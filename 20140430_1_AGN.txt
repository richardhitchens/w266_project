Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Lisa DeFrancesco, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Lori (00:33), and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Actavis first quarter 2014
earnings conference call.
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Actavis' earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014.
The press release, together with additional materials reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and forecasts,

are available on our website at www.actavis.com. We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will
also be available on our website after its conclusion.
With us on today's call are Paul Bisaro, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide an overview of the first quarter
business highlights. Todd Joyce, our Global Chief Financial Officer, will then provide additional details on the
performance of our business segments as well as our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Paul will then
conclude and then we'll open it up for questions and answers.
Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Siggi Olafsson, President of Actavis Pharma; Bob Stewart, President
of Global Operations; and David Buchen, our Chief Legal Officer.
Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Actavis and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's

projections or other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the
company.
It is important to note that such statements about estimated or anticipated Actavis results, prospects or other
non-historical facts are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of existing trends and
information as of today's date. Actavis disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements

depending on a number of factors affecting the Actavis business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to, the Actavis Plc. Form 10-K for the
period ended December 31, 2013.
As you may know, we announced a transaction with Forest Laboratories on February 18, 2014, and we ask that you see
the full details of this transaction, which are included in our registration statement filed with the SEC on March 25,
2014. Please also see the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements contained in our press release
which we issued this morning, which may qualify some of our comments today.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. We are pleased to report
another exceptionally strong quarter for Actavis, driven by strong organic growth across our global pharmaceutical
business, as well as the inclusion of the Warner Chilcott brand portfolio following last year's acquisition.
First quarter net revenues increased 40% to approximately $2.7 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share
increased 75% to $3.49 in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 86% to $860 million.
Our Actavis Pharma segment, which now includes all generic and branded pharmaceutical sales, had another strong
quarter. We saw a strong contribution from our generic version of Lidoderm, which continued to enjoy exclusivity, and
stronger than expected performance of our generic version of Cymbalta.
In our brand business, our performance reflects the addition of the Warner Chilcott portfolio, along with increased sales
of key promoted products, including Rapaflo and Generess Fe. We continue to strengthen our U.S. pipeline in the first
quarter, announcing patent challenges for Treanda, Multaq and Colcrys. We also received a favorable appeals court
ruling on Lialda and favorable district court ruling on Celebrex.
We also announced the patent challenge settlement with Noven regarding our first-to-file application for Daytrana and
we expect to launch a generic version of the product on September 1, 2015.
Finally, we announced that the district court ruled in our favor and upheld the validity of our patent on Lo Loestrin Fe.
In our North American brands business, we announced approval of metronidazole 1.3% for the treatment of vaginal
fungal infections. We expect to launch the product in the second half of this year.

We also announced a patent challenge settlement with Mylan on Generess Fe, where they are able to launch in April
2015 or later with an AG. Within our branded pipeline, we expect to commence Phase III studies for [ph] Cerecycline
(4:49) in the fourth quarter as planned.
Also, interaction with the FDA regarding the filing of our progestin patch has been positive. The agency has confirmed
the data required as part of the resubmission process, and we are well underway in preparing that data. As for Udenafil,
we expect to submit our NDA for Udenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction earlier than previously anticipated.
Internationally, we continue to enhance our commercial operations through strategic M&A, with the acquisition of
Silom Medical in Thailand, which was announced and closed on April 1. The acquisition helps deliver on our goal to
expand our presence in attractive emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and immediately elevates Actavis to a
top-five position in the fast-growing Thai generic pharmaceutical market, with leading positions in ophthalmic and
respiratory therapeutic categories and a strong cardiovascular franchise.
In addition, we completed the divestiture of our Western European generic pharmaceutical operations, or our INN
business, on April 1 to Aurobindo. We believe the transaction will allow the company to focus management time and
resources to support accelerated investment in driving faster growth in markets in Central and Eastern Europe and other
emerging regions throughout the world that enhance our ability to create long-term shareholder value.
Most importantly, we announced our planned acquisition of Forest Labs in February. The transaction, upon
consummation, is transformational, and will create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company poised for strong,
long-term organic growth.
We have been aggressively planning for the integration in order to execute immediately at close to ensure efficient
operation of the combined business and capture synergies. Finally, our Anda segment continues to post strong revenue
growth, driven by strong product performance.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Todd to take us through some financial updates.
Robert Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis. Consolidated net revenue for the
first quarter was $2.655 billion, an increase of 40% over the prior-year period, reflecting strong growth in both our
Actavis Pharma and Anda Distribution segments.
Net revenue in our Actavis Pharma segment was $2.265 billion, up 36% year over year due to the acquisition of
Warner Chilcott, new product launches and strong international performance. Within our Actavis Pharma segment,
North American brand revenues was $594 million, up from $130 million in the prior year due to the acquisition of
Warner Chilcott and increased sales of certain promoted legacy products, including Rapaflo and Generess Fe.
Within North American brands, net revenue for our women's health portfolio was $213 million, up from $20 million in
the prior year. Revenue from our urology and GI portfolio was $225 million, up from $57 million in the prior year. And
revenue from our dermatology and established brands portfolio was $156 million, up from $53 million in the first
quarter of 2013.
North American generic revenues was $1.024 billion for the quarter, up 7% from $957 million in the first quarter of
2013. This increase was driven by new product launches, including the generic versions of Lidoderm and Cymbalta,
partially offset by competition on our authorized generic version of Concerta.
Finally, international revenue, which consists of all revenue derived outside of North America, was $647 million
compared to $578 million in the first quarter of 2013. The current-year period includes $112 million of revenue from
our recently divested generic operations in seven European markets.

Actavis Pharma adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 65.3%, up from 52.7% in the prior-year period primarily due
to the addition of the Warner Chilcott portfolio. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue for Actavis
Pharma in the first quarter was 21%, down from 21.6% in the prior-year period.
Moving to Anda, net revenue from our distribution segment was $390.2 million, up 69% on higher unit sales. Anda
gross margin for the quarter was 15.1%, down from 15.8% in the first quarter of 2013 primarily due to product mix.
Anda SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter was 8.9%, down from 11.9% in the prior-year
period on significantly higher revenues.
GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $171.5 million compared to $132.1 million in the prior-year period, an
increase of 30%. R&D spending for generics, branded and biosimilars was $114 million, $33 million and $24 million
respectively.
GAAP SG&A for the quarter was $559 million compared to $413 million in the prior-year period. The increase is
primarily the result of the Warner Chilcott acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 16.4% in the
first quarter, down from 25.1% in the prior-year period.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization, acquisition-related and impairment charges as well as other items
detailed in table 4 of our earnings press release and detailed further in non-GAAP reconciliations available on our
website, earnings for the first quarter were $3.49 per diluted share, up 75% year-over-year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $860.2 million compared to $463.6 million in the prior year. Cash flow
from operations for the first quarter was $440 million and cash and marketable securities were $340 million at quarter
end.
Our pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end was 2.64 times. We're well-positioned from a balance
sheet perspective as we move toward the closing of our acquisition of Forest Labs, our acquisition financing plans are
on track and we expect to complete our permanent financing of the acquisition in late May or early June.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for a further discussion on the Forest transaction and some concluding
remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. Regarding Forest, our integration leadership group is aggressively planning for the combination of both
companies at close in a way that delivers immediate and long-term growth for the combined business, as well as an
efficient synergy capture.
Both management teams continue to focus on operating independently to ensure we meet all of our separate business
objectives established prior to the deal announcement. We are taking the necessary steps to close the transaction.
Appropriate antitrust filings have been made in the U.S. and several international jurisdictions.
We expect to file the final proxy related to the transaction shortly and a shareholder vote is expected in mid-June. All of
these activities support an expected close mid-year, as planned.
For the second quarter, on a 2014 standalone basis, we have made numerous assumptions consistent with our past
practice, the most significant being that we have included additional competition on our generic version of Lidoderm in
the second quarter. Based on this, we now expect GAAP second quarter 2014 earnings to be slightly lower than the first
quarter of 2014.
Regarding our forecast for the remainder of 2014, we plan to provide an updated combined financial forecast for the
year at or shortly following the close of the Forest acquisition.
I am very pleased with the performance of our business so far this year and with the efforts underway to plan for an
on-time close and the strong execution of our integration plans for Forest.

As always, I want to thank our employees for their extraordinary efforts and their unwavering commitment to our
company's success.
With that, let me turn it back to Lisa for questions. Lisa?
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Okay, Lori, I think we are ready to take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning. How are you?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Quick question, on the deal that Forest just announced, the Furiex deal, does that preclude you
from adding further IBS-D drugs from an FTC standpoint? And I just have a quick follow-up, go ahead.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Well, no, actually, Jami, I think as we looked at that transaction and, of course, pursuant
to the terms of the agreement with them, we had to give our consent to the transaction. So we did have a good view of
the Furiex transaction. We are obviously very pleased with it. We think it's a great addition to the GI portfolio for all of
the reasons that Forest discussed on their call on Monday and then again on Tuesday.
But I think we will have to review what the FTC's position might be with respect to other products. But for now I think
the franchise is very strong and I'm not sure we need anything at the moment to continue with the IBS-C franchise.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: And just as a follow-up, obviously the drug industry is going through a period of rapid breaking
itself up through asset sales and swaps, et cetera., which I would think would provide opportunities for Actavis. Can
you talk about what we are seeing in the industry in terms of just sort of these asset swaps and legacy businesses
becoming available, drug companies carving out their businesses? Is that an opportunity that would be appealing to the
new Actavis as we think about it going forward?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, it certainly is an exciting time. I mean, you probably need a scorecard to keep track of all
of the changes that are going on. And we have been very active, along with the Forest team, in evaluating all of the
transactions that are taking place at the moment. We are looking at how they affect the industry and how they affect the
new combined company.
Jami, I wouldn't preclude anything by way of what we are looking at and what we are not looking at. We will be
hopefully involved in the continuing modification in the industry. We certainly have the balance sheet and the
performance to be able to do that. And I think we are going to remain active in that space.
With respect to some of the legacy businesses, I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging on a combined basis
to participate with some of those legacy businesses, because the company now is certainly well poised for organic
growth and we want to make sure we continue to drive organic growth and some of those legacy businesses might
create a little bit of a challenge from a legacy perspective, or from a growth perspective.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Just a couple product-specific questions. So on Cymbalta, that's been a nice
near-term contributor. What are your thoughts on how that market will change and when do you expect that product to
be truly commoditized?
And then secondly, on Lidoderm, what's your latest market intel telling you on where Mylan is? And I realize you put
that competition in your guidance, but do you think that it's potentially conservative?
And then lastly on R&D, your strategy overall, the Furiex deal that Forest announced yesterday, is that a kind of
transaction that the combined organization post-closing would do? How should we think about that kind of transaction
in the context of the new Actavis? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, David. It's Siggi here. I think on generic Cymbalta, as Paul mentioned earlier, the
market has been better than we expected. [indiscernible] (17:16) December and throughout first quarter there have been
fewer players. There also has been some shortage in the market that has given the other company some opportunity to
take market share.
Our assumption is that there will be, in second quarter, probably two new competitors coming into generic Cymbalta,
probably closer to the end of the quarter. And then in third quarter we expect this to be a commodity generic product.
So I think second quarter still will be a good quarter going forward, also due to the market shortage, but in early third
quarter our expectation is this will be a commodity generic.
With regard to Lidoderm, again our expectation in the second quarter is competition. We just came back from the
NACDS, where we met with all our customers. So far we haven't heard anything about anyone coming out on
Lidoderm. That being said, time is moving on. So I think it's the right way to model it is to assume a new generic
competition on Lidoderm in the second quarter. But as of today we don't know of anyone or when they would be
coming to the market.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. Hi, David. I think the Furiex transaction fits perfectly the structure of the kind of
transactions we will be looking at going forward. It's an important addition to a very important therapeutic category for
us. And it also has long-term enduring value. It can drive growth in the years that we are looking at now in 2017, 2018
and 2019. And we have worldwide rights. And so those are the attributes that we are going to be looking for our brand
franchise and continuing to build out our brand franchise, but also the Silom Medical acquisition is something to
remember and that's also an important transaction for us. We will continue to drive growth and want to drive growth in
key emerging markets around the world so that when we do acquire worldwide rights to products like this or even as
well as having our generic portfolio, we have the commercial infrastructures in key markets and growth markets to be
able to drive growth and help support the growth drivers.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your next
question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Ken C. Cacciatore>: Hey, Paul, just wanted to kind of pick up on the theme here around Furiex. It seems to me
when I look at it that if you put into context, it's about a quarter of your annual cash flows, to your point, to get a
long-duration potential $1 billion asset, which I think the Street would be applauding even more than what we saw the
other day. So I was wondering how many of these are out there and how do you convince your shareholder base that if
you could do four or five of these tomorrow that this would be kind of money well spent to get this type of

long-duration asset on top of what is a very good near-term story? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, well, Ken, it's hard to know exactly how to convince investors of things. I think we have
all been a little surprised at the way the markets have reacted in the short term. But I also think it's a short-term
phenomenon. And when you think about assets like this I think I would assume for most investors, particularly the
long-term holders, that these kinds of assets are no-brainer kind of assets.
I also know, and I think post-close when we provide guidance for the combined entity, I think people will become more
comfortable with the growth profile of the combined company. That should reduce any concerns that people have, and
also make it clear that these kinds of assets are exactly where we should be spending our money.
And I think the other question you asked was, how many of these assets exist out there? Well, they're hard to find, I
will say. We have a very strong group of people looking at those assets. I think the Forest team is extraordinarily good
at finding these kinds of assets. And we are going to continue to use those combined groups to look for specific
products that fit that kind of profile.
<Q - Ken C. Cacciatore>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great, thanks, guys. Just two questions. Paul, can you just talk about the branded business
and what you're seeing, specifically with the GI business? And are you happy with it? And as you laid out your outlook
at the Analyst Day on January 31, is it fair to say that everything is tracking as you would expect? And then I have a
follow-up.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. With respect to the branded business, and I will focus principally on the standalone
Actavis brand franchise, I think we have achieved our objectives with the Warner Chilcott portfolio. We have arrested
some of the declines. We knew that there would be some upset with the integration, particularly the major change that
went on through the integration.
I think we have arrested the declines of the key products. And we knew we were going to face some headwinds with
respect to the GI franchise from the legacy Warner Chilcott portfolio. But we think we can now drive forward with
some of the good products. Siggi, did you want to add ...?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, I think, Randall, whilst we said on January 31, on our Investor Day, we expected
that our Asacol, Delzicol would decline year-on-year, we said about 18% in our slide.
I think overall, we saw that beginning of 2014, that the loss of the CVS Caremark agreement, which we knew about
from middle of the year, that came into force 1st of January. We clearly saw that in the first week afterwards. But also,
we are very happy with the [ph] NRx's and TRx's (23:18) in the last four weeks to five weeks of the quarter.
So I think we are on the right track. The new sales force came in place in first quarter, it took time to get them trained
and on the road. But overall, I think the last four weeks of the quarter and for April, we are very pleased with the
stabilization and the small growth of the business, and we hope to continue with that going forward. But there were no
surprises overall in the GI business.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Got it. So tracking as expected. Paul, on Celebrex, can you just talk about that, and if you
and Mylan are successful in knocking out Teva's exclusivity, which is a little bit of a surprise to I think a lot of us,
when would you launch, what would the competitive dynamics look like?
And then I guess, just how this could play out. Obviously, you have a settlement in place, but there is a little bit of
uncertainty as to timing and the competitive makeup. Thanks.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, obviously with the litigation, it's always unpredictable. We were a little surprised with
the FDA's position on this product, I would say. Certainly Mylan, obviously, was as well. They're going to pursue their
litigation and we'll pursue ours. I'm not sure whether they'll be combined or not. We'll have to wait and see what the
procedural platform turns out to be.
With respect to launch readiness, we're preparing now and we will be ready to go at the earliest possible time. Our
settlement does not preclude us from launching if someone else launches. So we are preparing to be ready at the earliest
possible moment, but no later than December.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao of Barclays.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, good morning.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: First, in terms of the guidance for Lidoderm, just to clarify, you are expecting generic
competition to come in for the second quarter. But obviously that begins at what point? Is that as of today, or – just so
we can think through the added time of exclusivity that you may or may not enjoy.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. Let's say I think today is pretty safe, it won't be today. I would have heard that
already this morning. And I think, even to the end of the week, we are pretty okay. I think what we say in second
quarter, we don't know exactly when. I think to clarify it even further that we built in two competitors, both the AG and
another competitor. So I think it might be conservative, but let's say middle of the quarter is not unreasonable, to put
that into the guidance.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, fantastic. And then, Paul, obviously, with Fred Wilkinson leaving the company, you
had a little bit of a shift in terms of responsibility, with Bob taking on R&D, his part of operation. Do you anticipate a
further realignment once the Forest acquisition is completed and that expanded R&D capability and branded portfolio
becomes part of your business?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, the short answer is, we would anticipate having a number of changes with the close of the
acquisition with Forest. They've got a very strong team. We're combining two very strong teams, and we want to make
sure we do it in the best possible way.
Brent and I continue to have discussions about how best to structure the organization. The integration teams are
working aggressively to look and do the baselining and preparing for day one operations, as well as giving us a sense
for what the two organizations have, where their strengths are. And of course, we can't start integration, but we are
aggressively working on those plans.
I don't want to say we have fully decided what the structure will be, although we do anticipate making some final
decisions within the next month or so. And of course, we will not only be communicating them internally, they would
certainly be communicated externally as well.
For today, Bob has taken over the R&D operation. He wasn't busy enough with just the operations, so we wanted to
make sure he had a little bit more to do. He does have a very strong scientific background, as I'm sure you all know,
and we feel very comfortable with having the R&D report with the operations group.
There are certainly great synergies to achieve. And of course, the people who actually do the day-to-day running of the
operations are doing a fantastic job, Hafrun and Chuck and their teams are doing a great job, and they manage the
day-to-day operations. So, I'm very pleased with the way the organization is set up. We also, of course, wish Fred well.
He went on to one of our competitors, and it's always good to have a friend as a competitor.

Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra of Sterne Agee.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Thanks very much. Paul, I've got a broad, big-picture question for you. Obviously we're
seeing a lot of changes in the specialty pharma and generics landscape. Can you talk about your view on some of the
more recent transactions that [indiscernible] (28:37), things that companies are trying to do such as Valeant and
Allergan, what you think – how that affects your industry and your position, as Jami alluded to earlier?
And then also, I know you've just done a big deal with Forest. Can you talk about whether Actavis is still in the
position to consider transformative deals or whether we should be thinking more along the Furiex sort of lines in terms
of further acquisitions? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks, Shibani. Well, with respect to the most recent activity with Valeant and then also with
I would say Pfizer and AstraZeneca, I'm not surprised that there's a lot of activity going on. I think everyone expected it
to begin. We got moving a little bit earlier than everyone else, but I'm not very surprised to see the activity pick up.
There is certainly good reason for that activity to pick up – consolidation of customers, consolidation and price
pressures throughout the industry, whether it's branded or generic, have caused everyone to reevaluate their business
models and try to find the right business model for the long-term growth profiles that we all want to have for our
shareholders.
The only other thing I would say with respect to the Valeant and Allergan transaction, I think it's a very unique
situation. I think we're all watching it very closely to see how it plays out. This could be a precedent-setting transaction,
not just for the pharmaceutical space but for other spaces as well. If the activist shareholder movement moves in that
direction, that does change the landscape a bit.
I think the other question is you had first was about us and doing transformative deals. I have to say, I think we feel
pretty transformed already. I think the Forest transaction has created really a fantastic platform for us to grow from. I
think we have the luxury of looking at a lot of different kinds of deals but not the necessity to do any of them. So we
will continue to evaluate things as they come up and hopefully make the best decision possible. And sometimes the best
decision might be to stand on the sidelines. But we will be ready to move if we think it's important.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. Just to clarify, so are you in a position where you would still consider something big
or are you preferring at this stage to look at the small-size transactions?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I would say now at least until mid-year we're on the sidelines. But I don't think we are in
the position – I think today we're looking at sort of the smaller transactions, but -we're keeping an eye on everything
else.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay, great, thank you.

<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning, Paul, two things. First, can you give us more color on the overseas key regions
for you? And then second on M&A, you bought something small in Thailand. What are some of the other geographies
that we should be keeping on our watch list for next as far as these niche acquisitions?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Well, the key regions continue to be areas like Southeast Asia, where you have 600
million people, fast growing pharmaceutical use, good profile. We have a lot of assets in the region. We can deploy
those assets very well. We just opened our regional sales office in Singapore. That will help us even further look for
smallish opportunities like the one we just did in Thailand. I would expect that you would continue to see as work there
aggressively.
The other area that we've made no bones about that we want to get bigger in is in South America. Both Actavis and
Forest have a very well developed R&D portfolio, in Brazil particularly. And our commercial infrastructure probably
could use some beefing up in that region. So we'll continue to look very aggressively there, Mexico as well, and of
course all of South America.
With respect to Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, I think we still see that as a very attractive space. Our Russian
market is performing very well. We're very pleased with its performance to date. Even with the unrest in the region, it
has continued to perform well. We did suffer a little bit in the Ukraine, but that's not too surprising. It's a smallish
market, so it wasn't a major impact. But certainly Russia has done well and we will continue to look for assets there.

Your next question comes from the line of David Buck of Buckingham Research.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of quick ones. First on the North American
generics, Paul and/or Siggi, can you talk a little bit about the impact that you have seen from the trade consolidation
thus far, what generic pricing has been and where you are on your own generic Concerta approval?
And then for Paul, can you talk about, post-Forest, where you see the role of R&D and the importance of that to
organic growth? And also can you talk a little bit about how we're going to be able to keep track of the various different
synergy captures, including legacy Actavis, Warner Chilcott, Aptalis, Forest, etcetera, how we're going to be able to
track that progress? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: David, if I start on the North American trade consolidation, clearly there has been a
significant consolidation of our customers. We obviously Walgreens, Alliance Boots and ABC, our top customers for
sure, we understand that pretty well, we have agreements in place for 2013. We have a very good relationship with
them. And overall we have managed with our extensive portfolio to build a win-win relationship. We have grown in
market share outside of the U.S. and we have managed I think that extremely well.
The next one up is CVS and [indiscernible] (34:48). We work very closely with both companies and will continue to do
that going forward. We expect that to start to impact mid-year, that relationship. And then obviously the last one is
McKesson and Rite Aid. They are partly tendering out the portfolio at this point in time. We don't know the outcome.
We have modeled it I think right for second quarter.
But overall we think the consolidation probably net-net impacts the price downwards for sure in this tendering of the
portfolio. But overall on a global scale we, especially with Walgreens and Alliance Boots, we can see a positive
win-win situation where, because of the size of Actavis today and our presence in markets where Alliance Boots is very
strong today, including U.K., Norway and Russia, plus Turkey.
With regard to the Concerta approval, as we said, it's moving along at the FDA. We feel comfortable that we will have
supply going into 2015. We work very closely with the FDA on this issue on our approval on the hope to move that
forward as soon as possible. It's very difficult to predict anything about when the FDA reacts, but we are still
comfortable that we will have a supplier of the product going into 2015.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, David, and I think you asked about the role of R&D. I think, as you know, and you have
known me for a long time, I think R&D is a very important aspect of our business. We look to it to drive organic
growth. And I think we have a very efficient generic program and we have a very good brand program which is being
further supplemented by the strong team at Forest.
So I would expect to continue to see us spending aggressively on the R&D side. We announced that we were $1
billion-plus in R&D; we expected to do $1 billion-plus in R&D in 2015.
I don't see us ever wavering from that commitment. If you think about what we talked about, and I just said it about
Brazil, you over-invest your R&D assets into a country so that when you do an acquisition in that country you have
built-in synergies going in. And that is just one of the strategies and one of the reasons to spend money on R&D, but it
is important to do it well. And I think we've proven that we can do it as well as anybody.
With respect to the capture of the synergies, I think on the Actavis side I can say that we have basically completed the
capture of legacy Actavis synergies, and I think we're almost complete, if not fully complete, on the Warner Chilcott
synergy side. So for us it will just be a going-forward number. But we also have spent some time making sure that we
don't double count the Aptalis and the Rejuvenate synergies as we move into the combined entity.
So we will do our best to make sure that we are not double counting things and making it clear that we are capturing
synergies. But I guess the easiest thing to look at is the margins, and if you see margins continuing to improve and you
see our SG&A numbers continuing to stay where they are, then you can bet we're doing the right job.

Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Good morning, everyone. Sorry about that. So I missed part of the call, I apologize if my
question or follow-up question have been asked. But first on Concerta, there was a recent FDA warning that certain
generic Concertas are not therapeutically equivalent to the brand, similar to what happened with Wellbutrin. Could you
just comment on that, including whether the problem drug is now [indiscernible] (38:37) or both? And what is the
opportunity for your authorized generic to benefit?
And then my separate question is with respect to generic launch timing, could you comment on Exalgo, and also on – I
think you said something about Pulmicort, but whether we should assume that in 2015 or how we should think about
Pulmicort? Thank you.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Thank you, David. I think with regard to Concerta, yes, there has been highlighted, if
you look at the FDA website, they are investigating the efficacy of the generic product. Clearly this doesn't affect our
generic Concerta; we are the authorized generic of Johnson & Johnson.
There has been some market movement, we have seen that already, both Actavis and [ph] Costco (39:38) have taken a
little bit more share over the past few weeks. But overall we don't know the extent or impact of who was involved in
the investigation. But overall, it's been a stable market there. There's been a little bit of TRx movements with [ph]
Costco (39:56) and Actavis taking more share.
With regards to the generic Exalgo, again it's very difficult to predict when the FDA will give us approval. It's moving
forward. The brand now has a new label in place, which opens up the door for us to have a label. I think that was the
first hurdle that we had to overcome. The brand bought the new label about two weeks or three weeks ago. So that
hopefully is out of the way.
And the last issue with that approval is a possible REMS program that we are discussing with the FDA. That being
said, I sincerely hope we get approval in the second quarter. We are ready to launch whenever we get the approval. We
don't think there's any technical hurdles, label being in place now.

We feel that the REMS program should be a non-issue going forward. But it's difficult to accurately put down when we
get the approval, but overall we feel comfortable. On generic Pulmicort, I think overall your guess is as good as mine.
We are waiting for the courts to move on that. Obviously, we feel good about the product itself. I think launch this year
is highly unlikely. But there is a chance, there is a chance to go this year, but we really hope that at least in 2015 we
will have a product to sell.

Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Two questions, please. Firstly, can you comment on the status of your generic
Restasis application and when you expect to have clarity on the potential acceptance of this application by the FDA?
And then secondly, just going back to the theme of business development and capital allocation, Paul, you mentioned
your appetite for opportunistic continued business development. Can you comment on your openness to a share
buyback, if you do choose to stand on the sidelines, as you mentioned a few minutes ago?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think on generic Restasis, we have said that we don't have [ph] a set time for (42:13)
filing from the FDA. We have responded to clarifying questions from the FDA. We feel our application should be
accepted for file. But at this point in time, we don't know the timing. There is nothing outstanding on us. We have sent
in clarifying responses to the questions from the FDA.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: With respect to capital allocation, I think one of the things we probably should have said
coming out of the blocks is that one of the most important things we can do is pay down our debt. We want to make
sure that we maintain the right flexibility with the balance sheet. And we will be, of course, doing that. I think we have
highlighted that we intend to take out the old Warner Chilcott notes in September of this year. So that is still on track to
be done. But in addition to doing debt paydown, we will continue to look for acquisition opportunities in the new
organization around the way we have discussed.
And then finally, we have said the combined organization is going to be generating – we expect it to be generating a
significant amount of free cash flow. We've talked about $4 billion-plus in 2015. And you could certainly see a
situation where we wouldn't be able to allocate all of that capital to the other two options, at which time we would then
think about what made sense, whether a share buyback or a dividend makes sense. And we are open to considering
both. But at the moment, our first priority is to pay down debt and second priority remains allocating capital to support
the growth of the business.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, David. Todd, why don't you take the second part of that question?
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: Yeah. In terms of the first quarter, the breakdown between generic, brand and biosimilar
was $114 million, $33 million and $25 million. And we have given guidance for the full year, and that was roughly in
line with that guidance.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Right.
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: In terms of the breakdown.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Hi, David. It's Bob. Just to weigh in on the biosimilar program. The FSH program is going
according to plan. We have started Phase III in Europe, with 20 sites now up and running. The relationship with Amgen
has gone extremely well. Phase III has started both with Avastin as well as Herceptin. And the other programs are
moving along on the timelines that we had previously expected. So overall, it's going exactly according to plan.

Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur of Needham.
<Q - Elliot H. Wilbur>: Thanks. Good morning. Paul, just wanted to ask you a quick question on the Progestin-only
contraceptive patch. I think you provided a bit of an update a little bit earlier, but maybe just a little bit more detail in
terms of what the gating factors there are in terms of moving that forward and whether or not you think, at this point,
based on what you know, that we could see a launch closer to year-end, or more likely next year?
And also, thinking about the commercial potential of the product, I guess it's surprising that, after all the issues that
Ortho Evra had, still roughly $150 million product. And I know this is not a combination patch, but I'm not really sure
how relevant that is, in terms of thinking about the market opportunity. And just the quick question is, should we be
potentially benchmarking this product against Ortho Evra, or do you think it's just going to have a much more limited
commercial potential, given a more limited targeted patient population? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: So, Elliot, it's Bob again. Just on the discussion on what is required yet for approval, we got
clarity from FDA, exactly what they were expecting. It's a small study that we needed to do to fill equivalence between
a different patch size. And we have started accumulating that data and are planning on submitting that information to
the agency later this year. We would expect approval on that product in 2016, or at least that's what we're anticipating –
2015. 2015, I'm sorry.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, I think, Elliot, on the commercial opportunity for this product, clearly this is an
opportunity for Progestin, is to have the timing is right, because, if you take a Progestin as a contraceptive, timing is
everything, to have it safe and effective. When you have a patch, the timing is less critical, for sure. So this is the
opportunity with the patch. On top of that, it doesn't include any estrogen, so there are many women that don't tolerate
the estrogen.
I think at this point in time, it's difficult to say how you should model it. My guess, it's a little bit more limited than
Ortho Evra as a product at this point in time. We need to see, we need to make the market. The efficacy is there, we
know that. The patch is a great development by the product. When we launch in 2015, there will be a ramp-up over the
year. But I can't guide you exactly how you should model it, or based on which product, because in a way it's a new
product to the market.

<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just two quick product questions, the first one
on Precedex. Any expectations on when we will hear about the carveout? And were you sued by Hospira on the
product? On the [ph] Alda (48:20), can you just clarify, you've told us before you're pretty sure that you have got an
approvable product. Have you done a new validation batch? We are hearing back and forth from Shire, and if you could
just clarify that situation.
And last, Paul, a bigger-picture question. You are often being put in the same camp as Valeant, as two companies who
are growing primarily by acquisition. It would be really useful if you could distinguish for us, how do you see your
business model going forward different from the Valeant business model?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay, do you want to take the [ph] Alda (48:54) ...
<A - David A. Buchen>: So we were sued on Precedex, I'll just give you a quick update. We just got sued earlier this
month. I think it was April 18 when the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, one patent in suit. So it's very, very early stages
of the litigation.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Okay.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think on the [ph] Alda (49:12), we got the question back from the FDA. As I've
outlined before, the issue has been that the overall guidance came out after the filing of the ANDA. Where we
differentiated was on the dissolution, on the dissolution methods and how we calculated the dissolution. We got the
questions back from the FDA.
I think we have done all of the technical work necessary to receive approval. We don't think this issue should hinder the
approval of the product. We have submitted that few months ago back to the FDA. So I think we are working closely
with the FDA to gain approval of this product. I'll say it again, I don't think the technical issue of dissolution method
that was mentioned in the guidance document, I think we have addressed that appropriately with the FDA.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And do you have a response date for this file, do you expect a response in 2014?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: No, we have responded, so everything is with the FDA, so we have fully responded to
the FDA on these questions.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: I think the FDA now gives you a response date. Do you know when the FDA is going to respond to
your filing or is this still up in the air?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: It's still up in the air. They haven't confirmed or give us any date when we hear back
from them.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great, thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And then, Ronny, with respect to your question about Valeant and perhaps distinguishing
ourselves, let me first start by saying I think Valeant has built a very formidable company. They have done
extraordinarily well for their shareholders and they continue to be creative in the way they approach not just
acquisitions but their business model as well.
You know, I think we've also been very clear about how and what builds our business. We've talked about the four
pillars and I think that's probably the best way to try to distinguish ourselves from any company, not just Valeant. I
think, remember, our first pillar here is executing on the assets that we have, making sure we maximize those in every
country, whether it's brand or generic, and that execution is incredibly important with respect to the sales and marketing
of those products.
Second pillar we have is our organic growth. We've aggressively spent on generic R&D, on branded R&D and also
biosimilar R&D. We believe in the long-term future of the company is built fundamentally on organic growth and that
everything else is a supplement to that. And then the third pillar of course is commercial or – I'm sorry – operational
excellence, really. If you don't have high quality in our industry, you see exactly what happens.

Your company gets hurt, you can't provide products, you get into trouble with the regulators and you're in a downward
spiral that is very challenging to get out of. And we do know that if we do those three things very well, we will generate
sufficient capital to be able to reinvest in our business, and that's what we use the fourth pillar of and that's reinvesting
through acquisition.
So we're really focused every day on the top three, the first three things. And the fourth one comes as – it probably gets
more of the news than anything else of course but it is ancillary and supplemental to the other three.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just had two here. I guess one is on coming back to the
business development and the wide range of assets the combined company can pursue. Can you just – coming back to
this organic growth element – can you just talk about how you kind of balance that desire to work on this longer-term
organic growth kind of opportunity that you are highlighting relative to what might be some very attractive financial
returns if you're looking at potentially lower-growth assets that seem to be available in the market?
I'm just trying to understand how you kind of – I know you want to focus on the organic growth, but if you can get a
really nice return on lower-growth assets, how you balance those two. The second was on repo. Can you sort of
elaborate a little bit more about that prioritization of repo versus debt paydown given what seems to be a very attractive
stock price here? I guess my question is why isn't repo higher in the priority of use of cash just given where the stock is
trading? Thanks very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think with respect to the capital allocation question, long-term – with respect to assets –
so long-term versus shorter-term higher financial returns.
I mean I'm not certainly suggesting we wouldn't consider short-term high-value assets. I think we're in a unique
situation today. If you start building out the combined entity's portfolio of products, that's on the brand side, if you look
at the number of products that are being launched over the next several years, including this year, and if you look at the
generic portfolio and you look at the size of the pending applications, not just in the U.S. but across the world, and you
look at the number of dates certain launches that we've been able to I guess accumulate, if you want to put it that way,
we're starting to build a very clear growth profile and have built a strong growth profile for the rest of 2014, 2015 and
2016. And I think, as we have talked about, we're starting to consider assets that have now growth profiles 2017, 2018
and 2019.
And when we start providing guidance to our investors, I think they'll see that we feel very comfortable with the growth
profile in the short term and that the long term is where we're kind of looking at. And it doesn't mean we wouldn't look
at short-term assets that generate returns, because that would be a silly thing to not look at.
With respect to repurchase versus the debt paydown, from a prioritization basis I don't think in the short term we are
looking at a share buyback, even though I would personally agree with you that I think the share price is at a very
attractive point.
I also know that when we provide guidance I think people will feel and start to understand where the right number
should be for the company's stock and maybe we'll wait and see what happens after that before we consider whether a
repurchase program is appropriate.
For now I think we want to get through the close, we want to get our debt structure in place and we want to make sure
we continue to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. And a repurchase program will be certainly on
the agenda to discuss, but I don't see it as a high priority, at least for 2014.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni of Bank of America.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of product-specific ones. First
one is could you remind us as to when you are expecting competition on Estrace? And the second one is could you
characterize your interest level in participating in the generic Copaxone market, given that Synthon has a partnerable
asset and we know you know that company in a different setting?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, I think with regard to generic Estrace we don't know of any filers. We obviously,
prior to the Warner Chilcott acquisition, we looked very closely at that product. It's extremely difficult to develop a
generic Estrace, but at this point in time we don't know of a generic competitor coming to the market.
That being said, there is not many patents left on this product, so we don't necessarily know that. But overall there has
been no indication of generic competition so far.
With regards to generic Copaxone, I think we need to see how the market is. We obviously – we worked very closely
with Synthon on the generic of the Herceptin biosimilars where we acquired assets.
We think they are a very strong company for sure, they have built up a good business and they are close partners, not
only on Herceptin, but we also have in license from them a few products, especially in our international markets.
Overall, we are looking at the market, we are looking at the movement from 20 milligram to 40 milligram to evaluate
what is the opportunity for generics coming to the market. But at this point in time we don't have a generic Copaxone in
our focus going forward.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: Thanks very much for taking the questions. Maybe you can just talk a little bit, as you
look at the portfolio you're going to have in a couple of months, and I'm thinking particularly on the brand side, what
do you think are the imperatives for where you invest to continue the growth across this portfolio both in terms of sales
force promotion and marketing spending more broadly, where are the best returns and how do you optimize spending
maybe relative to what Forest or the industry has done in the past?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, let me start with a high level and then I'll hand it over to Siggi. I think that is a very key
question for the combined organization is to prioritize the sales and marketing spending, allocating it between
marketing spend and field force spend.
I think the combined entity has a very strong and would have an extremely large sales force. We, of course, will be
looking at making sure we have the optimum sales force size and then we will then look to allocate appropriate dollars
to the marketing side.
We know that Forest has started with the Linzess direct-to-consumer campaign; it appears to be doing quite well. It's
hard to tell in the short-term, of course, but certainly all the near-term indications are positive. But anyway, I think
that's a very high priority. Siggi, do you want to add a little bit more?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, I think in a way this is a luxury problem we have because we have I think in the
specialty space we have the strongest pipeline there is. If you look at the combined pipeline from Phase 2, Phase 3 and
then registration, we have 27 new products on top of the newly launched next line that Forest has on top of what we
have from Warner Chilcott on the legacy Actavis.

I think as Paul mentioned, clearly GI will be a key therapeutic area. Linzess is growing extremely well. The response of
the DTC is coming in. We see that as a key product. The [indiscernible] (59:25) is important, it's important for the
combined company going forward. We are very encouraged by the [indiscernible] (59:33) numbers as of today.
We think Forest is executing on the [indiscernible] (59:36) extremely well. They worked with managed care, they have
done this extremely well and now I think we need to continue the investment in the CNS.
And then there's opportunity also in women's health going forward. We are a leader, we have over 90 per share of voice
in OCs, we have an E4 coming to the market down the line. So I think these are the three key therapeutic areas that we
have. But we have this luxury problem of having a great portfolio that's early in its patent life with 27 products in
late-stage pipeline to come to the market.
So I think we hope to explain that further to you when we close the transaction how we are going to invest and execute
on it going forward.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: And how should we think about launch expenses as you may have a number throughout
2015 in terms of the upfront spending to get some of these new products out?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think we have a fixed cost in the sales force. We are working very hard how we design
our sales force. We have probably – the combined company has one of the best sales force in the industry.
I think when you see how they have performed over the last six months to 12 months, even further, they have done an
excellent job in execution. So we need to get the right size of the sales force to support the launches going forward.
So I can't I think comment on the market spend or things like that for the launches. That will be different between
different products and different categories. But you are asking the key questions we are designing around now, how
will for the next two years to three years with all this pipeline coming to the market, with the early stage of the product
that's already being launched, how can we best get the best return on our sales and marketing dollars going forward.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: Thanks very much.
