Third quarter sales declined modestly to $6.3 billion with underlying sales decreasing 1%. While this macro-economic
condition continued through the quarter with cautious levels of business investment globally. Sales growth was also
affected by difficult comparisons from the Thailand flooding recovery in the prior year. Emerging markets grew 2%
which was more than offset by mature market weakness.
We announced this morning that an agreement has been signed to sell a 51% stake in the embedded computing and
power business to Platinum Equity. The transaction immediately monetizes the business and shifts focus to our core
businesses. Transaction proceeds of approximately $300 million and repatriated cash will be deployed for incremental
share repurchase of $600 million.
Charges related to the business were recognized in the quarter totaling $0.70 of EPS. Excluding these charges earnings
per share were $0.97. Strong cash generation continued with free cash flow up 20%.
Moving to Slide 3: P&L Summary. Having mentioned the slow macro-economic environment limited growth, gross
profit margin was flat as cost containment offset unfavorable product mix and volume deleverage. Operating profit
margin declined due to higher stock compensation and pension expense as well as abnormally high leverage in the prior
year from the flooding recovery.
A goodwill impairment was recognized in embedded computing and power business and other deductions increased
$37 million nonrecurring dumping duty gained in the prior year. EBIT decreased sharply due to these items leading to
reported earnings per share $0.27 and $0.97 excluding the goodwill impairment of $0.65 and income tax charges of
$0.05 related to earnings repatriation.
Moving to Slide 4: Underlying Sales by Geography. By geography, underlying sales have decreased in the U.S. by 3%,
in Europe by 6%, and in Asia by 3%, including a 4% reduction in China. Sales grew in Latin America by 8%, in
Canada by 4%, and in Middle East and Africa by 18%. Total underlying sales declined 1%. Divestitures and currency
deducted 1% to a reported sales decline of 2%. Excluding the embedded computing and power business, Q1 sales were
essentially flat with modest growth in China.
Next slide: cash flow and balance sheet. Cash generation was robust with operating cash flow up 17% and free cash
flow up 20%, which represents conversion from earnings of 121%. Working capital as a percent of sales increased from
prior year due to higher receivables, but improved sequentially by 120 basis points.
Moving to Slide 6: Business Segment Detail. Business segment margin declined 130 basis points due to flooding
recovery and dumping duties in the prior year as well as higher pension expense. The increase in corporate expense is
due to the previously mentioned impairment and higher stock compensation expense. And tax rate reflects one-time
income tax expense to repatriate [indiscernible] (5:15) from the embedded computing and power business. Excluding
this impact the tax rate would have been 29%.
Next slide: Process Management. Process Management sales grew 3% with an approximately 7% – point impact from
the Thailand flooding recovery in the prior year. By region North America declined 4%, Asia grew 8%, Europe was
flat, Latin America grew 17%, and Middle East and Africa grew 24%.
Oil and gas, power, and chemical end markets continue to grow. Underlying orders were up 8%, led by double-digit
growth in systems and solutions, improvement in North America, and 13% growth in China. Segment margin declined
160 basis points, which was also affected by flooding recovery comparisons. Global project activity remains robust,
supporting solid growth momentum into next year.
Moving to Slide 8: Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation sales decreased 7% with North America down 5%,
Asia flat, Europe down 13%, Latin America down 4%, and Middle East and Africa down 2%. Industrial goods end
markets remained weak globally, especially in Europe. Weakness was most pronounced in the power generating
alternators business with channel inventory destocking beginning to slow, and orders are expected to turn positive soon.

Excluding $37 million in dumping duties received in the prior year, margin remained unchanged as cost containment
offset volume deleverage. Demand for industrial goods appears to be stabilizing but is expected to remain slow in the
near-term, particularly in Europe.
Next slide: Network Power. Network Power sales declined 5% with North America down 2%, Asia down 13%, Europe
down 4%, Latin America up 6%, and Middle East and Africa up 19%. Slow demand continued in global information
technology and telecommunications end markets.
The Network Power systems business declined slightly as growth in data center infrastructure was offset by
telecommunications weakness. The embedded computing and power business declined at a double-digit rate. Segment
margin contracted 220 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable price. End markets appear to
be improving, but difficult comparisons from prior year's NBN project in Australia will limit near-term growth.
Next slide: Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies sales decreased 2% with North America down 4%, Asia down
2%, Europe down 5%, Latin America up 3%, and Middle East and Africa up 21%. The U.S. air conditioning business
declined modestly as the residential markets paused due to mild weather and inventory destocking. Asia sales declined
as China decreased after a double-digit growth in the previous quarter. Europe market conditions remain weak.
The global refrigeration business improved, helped by recovery in the transportation business. Segment margin
expanded 80 basis points as cost containment offset unfavorable mix. Growth is expected to resume in the residential
and refrigeration businesses in the near-term.
Moving to Slide 11: Commercial & Residential Solutions. Commercial & Residential Solutions sales declined 2%,
reflecting a 6% adverse impact from divestitures. Underlying sales grew 4%, with North America up 6%, Asia up 3%,
Europe down 4%, Latin America down 1% and Middle East and Africa down 11%. Residential investment in North
America continues to grow, more than offsetting slower commercial demand. Segment margin remained unchanged
from the prior year. We expect growth to continue with solid residential and improving non-residential demand in the
U.S. as well as stabilization in Europe.
Moving to Slide 12. Consistent with previously communicated intentions, today we announced an agreement to divest a
51% stake in the embedded computing and power business to Platinum Equity. The terms allow us to immediately
monetize the asset and focus on our core businesses while also participating in upside from repositioning the business.
Emerson will receive approximately $300 million in cash and retain a 49% non-controlling interest. The transaction is
expected to close in the next three to six months.
The $300 million of transaction proceeds and approximately $300 million in repatriated embedded computing and
power earnings will be used for $600 million of additional share repurchase to offset EPS dilution. The businesses sales
and earnings will continue to be reported in Emerson's consolidated results until the transaction closes.
Next slide: Full-Year Outlook. The economic environment is beginning to stabilize and improve with orders growth
resuming in June after declines since February. We expect near-term business investment will remain cautious but
slowly improve. Specifically we anticipate energy in the residential markets to remain solid with slow but improving
demand for industrial goods in Information Technology and Telecommunications infrastructure.
Based on current conditions the revised 2013 outlook is as follows. Reported and underlying sales growth of
approximately 1%. EBIT and pre-tax margin approximately equal to prior year excluding the goodwill charge in each
year. Earnings per share excluding goodwill and tax charges trending toward the lower end of $3.48 to $3.55 or $2.78
to $2.85 excluding charges. Operating cash flow of approximately $3.4 billion and free cash flow of approximately
$2.7 billion.
And with that, I will turn it over to David Farr.

Thank you very much, Pat. Welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call. I also want to thank all the operating
executives out there for delivering what I would call very solid operating margins and some very strong cash flow and a
very difficult quarter from the standpoint of comparisons from last year, which we've referred to a couple times in the
press release since the Taiwan flood. We always knew this was going to be our most challenging quarter given how we
recovered last year.
On the negative side we dropped the quarter -- probably for the last four or five months we've seen weakening of the
global economies and that weakness really started coming through as we moved through this quarter. The good news,
though, if you look at where we sit right now, June orders were positive. The early indication right now, July orders are
also going to be positive. So it looks to us that things are starting to shape up with a little bit upward trend to finish the
year with a strong operating performance in Q4 to get through what I call a challenging fiscal 2013.
But overall it was a tough quarter. We have a lot of moving parts. Some of the businesses are doing well as you can see
coming up out of our electrical products group meeting. The big exception is clearly Network Power Systems, which
continues to see weaker sales coming from a weakening China, other parts of Asia Pacific, also very weak IT demand
both coming out of Europe and the United States. Companies have not really increased their spending at any significant
levels yet to see that marketplace pick back up.
We also had some very bad mix throughout the quarter. Different businesses, in particular China which is a
high-margin business for us is really weak. And our re-positioning and restructuring continues to take hold, and it's
starting to pay off. In fact, I just came back from Europe, and we saw our European businesses stabilize, and actually
started to see positive order growth in our Network Power Systems business. Very important the sign of all the
restructuring and the new management team we put in place, a good first sign that things are starting to turn.
Negative side also in this business was weak government spending. We have a government spending arm here, and that
business was down, obviously with the pull-back in the government spending.
Overall the business did not turn out like we thought it would at electrical products group. Clearly the margin for the
whole year will be weaker than we said before, though I'm starting to see – basically as you see in the orders, we're
starting to see the Network Power Systems business pick back up. And I feel good we'll be going out of this quarter,
fourth quarter, doing better. And then really going into a stronger 2014 as the economy continues to I think moderately
improve but not robustly.
Well relative to the other businesses, they're all operating pretty well – pretty much along the lines – we talked about
EPG. Process Management is seeing continued strong order growth with some very difficult comparisons last year.
Underlying sales and orders are up close to double-digit this quarter. When you take out the impact of the Thailand
flood, we're seeing good business coming around the world. And we're not really seeing any delays at this point in time.
And the technology investments continue to go forward.
The other good sign there is we're continuing to work on a lot of nice bolt-on acquisitions in this space, which will help
us again as we finish this year and going into next year.
On the Climate Technology it was a little bit more volatile than we normally would see. We had a very good quarter
last quarter. A little bit weaker this quarter. But net-net the orders have turned up. And what we're seeing coming out of
Europe, out of Asia, and the United States is the trend line is positive. And I would expect them setting up for a pretty
good fourth fiscal quarter and hopefully a strong first quarter going into the next fiscal year.
Industrial Automation clearly has continued to be impacted by one of our large customers out there continuing to do a
lot of inventory de-stocking. But overall again I'm starting to see a little bit more improvement there. And I feel better
as we come through this quarter and get into the fourth quarter and go into next year that we'll eventually turn to
positive growth.
Even when you look at the business, online business with the volume down, they were able to protect their profitability
once you exclude the impact of the one-time net pick-up we had last year from the Byrd Amendment call back.

So that business is doing reasonably well. North America business in Commercial & Residential as we've said, the
housing market's still strong. People are spending a little bit of money. And the business is still growing in that 4% or
5% range, which is very good.
Very positively over the last six months we've been working extremely hard on trying to come up with an appropriate
exit strategy for our computer and power business, which has had four extremely challenging years. It is good to get
this behind us. And moving forward we've got a solution that's right for the management team, right for the business,
and right for the company.
And I feel good about where we sit right now. We need to get the approvals from the governments around the world,
which should not be a problem. But that takes time. Most importantly as a management team, and the board, we want
to turn back the $600 million that we're getting out of this business, and turning back to our shareholders in a share
repurchase. And that's very, very important from the perspective of giving money back to our shareholders.
From the cash flow standpoint, we're going to have a very strong year. We had a very strong quarter, with almost $1
billion in operating cash flow, and what we see this year is pretty record levels of operating cash flow, over $3.4 billion
and hopefully $2.7 billion of free cash flow.
With a share repurchase of $850 million we already had planned, the $600 million is an incremental number to go back
to the shareholders so this year we'll be paying – obviously doing a lot more share repurchase in the next 12 months.
Acquisitions are very moderate this year. We're only going to be doing about $100 million. However, the pipeline and
the deals we're working on right now, I would expect that number to bump-up on bolt-on type of acquisitions to about
$1 billion level when we get into 2014. We do not, do not, have any large strategic acquisitions at this time on the table,
and we're working very diligent on the bolt-on acquisitions in our core space to strengthen our company.
Tough quarter, but certain things are starting to turn relative to orders. The cash, I think that you're going to see a
stronger operating execution here in the fourth quarter, and we're setting up for a solid fourth quarter with good
movement going into 2014.
It's good to get this one behind us. It's really good to get the agreement with the sale of the computer power system
business. And it'll be good to see a return to positive top line growth and solid order growth as we go forward during
the coming months. It's been a very difficult three or four years here with a very moderate growth environment which
has created a lot of pressure relative to the growth, but the business is in very good shape from a restructuring
standpoint, cash standpoint and the position of the business at this point in time.
So with that, I want to open the phone line up for questions, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today. And
again I want to thank the operating executives for working hard and delivering a good quarter in a very challenging
environment.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You'd mentioned in the release that you were encouraged
by the emerging market investments. You had 2% growth overall. Are you able to talk a little bit more detail in terms
of how these investments are paying off so far and what the GFI backdrop is in the emerging markets that you're
achieving that 2% growth in?
<A - David N. Farr>: From my – the reason we said we're encouraged by it is because we're seeing very good growth
in our Latin America business, we're seeing good growth in our Middle East business. The big issue that we've seen, in
Southeast Asia, the biggest issue we've seen so far this year is Australia which is not emerging market, but China and
from our perspective investments we make in these markets are continuing to grow.

The China one we'll obviously continue to see, evaluate how much more we're going to put in there, but I would say the
GFI going forward here for the next couple years in the emerging markets is most likely going to be in the 4% or 5%
range. It's not going to be all that strong, it will be better than you're seeing in the mature markets but still kind of weak.
But one or two quarters, we have things moving in and out based on what's on our large projects, but overall it was a
reasonable quarter except for what happened in China as China weakened significantly throughout the quarter. And
hopefully that will start turning around here in the coming months and quarters.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: And as a follow-up, are you still seeing the credit issues in China that I think you'd mentioned
last quarter?
<A - David N. Farr>: That scene has stabilized a little bit. I think there – they tightened up at the banks. I think that's
now starting to settle down. We've not – I look at our receivables, I look at our outstanding receivables, that's
improving. So overall I think that's okay at this point in time, we're just looking for where they're going to invest. And
we had a pretty good quarter excluding the embedded power and computing business in China, so overall I'm looking
for a good second half of this year on a calendar year basis as things start to stabilize a little bit there.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, Dave, and all, congrats on the deal with Platinum.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Steve. It's afternoon now unless you're someplace different than I am.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Yup. You know, you're right. I've been working on you since early this morning, it's all
blended. So the transaction details, just a little bit more clarity on the dilution of it or on the exit of that 49% over time,
I mean we've seen this IR and Tyco and others, they kind of get into these deals, they deconsolidate and promise to get
out and then they get diluted over time and we don't really see a lot happen over time. What are your expectations? I
mean how many years should we think about this? Is this a longer-term for the remaining stake? Or how are you
thinking about it?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're visioning as we talk to the Board about three or four years. We will get out of this
business, the way we are structured from the standpoint of book and the residual value. I think the intention that – of
Platinum and the management team is obviously to transform this business and clearly get their money back out, but it's
going to be, I would say, three to four years that we're looking at, at this point in time.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. And just maybe backing up a little bit, with all the news on Invensys – and
Schneider going after Invensys, I know – we know that obviously Emerson is a very strong competitor in these areas.
So my question is more about to what extent Schneider's reinvestment in the Invensys installed base sort of potentially
slows down share gains or impacts the industry more broadly over time? How do you – how are you thinking about that
one?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know from my perspective having Invensys go into the hands of Schneider is – I think it
will bring some stability to the marketplace, to be honest. I think that Invensys was not large enough to have a critical
mass, so I think it's having – another large global customer like we have with Honeywell, like we have with Siemens,
like we have with ABB or Yokogawa. I'm not worried about another one. I think – in fact I think it's a positive sign
from our perspective. From the installed base point, Schneider doesn't bring a lot of technology to its systems, but they
bring other things. So I think they're going to have to spend time – figure out how to integrate their type of system
technology with a control system technology, and that will take time.

So I think that, if I look at the opportunity for market share, it's still going to be out there, because you're going to have
customers wondering about Schneider, how long they've been in the Control market what space, are they going to be,
are they going to be the right guy you want to back with? So I'm not too worried about it at this point in time. I mean,
Schneider's a good competitor and we compete against them, I look forward to it, and it's not – I mean, it could have
been a lot worse scenario.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on and get back in line.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Steve.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, John. How are you doing today?
<Q - John G. Inch>: Doing well, doing well, enjoying the summer. There's been some, obviously, some false starts
before over the past three or four years. I mean, you've called it out. What just, just what gives you the conviction that
these markets – never mind turning up, but they're just – we're finally at long last at a bottom. I mean, you've done this
a long time. Why do you think now is sort of this inflection point versus simply a pausing before we step down again?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm not forecasting robust growth, let's put it that way. I'm forecasting – I mean, from my
perspective right now, I've seen the disinvestment – let's just take Europe for instance. Disinvestment for almost two
years in Europe, into the point now that businesses need to put some money back in. So if I look at what's going in
Europe, we've been going negative for almost two years, you're looking at a sort of slight positive. You're just going
from negative 3% to a plus 1% type of situation. I just feel that what we're seeing right now is, people need to – do
need to put the money back into play. You're seeing some of that same thing happen in the United States, and you're
going to start seeing that happen in other markets around the world. I think you've got the money going in Japan right
now, with the government trying to encourage business investment. And that's going to have, I think, a positive impact
throughout Asia Pacific.
So I mean, from my – my view right now, if I look at the world, and I look at where we are relative to the world in
GDP growth and GFI growth, I'm looking at basically a moderate growth next year. Maybe a slight tick higher, but not
much more than that. I just think right now, you – people are going to have to put the money to work here, invest in the
capital and reinvest in productivity. And I'm not expecting a sharp turn here, but I'm expecting a slight upward
momentum, and that's what I'm feeling right now. That's what I feel and that's how we're planning. So like, so what I
call moderate lift. But it's a tough market, as we've talked about. I think that this is going to go on for a couple more
years.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, that makes sense. Hey, what kind of projects – could you give a little more color on the
projects that you're seeing in process? I guess one of the themes of the quarter has been kind of a resurgence here in oil
and gas spending. Are you seeing that too, or just anything that might provide sort of your level of how this thing is
going to play out over the coming quarters?
<A - David N. Farr>: We are continuing to see a lot of oil and gas investments, per se. We're also seeing a lot of
investments in power in both Asia and also North America. Our power orders are pretty good this year and have
continued to strengthen. And it's a function of, people are having to figure out how to upgrade their power systems.
Maybe not putting new capacity in place, but how to upgrade their systems. So we're seeing a pretty good area relative
to power.
We're seeing good money relative to downstream work going on right now too, like the oil and gas Sasol investments
that we're seeing a lot in Louisiana, that type of investment. So we're seeing the large projects coming off the oil and
gas, we're seeing the oil and gas investments, and we're starting to see a return into some of the power investments.

So overall, I'm very pleased. Now, we're not seeing – I haven't seen a lot of what I call MRO which we had a lot of last
year, which I'm hoping from the capital standpoint that we'll see that pick back up here in the coming months. But that's
been the weakest part of this recovery in this year versus what we saw last year. But the projects are pretty broad and
they're pretty global, and the pipeline is about as big as it's ever been.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And large projects are picking up as well. Is that what you just said?
<A - David N. Farr>: Right. Correct.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. And just one last one. Eaton called out, I think, large data center improvement for the
Network Power businesses in the second half or starting in the second half. I think you talked a little bit more
constructively on the systems side. Are you seeing that as well? Is there is something about their mix that makes them
perhaps a little bit different? I know they've got a couple new products. I don't know, maybe there's some channel fill or
something?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't think – I think what they're seeing is the same thing we're seeing. We're seeing a lot of
quoting going on right now. There's some large projects that have been pent – held back for quite some time, and we're
seeing that quoting activity happening right now. Same thing.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Dave, just wondering what the restructuring is for the year now, and for next year?
Because it sounds like you're talking about maybe 2% to 4% organic next year, if I'm reading properly. So wondering
how you view the margin opportunity in these contexts.
<A - David N. Farr>: We're looking at probably $85 million restructuring this year, and I would say we're going to be
looking at about the same level next year, too. $85 million, $90 million, $95 million right around that range. We're
starting that real process. From my perspective, what the biggest issue I think – I was just talking to John about it – was
getting – if I can get Europe to actually turn from going negative to positive, the restructuring that we've been making
in Europe will be a very positive from the standpoint of getting that margin to pop back up in Europe, which is – what
you need that growth to make happen there. So at this point in time, I think that moderate growth, about the same
restructuring we should do reasonably well next year.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Got it. Thanks. And then just looks like a pretty heavy CapEx pick-up in the fourth quarter.
Is that just timing?
<A - David N. Farr>: Timing.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: Timing and typically right now I would say, $700 million is the number. I bet you we'll be
closer to last year's number. But like I said, I can't call that plus or minus $20 million in capital. But I would say right
now, probably we won't probably hit $700 million. I would say that operating cash flow will hit $3.4 million, but we'll
only hit $7 million. Just won't get done.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Hello, David, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeff. Long time no see.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah, absolutely. Hope you're doing well.
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm Alive.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good. Keep on keeping on. Just back on process, you also called out water. The strength in
power and water that you're citing actually is very different from things like the [indiscernible] (31:09 – 31:11) flow
underwater businesses and the power guys struggling. You said on power there's a lot of retrofit. Is it – or upgrades? Is
it coal or mute or something still out there? And what is it in water that you're actually seeing?
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. On the power side we're seeing mostly gas right now. We're seeing gas cast – gas systems
being upgraded. A lot of conversion going on there. Not much going on in coal at this point in time. No one's touching
that coal. It's pretty tight, but they're actually going in and doing power additions for gas, and that's been going on, and
that continues to go on. We've also seen a lot of investments going on in security. There's a lot of new regulations, and
relative to the security of your power plan, and we have very strong security capabilities and systems capabilities which
we've been going and upgrading so they can meet the code, which has been a positive thing for us.
As you know, when we bought the Westinghouse power business, we actually picked up a water business. We picked
up a water business relative to the system to go into the wastewater systems, new water systems. We also picked up a
system out of our Bristol acquisition, too which works – now we put that together. So we – there have been investments
on upgrade in the wastewater systems. A lot of laws coming out of the EPA, and so we've been getting good what I call
medium-small size projects throughout the United States, and throughout the world relative to water, water projects. So
we've seen a little bit of a pickup there, too. But we don't really talk much about it, because it's not the biggest driver of
our control systems in that PWS, but we've seen a pretty good recovery here along with the power.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, great. And just on Climate, the [indiscernible] (32:56) does sound a little bit better. I'm
wondering if you could just address the competitive landscape, and how you feel about where you're at with kind of the
variable speed compressor product line and roll-out? And in particular I just kind of had my eyes on the Japanese,
wondering if you're seeing any particular kind of emerging threat from those guys basically given what's going on with
the yen?
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. From the standpoint of the overall system right now it – I mean as I look at the road map
and the under-investment in Europe, it's primarily refrigeration. It's not a AC marketplace. That business does appear to
have – actually it could start trending upward, which is good to see after a couple of tough years.
Asia, the AC system, refrigeration investments, that's doing pretty well. We're starting to see some of that pick up back
and again transportation as people are starting to invest back after a couple years being off.
In North America the competitive environment really hasn't changed much in the last three or four months. We had real
– we had a very, very strong quarter last quarter and then this quarter we backed off. The orders have been reasonable
this quarter, and we're starting to see some of the other commercial businesses pick back up.
Relative to variable speed, in your case I guess you're talking about Daikin coming out of Japan, obviously everyone's
working right now on bringing what I'd call competitive variable speed to the United States. We clearly are working
with them to do that. Nothing has changed at this point in time.

I don't think you're going to see any significant product until sometime middle of next year. Carrier today has a
high-end product which is very good, but it's a very – it's a smaller part of the marketplace. And we need to get into
what I call the mid-size marketplace, mid-price point.
But I think we're all working on that right now. But it looks like a reasonable trend here for the next couple months and
hopefully next couple quarters.
But it's clearly, variable speed is the key issue that we as a company understand and that's why we're making electronic
investments. And the products are coming out and we've been doing pretty well in Europe, doing okay in Asia. And the
next game will be in the United States.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Beyond Viking is there anybody, Toshiba, Hitachi, others that we need to keep an eye on? Or
worry about as a competitive threat?
<A - David N. Farr>: Toshiba has worked – works obviously – their close relationship with Carrier. But Carrier
obviously has an option there working with Toshiba, but they've always had that. And we work – we sort of duel
together. But I would say in my perspective Daikin has the most competitive capabilities out there.

Our next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey Dave, just on this idea of getting Europe to turn, I mean you mentioned a couple
areas I think in Network Power and Climate that you saw turning positive. Getting the whole picture to turn positive,
what are kind of the lagging pieces? And maybe just fill that thought out a little bit?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well from our perspective we've been watching this now because – for the last several months.
If you – all the leading indicators in Europe are – have been pointing consistently now I want to say for three or four
months. I'm trying to get my chart out here, how many months it's bottomed.
So as I look at the European structure at this point in time – it's been actually from a leading indicator it's actually been
almost six months and the industrial numbers have been up three, four months.
So from my perspective what we're seeing right now is the longer the banks have stability to access the money, you're
going to start seeing the medium and small customers come into play and start investing again. And so I think that's the
key sign.
From Europe perspective right now, process had a good quarter in Europe and we're starting to see some of the other
businesses, industrial businesses come along with it.
But again I want to go back. It's not going to be what I'd call a robust turn. What I would envision next year would be
probably 1%-type a little bit, or maybe even a – maybe a little bit better than 1%-type of growth, which versus two
years of very negative growth, that's going to be like a nice wind to our back.
So key to me is the financial institutions starting to lend the money out, feeling comfortable to lend the money out. And
I think that obviously the German election coming up, I'm hoping things will stabilize here and we'll continue to trend
upwards.

Right now though it's been going on for several months and I would say the indication is that this will lift up the boats,
and we'll have a little bit more positive view of Europe next year. Again not robust but more positive.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay great. And then on some of the restructuring benefits, I mean Industrial
Automation you've done a really good job offsetting the volume deleverage with restructuring and cost take-out.
You've done heavy restructuring in Network Power too, but it hasn't really panned out there in terms of offsetting the
volume deleverage. Is there – is that a function of the mix in Network Power or the restructuring savings taking longer
to show up? Or maybe just give us a sense of why it's been so much more effective in Industrial Automation?
<A - David N. Farr>: Industrial Automation we actually had laid it out a little bit earlier. We saw the European thing
coming down quite rapidly and so we had laid it out – last couple of years we had done it incrementally. So we got
ahead of this power curve.
And we got a couple of key last restructurings done in Europe and a couple of key ones done in the United States right
before this started here. So that's been helping us cover this.
And the Network Power, the biggest issue for us has been the European drop-off right after we bought Chloride. We
started pushing them together. On the cost of the restructuring, the disruption of the restructuring, it's been a more
painful process relative to recovering that profitability through the restructuring. We need to get the growth back.
And as I said earlier we're starting to see the orders grow, we're starting to see some of that sales grow. If that trend line
continues, then we'll start seeing that positive. But that's been the biggest issue is the timing of the restructuring just as
the marketplace started turning down, the sales turned down rapidly. We were behind the power curve, because of the
downturn, where we got ahead of the power curve with IA.
That's our normal game, but we had just done a big acquisition and started it. And we got – unfortunately got behind
this one. And if you've ever done surfing in a surfboard, the wave crashed on top of you.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Got you. All right. Thanks a lot.

Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey David, I haven't heard you use a surfing reference before.
Is that a summer activity?
<A - David N. Farr>: I lived in North Carolina. When I was a young kid, I used to surf. And most people didn't realize
that, but I'm kind of too old and bad knees and I don't do that anymore. But I use that analogy all the time, you don't
want to get behind the – if you ever surf, you get behind that wave, man, it hurts when that board hits you on top of the
head.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Absolutely. On the Climate side maybe just expand your comments about the pause and
some destocking in the residential HVAC side, because you had the OEs posting pretty good high single digit sales this
quarter and just try to reconcile those comments.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah we – if you remember last quarter, we had a huge recovery so we put the product out
there, the OEs started using it and then put it in the inventory and they started selling it through. So we had a very
strong second quarter in North America residential.
And then so as the OEs started obviously integrating that inventory and starting to sell it, they sold us down a little bit.
And right now it looks to me like things are running reasonably well. And we've got it back into sync a little bit more
and we're starting to see some pickup back in the transportation area. So it took off very rapidly. I mean you remember

how strong were we in the first – in the second quarter in North...
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: It was over 20% North America revenue.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah. So we were over 20% North America residential in the second quarter. And so we got it
basically all in one quarter, and then they've been digesting it. So if I look at this quarter right now, I'd say we're going
to be in mid-single-digit, I think we're going to be pretty good. Right now it looks like that way.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Good. And then just a couple of follow-ups on the embedded power sale. Maybe take us
through the decisions about the – did you ever look at selling it in pieces? And this is probably a sore spot, but take us
through the economics on repatriating that cash.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. Yes, we did look at selling it in pieces. But from our perspective to give the business a
chance and also to get the best value for our shareholders after a tough couple years, we felt that doing the total
business together gave that enough flexibility to make that a viable company and to grow and make a good return down
on the second half of this piece. So we looked at all different ways. We looked obviously at strategics and this was the
best option for our shareholders.
Relative to repatriation, a lot of it came from Aztec, which I ran. Aztec has historically been a very profitable business.
And even though we've had a tough couple years here, if you look at the run we still had a slightly positive return on
our investment, all these investments. But it's still – the last couple years has been pretty tough and we had some
write-offs.
We had a lot of cash and earnings – or earnings. Obviously we never repatriated. And so with a transaction like this, we
have to bring those earnings back. That means we have to pay taxes on those earnings and that cash. So we're going to
bring it back and we're going to use that – part of that's going to be going back to our shareholders. And that's what –
where half the money's coming from. We had no choice, but we had to do that. Anything else you want to add on that,
Frank?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: No. That's clear.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's what it is.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: And that was all the cash that would be coming back related to this transaction?
<A - David N. Farr>: You got it.

<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Rich.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: On Industrial Automation the margins are holding in pretty well considering the environment.
So when things start to pick up are you going to have to add some cost back in infrastructure? How do you feel about
incrementals when volume actually starts to come back?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm hoping incrementals are pretty good initially and then as they continue to grow then we'll
obviously put the money back into it because we've done a lot of restructuring, but a lot of the restructuring was taking

out what I'd call excess capacity or repositioning it, and so it was a permanent. Now obviously we did do some what I
would call incremental type restructuring from the standpoint of personnel that we'd have to put back in as business
strengthens, but I'm hoping to have good leverage as this business recovers, and get that margin back up. It trades a
little bit higher than this when the good times are here, so I think we can do a little bit better and also starting investing
in the business again.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. And then just step back on Climate, you had a couple guys – OEMs, talk about better mix
that they're seeing on the residential side in the U.S. Are you starting to see that in your order flow at all in terms of the
mix of products starting to come through? Because I know that's been a headwind for a little while now.
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't specifically have the knowledge of that myself, I mean I could find it, but I don't sense – I
mean obviously we had, if you look at our profitability of the business, it's pretty good. So I would say we probably had
reasonable mix this quarter, if I look at the margin we just delivered, and we're going to deliver probably record margin
for the whole year. But I haven't seen a noticeable difference in mix. If we could get transportation in our commercial
businesses to start picking back up, that would be an even more positive mix for me.

The next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks. Yeah just a question on the Network Power decremental margins. They're
very high, and you call out pricing as a reason. Is that within just embedded computing? Or in the past you talked about
precision cooling as well?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah we saw a couple pricing. Excluding the embedded, we saw clearly there's a mix going on
right now in the type of cooling, and we're having to re-invest in a new product line of cooling, which is coming out of
a different price point, and there is going to be some aggressive restructuring in this area here, as we try to change the
cost structure of that business from a cooling standpoint. Because we're going to have to figure out how to make the
acceptable profitability on the new levels of the cooling.
In addition we have a mixed price mix relative to some of the shift we saw in China, is that China business. We can
slow down. We saw a little price pressure there. But other than that it primarily is the cooling side that we saw that, like
you said.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then within process management, your U.S. sales were down. They've been
down for a couple of quarters now. But you talk about orders improving. So I just wanted to see what's happening, say,
in the after-market business in the U.S. within process management. When you expect that to start showing up in better
– or an improvement in revenues there?
<A - David N. Farr>: The aftermarket business in process this year in the U.S. has not been good. And the orders have
not really -- that part of the order pace has not picked back up yet.
And so we had a phenomenal aftermarket business last year, and it looks like a lot of business went in. They're starting
– they're actually working on it, installing it.
Basically where I see where we are in the cycle right now in North America, I would not expect our aftermarket sales
to pick back up this fiscal year. But again I called it wrong last year. But I would say right now based – it's going to be
small projects and not necessarily aftermarket business. So obviously not as nice margin-wise, but it's still – we've still
got some good growth out there.

Our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hey. Sorry. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello Steve. Good afternoon.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Sorry I dropped the phone. You mentioned Europe quite a bit, and just next year you talked about I
guess low single-digit or 1%. Are you referring to your sales? Or are you referring to like some index of investment
there?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm looking at my sales right now. I would say until we get -- until we see anything above 2%
underlying growth in say the investment environment, we're going to be – we'll be in that 1% to 2% range.
If you go above 2% then we'll start seeing a premium for that. But right now I think you're going to see moderate
investment growth in the GFI level, and that means we'll have that moderate growth level is at 1% or 1.5% or 1.25%.
That's [indiscernible] (47:29).
<Q - Steve Tusa>: And then when I guess – that's great color. I guess when you think about the – I guess you talked
about emerging markets, kind of a mid single-digit growth rate. Over time would you expect to out-perform that? Or is
that something that again, is kind of referring to what your business can do?
<A - David N. Farr>: From my perspective, if we could see a 4% to 5% then we've historically gotten a premium to
that into that space. So I would say we won't get the same level of premium, when you go up to 6%, 7%, 8% that
premium gets wider, as you know.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say we're at 4% or 5% we should get a point or two on top of that.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. And then finally, just kind of like slicing it up this year, I guess year-to-date your U.S.
business is growing low-single digits. I know that there's a lot of – that's just an average growth rate. Just a lot of
moving parts there, with Network Power and Climate. Ultimately you guys are going to finish I guess in the low-single
digits in the U.S. this year. You are reflecting somewhat of a little bit of a recovery in resi this year that's now booked.
Would you expect that to accelerate in the U.S.? Or is the U.S. kind of just a solid – is the U.S. just more of a consistent
rate of what we've seen this year?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think you're going to see – our U.S. business should be better next year. It was extremely
strong last year, U.S., and stronger last year in the U.S. and then it weakened as I think we saw certain businesses tail
off after the strength last year. I think you're going to see an improvement both in the U.S. and Europe. I think this next
year you're going to see the mature markets actually be – do a little bit better from the standpoint of underlying growth.
That's my gut feel right now with Latin America being pretty good. I think China will be low-single-digits next year
and I think Asia-Pacific will be high-single-digits. I mean Southeast Asia.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: So when you say U.S. a little better, does that mean like 3% to 4% or something like that? Or is it
even better than that?
<A - David N. Farr>: I wouldn't say it's any better than that. I would say 3% in the U.S. would be a good number.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. So that kind of blends you guys into that kind of 2% to 5% range?
<A - David N. Farr>: I wish – I mean I'd take 5% tomorrow but I think it's – in my mind it's like 2% to 4%, yeah.

business, you're kind of restructuring that. So does that mean you're restructuring it to make the margin that it made
historically? Or you're restructuring and positioning the business to where the volume is and that maybe a lower
margin? I didn't quite understand what this means structurally for that Cooling business?

<Q - Andrew Obin>: As we look at Process into 2014 and specifically North America, how concerned are you guys
about ability to do stuff on time given the labor shortages? Labor shortages obviously by people who build this stuff,
sorry.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I'm sorry. You're talking about skilled installation base.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Right. Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: That clearly will hold back, but we haven't seen a problem with that yet. I mean I think that it
probably made a pause this year because of people being – working on what they tried working on last year, but we
have not seen a problem yet relative to our customer base or our base or even our own self-having to do these projects
yet. It would have to be very, very strong growth to cause that problem at this point in time. So I've not seen that in
North America yet.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just thinking about capital re-deployment beyond buybacks, I appreciate the focus on
smaller deals, but what keeps you away from doing sort of deals over $1 billion? And what's the framework there going
to next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Nothing keeps me away from it, I just – from the standpoint that I have nothing right now that I
find worthwhile from the standpoint of – that makes sense for us from the business and strategically. And so I mean we
can do big deals, we've got plenty of capital to do it it's just right now nothing's popped; most of these deals are in the
$100 million to $300 million, $400 million levels right now that we're working on and nice little bolt-ons in those.
That's where the focus is right now. If the right one came along, we'd obviously work on it.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. All the best.

<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So just piggybacking on Steve's question earlier, he went through some of the regional color
for 2014. What are some other puts and takes we should be thinking about? At this point it seems like there would be a
tension tailwind. But perhaps some color on price-cost? And I know that you're spending an incremental, call it $100
million to $120 million in stock comp this year.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah. Pension I mean it's interest – this is Frank speaking, Joe. Pension if interest rates
stay where they are now, when we finish up our year September 30 should be at order of magnitude of $50 million
pickup next year. With respect to stock comp and other corporate items, that's probably in the range of $35 million to
$50 million as well as we come off the overlap year for the stock comp. So we should have some tailwinds next year in
those areas.
<A - David N. Farr>: Relative to price-cost, it's a point – I got my top executives coming in. I would say the point of
inflection on price-cost is here sometime in the next quarter or two. We've had a very strong net material inflation
environment, which has been helpful for us. Materials have really dropped.
If there's some stability around the world – and I'm not talking about huge growth. But there's some stability around the
world, we've been seeing – we'll start seeing – you should start seeing some I would say less negative net material
inflation, so we have less benefit there.
The last couple quarters as we've seen the negative net material inflation come into play, we're starting to see some
negative price overall. And so what that tells me, now we've had a period where we – the net material inflation is
helping us. A slight negative price is hurting us overall. And we're netting out to what we call green.
However typically what we're watching right now is this point of inflection is happening where this thing's going to
flip. And we got to make sure that we're paying attention to this, where the net material inflation will start going the
other way. The price, if you let it get away from you, might get too negative. Then you'll go red, which we've seen
several years back.
So right now I'd say Joe, we are at the point of inflection for our company. It's all hands on deck. Frank and Ed Monser
have been talking about this for the businesses. I see it pretty clearly. If it's not this quarter, it's going to be next quarter.
And so we're – what we're trying to do right now is make sure we get ahead of this, and make sure we do not go into a
red quarter sometime in 2014.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: That's really helpful, Dave. And then specifically on that point as it relates to each one of
your businesses, which businesses do think are going to be most impacted by it? And maybe talk through some of the
actions that you're taking.
<A - David N. Farr>: Clearly on the Network Power side, it's historically been the most negative impacted by that.
And so we've clearly got to make sure we stay ahead of the net material. We've got to keep driving that down, that net
material.
Getting embedded power and computing out of there will help us from the standpoint, because they're a little bit more
volatile. The other area that we obviously have to work on very carefully will be the Climate Technology area, because
of the large, metal content in there. So metal prices have been depressed. And so we have to make sure that we – in our
pricing as we look forward and we've had the positive net material inflation, and we've been having that obviously
support that.
Those are the two areas and we have to make sure we keep ahead of that from a price buff. And we just know it's
coming, you just – you have to figure out where you hedge and don't hedge, and things like that. So there's a lot going
on right now as we go into that mode.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Well thanks for taking my questions.
<A - David N. Farr>: All the way best, Joe.

Our next question is from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Thank you. Good afternoon, folks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, John.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: First on Network Power back to Europe and the data center question of, it looks like demand is
firming and improving. Can you talk about the competitive situation when you look for growth in the coming quarters
there? Talk about the split versus organic versus maybe share gains? Also I know you got the new precision air stuff
coming out. But just qualify it for us in terms of the competitive growth there.
<A - David N. Farr>: I can't – I mean it's very hard for us to say what winning or losing in a quarter. You don't – it
takes a long time to see that. So I don't – right now what we're seeing is we're going back into our install base and going
back and upgrading that installed base where they spend money.
So I'd say right now – I would say we're going to be mining the current core space at this point in time. I don't – it's
hard to say until after you get through this period. Do you pick it up or lose? So it's really hard to say that, John, from
that perspective. And I don't – from the standpoint I don't break out those individual product lines and other stuff. So
that's something I'm not going to do there.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Okay. Thanks. And then my last question. Back to the M&A point for next year and your
relative – I guess some of the targets are unattractive here. Is it just purely valuation, or some of the good properties are
spoken for? Just give us a little bit more detail about your thoughts about M&A.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think in the larger deal I think the valuations are a little too high at this point in time. I think
the smaller bolt-on deals where you can actually have a little bit more synergy, just a lot more flexibility. I think that
those deals right now are in play, where the large strategic deals kind of expensive at this point in time.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Great. Thank you, David.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hey, David. How's it going?
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So when you put together your comments about companies are set on CapEx investments for a long
time. There's some desire to reinvest, and then you put that together with your more mature comments. It seems a bit
more bullish than I guess your sub-GDP type growth forecast in 2014. I guess to turn it around, as you're obviously
planning for 2014 right now, are you planning to set up investments materially for next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: I wouldn't say material, but our initial investments will be up into the mid-$700 million range
from the standpoint of our capital. So right now we're planning if we did around – let's say we did $685 million this
year, I would say our plan is to make $750 million to $760 million next year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. I think that's pretty broad-based? Would you expect pick up investments in Europe, too?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. It's pretty across around the world.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: And then just going back to capital allocation. You mentioned in the PR this morning the $800
million-plus run rate for share buybacks and the $600 million on top of that. So you've already said that next year
M&A is going to remain say small and bolt-on, probably a bit more than we did this year, but is the ambition for next
year to do sort of the same level of base repurchases with the $600 million on top of that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we – our plan will be next year as we build the plan, we show the board today, is that we
do somewhere between $800 million and $900 million next year again.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Ignoring the $600 million?
<A - David N. Farr>: Ignoring the $600 million. So this year's pace was $800 million, $900 million. We expect to do
another $800 million, $900 million next year plus we're going to do – we're going to make the special one-time $600
million payback – buyback.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And one more if I can. You talk about mix being an issue for the last couple of quarters now.
Full – the full key setup is for margins to be I guess in-line or actually better than they were last quarter, last year, and
4Q 2012 was an extremely good margin quarter. So I'm wondering, how confident are you that the mix is going to
work for you in 4Q? And even if it doesn't, do you feel you've got nothing in hand from restructuring savings to offset
those potential headwinds?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Well, we're planning on that. That's what the game plan is right now. And I'm hoping that
the volumes continue to trend upwards and we've got cost structure in place. Typically our fourth quarter we leverage
quite nicely, so I'd say right now we're set up reasonably well to have a good, a very good profit quarter and a good
cash flow quarter.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. All the best to you.

Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Jeremy [ph] Capone (60:15). Please go ahead.
<Q>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Going back to Industrial Automation, you mentioned the
continued negative impact of destocking at one of your large customers for alternators. Could you give some color here
in terms of the extent to which this is impacting your top line this quarter?
<A - David N. Farr>: I have not given out specific numbers on this, but it's quite significant from the standpoint it's a
very large $1 billion plus customer. So we – I've not – I've never told people how much per quarter per se, but if you
look at what they've been doing relative to their inventory levels and they're taking out, you can see how much that's
impacted. But as I've said, at EPG I think this trend is getting close to reversing and I would expect that as we end this
year and go into next year we'll start seeing some more positive input there.
<Q>: Okay. That's great. And as a follow-up, just quickly on the drive, the new drive that you launched earlier this
year, how – is this having any material impact on the P&L as of yet?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I would say that they're starting, the Drive business is starting to turn. And they're very
European-centric, but right now it's starting, it's a profitable business and it's starting to get better. I expect 2014 we'll
gain a lot more momentum in that area as those drives take hold of the industrial drives. So I think that's – I like the
first 12 months of it and it's starting to have a positive impact there and it's starting to turn.
<Q>: Thanks very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.
