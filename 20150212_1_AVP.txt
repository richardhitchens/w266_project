Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call today. There are three topics I'd like to cover this
morning. First, I'll provide my high level perspective on the quarter. Second, I'll briefly comment on our progress in
2014; and lastly, I'll update you on our outlook for 2015 and our longer-term goals. Bob will then take you through the
details of the quarter and provide some perspectives on our outlook for 2015. We'll then open the call for Q&A.
Before we get started, I'm sure that you've all seen our recent announcement that Jim Scully will be joining us as Chief
Financial Officer in mid-March. I'm thrilled to have someone of Jim's caliber joining Avon, as you get to spend some
time with Jim, I'm sure you will recognize what a terrific addition he is to our team. Several of you have asked about
the timing of Jim's appointment, and the recent market rumors related to CPG's involvement with Avon. While we don't
comment on market rumors or speculations, Jim's hiring was a result of a thorough and thoughtful process and was not
related to CPG or any other market rumors. We'll introduce Jim at our next earnings call and you'll have the chance to
meet him at our Investor Day, which will be held on May 13.
Let me start with fourth quarter results. During our October call, we said that we expected to deliver continued
improvement in our performance in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to say that we delivered the financial results we
anticipated, despite significant additional headwinds. Our fourth quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 5% year-on-year
in constant dollars, in line with our expectations.
Our adjusted operating margin was 9.3%, up 110 basis points year-on-year. Worth noting, this 110-basis point
improvement in the fourth quarter operating margin came despite an estimated 250-basis point headwind from
currency. Bob will provide you with more detail in his comments, however, the foreign currency devaluations are
clearly masking our progress.
Another challenge we're facing in some markets is Active Representatives, which were down 4% in the quarter on a
global basis. From a geographic perspective, Latin America posted double digit constant dollar revenue growth in part
due to Venezuela, which benefited from increased pricing in response to inflation. EMEA delivered good constant
dollar revenue growth; however, profit was heavily impacted by foreign currency. Asia Pacific while small continued
to show progress in the overall performance. North America while still declining in revenue continued to reduce their
cost base in the fourth quarter in line with our expectations and remains on track for profitability in 2015.
We also executed well in controlling cost at both the corporate and market level, and we continue to aggressively look
for opportunities to improve our overall cost base. This is critically important, as we face significant macroeconomic
challenges moving forward and we need to ensure that we protect investment in our key markets. In summary, we
began the year with the expectation that the second half of 2014 would show improvement relative to the first half and
in spite of the unexpected headwinds, we delivered improvement on both top line and bottom line in the second half.
Now I'd like to briefly comment on our full year 2014 performance. From a financial perspective, it's fair to say that
2014 was a challenging year. We had some internal issues in some markets in the first half of the year and throughout
the year, we were impacted by macroeconomic and currency headwinds, with the impact increasing significantly in
fourth quarter.
In 2014, we delivered flat revenue performance in constant dollars year-on-year and we improved the adjusted
operating margin by 40 basis points year-on-year to 8.3% even with the negative headwind of about 220 basis points
due to currency. We continue to improve our cost structure and through our actions, we have reduced our annual cost
by more than the $400 million goal established in late 2012.
While these savings have been offset in part by currency and inflation, it's very good progress.
Given the stiff headwinds we are facing, continuing to reduce structural cost remains a key priority for us. In spite of
the fact that our progress against our financial objective has been slower than I would like, I'm encouraged by the
sequential improvement we made in key markets and categories in the second half of 2014. I attribute this in large part
to improvements to the foundation of Avon's business. Across our top 12 markets, we have stronger management teams
and improved talent pipeline and better discipline in executing against Avon's core processes. There is more to be done

here, but I cannot emphasize enough how important this work has been. Only with the right people in the right job,
executing well against the clear plan, will we continue to make progress in our efforts to return to sustainable profitable
growth.
In 2014, we made good strides in commercial marketing with improved product offerings across our base business in
core categories like skincare and fragrance. In fact, in skincare, we grew in the second half of the year. This is the first
time that we've had consecutive quarter growth in skincare since 2008. This reflects the strength in the base business
coupled with strong innovation in our top markets. We also improved our pricing capabilities in our top markets, an
area where we have been challenged in the past.
As it relates to sales management, we've shown improvement; however, we're not yet executing consistently across all
markets. Continuing to improve execution in the field is our number one focus in 2015. This is a key driver of
Representative engagement, which ultimately impacts the number of Active Representatives. We've also made good
progress in improving the overall health of our top 12 markets. You'll recall when evaluating our key markets, we ask
ourselves three questions. First, do we have the right management team in place? Second, are we executing well against
the critical processes? And third, are we driving Representative engagement? Our top market leadership teams are
largely in good shape, we've filled most of the talent gaps and the teams are jelling. Importantly for our business model,
we have a healthier mix of local leaders with direct selling experience in general management roles. I would say that
we are consistently executing well in 2/3 of these markets.
Representative engagement is in good shape, and about half of our top 12 markets were not where we need to be
overall, but we know where the issues are and we're working to resolve them. Improving Representative engagement is
my number one global concern. In 2014, we also improved consumer access to Avon. Across all markets, we've
increased our digital effort. We successfully re-launched avon.com in the U.S., and we continued the rollout of mobile
apps globally. We also completed two new strategic alliances in Latin America, which we expect will favorably impact
our financial performance in 2015.
And I am also pleased that during 2014, we finalized our agreement with the U.S. Government, related to the FCPA
matter. As I said throughout the year, much of the work we did in 2014 was foundational; putting the right talent in
place in our key markets, improving execution against Avon's core processes, and getting our cost structure better
aligned with our current business.
Before moving to 2015, let me talk in a little more detail about our top four markets, as they represent about half of our
revenue, and this perspective will provide more insight into how we view 2015. Three of the four, Brazil, Mexico, and
Russia are emerging markets, and while we are currently in a tough emerging market environment, we feel these
markets have strong growth potential in the long-term.
Starting with Brazil, Avon's largest market; Brazil is the third largest beauty market overall and the largest direct
selling beauty market in the world. Today, consumer spending in Brazil is being impacted by the uncertain economic
environment, higher levels of consumer debt and currency devaluation.
While growth is slowing, and the competitive environment is intensifying, Brazil remains a highly attractive market,
given the emerging middle class, the importance of beauty and the high penetration of direct selling in our core
categories. We continue to invest in Brazil, as we see a bright long-term future, despite shorter-term challenges.
As I stated last quarter, we expect our Brazilian performance to improve in fourth quarter, but not necessarily deliver
growth. Brazil performed as anticipated, with its underlying revenue performance sequentially improving by three
points.
In 2015, we will continue to invest in Brazil. Based on what we know today, we expect our Brazilian business to
deliver modest growth in 2015. We have adjusted our marketing plans to take into account more muted consumer
spending.
In addition, we have a great program of new product initiatives and activities to respond to this competitive
marketplace. Key to delivering our growth will be strong execution of base enhancing activities, coupled with launches

of new innovation.
This includes products from our two strategic alliances, which should better enable us to trade up existing customers, as
well as attract new consumers. For example in the fourth quarter, we successfully launched two Coty brands and more
Coty brands will be integrated in Brazil's marketing plan throughout this year.
One new issue we are dealing within Brazil is a change in tax laws for cosmetics products that will be effective May of
this year. I know many of you reached out to us with questions on this situation.
We're working to better understand its potential implications for our business, and are looking for ways to help mitigate
the impact. At this time, given the uncertain outcome, we have not included any impact into our 2015 outlook.
Moving to Mexico; Mexico is an attractive emerging market for the long-term. While the economy has been impacted
by declining oil prices and beauty, personal care category growth has been a bit muted in recent quarters; we see good
opportunity for the future. For our business in Mexico, we've improved our capabilities in overall performance.
Mexico grew constant currency revenue 7% in fourth quarter after several quarters of decline. As I said last quarter, we
expected Mexico to show sequential improvement in overall performance in fourth quarter. I'm pleased with the
performance and the progress that Mexican team has made. They have stemmed the decline in Active Representatives,
an area that they've been working on for the past year. And they continue to deliver a consumer relative product
portfolio at the right price. For 2015, we anticipate solid performance in Mexico.
Turning to Russia; as all of you know, this market is facing many challenges at the moment, not respective to the Avon
business; continued political tension, significant currency devaluation and a steep drop in oil prices. Our team there is
doing a very good job of managing through this volatile environment. As indicated last quarter, we expected to deliver
low single digit growth, and we achieved this, posting 2% constant currency revenue growth, while continuing to grow
Active Representatives.
The Russian ruble fluctuation was significant and caused fourth quarter EMEA operating margins to decline. We
expect that the economic situation will have a significant negative impact on the profitability of our Russian business in
2015. Challenges aside, Russia is an important market and we are in it for the long-term. It is important to keep our
Representatives and consumers engaged in our business. We anticipate continued healthy constant dollar sales growth
in 2015 and we will continue to evaluate pricing and are working to manage operating costs, but we do not believe we
will be able to fully offset the significant currency impact in Russia. Bob will provide more details and I'll comment
more on the overall impact to the company when I discuss 2015 a bit later.
Lastly, an update on our U.S. business; as I've said many times, the U.S. is an important market for us. It's a large and
growing beauty market. While it's clear that we have a long road ahead to fix the U.S. business, we've made good
progress in some key areas. We've taken aggressive actions and are on track to deliver profitability in 2015. At the
same time, we are working to build a sustainable business by improving all aspects of the Representative experience to
drive better engagement.
As I mentioned last quarter, the North American management team is taking aggressive actions to fix the business. For
the year, they reduced SG&A costs by $178 million with the majority coming from fixed cost reduction. Importantly,
while taking significant cost out, they've made major improvements in the commercial marketing process in the areas
of product mix, pricing, and merchandising execution. And as a result, we once again saw a strong increase in average
order in fourth quarter, up 5% versus prior year.
The area where our U.S. business remains challenged is our Active Representative trends. We have not yet been able to
sufficiently improve the Representative experience to retain new Representatives at the level we expect. We have been
taking action in the field, increasing our support for new Representatives, improving aspects of the Representative
experience and we are now introducing more ways for her to improve her earnings opportunity. We have put a lot of
effort into this, but have not yet realized the full benefit. Moving into 2015, the U.S. team has reallocated resources to
continue improving the Representative experience with the focus on recruiting and retention processes and leadership
advancement. One bright spot in North America has been the re-launch of avon.com, which allows us to offer our

Representatives and consumers a more contemporary social selling model.
In fourth quarter, we grew online sales and saw an increase in average order size. For 2015, we expect North America
to be profitable for the year and to show improvement in the field. Let me now share my thoughts on 2015. We
continue to push hard against the long-term value drivers necessary to produce profitable and sustainable growth for
Avon. We will continue to strengthen the management teams in our key markets and to strengthen our core processes.
The major area of work in 2015 involves improving Active Representative growth.
We continue to improve our discipline behind our two fundamental processes, commercial marketing and sales
management. We expect this will drive representative engagement and ultimately Active Representative growth. We
will invest in innovation in our top markets to build for the long-term, and we will continue to take out overhead costs
to improve productivity. Cost management will continue to be extremely important in our ability to protect investments
in our key markets given the headwinds we anticipate particularly in Russia and Brazil.
In 2015, we will continue to improve consumer access through our efforts in e-commerce, mobile and other digital
activities and having solidified our product category strategies will turn to strengthening the relevance and impact of
the Avon brand around the world. We will also continue the rollout of products from our key strategic alliances in Latin
America, our largest region to drive growth by reaching new consumers and strengthening the earnings opportunities
for representatives.
Let me now discuss our 2015 financial projections. As a background, our initial task at the 2015 budget was complete
in November, and we anticipated delivering modest revenue growth and improved adjusted operating margin versus
2014 by about 100 basis points. Since then the macroeconomic environment, especially as it relates to foreign currency
and emerging market economies has changed dramatically.
Given the recent FX issues in key markets like Russia and Brazil, we see more pressure on our cost base. To mitigate
this, we expect to take price in a prudent manner, improve product mix where possible and cut costs where we are able.
We also plan to realize some benefit from the lower price of oil. Through these efforts, we expect to offset most of the
transaction FX impact. However, it will be difficult to cover all of the currency headwinds.
So when we take these factors into consideration for 2015, we're still targeting modest constant dollar revenue growth.
And based on what we know today, we also expect the operating margin to show modest improvement in constant
currency. However, the adjusted operating margin will be hurt by the impact of translation of overseas results into U.S.
dollars and could be down as much as 100 basis points.
We estimate that the full impact of currency in 2015 will be about 350 basis points, almost 2/3 of which we should be
able to offset through pricing mix and cost reduction activities. We'll be watching the macro trends, monitoring
progress in key markets like the U.S. and assessing the impact of the cosmetic tax situation in Brazil. And of course, we
will work to accelerate growth wherever possible.
Lastly, let me make a brief comment on our longer-term financial goals. Let me start by saying, our company should be
delivering mid-single digit revenue growth and low double digit operating margin. However, as I acknowledged
previously, the degree of difficulties has been greater than when we set the goals in late 2012. And we remain behind
where we thought we would be, particularly in terms of revenue growth. We also said we felt better about the goal of
low double digit operating margin based on the traction we've been getting in our cost reduction efforts.
However, based on where the business is today, with extreme foreign exchange and macroeconomic headwinds and the
U.S. proving to be a tougher turnaround than expected, we do not expect to achieve the revenue or operating margin
goal in 2016. The obvious question is when will we get there. As you might imagine, given the uncertainty that we see
today with 75% of our business in emerging markets, it's difficult for us to provide specific timing. But as a principle,
we do expect Avon to continue to make constant dollar progress every year in both revenue growth and operating
margin.
We're spending a lot of time this morning discussing currency fluctuations because of the impact on our business in
2014 and into 2015. I would note though that Avon has weathered emerging market cycles in the past, and I'm

confident we'll do so again.
In closing, in 2014, we saw good progress and addressed several challenges in key markets. In 2015, we expect
continued progress; however, our financial results will be impacted by currency fluctuation.
Moving to the long-term, what do I see and why do I believe that Avon is on track to return to strong performance.
While the road ahead is a tough one, I am optimistic that we will succeed in our mission of returning Avon to
sustainable profitable growth. My confidence stems from our experience in the past year. Market-by-market,
step-by-step we are rebuilding the foundation. We're clear on our strategy and our plans, and we've been executing with
more consistency. We participate in the growing and attractive beauty segment and despite current FX issues we have a
very attractive geographic portfolio for the long-term.
And importantly every associate at Avon understands what's at stake. We're all committed to ensuring that this iconic
beauty brand remains a source of inspiration and power for women around the world for decades to come. And we
know that we accomplish that by returning the business to sustainable, profitable growth.
Thank you. And I'll now hand it over to Bob.
Robert Loughran
Thank you, Sheri. Before I discuss the full year 2014 and fourth quarter results, I wanted to spend a few minutes
discussing currency, as it had a significant impact on our results in 2014, and we expect the impact to be even greater in
2015.
Foreign currency impacted our results in three ways. First, currency translation, as you know as the dollar strengthens
relative to foreign currencies, the revenues and profits of our foreign business units are reduced when we translate them
into U.S. dollars. This also impacts our margins due to country mix given that many of our higher margin businesses
are in the countries experiencing the most significant currency devaluation. Our costs are also more weighted to U.S.
dollars while our foreign revenues have declined due to currency translation, compounding the impact on our P&L.
Second, foreign currency transaction costs; foreign currency transaction costs have impacted us most significantly in
EMEA, mostly due to the Russian ruble devaluation and to a lesser degree in Latin America. As I discussed in the third
quarter earnings call, in EMEA we manufacture most of our products in Poland and some in Russia. We source raw
materials mostly in hard currencies, including euros and dollars. At the same time, we sell products in many countries
with soft currencies including Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Ukraine. This creates the negative transaction foreign
exchange impact, given that sales and costs are often denominated in different currencies. We typically work to
mitigate this transaction impact through price increases, but there is a delay in our ability to realize pricing in order to
offset the currency impact as we assess the competitive and consumer environment in each market. Typically, we end
up staging the price increases to protect market share and this creates a lag in our ability to offset the impact.
The third way currency impacts us is the revaluation on foreign currency denominated working capital balances. This
includes the revaluation of accounts payables that one Avon entity such as Avon Russia may have with another Avon
entity such as our European manufacturing entity in Poland. In this example, Avon Russia's payable to Avon Poland is
revalued at the end of each period, based on the spot rate in effect at the end of the period.
Gains or losses from revaluing these working capital balances are recorded in other expense net, which is shown below
operating profit on our income statement. In both 2014 and 2013, we recorded losses due to the revaluation of our
foreign currency denominated working capital balances. You will note later when I discuss our outlook, we do not
include an estimate for below-the-line revaluations in our 2015 outlook, because that would require an estimate of
future foreign exchange rates.
In the aggregate, currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS by approximately $0.53 per share during 2014 with $0.24
from translation, $0.23 from transaction costs and another $0.06 from below operating profit revaluation of working
capital balances.

Adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by currency translation and transaction by approximately 220 basis
points. While we have been able to take some pricing to offset some of our foreign currency transaction costs, in 2014,
it was only a fraction of the cost, due to speed of the recent devaluation and the lag in being able to build in pricing. I'll
talk more about the expected impact in 2015 later.
Now, let's turn to the details of the 2014 results. As Sheri has indicated, our sales recovery is taking longer than
expected, largely due to continued weakness in the U.S., as well as the macro challenges we are facing in several
markets around the world. For 2014, our constant dollar sales were relatively unchanged, but we are pleased with the
improved trends in the second half of the year. Our adjusted operating margin was 8.3%, up 40 basis points.
We are very pleased that as of year end 2014, we have achieved all of the $400 million in cost savings that we had
targeted at the end of 2012. The savings were achieved from both initiatives that had CTI charges associated with them,
such as head count and marketing facility closures, as well as initiatives not requiring CTI charges. These other
initiatives include areas where we have previously discussed including reducing our [indiscernible] (27:13) cost and
legal expenses as well as some others. While we plan to continue aggressively right-sizing our cost structure to achieve
cost savings, currency was and will remain a significant headwind that is offsetting much of the benefit. As mentioned,
in 2014 currency had a 220-basis point negative impact on our adjusted operating margin, and we anticipate this
accelerating in 2015, which I'll address later. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS was $0.75 compared to $1.02 in the prior
year. As I mentioned earlier, currency negatively impacted full year adjusted EPS by approximately $0.53 per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations that we shared with you in October of
sequential improvement in several markets and continued margin improvement. I'll start by providing a quick overview
of our consolidated results, and then I will review the geographic performance.
In the fourth quarter, constant dollar revenue rose 5%, but declined 12% on a reported basis, negatively impacted by
approximately 17 points by foreign exchange. The biggest contributors to the negative foreign currency impact on
revenues were Venezuela and Russia. Constant dollar beauty sales were up 5%, while fashion & home was up 1%.
Within beauty, all three subcategories of fragrance, skincare and color were up.
With regards to constant dollar revenue growth, our consolidated results benefited approximately 1% from additional
VAT credits in Brazil. In addition, had constant dollar results been translated at SICAD II exchange rate of 50 in
Venezuela, our constant dollar growth would have been reduced by three points.
Active Representatives were down 4%. This was driven by continued weakness in North America, as well as a decline
in Latin America, most significantly in Venezuela. EMEA Active Representatives continued to grow this quarter,
which is encouraging. And average order growth remains strong, with growth in all regions as we make progress in
improving our commercial marketing processes around the world. Units declined 3%, and consistent with the Active
Representative declines was driven by North America and Latin America. Q4 price mix was up 8%, led by inflationary
pricing in Latin America.
Adjusted gross margin declined 40 basis points to 60.8%. Foreign currency negatively impacted gross margin by
approximately 160 basis points, primarily in EMEA, partially offset by positive price mix. Adjusted operating margin
was up 110 basis points to 9.3%. The benefit from Brazil taxes was approximately 90 basis points, though this was
more than offset by currency, which had a 260-basis point drag in the quarter.
Our underlying adjusted operating margin continues to benefit from our cost reduction efforts, particularly in North
America. We also saw cost savings from other head count reductions and lower corporate expenses. The adjusted
effective tax rate was 37.2%, in line with our expectations of mid-30% to high 30% range. Adjusted EPS was $0.20 per
share, compared with $0.34 per share a year ago. Currency had a significant impact on the year-over-year comparison
of EPS of approximately $0.22 per share.
I will now provide more details on our results by geographic region. I'll start with Latin America. Q4 revenue rose 10%
in constant dollars including approximately 2 points from VAT tax credits in Brazil. Active Representatives were down
5%, driven by continued double digit declines in Venezuela.

Average order was up 15% benefiting from the recognition of the Brazil VAT as well as inflationary pricing in
Venezuela and Argentina. Units were down 6% primarily due to declines in Brazil and Venezuela. As we've been
indicating all year, we adopted SICAD II for Venezuela at the end of the first quarter, but we only update our constant
dollar exchange rates on an annual basis, so we will change to an exchange rate of approximately 50 to determine our
constant dollar results beginning with the first quarter of 2015. Had we used the SICAD II rate to translate Venezuela
results into constant dollars, the region's constant dollar revenue would have grown 4% this quarter.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 8.8%, down 80 basis points. The margin decline was due to currency
translation, primarily due to Venezuela and higher obsolescence expense. These were partially offset by an
approximately 180-basis point benefit from the incremental impact of VAT tax credits as well as lower Representative
and sales leader expense.
Turning to Brazil; constant dollar revenue was up 4%, including approximately five points from the VAT tax credit,
recognized in the quarter. Beauty sales in Brazil were flat in constant dollars with growth in fragrances aided by the
launch of some Coty fragrances. Fashion & home was down 8%.
In Mexico, revenue was up 7% in constant dollars driven by recovery in Active Representatives and units. Average
order also continues to improve compared with the year ago benefiting from more effective pricing and a strong
holiday offer. As mentioned last quarter, the team in Mexico remains focused on improving the Representative
engagement and they've seen some improvement in Representative recruitment and have stemmed the decline in Active
Representatives this quarter. Venezuela revenue increased 62% in constant dollars. The increase was driven by
inflationary pricing. Given the difficult environment we are operating in, in Venezuela, our management team has done
a terrific job as they have secured goods and prioritized products to our top sellers.
As a result, we have not been able to provide products to all Representatives, leading to a significant decline in Active
Representatives. As we have said before going into 2015, using the SICAD II rate, Venezuela is expected to be only
1% of our total revenues. As we look into 2015, we are mindful of the difficult operating environment in Latin America
given the macro outlook. We are already adapting to this by working to ensure that our portfolio mix is attractive to
consumers in these markets.
Currency will remain another key challenge as well, given the recent spot rates and the outlook for continued weakness.
We plan to try to recover some of the impact from currency with price increases, but ensuring that we do so in a way
that doesn't alienate consumers or representatives. And we will remain focused on driving representative engagement
throughout the region, by not only focusing on recruiting but also on retention, training and ensuring we have the right
incentives.
As many of you are aware, there is also a pending tax law in Brazil, called Industrial Production Tax, IPI. As Sheri
indicated, we're working to better understand the potential implications for our business and looking for ways to help
mitigate the impact. At this time given the uncertain outcome of this change, we have not included any impact in our
2015 outlook.
Moving to EMEA, we remain very pleased with the results in this region. Revenue remained strong rising 5% in
constant dollars. The closure of the French market negatively impacted the region's growth in Q4 by approximately one
point.
EMEA is benefiting from strong underlying fundamentals with healthy Active Representative growth, average order
and units. In addition, the region is benefiting from a focus on improving and enhancing the fashion & home offerings
in several markets, including the U.K. and across Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Even though our growth is
strong, our adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 13.9%, down 170 basis points due to currency.
In Russia, constant dollar revenue rose 2%. This was as expected given the timing issues we discussed on our third
quarter call, which benefited Q3 and tempered Q4. We expect this change in timing of the end of the campaigns will
also cause some variability in our growth rates in first quarter of 2015. Specifically we believe that it is likely we'll
report growth above the underlying run rate. We continue to believe our underlying growth in Russia is mid-single
digits.

I'll talk about the currency issues impacting Russia in a moment. The U.K. business is continuing to trend from recent
quarters with continued growth, as constant dollar revenue was up 4% in the fourth quarter. This quarter's growth was
once again driven by improvements in average order, partially offset by a decline in Active Representatives.
EMEA's revenue growth also benefited from strength in South Africa and a strong quarter in Central Europe. We're
encouraged by the progress that EMEA made in the second half of 2014 and feel good about actions the team has been
taking to accelerate customer and representative engagement. Looking forward, however, we expect that the recent
currency weakness most notably in Russia will have a significant negative impact on our operating profit in 2015.
We are working to mitigate the impact with pricing, but also working to keep our representatives and consumers
engaged during these challenging times. We're also looking for incremental cost savings, such as continuing to focus on
head count and indirect sourcing.
As you know, we have a lot of experience in dealing with markets experiencing these crisis situations, and this is no
different. Our challenge will be to balance protecting profit by a price increase, while keeping consumers engaged.
With that said, we are confident we have the right team in place to manage this properly.
Turning to North America, constant dollar revenue was down 11%. As we expected this was better than recent trends
as we benefited from the strength of our holiday products as well as the timing impact of moving the President's Club
cycle forward into the fourth quarter, which we had discussed on our third quarter call.
However, our Active Representatives are still down 16%, partially offset by average order growth of 5%. Units were
down 10%. On a constant dollar basis, beauty sales declined 10%, and fashion & home sales declined 12%. Adjusted
North American operating margin was negative 0.6%, up 60 basis points from the prior year, as we continued to benefit
from our cost reduction actions.
As we look ahead to 2015 for North America, we continue to expect the region to be profitable and show
improvements in the field. As a reminder, Q1 sales will be negatively impacted by the pull-forward of the President's
Club cycle into Q4 to align to the rest of the world's timing. And we may experience some margin decline, given the
small sales base in Q1.
In Asia Pacific, revenue rose 2% on a constant dollar basis. Active Representatives declined 5%, while units declined
1%. Revenue benefited from continued growth in Philippines of 5%, which benefited partially from the comparison
from a year ago, which was negatively impacted by Typhoon Yolanda. Adjusted operating margin was 6.2%, up 410
basis points. This was due to lower obsolescence costs, cost reduction actions, and lower bad debt expense.
Now, I'll take you through the five adjustments we made to our GAAP results in the quarter. First, we recorded a
non-cash income tax charge of approximately $405 million or $0.92 per share, primarily as a result of lower projected
foreign source income to be able to utilize the company's U.S. deferred tax assets. This was driven by the recent foreign
currency devaluations, which have lowered our profits from foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we're no longer certain we
can produce sufficient foreign source income to utilize the full amount of our U.S. deferred tax asset.
Second, we recorded additional CTI restructuring charges of approximately $38 million pre-tax or $0.06 per share,
primarily related to the company's $400 million cost savings initiative. Third, we recorded a net tax benefit of
approximately $19 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to the FCPA settlements. Fourth, we recorded a settlement
charge of approximately $8 million pre-tax, as a result of payments from the company's U.S. pension plan that I
discussed on our last call. And lastly, we recorded a $1 million charge for the leftover impact from the SICAD II
adoption in Venezuela.
Moving on to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities was $360 million for the 12 months ended December
31, 2014, compared with net cash provided of $540 million for the same period in 2013. Operating cash flow during
2014 was unfavorably impacted by lower cash related earnings, the $68 million fine paid in connection with the FCPA
settlement with the DOJ, and higher payments for employee incentive compensation. These unfavorable impacts were
partially offset by a benefit from the improved accounts payable.

In addition, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by comparing to the prior year, which included significant
payments for make-whole premiums on debt. Also note that after the end of the year, in January, we made a payment of
$67 million to the SEC in conjunction with the FCPA settlement. This represents the last of the payments we owe to the
government in connection with this matter.
In Q4, we continued to make progress on working capital, which operationally improved four days compared with a
year ago. Accounts payable improved 22 days operationally, as we continue to focus on re-negotiating payment terms
with our vendors. However, inventory was 19 days worse off operationally, largely due to Venezuela.
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect foreign currency to have a significant negative impact on results. As Sheri indicated,
we expect modest constant dollar sales growth, but currency could tamper reported sales growth by 12 points, based on
January spot rates. We also expect currency to reduce adjusted operating margin by approximately 350 basis points,
due to both foreign currency transaction and translation. We are working to mitigate the foreign currency transaction
impact through impact through price increases and incremental cost reduction actions. As a result, we expect constant
dollar adjusted operating margin to increase modestly. However, adjusted operating margin on a reported dollar basis
could be down, as much as 1 point due to the translation impact.
As I mentioned earlier, we don't estimate the below-the-line transaction amount while revaluing our working capital.
So any impact from that is not included in our outlook, and is not reported within operating profit.
In addition, we've not included any negative impact from the Brazilian IPI tax law change on cosmetics in this outlook.
In terms of a little more color, let me give you some things to consider. Given the rapid deterioration of foreign
exchange rate at the end of 2014, the currency comparisons are more onerous at the beginning of 2015, and then begin
to ease a bit in the second half.
In addition, the pricing actions and additional cost reduction efforts we are undertaking will take some time to benefit
results, and are more likely to benefit the second half. Also, remember that in the second half of the year we're lapping
the Brazil VAT credits that aided results in 2014. As it relates to Q1, as you know, this is our seasonally smallest
quarter and that may cause a greater currency translation impact on operating margin relative to the rest of the year.
With regards to cash flow, for the full year 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $125 million to
$150 million. And while we expect free cash flows to be lower than in 2014, we expect to generate free cash flows in
excess of $100 million.
With that, I'll hand it back to Sheri.

<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, I have two questions. So the first one is just on cash flow and how it relates to the debt
covenants, I mean I'm sure you guys have paid attention but the CDS spreads have widened considerably, and
obviously the EBITDA is going to pressured by the currency, so are you guys concerned at all, I know you said $100
million of free cash flow in 2015, but do you think there is enough cushion here to kind of stay underneath some of
those covenants? And then I have a follow-up please.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yes. Thanks, Bill. Yes, so free cash flow, I did say, would be in excess of $100 million, but
with regards to the covenants, the covenants as you all know are related to our revolving credit facility, and we don't
have any borrowings outstanding under that facility. And obviously we were in compliance with those covenants as of
year end, and whenever currency is impacting our profits, the calculations in those covenants are tied to our earnings,
and as we noted, 2015, we'll see lower margin because of the translation impact. So if not as high as it was, the
headwind isn't as high as it was prior to that currency headwind, so it makes it a little bit more challenging, but we're
watching it very closely.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. Great. And then, just a question on the guidance for 2015 on a local currency operating
profit growth, because if my math is right, I think you did 25% local currency EBIT growth in 2013, you did 33% this
year with the add-backs in the press release. So it seems like if you take your guidance, it suggests that in local
currency, the operating profit is only up very modestly. And I'm wondering why that would be the case?
<A - Robert Loughran>: In constant dollars, the operating – I'm sorry, I hope I got your question right, but in constant
dollars the operating margin we expect to be up modestly. The reason why it's only up modestly, as we have
experienced a lot of benefit from our cost reduction actions, but they're being impacted by – they're being offset now
with the foreign currency transaction impact which is hitting us fairly significantly at the end of 2014 as well, going
into 2015.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: My point, though, was that if you imply the local currency growth, it seems like – so even take
all the currency impacts out, it seems like you're sort of guiding to like mid-single digit-ish local currency operating
profit growth. And my point is, you did 25% in 2013, you did 33% in 2014, and it looks like the business is starting to
get a little bit traction, I mean we even know what the currency rates, but if you kind of strip that stuff away, it seems
like there's a little bit more momentum in the business. So I'm wondering if you perhaps view that sort of local currency
guide as conservative or not?
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yes. Well, I guess what I would say again is, to say whether it's conservative or not, we are
facing significant headwinds on the currency, which is impacting our operating profit. So that's really an inflationary
cost in the local market, as in the example of Russia, Russia is buying products from our Poland manufacturing site. So
it is costing them more in rubles than it had in the past, as the ruble declined. So that's impacting their operating profit,
in absolute terms even in constant dollars.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes, I think just to add to that, what we're seeing is, the transaction costs are much greater
and that flows through from a gross margin perspective. What we're balancing, Bill, and what we want to make sure we
do is, make sure we keep consumers with us and Representatives, so we're assuming we're taking a level of price, at the
same time we do feel really good about the cost that we've driven out of the business, we're going to continue to do
that, but we're trying to make sure we balance that.
So as we look at it, what we're basically saying is we're challenging ourselves to really make sure, we cover that
transaction cost, it's more difficult for us obviously to cover the translation cost, but we will continue to look at what
we can do to drive price either through mix or through actual price increases, and at the same time we're continuing to
drive the cost savings. The challenges of the transaction, when we look at the transaction cost year-on-year they've
increased more dramatically given the impact that we saw really coming through in December with some of the
devaluation.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Sure, with Citigroup. Could you talk more about the U.S. specifically and what gives you
confidence, your specific words were the U.S. will show improvement in the field, and does that mean that you think
you'll actually show growth in Rep count next year, but I guess what I'm struggling with is, in order to grow the Rep
count is it that you're going to retain them more effectively or recruit more and either way it strikes me that what you
need is more investment spending in the U.S. either in terms of promotions to pull them in or higher commission rates
or more advertising or more new products. So I'm curious what is going to change in the U.S. so that that Rep number
gets stronger particularly in light of a stronger employment picture in the U.S. where I would think people would be
going back and working full time and those sorts of things? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So our focus in the U.S. in 2015 is to be profitable, and so we've been very consistent
on that message and that's what we're working toward. As it relates to the Representative piece, we don't expect to get
to growth. What we expect to see is a less decline in Representative growth. What we've been very focused on is
making sure that we retain the Reps as they come in. Part of its challenge has been the experience and we have targeted
efforts against that. The other piece is that, we're looking at how we can get more money into her pocket, so that the
earnings per effort ratio is right. And so we've introduced additional funding opportunities for our leaders, so that they
can actually get more money more quickly as they come in to the business.
So those are the two things; it's retaining the people when they come in. We're able to bring people in. Our challenge
has been to keep them, and to make sure that people get earnings quick enough so that they stay with us for the
longer-term and so we can see where they fall out and we're making sure that we put efforts against those, that's
critically important for 2015 and beyond to make sure that we change that trend in the progression.

And your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks very much, it's Barclays. I'm wondering here a little bit about some of your,
call it, efforts to go from pure 'direct selling' to something of more of a social model, and, Sheri, you used that phrase
specifically already, but curious about the e-commerce, the new site in the U.S. for avon.com, if you are willing to
share what kind of growth you saw there, I think that's something about basically looks and sounds like a retail store in
Poland, I know it's staffed by reps, but kind of curious about that? And then also anything you're doing on mobile, so
have to think that that could also do a lot to help with Rep engagement? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Thanks, Lauren. One of the things that we see as an opportunity is also to make our
representative social seller and so what we've done is armed her with tools in the U.S. where she can use her own
e-store, and still a small portion today are using it, but we're seeing an increase there, so we're seeing more people come
online, we are in some parts of the world evaluating different ways where our sellers can have more of a retail approach
and that was the pilot that we have in Poland, where its actually Representatives and sales leaders running the stores, so
people can come in and do that and we continue to evaluate that.
I think mobile is the key to the future, we're launching that in the number of markets around the world, we're launching
it in the U.S. in the next month or so, which will allow our Representative to take an order when she is face-to-face
with customer, ideally, she can also have her customer put that into her phone and text it to the Representative or come
directly to Avon and she gets credit for that, so I think that's actually going to change the whole approach of direct
selling, I think direct selling is still alive-and-well, but I do think how women will interact and in some cases men will
be much more digital, so you have the opportunity to interact face-to-face, but you also have the opportunity to use
technology to do that, and I think that's a very positive thing.

It's something where, I think we try to go behind on, I think we've made tremendous progress in the last year, our teams
are all very excited about that and it's a matter of making sure that we have the systems in place to be able to do that.
The good news is we can buy a lot of that off the shelf and be able to do that without having to revamp all of our
systems, so we're making good strides there and I'm excited about some of the things coming in the U.S.

The next question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thanks, it's Wells Fargo. Guys, I think you mentioned that as you get to the back half of the
year, you lap some of the Brazilian VAT stuff. So I was hoping I guess number one can you talk about whether you
expect the VAT benefits to completely disappear in the back half of the year, and I guess how much of that is baked
into your operating margin view for the year? And then just as it relates to pricing in Brazil, all right, so it looks like
your beauty was – if Brazil beauty was flat in constant dollar, and if the VAT benefit was the same in beauty, it's like
down 5% even with Coty, so are you comfortable you can price there and not chase volume away.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So the first part of your question was on do we expect additional VAT?
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yes, as far as additional VAT, it's a very complex environment, so we're always working at
it, but with regards to our outlook we're not including any additional VAT in our outlook.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: And then as it relates to price, we did see positive performance with the Coty fragrances in
Brazil, obviously, one of the things that we have to watch very carefully in Brazil given the consumer environment is
how we can take price, I think what we've been able to do is look at our portfolio at different price points to make sure
that we have lower prices and competitive prices in certain categories and other categories like fragrance, particularly
the Coty fragrances we were able to take price.
We need to continue watching that particularly as the consumer is in some ways holding her a lot. As we talk to our
representatives, the good news is our representatives, we have a really strong field. What they worry about is making
sure that we have competitive offerings because the consumer is going to be much more thoughtful about where she's
going to spend her money. And I think that's going to be important moving forward.

The next question comes from Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Great. Thank you. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First, I just want to follow up on Brazil and
your plans on pricing and your expectation in terms of the impact to units, because [indiscernible] (58:04) reported last
night and saw pretty dramatic decline in units when they priced. And they tend to address a consumer that has a little
bit more disposable income than the average Avon customer, so just trying to understand the puts and takes there.
And then on the full year outlook for operating margin, the 100-basis point hit. If I understand this correctly, you're
assuming January rates for FX and FX has gotten worse in a few key markets, most notably Brazil. So can you give a
little bit more detail in terms of how you get to that down 100 basis points and up modestly in local currency? Thank
you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes. As it relates to the consumer in Brazil and the Representative in Brazil, I think as we
look at our portfolio, one of the things as we've started to see declines in consumer spending and consumer confidence
in fourth quarter last year, we actually went back and looked at our portfolio to make sure that we have the appropriate
size and price points at all different tiers within our personal care range, within our color range and that's really
important, so there are consumers that will pay up and that will continue to buy at the higher level and we saw that
through – as an example through Coty and some of our other products. But what's really important is we look at the
portfolio, that we're thoughtful about how we manage that, I don't think we can take price across the board, I don't think

that would be a smart thing to do, we have to look at it almost unit-by-unit and category-by-category to make sure we
understand where we can take price, we have good sense of elasticity and we're continuing to look at that, that's
something that will be very cognitive of as we move forward.
<A - Robert Loughran>: And on the currency, yes, obviously it's a process to come up with full year outlook, and so
we use some January spot rates, and yes I think there's been some movement, but we will update you as we go, so when
we're redoing forecast we'll come up with a new look in – if currencies continue in that direction that might impact us,
but we would update you when that happens.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys. I'm from Bernstein. So clearly there's lots of talk about the effect of currencies and the
negative effect, I think the clarification you guys give is really helpful, I think not just for you guys, but for other
companies as well, but doesn't it also boost your top line growth, so if you think about the 8% you got this quarter and
you strip out clearly Venezuela, which was – sounds like a big deal, surprisingly bigger deal than I thought. Russia,
may be some Brazil, and obviously if you pull out the VAT in Brazil, which is a separate issue than currencies, it
doesn't look like you would have grown much if at all and so is that a fair view, at least directionally a fair view that
there is also an offset of pricing to currencies, which you wouldn't done any way, in fact this quarter you've under
grown? And then continuing on currencies, do you get any relief on your debt covenants from currencies, because we
look at it – well, maybe I will ask this way, in your guidance, where do you see your debt covenants look at across –
throughout 2015, are you getting closer to, do you trip the 3.5 to 1 in particular covenant, given your guidance, maybe
I'll ask it that way? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So as it relates – and I want to make sure as it relates to the underlying health of the
business, I think is really where you're going with the first question, we feel good about the progress we've made,
particularly if you look at the top markets, what we are seeing is improvement in average order, I don't think that that's
all related to inflation because we obviously don't keep up with inflation. The area that we do see the inflation hit or
impact in a positive way is Venezuela and Argentina, not necessarily in some of our markets in EMEA as we looked at
that from a price mix perspective. So I think the underlying health of the business is moving in the right direction. We
need to continue to invest and make sure we get the balance right between price and keeping consumers and
representatives in the business.
Now, I'll turn it to Bob for comment on your question relative to the challenging economic situation the we're in as we
balance some of the currency headwinds.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yes, so, yes, the debt covenant calculations are based off of our reported dollar amount is the
basis to start with. And I just would remind you that the debt covenants are tied to the revolver and as of December 31,
right now, we don't have any borrowings under the revolver. And what I can say is we were in compliance with the
covenants as of the year-end. And as I mentioned before obviously when the earnings are declining and it's because of
currency here, it does make it a bit more challenging. So we will have a close eye on it as we move forward. But we're
still in compliance right now.

<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: BMO Capital. Good morning. You've mentioned the pending Brazilian tax increase a
number of times, and you're looking to offset it. But what is the order of magnitude impact as you see it now?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: We are still sorting through that, Connie. What we understand today it's more related to
some of the color products or cosmetic products not as much to fragrance. So we're still sorting through, it's almost a

line item by line that we're moving through and then understanding what the size of the challenges and then how we
would mitigate that. So our Brazilian team has been working over the last month really trying to understand that. In
fact, I was in Brazil and had the opportunity to meet with President Dilma on this topic and shared our concerns about
making sure that we were doing the right things to keep women engaged in the workforce and the opportunity to make
sure we're doing the right things.
So I think it's one of these things where the government is working with the industry there. We're continuing to look at
what the impact is on us right now. We see it more on the color franchises at least as we understand it. And we'll update
you. Obviously by next quarter, we'll have a much better understanding of where we are on this.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: So what percentage of your sales are color cosmetics in Brazil?

The next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Good morning, it's Stifel. I wanted to talk about free cash flow again a bit. So first of all
you had this big deferred income tax benefit in the quarter. So if my math is right, then would free cash flow have been
negative for 2014, excluding the benefit and then sort of looking forward, you've got $100 million plus in dividends
that you're going to pay out, yet the free cash flow is going to be about $100 million this year. You got a $250 million
debt payment due in March. I mean I guess I am sort of trying – March of the following year. I guess I am trying to
figure out as sort of how holistically we sort of think about free cash flow situation, are you expecting a pretty material
increase into 2016 that allows you to pay off the debt as well as continue to pay the dividend or is there some risk at
least in the short-term that you have to prioritize some of the use of the cash here?
<A - Robert Loughran>: So hopefully I'm getting the first part of your question right, but I think what you're referring
to with the tax item is the VAT taxes in Brazil. I'm not 100% sure, but if that's what you were referring to, it takes some
– we didn't get that in 2014 from a cash flow perspective because you're taking those credits, but then you're offsetting
those with future payments. So while we've got some of the benefits potentially in 2014 for some of the earlier ones, it
takes time to realize those benefits in your cash flow. And with regards to – what I did say was our free cash flow
would be in excess of $100 million. I didn't give any further guidance beyond that. And yes, so we do have our $250
million of debt that would be maturing in March of 2016 and our next big maturity would be in 2018. So, as I said, we
have $900 million of cash on our balance sheet. And overall what I did say was operating profit and cash flow is being
impacted by currency. That's going to take – it does take some time to get the pricing benefits over time to start
offsetting that. So, that would be as far as I can probably go on that.

And your next question comes from Steve Powers. [UBS Securities LLC] Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess just one point on housekeeping, then a real question,
maybe you said this, but could you clarify the low corporate costs again this quarter. It looks to me like they were
maybe $20 million short of what I was expecting. That would be great. And then I think this builds maybe on the first
part of Ali's question earlier. But one thing that stood out to me was the set against the better than expected organic
growth number this quarter. It was weaker volume performance at least that I was expecting and that was nearly across
the board. Europe was the one area where we saw better numbers and I think the conditions in the U.K. in particular
looked fairly stable. But I'm assuming you also got a lift there in Russia that probably won't sustain itself as prices rise

and newly signed reps potentially churn.
So can you talk about how you expect volume versus price mix to turn next year on a constant currency basis and what
another year of mid-single digit to high single digit volume loss implies about the strength of your business in 2016 and
beyond? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes. I think just a couple of comments, just as we look at the business, I think we are going
to always try to manage the price volume mix and particularly, as we look at the inflationary market we have to be
careful of that, I mean, if we look at Venezuela, we took significant price, and we saw dramatic impact on units, which
is the right thing to do, same thing in Argentina. So we're going to have some of that in our portfolio, I think what's
more important as we continue to look at our larger markets like Mexico, Brazil, Russia and making sure that we get
that balance right and be able to drive the business,
I think critically important both in Mexico, I would say all three of those markets our Rep base is strong, that's
important, if we need to make sure that we get the price and volume match in line with one another. So we are going to
continue to monitor that moving forward.
<A - Robert Loughran>: And on your question on corporate cost, I think you probably saw it also in the third quarter,
so we've done a lot of work to reduce our corporate cost, and as a reminder we did have the SMT cost in 2014 that we
didn't have in the back half of – I mean we had it in 2013, we didn't have it in the back half of 2014, but we also did
other things to reduce our corporate cost that continue to flow through in Q4.

And your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone, Consumer Edge Research. My question is for Sheri and it's more
kind of a longer-term kind of a strategic question. You got essentially you are losing distribution points, your sales
Representatives are declining at 4%, this is the worse I've seen. Beauty sales are flat and at the same time you have
beauty retailers like ULTA and Sephora growing at 15% and they already have $7 billion sales in the U.S. In Brazil,
you've got the industry growing at 14%.
So you comment that direct selling is well. And I don't know what makes you think that is well. And at the same time,
you already run out of savings because that $400 million in savings is in the base. So would you consider changing the
business model selectively? And are we going to hear something like that in the Analyst Meeting in May? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. I think there is no question that we see a lot more people going online for information
and for education around beauty as well as other areas. We believe that the opportunity for us is to continue to look at
how we build – as we build out our Representatives, getting them online, because that's where people are. What we still
see is that direct selling is growing, and if you look at Brazil 70% to 80% of all skincare and fragrance purchases, are
through direct selling. Is it getting more competitive? Absolutely. Do we need to understand how we reach consumers
in new and different ways? Absolutely. So we will continue to do that.
I think it's important that we make sure our core business and that we experiment and evaluate other things that it
makes sense though, the pilot program in Poland is a good example where we're just trying to get more access to
consumers through our Representatives. We will continue to do that, but I think it's important to also make sure that our
core business is on strong footing as we look at some of these other areas and experiment with some of these other
opportunities. And we will talk more about this, when we see you in May and some of the things that we're evaluating.
Thank you.

<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Hi, B. Riley. So, just going to North America again, it seems that there was a step back
in the improvement process and profitability in the fourth quarter, a little surprising given that your sales decline was
not as big, so is there something unusual in there in the fourth quarter that impacted profitability? And then in 2015,
how dependant is getting to profitability on the top line growth. So can you continue to decline double digit, but
through cost reduction you plan to get there, can you just give us a little flavor for that? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. One of the things we saw in North America is in fourth quarter, we had a very strong
holiday campaign and program, we also had some challenges with the ports shutting down, and we ended up having to
air-freight some of our products, and because we oversold or we had other challenges. So there was an impact as it
related to our margin on that. So that's what we saw there.
As it relates to the longer-term for North America, we obviously need to get our Active Representative count up. That's
important for us. We can achieve the numbers without it. We're very conservative about how we thought about the top
line for North America as we built the budget, but certainly longer-term we need to make sure we're continuing to
improve the Active Representatives, and that's really where all of our focus is for 2015.

And your next question comes from Michael Steib. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Credit Suisse. Good morning. This is a follow-up question related to the previous question,
Sheri. Given your confidence in your ability to return the U.S. to profitability this year, I wonder what the biggest
driver for that would be in your view. Is there a scope to take fixed costs down further or is it really a question of trying
to stabilize the top line and obviously improve the average order size as we go through the year? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes, well, certainly, we still have – we've taken on a major cost reduction program this
year. Some of it is still going through into 2015, so we still have – sorry in 2014, we took it on and it's still flowing into
2015. So we still have effort underway in supply chain and other areas in 2015, which allows us to continue to make
improvements in fixed costs.
Obviously, the most important thing is for us to be able to improve – over time is to improve the top line and the health
of the business, and that's why we're very focused and we've reallocated some resources against the Representative base
and looking how we drive that, and we will continue to invest behind avon.com and our digital marketing
opportunities, because we actually saw that as quite beneficial. Still it's off of a small base, but obviously that's an area
of opportunity for us going into the future.

And your final question comes from Steph Wissink. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Stephanie Schiller Wissink>: Thank you. Piper Jaffray. I just have a question on one of the controllable factors
in your model which is related to your commodity basket. How should we think about the benefits included in the
basket of commodities, as we look into your 2015 guidance? Thank you.
<A - Robert Loughran>: So, as we mentioned, so currency is having a big negative impact. We do are getting the
benefit from oil. The benefit from oil is included in our outlook, and it's not nearly as big as the headwinds we're
getting from foreign currency, but we have included that in our outlook, the benefit from oil.
