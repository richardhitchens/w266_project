MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Campbell Soup third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions
will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Gosnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Kenneth Gosnell
Thank you, Candace. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal
2016. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO, Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake
MacMinn, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. As usual, we created slides to accompany our earnings presentation.
You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to
the media who participate in a listen-only mode.
Today we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on
assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two or our SEC
filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in
forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure which is included in our appendix.

One final item. Before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to cordially invite our sell-side analysts and
institutional investors to our Annual Investor Day at Campbell's world headquarters. RSVPs are required. All others are
invited to join by webcast. This year's event will be held the afternoon of Wednesday, July the 20th. We will include
updates on our plans and key initiatives for the three operating divisions. We will also have time for interacting with
the management team. More details to follow on this.
With that, let me turn it over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll share my
perspective on our performance in the quarter and year to date.
As many of you are aware, the consumer environment continues to be challenging in many of the markets where we
have operations. In the U.S., consumer spending remains cautious. Shoppers are making more frequent trips than a year
ago, but they're purchasing less per trip. As a result, consumer takeaway of total food and beverage has softened
compared to both short-term and longer-term comparisons. This has exerted top line pressure on both retailers and
manufacturers. In other parts of the world, economic conditions remain volatile.
In the third quarter, our organic sales declined 2% which was below our expectations. Key factors that led to the
decline include softer than expected soup category performance, weakness in V8 beverages, and product shortages in
our Bolthouse Farms carrot business. I continue to be pleased with our adjusted gross margin expansion driven by
supply chain productivity programs despite the negative impact of the weather on our Bolthouse Farms carrot business.
Both our sales and the cost of carrots were adversely impacted by the poor growing conditions in California. Cold rainy
weather from mid-December through mid-March reduced carrot yields across the industry. The decreased crop yield
had a significant impact on our gross margin performance in the quarter. Both Anthony and I will discuss this later in
the call.
Third quarter adjusted EBIT declined but was better than we expected, reflecting improved gross margin performance.
The decline in adjusted EBIT was due to higher levels of planned spending, including the increased marketing
investments as well as higher incentive compensation costs and investments in long-term innovation. We expected that
our adjusted EBIT performance would taper in the second half, as we realized the benefits of our cost savings earlier,
cycled improved gross margin from a year ago, and implemented our plans to increase marketing investment in the
second half.
Now, let me share my view on our segment performance for the quarter. Let's start with our largest division, Americas
Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth consistent with the
categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter, predominantly
driven by US soup and V8 beverages. Our ready-to-serve soup business was challenged by a number of the same
factors we discussed last quarter; the mild winter weather which affected the entire category, the volume impact of our
pricing actions, and marketing execution on the Chunky brand.
We're realistic about these issues and have plans to address those things within our control for the next soup season.
Namely, we intend to do a better job of driving demand, particularly for Chunky ready-to-serve soups. We'll have a
more robust marketing plan that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We also recognize that we need to bring more
excitement to the category and we have new on-trend product innovations planned for fiscal 2017. We'll discuss these
plans in greater detail at our Investor Day in July.
There were several bright spots within Soup and Simple Meals. Sales of Swanson broth, Slow Kettle and Campbell's
Organic soup all grew. Also, Campbell's condensed soup gained share. Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well
driven by strong merchandising and growth in white sauces. We also began shipping Prego Farmers' Market, our new
premium Italian sauce with a clean label. Additionally, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum.

V8 beverages continue to struggle with sales declines in V8 Red, V-Fusion and V8 Splash. There was, however, some
good news, particularly in the performance of V8 Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy. In the short term, we've taken steps
to address the performance of V8 Red and have increased both TV and digital advertising specific to the V8 Red brand.
In the past, we've had success with advertising that reminds consumers of the benefits of V8. We're also building on the
successful launch of V8 Veggie Blends with new varieties and expanding our V8 +Energy carbonated beverages into
the grocery channel.
We recognize that these short-term actions are not the complete solution. That said, V8 is a great brand, and we believe
we have a solid platform to build upon going forward. We're in the process of finalizing our strategy, and we'll discuss
our longer-term plans to get this business back on track at Investor Day.
Overall, we feel good about how the Americas division is performing against its portfolio role year to date, especially
its continued margin expansion. Clearly, we have some work to do in several key categories to generate demand for our
products. We get it and we're on it.
Turning to Global Biscuits and Snacks, this division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and Kelsen businesses, and
its portfolio role is to manage growth while improving margins in both developed and developing markets. Pepperidge
Farm delivered modest sales growth while we experienced some challenges in our Australia and China businesses. The
two main drivers of the sales decline were Kelsen in China and Arnott's sweet biscuits in Australia.
First, China; despite strong merchandising support and our improved marketing efforts heading into Chinese New
Year, sales were below expectations. We experienced short-term distribution challenges and faced strong competitive
activity. Let me explain.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we made changes to our business model, adding salespeople and changing
distributors. This new go-to-market model is designed to improve execution while enabling us to increase distribution
into multiple cities in China over time. However, our new distribution system did not have the same reach as in the
past. In spite of the challenges we faced, Kelsen consumer takeaway and share increased in our priority markets. Going
forward, we'll need to supplement and expand our distributor network to increase our geographic reach. We're
confident that we'll get there and continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Kelsen in this important market.
In Asia-Pacific, excluding currency, sales of Arnott's biscuits were comparable to the prior year, with growth in
Indonesia offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, we faced competitive pressure in the sweet
biscuit category and experienced lower consumer takeaway on special varieties of Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, which
had a negative impact on sales. On the plus side, our savory biscuit business performed well, and we're encouraged by
the launch of our new and improved Arnott's Shapes crackers. While small, our developing markets in Southeast Asia
performed well. Excluding the impact of currency, we grew sales in both Indonesia and Malaysia double digits. As
expected, the economic situation in Indonesia started to improve in the quarter.
Turning to North America, Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers continued to perform well, driven mainly by
Goldfish crackers. Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business as we faced increased competition in the quarter.
Moving on to Campbell Fresh, C-Fresh is anchored by Bolthouse Farms and also includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and
our refrigerated soup business. This division's portfolio role is to accelerate sales growth and expand into new packaged
fresh categories. The CPG portion of this business is the full-force growth engine of the division. Reported segment
sales increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 4%.
In the quarter, Bolthouse Farms was a tale of two cities. Solid performance in our CPG premium juice and salad
dressing business was more than offset by significant declines in our farm business, which consists of carrots and carrot
ingredients. As I mentioned earlier, the carrot supply across the industry was negatively impacted by the adverse
weather in California. This led to product shortages and product allocation to customers, and we were unable to meet
market demand. As a result, our carrot sales were down double digits in the quarter.
This weather pattern is irregular. As we looked back, the Bolthouse Farms carrot business experienced similar weather
conditions in the winter of 2010 to 2011. Since then, we've significantly diversified our winter crop into multiple

growing regions in California, Arizona, and Georgia. Today, we're much better equipped to respond and have reduced
our recovery time. We're currently back in full supply with customers and don't anticipate any material sales impact
going forward, as we're now in the prime growing season in California.
Turning to the CPG side of Bolthouse Farms, we're pleased with the 8% sales growth we delivered in the quarter. As
expected, this growth was driven by distribution gains and our spring innovation. We added 14 new items across ultra
and super-premium beverages as well as salad dressings, which increased double-digits. We're also pleased with the
performance of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, our ultra-premium cold-pressed organic juice line. We achieved 50% ACV
in less than 12 months, enabled by our investment in expanded capacity. Due to the success of our spring innovation
sell-in, we're well positioned for fourth quarter as we look ahead to fiscal 2017.
A quick word on our Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, from an integration standpoint, we continue to make progress
on bringing the business into the Bolthouse Farms operations platform, and we've expanded fresh salsa distribution. We
remain very optimistic about the potential of this brand.
Before wrapping up, I'd like to share my thoughts on our year-to-date performance. Year to date, organic sales are
down slightly, 1%, in what continues to be a very challenging consumer environment. We're clear-eyed about the
factors impacting our top line and the actions we need to take to address them. We can and we must do better on
driving profitable net sales growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and next fiscal year, we expect to grow organic
sales.
Our year-to-date adjusted EBIT increase of plus 15% reflects our improved gross margin performance and the benefits
of our $300 million cost savings initiatives, including our move to zero-based budgeting.
As we focus on finishing the fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making, how we've performed year to
date, and our outlook for the full year. This is reflected in our updated guidance, which Anthony will discuss shortly.
We've made many important changes to Campbell: completely redesigning our organization; setting up the company by
category versus geography; and assigning each division a clear portfolio role. We continue to remain focused on
strengthening our core business and expanding into faster growing spaces as we unleash the power of our purpose, real
food that matters for life's moments.
Overall, we're now better positioned to execute our strategies, invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest
profitable growth potential, and increase shareholder value. We're proud of the progress we've made, but we know we
have more to do.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.
Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Thanks, Denise, and good morning.
Before getting into the details, I wanted to give you my perspective on the third quarter. Organic sales in the quarter
were below our expectations, reflecting softness in U.S. soups, V8 beverages, and the weather-related crop yield issue,
which negatively impacted our carrot sales and earnings. We continue to make progress on adjusted gross margin. It
improved by 40 basis points, better than expected, benefiting from our supply chain performance and moderating cost
inflation despite the weather-related yield issue on carrots. The carrot issue negatively impacted sales by approximately
$14 million and our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points or $0.02 per share.
We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives, which delivered approximately $30 million of
savings in the third quarter, with these savings impacting multiple P&L lines, bringing the year-to-date total to $110
million. Program to date, we are now at $195 million in cost savings.
With one quarter to go, we are updating our guidance. We are holding the sales range, narrowing the adjusted EBIT
range, and raising the adjusted EPS range to reflect our current outlook for adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted tax rate.

Now I'll take you through the detailed results and guidance. For the third quarter, net sales on an as reported basis
declined 2% to $1.87 billion. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net
sales also declined 2% driven by lower volumes. Net price realization was comparable to the prior year with higher
selling prices offset by increased trade promotions.
Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $312 million, reflecting higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, higher
administrative expenses and lower volumes, partly offset by a higher gross margin percentage. Adjusted EPS decreased
2% to $0.65. For the nine-month period, net sales on an as reported basis were down 2%, while organic sales decreased
1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of $1.214 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.48 both increased by 15%.
Year-to-date earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross margin performance and benefits from our cost
savings initiatives.
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported net sales and organic sales both declined 2%, as the
one-point negative impact of currency translation was offset by the one point benefit from the acquisition of Garden
Fresh Gourmet. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted two points, which was primarily driven by declines in
V8 beverages and soup within the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment, as well as the lost carrot sales in
Campbell Fresh. Higher selling prices contributed one point of sales growth, while higher promotional spending
subtracted one point.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 40 basis points to 37%, exceeding our expectation on overall supply
chain performance, despite the weather-related carrot issue. Cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin
impact of 1.6 points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which as a rate, increased by approximately 1%, and the
increasing carrot costs previously discussed. In aggregate, our net price realization reduced adjusted gross margin by 20
basis point as higher promotional spending in the quarter to support U.S. soup, Global Biscuits and Snacks and
Bolthouse Farms beverages was mostly offset by list pricing actions previously taken across several businesses. Mix
was slightly favorable adding 10 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs which are incremental to
our three-year cost savings program contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter.
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising and consumer
promotion expense. Advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by
increases in Pepperidge Farm and V8 beverages. Adjusted administrative expenses increased 4%, primarily due to the
higher incentive compensation cost, inflation, increased costs to support long-term innovation and the acquisition of
Garden Fresh Gourmet partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives.
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating
performance and below the line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 compared with the prior year
from $0.66 to $0.65 per share. On a currency neutral basis, declines and adjusted EBIT had a $0.03 negative impact on
EPS. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly,
but had no impact on EPS for the quarter and net interest expense was comparable to prior year levels.
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, down 3.1 points versus the prior year primarily due to the lower than
expected taxes on foreign earnings, partly offset by the geographic mix of our earnings with a higher proportion of
income in the U.S. The lower tax rates benefited EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the
quarter completing the bridge to $0.65 per share.
Now, turning to our segment results, in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 2% to $999
million, driven by declines in soup and V8 beverages partly offset by gains in Prego Pasta sauces and Plum products.
Operating earnings increased 1%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement,
partly offset by lower volumes and increased advertising expenses. In total, U.S. soup sales declined 5% driven by
category declines, which, as Denise mentioned, were primarily impacted by warmer weather compared to the year ago
quarter, the impact from our pricing action and marketing execution issues on Chunky. Although our pricing actions
had a negative impact on volumes, they have contributed to improved profitability.

Within U.S. soup, RTS declined 13% and condensed declined 4%, partly offset by 10% gain in Swanson broth.
Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully impact sales in the quarter. As we've previously
stated, we will not be providing this subcategory sales performance beyond this fiscal year.
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period
ending May 1, 2016, the category as a whole declined 2.4%. Our sales in measured channels declined 3.5% with
weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share,
a decline of 70 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players
collectively had a share of 29%, up 50 basis points reflecting share gains by smaller brands.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales decreased 1% with declines in Kelsen, partly offset by gains in Pepperidge
Farm Goldfish crackers and soups and beverages in Australia. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation,
sales from Arnott's biscuits were comparable to the prior year with gains in Indonesia offset by declines in sweet biscuit
varieties in Australia. Operating earnings decreased 8%, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation cost and
the negative impact of currency translations.
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 4% with declines in carrot, partly offset by gains in Bolthouse
Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition,
Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 10 points of sales growth to the segment. Operating earnings declined 28%
driven by the higher carrot cost. Excluding the negative impact from the carrot issue and the acquisition, operating
earns for C-Fresh in the quarter would have increased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite the negative
impact in the quarter, year-to-date operating margins in C-Fresh have increased by one percentage point.
We had strong cash flow performance for the first nine months. Cash from operations increased by $212 million to
$1.183 billion, driven by higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements especially in the area of
inventory. Capital expenditures decreased $17 million to $225 million. We continue to forecast CapEx of
approximately $350 million for fiscal 2016. We paid dividends totaling $294 million, reflecting our current quarterly
dividend rate of $0.312 per share.
In aggregate, we repurchased $118 million of shares in the first nine months, $75 million of which were under our
strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based
compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $250 million as positive net cash flow generated by the business
more than offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Now I'll review our 2016 outlook. Our sales guidance remains unchanged at minus 1% to 0%, including a one-point
benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and a two-point negative impact from currency translation.
We're narrowing the range for adjusted EBIT, which we now expect to grow 11% to 13%.
The year-over-year growth reflects the benefit of improved gross margin performance and the benefits from our cost
savings initiative. We expect adjusted gross margin for the year to expand by approximately 175 basis points to 200
basis points. We're increasing the adjusted EPS growth range to 11% to 13% or $2.93 to $3 per share in line with EBIT
growth. Reflecting lower taxes on foreign earnings, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately
32%.
Against our cost savings program and consistent with our prior forecast, we expect to deliver incremental savings in the
range of $120 million to $140 million in 2016. Our 2018 annual savings target remains unchanged at $300 million.
That concludes my remarks and now let's turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is
now open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great, thank you and good morning, everyone.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, David.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hey, David.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: I just wanted to ask a question about the cost savings program. I think the original
expectation was to take half of the savings from the program and reinvest back in the business. And I think you guys
have said a number of times that the savings have just come in faster than you originally anticipated. So maybe you're
not at the pacing of putting a full half in. So is it right to think, going forward, that the bulk of the 2017 savings should
get reinvested back into the business, Denise? And this would, number one, give you the fuel to reinvigorate the top
line; and then number two, would just marry up to that big picture comment about 50% reinvestment? Can you just
comment on that?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, the cost savings program is giving us the financial flexibility to reinvest back in the
business to jump-start top line growth. We're being very choiceful about these investments, and they're predominantly
going after new product launches, such as you started to see in the third quarter our C-Fresh innovation, new Shapes in
Australia, Prego's Farmers' Market, and we're introducing a Plum organic baby formula. And we'll continue to support
those new products into next year and announce some more at our Investor Day. A lot of the money is going to make
sure that we have support of our key brands in line with the portfolio roles in each division.
One thing that is new is we are channeling some of these dollars into longer-term innovation so that we make sure we
have a robust pipeline in a state of readiness. And then finally, we're reinvesting it to build capabilities in things that we
see coming into the industry such as digital and advanced analytics. So our intention is definitely to reinvest some of
this money to drive top line growth.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Just one follow-up, did the pacing of the cost savings change at all, Anthony? Is
your forecast for the year still the same?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yes, David. So in the last quarter we talked about $120 million to $140 million
incremental for this year. We're at about $110 million year to date. So we've got a little bit to go, but we are certainly
well ahead of our initial expectations, both in the total amount and the timing. And I think if I can get to the essence of
your earlier question, with the target going up to $300 million, and a significant amount of savings still to be achieved
in fiscal 2017 and 2018, we will work and continue to target our long-term targets in terms of sales, EBIT, and EPS
growth in fiscal 2017.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi. I think the gross margin guidance for the year was, I think, up 175 basis points as of last
quarter. And Anthony said now 175 basis points to 200 basis points for the year. So I'm just trying to get a sense of
what the key change there was. I know volume in the quarter wasn't necessarily where you wanted it. So I'm trying to
get a sense of what's driving that upside. Thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Sure. Andrew, it is primarily coming out of our supply chain, which continues to
operate extremely well, if you look across the number of metrics there. All of our plant efficiencies are up. The plants
are running more effectively than they did last year. And we continue to see significant savings in the area of
transportation and warehousing. And just to give you a couple of KPIs, our inter-plant shipments are down versus a
year ago. The amount of times we reach into the spot market for freight purchases is basically at zero compared to a
significant amount last year. Our truck weights are up this year versus last year. Our miles traveled are down versus
year ago, and all of these things are just yielding really good results coming out of supply chain and continue to exceed
our expectations
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
<Q - Evan Morris>: Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, Bryan.
<Q - Evan Morris>: It's actually Evan on for Bryan. Just following on David's question, just about reinvesting back, I
guess I'm still struggling here. So promotion spending was up in the quarter, marketing was up in the quarter, but
organic sales were down. I guess, Denise, you started out your prepared comments talking about the challenging
operating environment. So I guess I'm still unsure how just the planned reinvestment is going to drive the top line and I
guess starting in 4Q. So if you can just – I guess within the context of the operating environment, I guess the question is
why? Why should we expect sales to return and how, I guess, starting as early as the fourth quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It seems like it's an equation but it isn't because the places where we experienced the sales
decline were not necessarily the places where we invested the A and C and the T, so let me explain. I talked about the
sales decline being due to three factors: one being predominantly RTS soup; the second being V8 beverages; and the
third the unfortunate situation we had in carrots with the shortage of organic carrots.
The investment that we made was on different things. So we invested A and C, advertising and consumer, in our Global
Biscuits and Snacks business against: Shapes in Australia, which worked; Tim Tams in Australia, which didn't work;
and our cookies and bakery business and Goldfish in Pepperidge Farm, which did work. We invested advertising and
consumer in V8, but we focused it on the Veggie Blends. And that worked, but what we realized is that we had to put
more emphasis going forward on V8 Red, and we're of course correcting there.
We also spent predominantly promotion spending on our Campbell Fresh new product launches, and that is going
incredibly well. And then finally, we spent money against Prego in Simple Meals, which also had a very good quarter.
So, we do believe in the investment of A and C in this business and with trade spending, it was up against the Arnott's
business that I just talked about; Goldfish, and C-Fresh new products. On a year-to-date basis, trade spending is down
5%, and about 0.3 – it's down 0.3 points versus a year ago on a rate basis.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So just to add to that, there are a couple of issues that we believe are temporal in the
quarter and a bit unusual. One is certainly the impact of the carrot yield issue, which was impacted our sales by almost
a point negatively and also the category declines in soup, as Denise mentioned earlier, impacted by the warmer
weather. If we exclude those two items, sales would have been flat compared to year ago. So, we think a couple of
things happening in this quarter are not going to repeat themselves.

<Q - Evan Morris>: Okay, that's helpful. So it sounds like some of the things were more brand-specific or
category-specific. And as you're thinking about the challenging operating environment, particularly in the U.S., are you
seeing just broader levels of promotional activity. Do you expect that going forward or again, it's just really where you
are spending is really more category-specific behind some of these brands that need a little help?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We are in a situation in the industry, particularly in center store categories where growth
is hard won and it's very competitive and we expect that to continue.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you very much.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Rob.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. One question is on the fourth quarter implied guidance. It's a very wide range, Anthony. I
wanted to know why so wide? What are the factors that could go either way? Second, are you giving fiscal 2017 and
2018 guidance today? I thought I heard you say that you expect to be on your long-term algorithm. Maybe I
misunderstood. Thanks.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yes. So just to clarify that, I said we aspire to achieve our long-term target in fiscal
2017. We'll give more specific guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. In the terms of the implied range, it
does obviously have a $0.07 delta in the fourth quarter. I think for perspective we've had a bit of challenge forecasting
our year. As you know, we've taken the guidance up a couple of times already. We've just gone through massive
change here at the company, probably the largest transformational change in the company's history, in terms of
reorganizing into three divisions, addressing spans and layers, and the voluntary head count reduction, involuntary head
count reduction, the adoption of zero-based budgeting and changing many of the policies we have at the company,
changing our operating model and forming an integrated global services function. And given the amount of change, it's
just been really difficult, or more difficult than usual to forecast. So we're just giving ourselves a little bit of latitude
here in fourth quarter in terms of where we're going to come out.
Some of the variability will likely be in gross margin. That 25 basis point range can take you from the top of the EPS
range to the bottom. Cost savings could be a little bit variable. We feel pretty confident we'll see some organic growth
that's at the top line.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. I just want to ask a question in relation to the market share declines in soup, but I
know we've talked about soup generally – you've talked about soup generally and some of the challenges, particularly
in ready-to-serve. But condensed was down as well and that's the part that I was surprised by. And I guess in relation to
that, I'm just trying to understand when you think about the incremental marketing and, for example, in this quarter in
promotional spending. As you look ahead, is it designed to try and narrow that market share gap in soup? Is that

something that you're trying to work against here in the short run and we could see some improvement in early next
soup season?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: As I look at it, for the quarter, condensed was down but on a year-to-date basis,
condensed is actually up in share. Broth was up 10% for the quarter and pretty flat, by gaining consumption and
gaining share. Our issue really is RTS. And I look at myself in the mirror on this one. It was bad execution on Chunky.
We had lack of compelling advertising. We didn't leverage our partnership well with the NFL. We had a label issue in
the first quarter which cost us sales, but the good news is that these are all execution issues within our control and we
are actively addressing them. So I believe that if we keep supporting this core business and we get our act together on
Chunky, we'll be in pretty good shape going forward.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Just to add to that, one of the things we did in RTS was we made a pretty significant
move on our promoted price points which we hadn't done in over a decade. And we felt it was really important for the
category and for our profitability to make that move. We knew it would have a negative impact on buying. We're
seeing that come through and we knew it would have a negative impact on our share performance, and again, we're
seeing that come through as well.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think also too, you'll start to see more of a steady stream of innovation in the core soup
category.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And just on that point, Anthony, in terms of the raising promoted price points, is
that something that you can sustain, or is competition not allowing for that in ready-to-serve?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: We intend to sustain that.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hi.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Ken.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hey, good morning everyone. Anthony, you said that excluding, I guess, the carrot and
weather generated soup issues, sales would have been flat this quarter. I get it. That makes sense, but it still implies like
a two-year stack number of minus 1%. So I guess when I'm looking at your four quarter guidance, are you looking for –
and just to confirm, and if you said this already I apologize, but just to confirm are you looking for – it seems to me like
at least positive 2% roughly on organic basis against what would be a positive comp. So I'm just curious; A, is my math
right on that? And B, just to go back on some of the questions that people have asked already. Doesn't that sort of imply
a little bit of a sequential improvement in sort of run rate organic growth, excluding some of the items you talked
about?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Sure. Let me give you a little more detail on the fact. So, before I get to the organics,
just building up to the sales in the fourth quarter. So year to date, currency has been minus two points. In the fourth
quarter it's going to be more modest, likely a minus one. The other thing is the impact on Garden Fresh Gourmet in our
fourth quarter, which is seasonally low, it'll probably have closer to a two-point positive impact than a one-point
positive impact. So net-net, that's a positive one point. And if we can do plus one point in organic, that gets it to a plus
two point. So that's what we're thinking about. So it doesn't have to be a two point organic, just has to be a one...
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: ...point to get to the bottom end of that range.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey good morning, folks.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Jason.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Real quick clarification question, Denise, I think you said trade spend is down around 5% year
to date, but when we look at the promotional line in terms of sales drivers, it's neutral year to date. So what else is
driving the offset to trade spend reductions?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I don't remember you saying that. I think in dollar terms, trade spend is fairly
comparable to prior year. And I think on a rate basis – let me look that up real quick here – relatively flat on a total
company on a rate basis.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. Then let's delve a little bit deeper in there. I know you guys set up a revenue management
team earlier this year. It's probably still early innings, but there was an objective coming in to be able to find some
opportunities from efficiencies there and reverse what's been sort of a long-term trend of promotions being a drag on
sales. Where do we stand? You sort of have progress out of the gates. We've unwound some of that progress. Have you
found sort of your efforts on that front to be futile or as we think forward, is there still opportunity and can we expect to
see it start to bear fruit as we go into next year?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We look at trade as part net price realization. And to that end, with our creation of the
integrated global services, we have beefed up our revenue management group and are working on advancing our
analytics. To be able to do a couple of things, first of all make sure that we are optimizing our pricing; second, make
sure that we are maximizing the return on our trade investment as we continue to work through programs on our brands
with customers. If we do see opportunities to be more effective and efficient, we will do so. I'm as much for working
with the numerator as the denominator.
<Q - Jason English>: That makes sense.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I'll just add to that. We are seeing benefits from our revenue management initiative. It
led to the pricing actions we took on soup last year. It led to the changes in promoted price points. It led to the pricing
on Prego. It led to the some of the pricing in some of our other businesses around the world and we'll continue to focus
on it going forward. I think just one more comment in terms of the quarter, a lot of what you're seeing in the quarter is a
result of timing. A lot of the cost savings came in the first half and we had re-phased some of the marking out of the
first half and into the second half. So I think it's probably appropriate to judge us on our year-to-date results which we
feel really good about.
<Q - Jason English>: Makes sense, thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.

<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Denise, I'd like to ask about promo
spend in baking and snacking. It's been segmented where you had reduced promo during the first half of the year and it
looks as though you reversed course this quarter. How much of this is really just a comparison issue against the pacing
of last year versus maybe relative to deeper change of course going forward?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that promotion spend is really important. In the baking and snacking area, in the
United States we've been really focused on a couple of brands, one being Goldfish, which has performed very well, and
the other being Milano. I do think that there will be a cadence that's worked throughout the year, but promotion is an
important part of the mix for that particular business for impulse sales.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Okay. And then just in terms of the volume prospects there, you were lapping
some pretty hard comps earlier this year. But how do you think about the base Pepperidge business going into fiscal
2017 and on the competitor front as well?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you clarify?
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Yes, in terms of the volume prospects for the segment going forward, I think you
had lapped some pretty hard comps in the first half of this year which depressed volumes. But as you get into easier
comps back half of this year, some of the innovation rolling out in Goldfish, how are you feeling about the volume
prospects in the business as you move into fiscal 2017?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: And you're talking specifically about baking and snacking?
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Yes.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Pepperidge Farm.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Pepperidge Farm. I think that you'll get a glimpse of their plans in July, but it's shaping up
to be a pretty strong plan. And we'll continue to work on, like I said, on Goldfish and also on the cookie business as
well. I don't know what else I can say about that at this point.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Great, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: I just was hoping to get a little more color on the top line and some of your outlook there. You
mentioned, just in general, the cautious consumer spending and soft trends. But can you dissect that a little bit because
certainly there are categories and companies that have very strong top line growth and there's minimum wage increases
and low end wages that are on the upswing? And so is that more big food or center store specific, or do you think that's
a macro issue?
And then related to that on pricing, obviously Walmart had very strong numbers driven by price investments, and
presumably they're funding a good bit of that. But are you seeing pushback on pricing from the trade and are you able
to get pricing through, or how do you see the outlook there?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: What we're seeing, we're seeing in terms of performance in the marketplace. The
shelf-stable businesses, we're tracking them. The shelf-stable businesses are pretty mixed with more robust sales
growth in the Simple Meals area, and then there are a number of categories who are below the average. And so
refrigerated is doing a lot better, so the Fresh business and frozen, more categories are down than up. And so we have

done an analysis on trips. And like I said, there are more frequent trips being made versus a year ago, but shoppers are
buying less overall units, and that seems to be across all of the categories. And so we are noticing that behavior. We
don't really talk about specific customers, but I think in general, we've been able to execute our pricing in the
marketplace.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: And I didn't expect color on Walmart in particular, but just pushback from the trade. In
general, you're seeing – that pricing outlook environment looks constant?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's just been such a long time since we've increased prices on our products that we were
able to establish them in the marketplace. And we're still promoting the products and working with the customer on
their plans.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: And when you say across categories, are you referring to grocery specifically, or do you get a
read through things like channels shifting say even to Amazon or other non-traditional channels?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We track about 38 categories in Simple Meals and across the center store, refrigerated,
and also in frozen, so that we can get an idea for the cadence of the industry and how we're performing within that
cadence.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: That's where, in grocery?

Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning, Alexia.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: So can I just ask I guess a soup question? It seems to me that there are some smaller
challenger brands that are doing quite well in soups at the moment. You may think about Imagine obviously from a
much smaller base or even in the refrigerated section, Panera's chilled soup. How is that informing your innovation
pipeline? And also how is that affecting your relationship with the retailer, where you mentioned analytics a couple of
times are improving. Is there a sense that the retailers might be starting to tone down the category captain role in favor
of just using analytical algorithms to set the shelf space, now that these smaller brands do seem to be where the growth
is? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's absolutely true, and I think it's absolutely true in a lot of categories that smaller
challenger brands are growing faster off of a smaller base. And in the soup category, there are a couple that are growing
faster again, but they're much smaller. We also have some smaller parts of the soup business that are growing faster. So
for example, Slow Kettle was up 9% in the quarter and is up 50% year to date in consumption. And also Campbell
Organic is up 41% in the quarter and then a relatively new brand to the category. Those would be two examples and
there are a couple others as well. And our refrigerated soup continues to perform as expected, up 2%. So we are seeing
it and we believe that we need to participate in that.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: And then on the category captain role?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm sorry. I didn't understand what you mean by the role?

<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: The idea that the traditional category captain role that you've obviously played in soups
might be being replaced by just more analysis of the scanner data, particularly by the retailers, I mean. And maybe the
retailers are less dependent on you. How is that playing out?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We have just about 59% market share in the soup category. We believe that we have to
play in all segments and we are doing so. And we're working with retailers in the best way to manage the whole
category. So that has not changed.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Hi.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Good morning, everybody. Denise and Anthony, I just wanted to ask about the M&A
landscape. I know this comes up a lot. But you've always talked about being open to acquisitions, but approaching it
just generally with strategic and financial discipline. So I guess with that as the starting point, can you just give us an
update on the scale of opportunities that you're thinking about, whether the focus is more on bolt-ons and higher growth
adjacencies or whether you'd be open to larger, more transformational things that allow you to more aggressively use
the balance sheet now that you've de-levered a bit.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Matt, as we've said before we have a very disciplined approach to M&A. Anything we
do obviously needs to be strategically compelling and has to be financially attractive. And I'd say we're open to both,
both the idea of smaller bolt-on acquisitions that build upon our platform. For example, in Campbell Fresh or to expand
geographically, in Biscuits and Snacks. The overall list is relatively short. We continue to work it and develop
relationships with companies around the world, and in the U.S. On the other hand, we do have the financial flexibility
to do something a bit larger. So I think it depends more on the attractiveness of the opportunity first and foremost, from
a strategic and financial perspective and again open to varying sizes.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Are there any constraints that we should keep in mind, just in terms of leverage
or willingness to use equity?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: We don't have a specific limit in mind. I think the Bolthouse Farms' acquisition is a
good example where we took the debt to EBITDA up between a little over 3.5 times and paid that down pretty quick.
So again, we have quite a bit of financial flexibility.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: And would use it for the right opportunity.

down about 7.5 point, just for the third quarter, just back the past two years. And I'm wondering – I know costs are
down a fair amount in that time, and so I understand you've done a great job holding share in those categories. We're
mainly talking soup here, but what role do you think higher pricing across the category is having in sort of hurting the
volumes in soup? I know you maybe had some weather, but on a two-year basis, that's not really been the case, some
weather this. Going forward now that costs are rising a little bit more, is that going to change your philosophy in
thinking about how you balance price and volume in Americas Simple Meals? Thanks very much.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Jonathan, I'll start. I'd say on the cost side, you said they're rising a little bit more.
We're seeing moderating cost inflation, at least in the back half of this year and probably into next year. And that takes
a little bit of pressure off the pricing algorithm. Our objective is to expand gross margins through a combination of net
pricing and productivity in excess of cost inflation. So, as cost inflation moderates, that gives us a little more flexibility.
There's no question that if you look back over the last couple of years, we have moved up some of our net pricing
books, list and promoted, in an effort to improve the profitability of the soup business and in fact, we've done that quite
successfully. Now that does have a short-term impact on volume. You know, longer-term we like to think that in the
broad basket of things that'll drive consumer demand, things like product quality and innovation and robust marketing
are all part of that algorithm to drive volume growth over the long-term.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Okay. Just to clarify that, you're saying costs are up over the past two years in Americas
Simple Meals?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Looking backwards or looking forward?
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Looking back – versus fiscal 2014, looking right now, you are saying costs – say input
costs are up over that period of time for you?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah. Yeah.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Okay. I'll follow-up offline about that. Thank you.
