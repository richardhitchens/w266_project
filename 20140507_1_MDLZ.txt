Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. When we launched Mondelez International in October 2012, we set out to create a
global snacking powerhouse that would deliver top-tier financial performance and be a great place to work. Since our
launch, we've made good progress in many areas. We've grown our market shares, fueled by investments behind our
Power Brands and innovation platforms. We've strengthened our geographic footprint and route-to-market capabilities.
We've stepped up cost reductions in both our supply chain and in overheads to drive margin expansion. And we've
strengthened our balance sheet while significantly boosting cash returns to shareholders through both share repurchase
and higher dividends.
But despite these many accomplishments, we're not where we should be at this point in our journey. The recent global
slowdown in our categories has tempered our near-term top line growth, as well as that of our peers. This slowdown
has made it imperative that we act more quickly and more aggressively to address the inefficiencies in our cost
structure. So today we're taking two bold steps, both to improve our near-term results and to increase confidence that
we'll deliver sustainable top-tier financial performance over the long term.
First, we're focusing our portfolio even further on snacks by combining our coffee business with D.E. Master Blenders
1753 to create the world's leading pure-play coffee company. Second, we're stepping up and accelerating our
cost-reduction efforts to deliver best-in-class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads. Together, these actions
will enable us to become an even more focused and nimble global snacking powerhouse, to achieve world-class
margins faster, to simplify how we work around the world, to speed up and clarify decision-making, and to generate the
fuel to invest more in our people, in our brands, and in our executional capabilities. All of this will help us deliver
superior returns to our shareholders.
I'll take the next few minutes to discuss these strategic initiatives in more detail. Let me start with the coffee
transaction. We intend to combine our nearly $4 billion coffee business with D.E. Master Blenders to create the world's
leading pure-play coffee company. This new company will have annual revenues of more than $7 billion and an
EBITDA margin in the high teens. It will bring together our portfolios of iconic brands, our complementary geographic
footprints, and our innovative technologies to transform two strong businesses into an even stronger one.
The combined company will feature our market-leading brands like Jacobs and Tassimo and Douwe Egberts and
Senseo from D.E. Master Blenders. The combined company, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts will have an
advantaged position in the $81 billion global coffee category, including leading market shares in more than two dozen
countries and a sizeable footprint in all key emerging markets. With greater focus and increased scale, the new
company can operate more efficiently and invest more effectively in innovation, manufacturing, and market
development to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in coffee.
When we close this transaction, we'll receive after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $5 billion and a 49% interest in
the combined company. Our partner, Acorn Holdings, is the current owner of D.E. Master Blenders and will have a
51% interest in the combined company, as well as majority of seats on the board. Acorn is owned by an investor group
led by JAB Holding Company, an investment vehicle managed by three highly respected senior partners with whom
we're delighted to team: Bart Becht, the former CEO of Reckitt Benckiser and current Chairman of D.E. Master
Blenders; Peter Harf, a former senior executive at InBev, Reckitt, and Coty; and Olivier Goudet, the former CFO of
Mars. Bart Becht will be Chairman of the new combined company. Pierre Laubies, the current CEO of D.E. Master
Blenders, is the prospective CEO of the new company. The other members of his leadership team will be drawn from
both coffee businesses using a best-of-both approach. The deal is expected to close in the course of 2015, subject to
limited closing conditions. During the interim period, both companies will undertake consultations with all works
councils as required.

We're delighted with this transaction and the substantial value we expect it to create for our shareholders. By retaining
a 49% stake, we'll continue to benefit from the future growth of the coffee category and share in the synergies and
tremendous upside of this leading pure-play coffee company.
We expect to use the majority of the approximately $5 billion of cash proceeds to expand our share repurchase
program, subject to board approval. The balance of the cash proceeds will be used for debt reduction and for general
corporate purposes. Let me assure you that while deploying the cash proceeds we remain committed to maintaining an
investment-grade credit rating with access to Tier 2 commercial paper.
In terms of our P&L, we expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing. In
addition to unlocking and creating significant value for our coffee business, this transaction will also enhance the
profile and prospects of our core snacking business. Once completed, approximately 85% of our net revenue will come
from snacks, up from about 75% today. Going forward, this sharper focus will help optimize our capital allocation,
including investments to drive growth of our global platforms and to expand routes to market. So that's the first part of
the news.
Now let's turn to the second part. We're taking actions today to accelerate and enhance margin expansion. Specifically,
we're fast-tracking our previously announced supply chain reinvention program and significantly reducing overhead
costs. As Daniel Myers explained last September, over the next three years, we expect to deliver $3 billion in gross
productivity savings, $1.5 billion in net productivity, and $1 billion in incremental cash. We've already made good
progress against those goals. We're on track to open our state-of-the-art biscuit facility in Mexico in the fourth quarter.
We've initiated significant projects in India, China, and Russia. We're expanding biscuit manufacturing in the Czech
Republic and investing in new biscuit manufacturing technology in the U.S.
In addition, we've made some tough decisions, to close or sell nine plants and streamline another 21. As a result, in
2013 alone, we've reduced head count in our supply chain by 3,000, plus another 1,000 contractors. All of these actions
will enable delivery of the benefits we previously outlined. We also laid out additional opportunities through 2020 to
manufacture more of our Power Brands on advantaged lines of the future, and to streamline our production base.
Today, we're taking steps to accelerate some of those projects. This will allow us to capture savings even sooner and
result in additional margin upside through 2018. With this accelerated program, we now expect our net productivity to
increase from the 2.3% we talked about in September to around 3% over the next few years.
With respect to overheads, as we discussed at CAGNY in February, we're committed to creating a leaner, simpler, and
more nimble organization by significantly reducing operating costs. Achieving best-in-class overhead costs across our
business is particularly important, given the near-term slowdown in the growth of our categories, especially in
emerging markets. In addition, the combination of our coffee business with D.E. Master Blenders allows us to create an
even simpler, more focused global snacking company.
To drive overhead savings, we're starting with a clean sheet of paper and employing a zero-based budgeting approach.
With the help of Accenture, we used ZBB analytical tools to look objectively at our overhead costs and compare them
to best-in-class external benchmarks. This has enabled us to question how, where, and why we spend our money.
While this certainly involves addressing head count, we're also targeting non-head count costs. The lowest-hanging
fruit is to look at our policies and practices across a dozen major cost areas, to identify changes that will help us to
quickly reduce costs in a sustainable way. As an example, our travel costs are significantly higher than peers. That's
partly because we travel more, reflecting the coordination necessary during the Cadbury and LU integrations, as well as
the startup of our new company. But it's also because we weren't effectively leveraging our scale with suppliers. If you
multiply that example to many other cost areas across our company, it adds up pretty quickly to some big savings.
To enable us to capture these savings in both our supply chain and in overheads, our board has approved a new $3.5
billion restructuring program through 2018, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in
non-cash costs. We expect to incur the majority of the restructuring charges in 2015 and 2016. Capital expenditures in
support of these programs are already included in our CapEx target of about 5% of revenues for the next few years. As
a result of this program, we expect to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018, with savings about

equally split between supply chain and overheads. With $1.5 billion of savings on $2.5 billion of cash costs, it's clear
that these projects have very strong returns, well in excess of our cost of capital.
The cost savings from this restructuring program will enable us to accelerate and increase our future margin expansion
plans. Specifically, we're raising the bottom end of our 2016 adjusted OI margin range so that we're now targeting 15%
to 16%, up from 14% to 16%. This improvement comes largely from greater overhead savings. After 2016, along with
continued improvement in overheads, we expect the contribution from supply chain to build. This will enable us to
drive further margin expansion beyond our revised 2016 target, while continuing to fund growth.
Taken together, the strategic initiatives we've announced today underscore our determination to become a leaner, more
focused, and more nimble global snacking powerhouse.
Let me now turn the call over to Dave to provide details on our first quarter results.
David A. Brearton
Thanks, Irene. As you'll see in the next few slides, we're off to a solid start this year. We're making meaningful
progress towards our margin goals while continuing to deliver growth and strong market shares. Specifically, our
organic net revenue growth was 2.8%, in line with the overall growth of our categories and within our 2% to 3%
guidance range for the quarter. On the margin front, we delivered a big increase in adjusted operating income margin,
up 140 basis points to 12.2%. And our adjusted EPS was $0.39. That's up 17% on a constant-currency basis and on the
higher end of the double-digit guidance we gave for the year.
Looking more closely at our revenue growth, pricing was the key contributor, as we began to implement price increases
in all of our regions and across most of our categories to offset higher input costs. Despite these pricing actions, we
were able to drive a modest increase in vol/mix. And while the shift of Easter was a headwind for the quarter, the
40-basis-point impact was lower than expected. Coffee remained a headwind with the pass-through of lower green
coffee costs tempering our growth by 60 basis points. Emerging markets were up nearly 7%, reflecting challenging
conditions in a number of key countries, while developed markets were essentially flat, growing 0.2%. Overall, our
Power Brands continued to drive our growth, increasing 4.8%. In particular, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Chips Ahoy!,
belVita, Tuc, Club Social, and Tang were among the best performers in the quarter.
Now let's take a closer look at our results by category. For the second-consecutive quarter, category growth was slower
than historical averages, with growth of only 2.8%. This was due in part to the Easter shift but also reflects continued
weak demand in emerging markets and lower coffee prices. With Easter occurring three weeks later than last year,
some consumer demand was pushed into the second quarter. However, revenue was less affected, as we started
shipping Easter-related products in March. This can best be seen in chocolate, where a 2.3% growth significantly
outpaced the category growth rate of 1%.
The ongoing global slowdown was the second factor that contributed to sluggish growth across most of our categories.
The good news is that our market share performance was solid, with over 60% of our revenues gaining or holding share
despite the price increases mentioned earlier.
A closer look at our categories shows that our biscuit performance remains strong. While 4.7% revenue growth in
biscuits was below the category rate, our overall share performance was strong, especially in North America and
Europe. The difference was solely due to our China business.
Turning to chocolate. Our Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka Power Brands each grew high single digits, fueling our
growth. In addition, over 50% of revenues gained or held share. Our share performance in India in particular was
strong, up over 2.5 points in a category that continues to grow about 20%. Our results reflect recent capacity
investments to support the tremendous growth in that market.
Turning to gum and candy, our revenues fell 2.1% as an increase in gum was more than offset by a decline in candy.
Our gum share performance continued to improve as we gained or held share in over half of our gum revenues.

In beverages, our revenues increased 2.3% despite the headwinds from lower coffee pricing. Although the cost of green
coffee has surged over the past two months from about $1.20 to about $2 per pound, those prices are not yet reflected in
the market. Input costs for the first half are still being covered at pre-spike prices. However, we recently announced
price increases in Europe that will begin to take effect in late Q2, so we expect higher pricing to be reflected in the back
half of the year. As for powdered beverages, category growth continued to be robust, with Tang up in the low 20%'s.
Let's now take a look at our regional results, where we delivered solid top-line performance in four of our five regions.
In Europe, while revenue fell 1%, coffee tempered growth by about 1.5 points. Vol/mix was up nearly a point despite
the impacts of the Easter shift and some short-term customer disputes as we took pricing. Over 70% of our revenues
gained or held share.
North America had another strong quarter, with revenue up 2.5%, fueled by 5% growth in biscuits. Share performance
again was exceptional, with over 85% of our revenue gaining or holding share. Gum in the U.S. was up over a point.
In emerging markets, as expected, we experienced some share dislocations, as consumers adjusted to our higher
pricing. As a leader in our categories in many of these markets, we're typically one of the first to price in response to
higher input costs. Input costs began to creep up at the end of last year, especially in dairy and cocoa, and in many
emerging markets, weaker currency further magnified this impact. As a result, we began to price aggressively early this
year. In some cases, competitors have been slow to follow, resulting in share dislocation in some key markets. We
expect this to be temporary as competitors ultimately price to offset the higher input costs, which are common to the
entire industry.
Our EMEA region grew nearly 8%, with good contributions from both vol/mix and pricing. Russia increased high
single digits, driven largely by vol/mix. Coffee, biscuits, and gum drove the increase. Also in the region, the Gulf
states, Turkey, and Egypt all delivered strong growth. Not surprisingly, Ukraine declined double digits.
In Latin America, pricing, especially in the high-inflation markets of Venezuela and Argentina, drove organic growth
of 14.7%. But, importantly, Brazil was up high single digits. Powdered beverages and biscuits drove the bulk of the
revenue increase, while chocolate growth was modest due to the Easter shift.
Asia-Pacific was our lone lagging performer, down 2.7% for the quarter. As expected, China was weak, with organic
revenue down mid-teens, primarily due to biscuits. The issues we're working through in China are not new. We
expected China to be a drag in Q1 and through the first half as we lap last year's inventory build in support of our A&C
investment and the launch of Golden Oreo. While we continue to expect the China biscuit category to be soft for the
remainder of the year, likely growing in the low single digits, our revenue trends in the second half should improve as
we begin to lap last year's slower growth. In contrast to biscuits, gum in China continues to grow rapidly as we expand
distribution. Gum share is now over 7%, just a year and a half after launching in that market.
We're taking a number of steps to improve China's overall performance. Earlier this week, we hired Stephen Maher as
our new head of China. Stephen joins us from Carlsberg Group, where he was CEO of the company's China business.
In total, he has 16 years of on-the-ground experience in China, including stints at both P&G and Colgate. We're looking
forward to Stephen's leadership as he and his team get China back on a growth trajectory.
India continues to deliver strong performance. With our new chocolate capacity in place, we've been able to regain the
share we lost in the first half last year. Our beverages business, which is now a fifth of our sales there, was up
mid-teens. We continue to successfully expand our Tang business and increase support behind our top-selling chocolate
beverage, Bournvita.
Turning to margins. Adjusted gross margin was essentially flat at 37.1%, as gross profit grew 2.3% on a
constant-currency basis. Pricing fully offset commodity inflation in dollar terms, despite the fact that we've not yet fully
realized the impact of the pricing actions we implemented earlier this year. On a percentage basis, of course, the
denominator effect of this pricing pressured the gross margin percent. Net productivity was strong and in line with our
goal to deliver 2.3% of cost of goods sold this year. As a result, our gross margin percentage was essentially flat to
prior year.

In terms of adjusted OI margin, we jumped 140 basis points to 12.2%. Half of this gain was a direct result of our efforts
to significantly reduce overheads. The other half came from A&C, which was about 9% of net revenue. This compared
to last year's quarterly high of 9.6%, when we accelerated investment in China. To be clear, we didn't cut our base
brand support. We successfully lowered A&C costs through efficiencies, gained by consolidating our media accounts,
especially in EMEA, reducing non-working media spending, and continuing to shift towards more efficient and
targeted digital outlets. Consistent with our margin goals, we made great progress this quarter towards achieving our
adjusted OI margin targets in developed markets. Europe was up 130 basis points to 13.9%, and North America was up
240 basis points to 13.8%.
Moving to EPS. Adjusted EPS grew 17.1% on a constant-currency basis, driven by double-digit growth in operating
income. Below the line, the impact of having a more normal tax rate was a negative $0.06 impact, but that was partially
offset from $0.04 of favorability delivered through debt restructuring and share repurchases.
Before turning to guidance, I'd like to quickly update you on where we stand on cash flow and capital allocation. Our
approach to capital allocation remains the same. We'll continue to deploy capital to deliver the best expected returns,
whether it's reinvested in the business, M&A, reducing debt, or returning capital to shareholders.
With regard to free cash flow, we remain on track to deliver a two-year combined target of $3.7 billion. As you may
know, we tend to be free cash flow negative in the first quarter, as we rebuild inventories after seasonal lows at the end
of the year. At the end of Q1 this year, while inventories were unusually high due to the Easter shift, we were still able
to improve our cash conversion cycle by 17 days versus Q1 last year. In the first quarter, we returned more than $700
million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, we still expect to return $2
billion to $3 billion to our shareholders, including $1 billion to $2 billion in stock buybacks.
With respect to our debt, we were up about $2 billion versus year-end, largely reflecting cash returned to shareholders
and the working capital increase that I just described. In addition, we paid the taxes associated with the $2.8 billion
Starbucks award that we received in December.
Turning to our outlook for the year, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth that's in line with overall category
rates. However, as I described earlier, global category growth has slowed to around 3% over the last two quarters, due
largely to the weakness in emerging markets and lower coffee prices. We expect these trends will continue in Q2, likely
resulting in top-line growth similar to what we saw in Q1. In the second half, we expect the pass-through of higher
green coffee costs will benefit revenue, but we may also experience some disruptions to our top line as we implement
our strategic initiatives. As a result, we expect revenue growth to improve modestly in the second half. For the year,
then, we expect organic revenue growth to be in line with global category growth of about 3%. Importantly, though, we
remain confident in our profit outlook. Specifically, we're confirming our guidance of double-digit adjusted OI growth
on a constant-currency basis, adjusted OI margin in the high 12% range, and adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78 on a
constant-currency basis.
With that, let me turn it back to Irene for some closing thoughts.
Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dave. So to sum up, the strategic and cost reduction [ph] and (27:12) actions that we announced today
underscore our determination to become a leaner, more focused, and more nimble global snacking powerhouse. As our
first quarter results show, we're making meaningful progress toward our margin goals, while continuing to deliver solid
growth and market shares. The actions we've outlined today will sharpen our focus on snacks, simplify our operations,
enhance and accelerate our ability to deliver world-class margins, provide the fuel to invest in our core snacking
business to drive top-tier growth, and position us to deliver superior returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane, with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I've got a question about the coffee business – the coffee transaction. I guess the first is just
simply, Irene, can you talk about the strategic rationale, and maybe more specifically, was it driven more by your view
of some changes potentially occurring in the coffee industry, or was it more specific to just how coffee fit in your
portfolio?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Actually, Bryan, coffee continues to be a very attractive category. It's growing – category
today within our portfolio. It's growing. It's got good margins. In fact, the margins are actually above our Mondelez
average, and we've seen terrific growth, as you know, in on-demand in particular. But we saw a unique opportunity to
combine our business, our very strong business, with the DEMB portfolio. And I really think the partnership is a
win-win. We received the upfront cash proceeds that we've described of approximately $5 billion after tax. We intend
to use the majority of that, as I said, for share buybacks, subject to our board approval. But the balance will be used for
debt reduction and general corporate purposes, while still maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.
We also, though, at the same time, received a 49% interest in a very attractive company. It's a leading pure-play coffee
company. It has a set of iconic brands with, as I mentioned, leading positions in over a dozen markets. It provides
greater global scale, and it's highly complementary in terms of the geographic footprint. Both businesses come with
some very unique technologies. Us, in R&G and on-demand; D.E. Master Blenders has strong technology in liquid
coffee. We're going to combine the best of both from a management team standpoint. We feel very good about our
partners, as I mentioned. They're highly respected business executives. And it gives us the ability to focus our snacking
portfolio much more directly, and ensure that we have the opportunity to optimally allocate our resources. So net-net,
this is the opportunity to take what is a strong business and make it even stronger, while creating great value for both
partners, I believe, as well as for our shareholders.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Thank you, and if I could just follow up. A question for you, Dave. In terms of just the value
of the deal, I think back of the envelope, if you get back a little bit less EBITDA than what you're contributing, but you
net the $5 billion of proceeds after cash, it's roughly somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 of incremental value
creation that we saw this morning. So I guess my question would be, is that the right way to think about how we should
be thinking about valuing the transaction? And then also, just connected to that, in terms of cash flow, with this
business going into JV, just what's the mechanism for the JV to kick the cash flow back to Mondelez? Thank you.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think on the valuation, you can look at it a lot of ways. I mean, truthfully, we're
putting in our business, and so it's more about the upside of the two businesses combined that's going to generate the
value for this business. I don't think – it gets kind of complicated when you talk about joint ventures, so I don't think
we'll get into that, but I think you've seen the multiple that Douwe Egberts Master Blenders was purchased at, and I
think, clearly, that was one of the considerations as we put our business into that.
In terms of cash flow, today the coffee cash flow obviously is part of our ongoing free cash flow. And as Irene
mentioned, the OI margin is above the average of our business. So it's pretty healthy cash flow. That we obviously lose.
We're going to pick up $5 billion up-front, and then the ongoing cash flow will come from dividends. And actually we
filed an 8-K this morning along with the press release, and you can see the dividend specifics in there. But it's a
relatively fixed amount for the first three years, and then it's tied to net operating profit thereafter. So we'll get a
dividend instead of the ongoing cash flow of our business. Clearly, that will be a lower number in aggregate, but we get
$5 billion upfront in cash.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Should we expect – I guess, on slide 12, you show the impact from the coffee transaction. First
off, I assume that's the impact of stranded overheads. And if so, it looks like you expect these accelerated cost saves
and [ph] GDB (32:58) and such will more than cover those overheads by 2016, but would we expect this to be a linear
path, or do margins need to take a step back in 2015, when these stranded costs come out, and may not be immediately
offset by the incremental savings?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think, when you look at that page, the red bar there, it isn't so much about stranded
overheads. It's just that, as Irene mentioned earlier, the OI margin on coffee is higher than the Mondelez average. So it
has a small decrement to our average OI margin. I think the stranded overhead piece is actually quite small. Most of the
people and the overheads that are associated with our coffee business today will transfer over to the new company.
There will be some stranded overheads, but it's relatively small, and it would be taken out through the restructuring
program that we talked about today as well.
As it relates to 2015 margins, we didn't give you a margin target for 2015 today, mostly because it's going to be tied
largely to the timing of the closing of the coffee transaction, and the progress we make on the works councils and union
discussions. But this year, we'll be in the high 12%s in our OI margin. In 2016, we'll be between 15% and 16%, and
we'd expect to make measurable progress towards that 2016 goal next year. So it's hard for me to give you guidance
specifically on 2015, given some of the timing things that I can't predict today, but we'll make measurable progress.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: That's very helpful. And then, the one thing that surprises me, I guess, about your comment
about stranded overheads is, that was always one of the, I think – or one of the reasons that was always given as to why
it was important that coffee and grocery, I guess, to an extent, be part of Mondelez. It's for that scale impact and the
covering of fixed costs and such, in that European region. And so I guess I would have thought, by parting with that,
there would be a bigger headwind, right, to cover from that? And I even think, in certain markets like Russia, if I'm not
mistaken, you even go to market between coffee and chocolate, on a similar system. So I guess just a little clarity on
that would be helpful.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think it really is because of the structure of the transaction we talked about today.
As we create the new company, the two businesses are highly complementary. There aren't that many countries where
we have major overlaps. So in a place like Russia, we're going to be carving out a coffee sales force for the new
company and providing that to the new company. So that's the biggest difference from what you would have expected
from a straight sale transaction. Because there's a new company that we're partnering with, we can contribute most of
the people and the overheads attached to it, to that new company. And because it's largely complementary in terms of
geography, they're going to need most of those costs. So that's really what's different versus the historical practices
we've had. But you're right. A lot of the countries have combined sales forces today, so that's an exercise we need to go
through over the next year.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, we actually see the opportunity. Because coffee is much more of a center-of-store
kind of item and our snacking business tends to be more front-end and impulse driven, we actually see the opportunity
to focus the respective selling organizations on what they do best. It's not unlike the kind of thinking we had as we split
the North American grocery business off. So we actually are looking for these new selling organizations to be a lot
more focused on their respective categories and actually we believe that will help to drive growth.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up question on revenue growth. As you look at
revenues for the year, the plus 3%, have you considered a higher degree of price realization coming through to support
that growth? And are there any pricing actions you've taken? There's been some, as you said, maybe some short-term
challenges with market share. But anywhere where you see any challenges to getting the pricing [indiscernible] (37:26)
you expected earlier in the year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, the revenue growth we've given was essentially tied to category growth rate. I think
both our revenue and the category will reflect a lot more pricing this year, and probably a lot less volume/mix growth.
So that's typical when you have big price increases. In terms of the pricing so far, it's a bit early to tell. We put in a lot
of the pricing in emerging markets early in the first quarter and, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, competitors, some
have followed, some have not. But I think it's common to industry. I would expect it to come through. Europe is a little
bit later because it takes a while to negotiate the price increases with the trade in Europe. So we're not going to see the
full benefit of that come through until Q2. So it's a bit early to tell, but I think, historically, when we've had commodity
increases that are common to industry, we've been able to price away those costs. And so I would expect that it will
come through as we're planning this year.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Congratulations. You mentioned revenue growth of 3% for the year which is close to the
growth rate of the first quarter. That first quarter includes a point drag, however, from Easter and coffee deflation,
which are factors that one would think would reverse in Q2, at least by Q3 in the case of coffee prices. Are you seeing a
slowdown in your base business or perhaps anticipating disruption from the restructuring as you think about that 3%?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think you're correct. The first quarter had 40 basis points of an Easter impact and about 60
basis points of coffee. I think the coffee we expect to continue in the second quarter. I think the – we did say we would
expect some positive benefit as coffee goes from being a headwind to essentially even a tailwind in the back half, but I
think the flip side of that is, as you mentioned, there could be some disruption from some of the strategic initiatives we
put in place. And, frankly, we're just being prudent. The categories have grown over the last two quarters now around
3%, and so we felt it was prudent to not count on a terrific turnaround and to plan on that for the balance of the quarter.
So it's not just a quarter one comment, it's been six months now of about 3% category growth.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And how much of your business will be Europe pre and post this deal? Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: It's down about 1 or 2 percentage points in – if you look at the configuration post
transaction close.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Just to follow up on the questions on revenue growth. I know it's difficult to pull out the
crystal ball on this, but how confident are you that you'll see some recovery in category trends in 2015 and beyond?
And just as you're thinking about the prospects for EPS growth given your new margin targets, are you assuming a
gradual recovery back to 4% to 5%, or sales growth, or thinking about this as the new run rate?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, in fact, one of the reasons we took the actions that we announced today is to ensure that
despite what happens on our top line, even if trends continue at the same rate, that we have great confidence that we
can deliver on the margin targets and therefore on our EPS commitments.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, thanks. And, Dave, you spoke to the cash costs of the restructuring program
being largely front-loaded during the first two years. Just as we're thinking about the phasing of cost savings and the
potential for margin expansion beyond 2016, can you give us a rough sense of what portion of the $1.5 billion in
restructuring savings should be realized by 2016?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think it'll flow through pretty steadily. The upfront years will be more overhead, less
supply chain. The later years will be more supply chain, because that takes a little longer to get under way. So I don't
think you'll see a massive skew. I wouldn't expect a huge impact this year, though.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And then just as we're thinking about the margin progression again for those out
years, is there any degree of expected base margin expansion that's now just being pulled forward in a way that would
moderate the margin prospects for those latter two years?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think – we haven't given a specific margin target beyond 2016, mostly because it's quite a
ways from now. But we have said we'll be 15% to 16% in 2016 as an OI margin, and the savings that are going to come
beyond that in 2017 and 2018 should allow us to continue to make margin progress in 2017 and 2018. And obviously
we'll continue to invest in our businesses to drive growth while we're doing all of that through that entire period.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Morning, everybody.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Morning, Eric.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Morning.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess just first on the coffee, if I could ask a quick question, you're noting that it's high
teens margins, but that's during a very low cyclical point in coffee cost. So kind of what is more of a normalized coffee
margin for the business?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think you'd have to define what normal coffee costs are. I think $1.20 two months
ago was actually not far off the 10-year average. $2 is obviously pretty high. And you're absolutely correct, though; the
revenue creates a bigger denominator if green coffee goes up and would reduce that margin. But I think it has been
historically pretty consistently higher OI margin than the rest of our business.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: That's also been particularly true, Eric, as we've shifted from a roast and ground business –
a predominantly roast and ground business – more into on-demand and soluble, and that's been a trend that has been
improving over the last couple of years as we've made those investments in Tassimo and Millicano, for example.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then more about kind of the restructuring, maybe following up a little bit on
Matt's question. I guess, Irene, followed you for a long time at Kraft and now Mondelez – I mean, there's just – you've
made a lot of well-received strategic moves, but I would say that so much restructuring, so much cash leaving, really
historically hasn't led to great fundamental performance. This was [ph] growth co (44:16) 18 months ago, and the top

line targets have now taken a complete back seat. So, if I was working at Mondelez, I would be kind of wondering,
what are my targets? It used to be – I used to be let's say recruited here to be a brand manager with growth, and now it's
all about cost savings and ZBB. So I guess, as we kind of go through this next iteration of change and restructuring,
how do you keep people like focused or motivated, and how much disruption do you think is going to occur from so
much going on within the company?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Eric, I think you make a fair observation. I would remind you, as you know, our last
restructuring program was in 2004-2008. We did deliver the targeted savings under that program, but we had a business
that was severely in need of reinvestment at that time. And if you recall, in 2006, our shares were declining, our
product quality was not where it needed to be, we didn't have an innovation pipeline. So we did reinvest most of those
savings back into the business. And, quite frankly, I'd argue we created some great value on a number of those
businesses, which allowed us to split off the North American grocery business and create great value for shareholders.
At this point, though, we're in a very different position. Our shares have now been consistently positive for a couple of
years. We've got our investments up to where we need them to be on our four snacking businesses, and I have great
confidence that the savings that we've laid out you will see reflected in our P&L. And, in fact, we've made the
commitments today to take up the bottom end of our range over these next couple of years, and as we've said we
actually see some additional upside beyond that as a consequence of the investments.
With respect to how should employees react – there's a lot to absorb here; there's no question about that. But our
employees are committed to creating this global snacking powerhouse that will win in the marketplace. And it is clear
that as the environment has changed in large measure, it was imperative that we take appropriate actions to address
some of the inefficiencies in our cost structure while continuing to drive growth. If anything, a number of the actions
that we're describing today will certainly help our margins but will also give us the fuel to reinvest in growth. So I
actually don't think it's an inconsistent message. We continue to outperform our peers in most markets around the
world. It's just a more challenging environment than I think we all had imagined as we created this company 18 months
ago. But net-net, I have great confidence that the actions that we're taking today will make this a stronger company and
increase confidence in our ability to deliver top-tier financial results.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hey. Thanks for the question. Dave, I don't think you addressed this – forgive me if you
did. Can you help us understand how much net debt the new coffee co will have on its next balance sheet? I'm asking
just because if we're trying to model the improvement in your non-controlling interest, I guess we want to better
understand how much interest expense that entity will have. So is it fair to assume D.E. will finance the $5 billion as all
debt? How much legacy interest expense or debt do they have? Just curious for any color you can help with there.
Thanks.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I don't want to get too much into the financing of the new company, but if you look
at the 8-K we issued today, it's highlighted we're taking out €4 billion, which is the $5 billion we referred to, and the
JAB folks are taking out €2.5 billion, and I think any- all of the financing of that would be in the new company.
There'll be nothing at our level or above that.

<Q - Cornell R. Burnette>: Cornell Burnette in with a few questions on behalf of David.
<A>: [ph] Hello? (48:30)
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Okay, Cornell, go ahead.
<Q - Cornell R. Burnette>: Okay. Great. Just wanted to know if you could give us what the combined pro forma
EBITDA for the new coffee business will be? And then going forward, what level of cost synergies do you think will
be able to be achieved by combining the businesses?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think, as we said today, we think the new company will have margins in the high
teens on the EBITDA level. We haven't given any cost synergy numbers. I think, I would say that some of the
excitement of this business is that it's highly complementary, both in technology as well as geographic platforms and
brands. But I would say the revenue synergies, frankly, are as exciting as any cost synergies that could come out of this.
And, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the countries that our business is in, they are not, and vice versa. So I think this is
as much about being a global pure-play coffee company as it is about traditional synergies.
<Q - Cornell R. Burnette>: And so, in your accretion analysis and getting to that accretion in the first full year, you're
saying really – there's not much in the way of cost synergies baked into that projection?
<A - David A. Brearton>: As I said, I'm not going to get into specifics of the new company's business plan, but I
would say that, as we talk about accretion in the first full year, that reflects the cash we receive, and assuming the
majority of that cash goes to buy back shares, with a substantial portion potentially for debt paydown as well. So I think
that's more a driver, and the fact that we will be consolidating 49% of the net income of the company as minority
interest position within our earnings per share number, so that's where that really comes from.
<Q - Cornell R. Burnette>: Okay, and one last thing. On chocolate, can you just talk a little bit about the range of
price increases that you've taken and just generally how well have they been accepted thus far?
<A - David A. Brearton>: It varies a lot. In Europe, obviously, they're pricing to recover the cocoa and dairy costs and
most recently nut costs, and those costs – those price increases were negotiated in the first quarter and we've got those
lined up, but they really didn't impact our revenue until late in March. So you'll see those flow through in the second
quarter. I really don't want to get into net price increases because, frankly, that gets into trade deals and other things. In
the emerging markets, it's much higher, because not only are we covering cocoa and dairy; we're also cutting the
currency impact in most of those countries. So you're looking at price increases in emerging markets anywhere from
high single digits to mid-teens. It depends on the country. So it's fairly significant in emerging markets. Those mostly
were put in place in the first quarter, and they're playing through, and I would expect that those are on the shelf in most
of those countries as we sit there today.

<A - David A. Brearton>: Oh, it's not just regulatory approval. It's also the works council consultations that we need
to go through in Europe. So, as with any transaction like this, you need to consult with the works councils, and you
need to complete those consultations before you can close the transaction, or, in the case of France, until you can
actually accept the offer. So there's a process we need to follow. We went through the same process when we brought
the LU biscuit business from Danone. So we understand that process pretty well, and it's just a question of timing. So
it'll be sometime in the course of 2015, and that's why we've been a bit reluctant to give specific guidance for next year,
and we've really focused on this year and 2016.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Got it. That's helpful. And one last question. Back to fundamentals. I'm looking at slide 16,
where you showed, geographically, your share performance. Great share performance in the developed markets.
Relatively soft performance across each region of emerging markets. Can you give us some more color on what's
driving that share weakness, and on a forward, what you expect and why?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think if you go back over the last two years, we've been pretty consistently strong in
shares across all of the regions. So this is an aberration but, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we took pricing in the
first quarter, and in most of those markets, we are the price leader. And so we've priced to recover commodity and
forex impacts within our cost, and we successfully got that through. Some of our competitors are lagging those price
increases. But, in the end, these are all common to industry cost increases, so I'd be surprised if they don't eventually
come up. So I would expect that to normalize. It's fairly typical, when we're in a price increase environment, that the
price leader takes a bit of the hits in the first few months.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Ken.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: I have just a big-picture – what was the catalyst to push you to reevaluate the extent of
your margin structure? You guys have been looking at the portfolio for some time. What pushed you to do this next
restructuring effort?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, the fact is, as our global categories have slowed down, particularly in the emerging
markets, the need to drive best-in-class costs becomes that much more important for us to deliver on our bottom line
commitments. And so we've been talking about that for quite some time. Obviously, it was a big subject of discussion
with our board at our strategic plan last summer, and we've been working on a number of these initiatives. We shared
with you the early thinking on supply chain at back-to-school. We talked with you about some of the work that we were
just beginning on zero-based budgeting with respect to overheads at CAGNY. And what we've announced today,
essentially, reflects the culmination of those activities. Obviously, the coffee transaction is something that was
happening concurrent with a number of these other thoughts, but they're highly interrelated, and that's why we have
great confidence that, as we take these actions together, that we will be able to drive additional margin expansion
sooner, while still continuing to support our franchises.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Would you expect there to be more additional actions to be taken, in terms of either the
portfolio refinement, or even going another level deeper into cost? Not saying that this cost restructuring is not
excellent. I don't want to minimize that and the effort there. But, I mean, as you get deeper and deeper into this, do you
think this ball is going to keep on rolling, in terms of portfolio refinement and cost restructuring?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Look, I think the cost piece of it, we're committing to approximately 300 to 400 basis points
improvement over these next three years. That's a fairly substantial commitment that we're making on the margin front,

and we've got some very strong programs behind that. We'll continue to push as aggressively as we can, but I think the
targets that we've laid out are quite aggressive and, as we've suggested, we see the opportunity as we make some of our
supply chain investments to help accelerate our delivery there. That will have some benefits beyond 2016. So I think
the commitments we've made today are quite aggressive. At the same time, from a portfolio standpoint, this coffee
transaction was a unique opportunity to create the world's largest pure-play coffee company, and we believe we have
accomplished that by creating great value for both partners and creating good value for our shareholders, both today

even after the coffee is excluded from consolidated earnings? And then, finally, just following up on Ken's question.
Could you imagine structuring a similar deal for the cheese and grocery business, which seems even less strategic than
the coffee business does? Thank you very much.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: So, Alexia, our emerging markets business will still be about 40% of the portfolio after the
transaction. The second question was -
<A - David A. Brearton>: The margins – the 15% to 16% margin already takes out coffee. So there's a small coffee
decrement that goes in there, because coffee has higher margins than the rest of the portfolio, but that's more than made
up by the savings from the restructuring program.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: And then, yes, the last question on the portfolio. As I said, coffee is a very unique
opportunity for us to create value, and we are not going to get into any other hypotheticals at this point in time.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Irene, in the absence of seeing some reinvestment of these coffee proceeds into route to
market and white space growth, how are you seeing the return on investment, as global category growth has slowed?
Have returns deteriorated at all? And how are you thinking about developing markets reinvestment going forward?
Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, I think we've seen a number of good returns on the investments that we made,
particularly in a number of our markets last year, as we thought, at that time, we made some significant investments in
routes to market in Brazil, in Russia, and in India, and we've seen great paybacks there. The one place we saw less of a
return has been in China. And, as we talked, we have pulled back quite a bit from some of those investments. So we
continue to look at these markets on a pay-as-you-go basis. We're monitoring whether or not we're getting the return, as
we make investments in the areas like route to market. But we have a strong desire to make sure that we are creating
the necessary investments in our infrastructure to enable us to benefit as the markets recover. So I think we've got the
right balance here between continuing to make investments that deliver attractive returns, while ensuring that we're not
overinvesting if the markets are not responding as well. So we keep a very close eye on that.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Okay. Thanks, Irene.

Your final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: First question is just – I'm curious. I know JAB, I believe, also and Peet's and Caribou in the
U.S. and I just can't remember when you spun – when you split Mondelez and Kraft Foods, was there an agreement in
place that said you can or can't operate in a Kraft market? I'm just asking just – off chance three years, four years down
the road you decide that the U.S. is actually a very attractive coffee market, are you allowed to sell coffee in the U.S.?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: We are not precluded from selling coffee in the U.S.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect, thanks. And then, second, when JAB purchased the Master Blenders, D.E.
Master Blenders was obviously spun from Sara Lee, there was a great story behind it. As they sort of kind of worked
through their strategy upfront, before JAB bought them, they found themselves actually kind of facing a bit of pressure,
mostly on the top line, but then some of the margin estimates came under question, et cetera, JAB did a fabulous job of
being able to purchase the asset, what I would consider potentially trough margins and earnings. Now that you're
working with JAB kind of post-purchasing D.E. Master Blenders, have – like what have you – and I'm not sure if you
can provide any color on this – but have you seen that their strategy with the business before the JV with you and then
after it is really more cost focused, cost-saving focused, or is this something that we should be thinking is sort of
another phase of [ph] growth co and cost co, (1:01:31) or is it more of a cost-savings opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: As you can imagine, we're not in a position to be able to make a lot of statements about the
combined company going forward. What I will tell you is I think our approaches to the business are quite well aligned,
and that's why we see great opportunity and we're pleased to have a 49% of the combined company going forward.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
