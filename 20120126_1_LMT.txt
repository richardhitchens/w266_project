Robert J. Stevens
Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. All of us here hope that your new year's off to a
very good start.
Let me begin with a quick summary of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we booked almost $20 billion in new business
awards from domestic and international customers and finished the year with a record backlog of almost $81 billion.
Strong program execution coupled with ongoing cost reduction initiatives enabled segment operating margins to
increase to 11.5% in the quarter and 11.4% for the year, which reflected improvements over prior year levels.
Cash generation was exceptional with $1.1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter after making accelerated
pension contributions of $1 billion; and over $4.2 billion for the year, surpassing the prior year by more than $450
million. We paid $325 million in dividends in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year as we continue to execute our $4
a share annual dividend payout. Share repurchases continued in the quarter and totaled almost 32 million shares for the
year enabling the retirement of 7% of the outstanding shares.
With this focus, we generated a 21% total shareholder return with 16% stock price appreciation and a 5% dividend
yield. These results reflect the quality of our workforce, the dedication of our leaders and the strength of our
corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. Thanks to everyone
in the company who play a role in driving these results.
Since we last spoke in October, we've seen an expansion and, in some cases, an amplification of the uncertainty evident
in the global security environment and in world economic conditions. The events playing out in Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, North Korea, China and many other regions of the world underscore the complexity and the
volatility embedded in the mission of maintaining global security. Many signs of economic stress remain and the global
recovery appears to be, at best, uneven and slow.
On the domestic horizon, we see change as well. Earlier this month, the administration released a new security strategy
highlighting priorities for our 21st century defense. Citing the strategic turning point after a decade of war that is now
concluding, the joint force will be reshaped to be smaller and leaner with more agile, flexible, ready and
technologically advanced.
Forces are to be rebalanced with more emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East, while assuring
additional focus on the critical priorities of space and cyberspace, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,
communications and navigation systems, counterterrorism and irregular warfare, an effective nuclear deterrent, and
counter weapons of mass destruction capabilities. There will be an emphasis on air and naval forces while reducing
land forces, and on building more effective security cooperation partnerships with friends and allies.
The President's 2013 budget is also set to be delivered to Congress on February 13. And Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta gave an Executive Summary look at the DOD portion just an hour ago in a press conference at the Pentagon,
which actually may still be ongoing. But the Secretary described a fiscal 2013 budget request of $525 billion in the
base budget. That compares to a $531 billion defense budget in fiscal 2012, along with a request for $88.4 billion for
overseas contingency operations.
This new budget reflects the new security strategy and includes the effects of last year's Budget Control Act that
triggered the administration's proposal to reduce the Defense top line by $487 billion through 2021, with $259 billion
of that reduction occurring between 2013 and 2017. This significant and substantial $487 billion reduction, in
conjunction with the new security strategy, assures that commitments to deficit and debt reduction are met while
maintaining an adequate security posture necessary in the uncertain and volatile world that we see today.
While we'll gain additional details about specific program funding levels in the budget as more information becomes
available, the clear contours of the new strategy align exceedingly well with our portfolio and our experience. This
alignment is no accident.

Even as our national focus was appropriately on ground operations in Iraq and Afghanistan after having committed
forces there, our assessment of the global security environment suggested that the long arc of our national strategic
interest would orient toward the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East; that regional security there would be
influenced by China, North Korea, Iran and others who are investing heavily in advanced technologies; that these
technologies would include sophisticated anti-access and area denial capabilities, the advancement of nuclear and other
weapons and the missile systems necessary for their delivery, and an increasingly elaborate series of cyber systems and
methods, all of which would require response; and further that sustained pressure in world economic conditions would
continue to impose constraints on the resources available to governments, leading to more cooperation on shared
security objectives.
That's why we took action years ago to refine the architecture of our products to assure they would incorporate the most
advanced sensor fusion and communications capabilities such that real-time intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance information could be leveraged and that our systems would be flexible and adaptable in meeting
emerging challenges. And that's why the architecture of our business model was structured on promoting sustainable
security cooperation partnerships where interoperability would support more effective coalition action and leverage the
global supply chain.
While we clearly recognize there would be challenges with this strategic approach, requiring us initially to deal with an
additional measure of innovation and the complexity that results from that innovation, our strategy is proving to be
durable and well aligned. The result is a robust and increasingly mature portfolio of relevant global systems that are
meeting the needs of our customers in addressing global challenges; systems like Joint Strike Fighter, supporting three
U.S. services, eight initial partners and the needs of an increasing number of international customers, most recently
Japan; or our missile defense capabilities including Aegis, PAC-3 and THAAD, which are setting the standard for U.S.
and allied defenses as reflected in the recent selection of THAAD by the United Arab Emirates; or the Littoral Combat
Ship that is driving innovation and adaptability through a more affordable solution to meet the expanding array of
demands clearly present in to the Littoral waters around the globe; or our space based assets, including advanced DHF,
[ph] VU-Os (8:35) SBIRS, GPS III and other satellite systems that enable unparalleled situational awareness, secure
communications, precision navigation and prompt global response.
We're continuing today to apply the very same energy, rigor, talent and resources to further integrate systems, adding
more effective command-and-control, constructing more resilient networks, and preparing the information technology
environment for the hazards of expanding cyber threats while driving greater levels of efficiency and affordability
across our company. There is much more work yet to do, which is why we're greatly distressed by the prospect of
sequestration, that element of existing law mandated by the failure of the Super Committee to find additional spending
reductions.
The resulting automatic across the board budget cuts and sequestration would approximately double the $487 billion
top line reduction already reflected in the defense funding with an additional $52 billion reduction in 2013.
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has spoken in the strongest possible terms against sequestration which he described
as having catastrophic consequences to our defense. We support this view completely. The sequestration process has
occurred independent of any correlation with strategy, fore structure, technology needs or operational reality. While the
precise detailing of the adverse impacts of sequestration are yet to be determined, the United States would likely have
the smallest ground force since 1940, the fewest number of ships since 1915 and the smallest Air Force in our nation's
history.
The impact on industry would be devastating with a significant disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives, facility
closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations, erode engineering
expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge directly undermining a key provision of the new security
strategy which is to preserve the industrial base. We understand well the fiscal pressures our nation faces and have not
hesitated in realigning the cost basis in our business through expense reductions, rebalancing the workforce,
consolidating facilities and the like and will continue to do so. And we recognize that the Department of Defense is
committed to a $0.5 trillion reduction over the next 10 years, an ambitious initiative that we fully support. But our

position on sequestration is very clear. We must not let an automatic budget trigger, a default position in effect only due
to a committee failure, to become the dominant force for allocating resources in shaping our nation's security posture
and we strongly urge action to stop this process.
Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our performance, I want to highlight an organizational change
we announced this morning. After 37 years of distinguished service, Ralph Heath advised of his plans to retire from our
company. I've worked with Ralph for a very long time now and found him to be an exceptional executive in every
respect. He's been dedicated and professional in every assignment and he's set the standard for ethics and business
conduct. Ralph's decision highlights why we've invested so much time and energy in our talent management, our
leadership development and our succession planning process over the years; subjects we really don't talk a lot about on
this call, but subjects vitally important to our future success. Through this process, we now have an outstanding cadre
of highly qualified executives ready to assume additional responsibilities and take our business forward.
Effective April 1, Larry Lawson will serve as Executive Vice President of our Aeronautics business, replacing Ralph,
and the business could not be in better hands. Larry brings a proven track record of success in all that he has done.
Orlando Carvalho will succeed Larry as Vice President and General Manager of the F-35 Program. You may recall that
Orlando joined Aeronautics in August of 2011 after serving as President of our Maritime Systems & Sensors business.
Orlando has 30 years of experience in complex systems and his organizational leadership equipped him well for the
demands of the F-35.
Lorraine Martin will serve as Orlando's Deputy on the F-35 program, moving from the C-130. And George Shultz will
assume responsibilities for C-130 operations. I mention these names because they represent the breadth and depth of
talent in this company. Each has decades of experience, worked in diversified assignments, driven higher levels of
performance and have built superb teams. When I tell you that it is a privilege for me to work in this company, I'm
talking about the opportunity to work with leaders like Ralph, Larry, Orlando, Lorraine, and George, and I thank them
all.
So I'll have Bruce go through some of the details of our performance and then we'll open the line for questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with
the web charts that we've included today.
Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of the full-year for 2011. We grew sales for the company by 2% over our
2011 level, and given the environment we operated in throughout the year we're pleased with those results. We're even
more pleased with the record backlog amount for the full-year, driven by almost $20 billion in orders in the fourth as
Bob said. Segment margins were 40 basis points higher than last year reflecting a strong performance year for us with
much of that improvement stemming from cost reduction actions that we took earlier this year – or last year, excuse
me.
Our earnings per share from continuing operations were 11% higher than 2010 and we generated $4.3 billion in cash
from operations while accelerating $1 billion in pension contributions previously planned for 2012. So overall, 2011
was a very strong execution year and our results reflect that performance.
On chart 4, we'll look at sales of the four business areas. Two of the four business areas grew sales for the year led by a
strong 10% increase in Aeronautic sales over 2010 levels. Electronic systems had 2% growth for the year, better than
what we premised when the year began.
As anticipated, IS&GS declined by 5%, driven mostly by the absence of the U.S. Census activity this year. And Space
ended the year relatively flat compared with 2010 as we expected.
Turning to chart five and our backlog to end the year, all four business areas grew backlog in the fourth quarter and the
company increased backlog by about $8 billion over the third quarter level. Key orders recognized in the quarter

included additional funding for the F-35 LRIP5 contract as well as F-16 awards from Oman and Iraq in aeronautics;
additional domestic and international PAC-3 orders, a $1 billion order to upgrade warrior fighting vehicles in the UK
and our first international order for the THAAD program in electronic systems; the award of the NSF-Polar contract to
IS&GS; and the FY'12 installment of the [ph] Hoyt (16:41) ballistic missile contract in Space Systems along with an
award for the initial launch of an unmanned Orion capsule in 2014.
Chart six highlights that we grew backlog in 2011 by over $2 billion to $80.7 billion, a record for the corporation. This
is the second consecutive year we've grown our backlog and ending backlog is about $2 billion higher than our
expectations at the start of the year.
Moving to chart seven, you can see the significant improvement in margins for both the fourth quarter and total year
compared with 2010, again resulting from strong program execution and our cost reduction actions. And these cost
reductions are benefiting our customers as we price new business.
On chart eight, we'll discuss our earnings per share. Our EPS from continuing operations increased 11% to $7.85 for
the year. I'll remind you that last year included charges for our [ph] VES (24:39) program and the elimination of
Medicare Part D subsidies. However, when adjusting both years for the negative impacts of the FAS/CAS adjustment,
our pension adjusted earnings per share grew 21% over 2010 levels.
Turning to chart nine, you can see the effects of our cash deployment actions, returning $2.5 billion back to our
shareholders through share repurchases and $1.1 billion in the form of dividends during the year. Combined, we
returned 109% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2011 and returned almost $200 million more than the prior year's
amount.
On chart 10, we show the impacts of our share repurchases over time. 2011 was the second straight year that we've
reduced outstanding share count by 7% and we've reduced shares outstanding by more than 100 million shares over the
last five years.
Chart 11 shows that our total shareholder return last year was significantly outperforming all major benchmarks. The
TSR reflects both the strong execution in the year and the cash deployment actions from the prior chart.
Beginning with chart 12, we'll discuss our outlook for the year 2012. Our sales for the year are expected to be about 2%
lower than 2011 at the midpoint of our guidance. And segment profit generally falls with sales volume with our
segment margin expected to remain above 11% for the year. I'll discuss both sales and segment operating profit in
greater detail on the next chart.
Moving down the chart, our FAS/CAS adjustment has improved from the trends we gave in October. I'll also speak
more about this change in a couple of charts. Our earnings per share guidance for the year is $7.70 to $7.90 per share,
and as a reminder does not include any consideration for the R&D tax credit being extended into 2012. Think of that
R&D tax credit being worth about $0.10 per share of benefit in 2011.
Finally, our cash from operations guidance is $3.8 billion, up slightly from what we described last quarter. I should
point out that we expect the phasing of our cash from operations this year to be different from prior years and that our
cash will be significantly higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. We'll be making the planned pension
contributions in the first half with around $500 million in the first quarter and the reminder in the second quarter. And
we also have a tax payment in the first quarter, while we had a tax refund in the first quarter of 2011.
Chart 13 provides our guidance ranges for both sales and segment operating profit by the four business areas. For sales,
we now expect both electronic systems and aeronautics to remain relatively flat at the midpoint compared with 2011
while IS&GS and space systems are expected to see reduction sales. You'll recall that when we discussed our trend data
during the third quarter call we had expected sales to remain relatively flat compared to 2011. Two key events occurred
at the end of the year that changed that outlook.
First, we were unsuccessful in our bid to win the G&D competition. This results in sales in our space system segment
being lower than expected when we spoke on October. Second, we reduced our guidance for IS&GS as a result of
recent customer direction to stop activities on the AMF JTRS program by the end of February.

Our segment operating profit guidance is driven mostly by sales volume. The margins of aeronautics and space and
IS&GS are expected to be down slightly, reflecting a lower dollar amount of profit rate adjustments planned for 2012
as compared to 2011 while electronic systems is expected to have consistent margins with what we saw in 2011.
Chart 14 shows the changes that impacted our FAS/CAS adjustment from what we described last quarter. We ended the
year with a slightly higher discount rate at 4.75% versus the 4.5% we discussed in the third quarter and this improved
the negative FAS/CAS adjustment by $115 million. We also had other updates which partially offset the impact of the
higher discount rate by some $25 million, resulting in the 2012 FAS/CAS adjustment of an $835 million headwind on
reported earnings.
And finally on chart 15, we have our summary. 2011 was a strong year by any measure and reflects the focus that our
team demonstrated throughout the year. 2012 is expected to be a solid year, building on the strategic alignment of our
portfolio, our record backlog and the strong cash generation we've demonstrated for many years.
With that, Jovan, I think we're ready for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi Investment.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hello, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: I'm sorry about; I had my cellphone on mute. Just a quick question on the guidance and the
secretary's comments that were made this afternoon; does your guidance reflect the things that he had to say this
afternoon or is there potential risk either to the upside or to the downside after you parse through this comments.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Jason I'll take that one on. Obviously, we're still sorting through what the secretary is
saying but I think in any event I don't think there's a change to the 2012 guidance. Essentially, anything that would
happen at least that I'm aware of in the conversations that he had today would effect 2013 and beyond but we still got
some sorting out to do to see exactly what that impact would be. Bob'll offer any other comments you might want to
make.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Jason, just another thought, I think the secretary gave some executive summary views so we
and others could get a sense of the shape and overall feel, but I think our experience has been it's entirely valuable to
get into the details, the time phasing, and other facets of the budget proper and I don't think that's going to be available
to us until February 13. So I think we'll be able to give you much better insight as to our overall reaction to what is just
really breaking news today when we next speak with you. But as Bruce said, it doesn't feel likely that we're overly
sensitive in fiscal – in our current fiscal year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: I wanted to get an update on your views on the F-35 right now. I know when – Bob, when you
talked after Q3 there were issues when you looked at LRIP 5 in terms of the structure of that program, the risks
involved and potentially having to paper for work on prior airplanes. So if you could, if you could update both on LRIP
5, where that stands today and then also when you're looking at some of the technical challenges on the airplanes such
as the arresting hook, helmet mounted display, could you give us an idea of how some of that progress is going and
when do you expect a resolution in some of those issues?

<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Sure, I'll do my best and you'll let us know if it's thorough enough, Doug. So when we last
spoke we had a very unique issue on LRIP 5 and it had to with risks associated with concurrency costs. And in – at the
time of our discussion, the formulation that we were reviewing from the government had a substantial risk transfer to
industry: our company, and our partners, and our suppliers. Through negotiation and discussion that unfolded
subsequent to the call, we negotiated the parameters associated with concurrency and I would tell you put it into a
formulation that's about we and the government felt was appropriate with regard to risk and execution where we are
accountable and they are accountable, and that's what partners do. So I think that matter is resolved.
We are in the process of negotiating Lot 5 now. I don't have a time horizon where I can give you some assurance that
negotiation will be complete, but we are leaning forward in an attempt to negotiate the final terms, conditions, pricing,
and provisions of Lot 5.
Relative to some of the technical issues that you described Doug, and I think a number of those over time were
associated with the STOVL variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, I'll tell we are making progress along each of the items
that are identified. I think that progress was reflected in the 2011 performance of the program overall; certainly the
flight test program that ran a little bit ahead of schedule. I think most people would have noted that the STOVL variant
was removed from probation after personal involvement by Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta.
The Secretary visited the Pax River Naval Air Station; he spoke directly with the pilots and the maintainers and others
familiar with the airplane. These are folks in the government as well as folks in industry. I believe he went through a
careful and detailed review, item by item, and issue by issue. I must tell you I admire very much the personal level of
due diligence from a person as busy as Secretary Panetta to get personally involved to understand the details. With that
understanding, he removed the jet from probation.
We know there are challenges; this is a development program. I've spoken to you as honestly and straightforwardly as I
possibly can about our assessment of a development program. And I would tell you this feels ordinary and traditional
for complex airplanes of this type. It doesn't mean we're pleased when we have to modify an arresting hook or adapt a
helmet mounted display or work some thermal issues in the propulsion system. But these are observations that are the
types that are relatively familiar with complex aeronautical systems like this.
We've aligned our resource well; we've got great cooperation from the Naval Air Systems Command, from the joint
program office, from others in the government; everyone is leaning forward. So when I tell you we had a better year on
the Joint Strike Fighter, I don't mean we Lockheed Martin. I mean we, our partners, suppliers, as well as all those in the
government who support this effort, who understand the need.
What you will consistently hear is the underscoring of the criticality of having fifth generation capabilities in this
complex security environment. You heard that from Secretary Panetta today; you heard that from the President of the
United States and Secretary Panetta when the new strategy was rolled out. We take that responsibility seriously.
We have international partners who expect us to deliver on this program, and we will. We have an increasing number
of foreign military sales participants, most recently Japan, who can look at any airplane around the globe and pick the
best airplane in which they have the most confidence that will meet their security demands. They selected the F-35;
that's a huge honor and responsibility for the F-35 team.
And finally, Larry Lawson's leadership on this program has simply been exceptional. And he is a very seasoned and
skilled executive. He's built a lot of sophisticated airplanes including the F-22. The team that he assembles – has
assembled is first rate and we're ready for the challenges that we face.
So I will tell you the momentum is in the program. Yes, there will be some quantity reductions. We've talked to you
before about the new reality; this is part of the new reality where there are complex global security challenges and
scarce resources available to governments to meet those security challenges. We'll make the adaptations; we'll
incorporate the new quantities once we understand their time phasing. We will drive hard to have a successful,
effective, affordable program.

And next on line we've Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I wanted to ask question on your backlog. So take a look here, book to bill was pretty hefty,
1.6 times this quarter. You finished the year greater than 1 times, as you said; last year – following last year's greater
than 1 times book to bill. Not meaning to sound like someone who's saying what have you done for me lately, just
wanted to know if you could comment on the opportunity set for 2012? What's your view on 2012 book to bill? And
what I'd really like to get a sense of is do you feel – do you kind of feel that book to bill has peaked in 2011 or do you
see an ability to repeat that this year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Rich. I'll take that one also. I was looking at this actually, recently; we kind of did a
review of the plan for 2012 and the out year look as well. The thing that struck me as I was looking at that is there's not
just a large number of, I'll say, high dollar awards in the first quarter or practically for that matter in the first half of
2012. So what I think we're going to see at least in the first half of the year is some reduction in that backlog, so our
book to bill will be lower than 1.0. And I'm trying to think of the top off my head some of the larger orders we have in
the first quarter, but things like the fiscal year 2012 F-22 sustainment contract is one example. The authorization under
[ph] Ayuka (39:23) in all likelihood of the F-35 LRIP 6 contract and some international sales within aero, perhaps for
C-130s, might be the highest dollar items in the first half of the year.
I think we will likely have greater than 1 point, at least as we sit here today, we'll likely have greater than 1.0 book to
bill in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, a little bit different, maybe than years past which has always
historically been our lowest quarter of the year from an orders perspective and we'd always drop backlog more in the
third quarter than any other quarter.
I think that might change somewhat, at least as we see it today, that the third quarter will actually see some backlog
growth and I'm hoping, Rich, that by the end of the year I think we might see some slight reduction but I'd like to think
we can be around the $80 billion mark for the year and I don't think that's – I guess that's a stretch that I'd like to have
for ourselves is to kind of keep the backlog starting in the 80s. That's not a slam dunk by any stretch but that's – again,
as we sit here today that's the way I think about it Rich.

And next on the line we have Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes. Good afternoon. Bob, two questions for you. One simple and the other more big picture.
First, when do you get to rate on the F-35? And the second question is can you talk about the state of IR&D? The DoD
doesn't seem to be clear about where their R&D priorities are going to be beyond Bomber, so where does your IR&D
future look like since DoD may be a less reliable source of R&D going forward?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks, Heidi. On both of these fronts, the answer is going to be a little bit we're going to
have to wait and see. For example, rate on the F-35 is going to be function we think of new quantity adjustments that
will phase out – I'll give you our best understanding today, phase out of the nearer-term lots; some of the billed cycle
probably more or less leveling the quantities at around 30. Again, we look for the detail; and then accelerating out of
there.
I think in conjunction with that, Heidi, our understanding today is that the total quantity to be procured domestically
remains at 2,443 so we're looking at a phasing. The phasing will have dual advantages of lowering the budget demands
aligning the physical pressures, as well as creating some time for the maturation of the airplane that might minimize
some of the revisions to the configuration. Both of those things, we think, make sense.
I think the other aspect of rate or volume at least in the near term, we will in the very short term get some clarity and
insight as to the U.S. government's buy plan and we'd like to anchor that as a foundation. And then when we visit with
each of our international partners and each of our potential foreign military sales customers, not just those who are

already on board of the program like Israel or Japan but maybe future purchasers like South Korea where there's a
tender, and others; and begin to then build this revised acceleration plan that will lead to rate so that we can do that in
the most efficient and effective way possible.
So I think that's about the best summary of F-35 volume over time to rate that we have today and we'll get you some
more details when they're available to us. We continue to make investments internally in the areas that we think will be
most relevant to the forces described in the strategy that was released.
And I'll say to you again, I think that our portfolio, as defined in products and services, but also our portfolio of
research and investigative initiatives aligns pretty well with the strategy that was described to the extent that we have
those broad contours. For example, a number of years ago we established, through this research and development
facility, a cyber laboratory so that we could begin to much more thoroughly exercise the resilience in systems, and the
resilience in networks. So I think some of our actions there have aligned very well.
I think the future of the overall portfolio, and I very much resonate to the spirit of your question, in an era of more
fiscal austerity how will the apportionment of the top line budget reduction flow between and among expense accounts
like operations and maintenance and personnel and the investment accounts of procurement and research and
development and how will resources available for research be thrifted? So that's sort of an open watch item for us
because we don't want to see an attrition in our engineering facility. We don't want to lose some of the innovative
expertise that is fueled by access to this type of funding. And here again, I think the best we can do is look for the
details over time that we're not in possession of today and maybe be sure to follow on with you in that regard.

And next on the line we have Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So on the F-35, looking through your commentary, it looks like
revenues last year were down about – were up about $700 million on both parts of the program and profits maybe off
$35 million, so the margin's off maybe one point. Could you give us any sense now that you seem to have the
concurrency issues resolved, do we have any opportunity on margins this year or – excuse me or moving into the
future?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey Cai, this is Bruce, I'll take that one on. Without commenting on your math, your math is
usually pretty accurate, but without commenting on it, the way I look at 2012 – let's start with revenue on the F-35
program. I think the F-35 LRIP contracts are growing somewhere in the 9ish% to 10% range year-over-year so we're
still seeing some good growth there. That's being offset because the development contract, the STD contract, is going
down compared to 2011 as you might expect. I think net net, the F-35 is up some mid-single digits growth
year-over-year.
As to your question on margins, I would expect us to see some margin improvement on the F-35 in 2012, primarily
because if you just sit back and think about what we're going to accomplish in the year, we're going to deliver a lot
more aircraft this year; we're going to deliver – and I'm quoting this from memory here, we're going to deliver all the
LRIP 2 aircraft, all the LRIP 3 aircraft and a good portion of the LRIP 4 aircraft, all in 2012. And so as you might
expect, we have a historical practice of not booking from a booking rate perspective at the at-completion position or at
what we expect the programs to earn at their end or at their completion until we've retired the risk on those contracts.
And so as you might expect, we've got some risk retirements that we're expecting to become finalized with the final
delivery of those aircraft. And again, because a good chunk of those three LRIPs are all finishing in 2012, we would
expect to see some margin improvement compared to 2011 for the F-35.

<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, good afternoon, Bob. Just a question on capital deployment; you guys have been setting
the standard amongst your peers in terms of dividends and buybacks. I want to – how are you approaching it going
forward now that we kind of have a pretty good feel directionally where the budgets are going to be and potentially a
lot of moving parts amongst your peers when you weigh that against a selective M&A. How are you looking at that in
terms of going forward on the strategy?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Well, in today's environment we're looking at cash deployment pretty much the same way
we have been. We're not communicating with you any change in strategy or philosophy. Peter, I think you know that
the first thing we do is start by getting the cash and I don't say that lightly, but we have a very rigorous focus and
disciplined process here that is institutionalized around the company that cash management matters a great deal relative
to our ability to both make appropriate internal investments and then return appropriate value to shareholders.
So we're rigorously focused on that and we like the balanced cash deployment approach we have that you highlighted
with a component for share repurchases and a component for dividends. We spend a lot of time talking with the
investors in the company to make sure that we understand your sense about how we ought to be thinking about cash
deployment but I don't think you should expect a change in our approach.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Peter, this is Bruce. I don't think I said it in my remarks but I'll say it here because it relates to
your question, obviously. The guidance that we've provided for 2012 assumes that we're going to have at least $1
billion of share repurchases contained within the earnings per share number that we gave you. And I think that's at least
some indication we are going to continue the practices that we've done and demonstrated the last few years.

And next on the line we have Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just – for Bruce, a quick clarification on your comments around the Aeronautics margin and
then a question about long-term pension funding. On the margin, back to what you were talking about on the F-35 and
your sort of historical behavior pattern on EACs and risk retirement around the end of a contract, as you look to the end
of the F-22, should we be expecting anything in kind of a intra-year, quarterly patterns of margin in Aeronautics that's
worth noting in one quarter versus some of the others?
And then secondly, you provided some commentary around pension funding; obviously that's in the guidance in 2012. I
just wondered if you might give us some color on how that stands where we are today for 2013 and beyond?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks Carter. So let's see, I'll start with sort of the F-22 question, would you see the
same thing that we described. I think that was your question as we saw or as I commented on the F-35. Now I think
there's eight aircraft left to deliver on the F-22 production program; all of them have literally left the factory and they're
sitting in what we call our flight line operations going through, as you might expect, flight testing both with our pilots
and with the government pilots. So there's not a lot of – frankly, there's not a lot of cost left to do on those aircraft.
Again, they're all built at this point in time. They were finished up last year so most of the risk retirements that you
would associate with the end of the program occurred in the 2011 timeframe, not the 2012 timeframe. So while there
may be some opportunities for improvement I wouldn't expect it to be as substantial, for instance, as what we saw in
2011.
Longer term pension funding, again we accelerated $1 billion of the required payments from 2012 into 2011. As we
look for – and I think you're probably aware of the CAS Harmonization rules were recently passed or implemented. I
think they're actually effective not until next month, but I think the notification came out at the end of December of last
year. We should see CAS recovery rise in the next few years, but the actual payments from an ERISA perspective
looking into – from 2012 into 2013, I think we're paying now about $1.1 billion in 2012; that number grows to about

$2.1 billion in 2013.
The flip side of that is the CAS recovery's about $1.1 billion. So think of that as being sort of a breakeven position,
CAS – excuse me, ERISA payments out and CAS recoveries in for 2012. The CAS recovery in 2013 is more like $1.4
billion. So we're getting some of the benefit of the CAS Harmonization but not much. ERISA payments are probably a
similar level in the year after and the CAS recovery grows some beyond that.
So slow recovery, I'll say back to sort of getting back to a breakeven position primarily because of the CAS
Harmonization got pushed out further than the – than we had expected when we started first talking about CAS
Harmonization; but still expecting in the not too distant future for us to get close to breakeven and then start to flip the
other way around where we're getting more collections than payouts.

And next on the line we have Joe Nadol with JPMorgan Securities.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Bob, on the capital deployment front you have made – it
may be a subtle shift in the strategy or maybe it's just the timing, but you've done a couple of acquisitions here in the
fourth quarter that were – they weren't huge, but they were bigger than certainly than you have been doing. You have
also over the last year or so divested a couple of the deals that you had done a few years ago and I think all four of
these acquisitions – I'm including – or all four of these deals, I'm talking about the two acquisitions you made in the
fourth quarter as well as Savi and PAE, they're in adjacencies. So I was wondering if you could maybe characterize big
picture how you're viewing acquisitions and adjacencies and then maybe a little bit on each of the deals and why you
decided to divest Savi and then acquire these other two?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Sure, I'll be happy to, Joe. I think that we are – you mentioned timing here; I think that's
maybe a little bit of timing. We've had a string of pearls approach, we like that approach, we look for companies that
give us access to markets, unique technology; they provide a good fit, they have some ease of integration and they meet
our overall test for valuations. I think the acquisitions you're referring to are Sim-Industries and QTC. They are part of
an adjacent market strategy that we've had in place for a number of years now.
We are certainly interested in moving this business forward in the technology areas that we think customers will
increasingly value and in areas where we can backup some synergies. If you think of Sim-Industries in the market for
simulators, we've been in the simulator business for a long time. This extends our portfolio; we're not unwilling to take
that portfolio beyond our traditional customer sets to be bringing in some of those business practices into our core
business. We think there's real synergy there.
We'll continue to explore for businesses that fit our portfolio, fit our business model and that would now align with the
contours of this new national security strategy and the portfolio we've put in place. So to the extent that there would be
a business that would provide for us international opportunities, we will certainly look at that. With regard to the cyber
domain, I think there'll be a continuing and even growing demand for capabilities in that regard. Our systems
integration business is always one that we'd like to reinforce and support; and certainly the emerging fields in energy,
and here we're going to be selective because one size isn't going to fit all, but we do have some interests in the energy
domain as well as others.
I think there'll be some opportunities unfolding as we see the details in the budget domestically and maybe get a better
feel for how our global customers will respond, perhaps in logistics and sustainability and support. If long-term budgets
are going to be under pressure, yet operational tempos are going to remain high, if we're going to have deployments to
Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, if we're going to find innovative ways to move forces around, we think there will be
roles in our logistics business, our support, and in our supply businesses there. So if there were acquisition
opportunities there, we would look.
We've been prudent, I think, as good stewards of the hard earned cash position that we have; we want to maintain good
credit quality. We have fire power; that financial flexibility, I think, is a discriminator of our company along with our

portfolio and our selectivity about what we buy and what we do with it.
In the case of the divestitures, if there are changes in the market, changes in the customers' behavior, we are not going
keep businesses that don't align with the overall strategic arc and trajectory of this business. And we will be decisive.
So I think on the acquisition side we want to be selective so that we're not talking to you in the future about a lot of
divestitures. But in a case where circumstances change, we're going to face the reality, deal with those changes and
move the business forward. In doing so, we'll try to generate as much value as we can and share that value with
investors to the best of our ability.

And next on the line we have George Shapiro with Access 342.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good afternoon. This is for Bruce. If you take a look at Aeronautics, you disclosed this
quarter that you had risk retirement of $70 million on the F-16 and another $35 million on the C-130 and C-5 and
together that's maybe 270 basis points addition to the margin. Can you just describe what they were actually related to
and what the opportunity is for getting more of those next year? And is there any way we can kind of anticipate some
of those coming?
And then one other one in that area, the F-35 profit margin is clearly implied to be down in this quarter based on your
commentary. Just want to validate that that's probably LRIP 4 being booked in higher revenues and a lower margin
that's kind of swamping the overall numbers and there wasn't any change in any of the other program margins?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Okay. Let me start, George, with the first question, the F-16 step-ups and the C-130; what
drove them and what's out there for next year and what should you be looking for. The F-16 we've – I'll say a lot of that
was sort of ordinary, run of the mill program execution clicking off performance milestones and retiring risk
accordingly. There was on one of our international contracts a particular item that we were tracking towards that we
actually reached closure on in the fourth quarter that we felt justified to step up so that particular item which was – I'm
trying to think off the top of my head, George, that was a pretty good chunk, probably half or so of the F-16 pick up;
that will likely not repeat next year on the F-16 program.
The C-130 program is, again, just sort of the clicking off the normal manufacturing activates. The only thing that was a
little bit unusual on the C-130 is we had really, really good performance on the sustainment contracts on the C-130
activities in the quarter and I'd like to think that we have the opportunity to do that in 2012 as well. We're – I think
we've really had a stride where customers are seeing great value in the sustainment support that we are providing those
particularly, honestly, the international customers is where that – most of that happens. And I'd like to think that that
will be something that you'll continue to see in 2012 as well.
As far as the F-35 profit margins are concerned, I mean there was no – and I'm doing this again from the top of my
head, but there was no profit adjustments upwardly or downwardly in the quarter so any margin change that happened
was purely volume related. We're starting to get some heavier activity in the LRIP 4 contract, as you described in your
question. And that's again because, as I said earlier, LRIP 2, 3 and part of 4 will start delivering this year. So that
volume is starting to come in and some of that margin improvement that we're looking for in 2012 will be on contracts
such as LRIP 4 as we start to see production aircraft roll off the line. As we anticipate, that will be the triggering
mechanism, if you will, for the risk retirements that we plan.

And next on the line we have Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks, good afternoon. Just a – going back to the cash flow outlook for next year,
$3.8 billion on the op cash line; Bruce, a couple of things. One, the pension expense after tax looks like it's a $750
million tailwind or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And then, is there anything outside of maybe advances or cash

taxes? Are those the two major downers to the cash in 2012? It just seems like even your usual 10%, 15% conservatism
this would be a little bit lighter than you might otherwise have given the tailwind on lower pension contributions.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Myles, let me – just to clarify what I think I heard. I think you said $2.8 billion in operating
cash in 2012.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: No, it was 3.8.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: It was $3.8 billion for the year. And your questions I get when – there was – again, there was
a lot of receipts that got pulled into 2011 from 2012 including some fairly good-sized international receipts, and that's
one of the things that enabled us to do the billion dollar acceleration of the pension plan. So we're actually ahead of the
game; in fact for the first time in the corporation's history at least as I look back in the records, we actually have
negative working capital at the working – at the corporation level. So that's hard to replicate and one of the reasons that
you'll see are – the pure calculation from a balance sheet perspective, that's the heart of your question, is because you're
seeing some of the work off, if you will, of that negative working capital coming back next year.
I'd like to think even having said that, there are still opportunities. I can tell you if you talk to any of my folks in the
finance organization who work in any of the four business areas, they will tell you that I am pushing hard to do better
on cash pulled than what we have committed to here and I think there are opportunities to do that, but we're just not
there at this point in time to change the guidance accordingly. We'll obviously give you updates throughout the year as
we progress and we'll come back to you and tell you how we're doing on that challenge.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Bob, you were very successful in placing THAAD in UAE. Are there
a couple of more opportunities for this and might you also address some international potential on things?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, thanks Howard. I'll tell you that relative to the THAAD in the UAE program, you'll
note that Chris Kubasik hasn't been on the calls because he went out and got a real job as our Chief Operating Officer
and he's been doing an excellent job in focusing on the execution of programs like THAAD as well as assuring that
we're listening carefully to the needs of customers.
When we look at the Middle East, and you start with an assessment of the security climate there, I think many people
look at the Iranians with respect to their actions and their intentions even in the most recent discussions about the
prospect of closing the straights of Straits of Hormuz; and it creates a very high level of tension and people recognize
that they have invested in the kind of technologies that include ballistic missile threats and therefore many in the region
who have population centers, who have oil production centers, who have strategic areas of interest view missile defense
as a very critical system. So that as we look at the national security strategy that was outlined by the President and the
Secretary when they talk about increasing security cooperation partnerships movement as you highlighted by the
United Arab Emirates here with that, I think if you look across the – generally the Gulf Coordinating Council regions
you would see, I think, a similar level of threat and risk and a similar desire on the part of our administration to lean
forward.
Now you know we follow a very discrete process here that starts with government to government discussions first and
nothing that we would say or do would subvert that process, but in the longer term I suspect there'll be heightened
continued interest. I think those interests will be viewed favorably by our government. And I think we'll have a
maturing portfolio in the Middle East with regard to missile defense.
I think there'll be a similar version of that experience throughout the Asia-Pacific theater because we're watching the
same or similar type of overall security risk, the proliferation of technologies, the desire to get missiles of greater
performance, longer range, more precision, and the desire for governments to have some protection against that
ballistic missile threat. So I think this segment of our portfolio is one that we'll likely grow internationally. Our focus is

on making sure that we're executing the requirements under the contract, that the technology stays robust and there was
a question earlier that – about research and development or how are you investing, but we want to make sure that we
have resources available to think in terms of next generation technology and how can we adapt, how can we provide
adjuncts to this system. Maybe it's greater range, maybe it's pay load, but to continue evolve these systems. And we
think that's a very smart way to address the demands in the global security environment.
Of course, you need to mature a portfolio to start with before you can evolve that portfolio as the dynamics in the
global security environments unfold themselves and we can address them. And I'm very pleased that we have the kind
of portfolio; you mentioned THAAD, we have it in Aegis, we have it in PAC-3 in our missile defense portfolio that
forms a really good basis where some incremental investment can not only satisfy customer needs today, but satisfy
them tomorrow and can enable us to adapt the system for regional demands around the globe.

Yes, sir. Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS Securities.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Afternoon, guys.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Just a couple of little things. Bruce, I don't think you specifically said the tax rate you're
looking for 2012. And then back on F-35 in terms of the mix, could you maybe break out percentage-wise on the
production side how much of the revenues base you think in 2012 will be LRIP 2 aircraft versus 3 versus 4?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I'll answer the – I'll answer the easy one first, David. The tax rate for 2012 is – right now
we're looking about 30%. That excludes, obviously, the effects of the R&D tax credit but for planning purposes think
about 30%.
Relative to your question on the split of the LRIP, I'll remind you this is a contract that we're – the LRIP contracts
themselves are contracts that we're booking on a percentage of completion basis so there's very little cost, I'll say, for
the LRIP 2 aircraft relative to – and it's not proportional to taking simply LRIP 2 aircraft divided by the total because
those – the costs to build those aircraft, similar to what I was describing on the F-22 program, are kind of behind us.
They're out of the factory; they're going through flight testing and the like. And so it's difficult to parse that out. Off the
top of my head I'll say for the total LRIP activity, that's heavily, heavily dominated by LRIP 3 and LRIP 4 activity,
which you would probably expect in 2011. And that will shift over in 2012 to be LRIP 4 and LRIP 5 and a similar
pattern all the way through future years.
