Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2014 earnings
conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief
Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta
Stewart.
Norfolk Southern's earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share compared with $1.41 last year, which as you will
recall included a land sale that added $0.19 per share. Of course, our results during the quarter were impacted by the
severe winter weather, which adversely affected both revenues and expenses. This year's results also included a
deferred tax benefit related to a state tax reduction. Don and Marta will provide additional details in their remarks.
Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. Overall volumes
fell 1% as declines [indiscernible] (02:49) merchandise more than offset the growth in intermodal units. Expenses were
down 1% despite the added costs from the winter weather.
On the service side, we also saw the effects of the adverse weather as our favorable trends from last year were
temporarily reversed in the first quarter. While our velocity and terminal dwell metrics deteriorated in the first quarter,
we have seen them improve in the recent weeks and expect these trends will continue as we enter into spring and
warmer weather. Mark will provide the details of the first quarter operating results.
At this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team and I'll return with some closing remarks before
we take your questions. Don?
Donald W. Seale
Thanks, Wick, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was down $49 million or 2%
compared to first quarter of last year as a $94 million decline in our coal market more than offset revenue gains
achieved in intermodal and merchandise. Negative mix and price accounted for $38 million of the overall revenue
decline for the quarter, and lower volume due primarily to the severe winter weather conditions, generated a negative
$32 million in revenue variance. On the plus side, higher fuel surcharge contributed a positive $21 million in revenue
year-over-year.
Turning to revenue per unit, merchandise RPU showed the greatest increase due to continued growth in chemicals,
increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. Intermodal RPU showed a marginal increase of 1%, despite a slight
decline in fuel surcharge per unit. As a reminder, intermodal fuel surcharges are tied to East Coast highway diesel
prices rather than West Texas intermediate crude. Coal continues to be impacted by negative mix effects related to the
decline in export coal volume. In total, revenue per unit per quarter for our book of business was down 1%.
With respect to volume, turning to the next line, total shipments for the quarter were down 1% as intermodal gains were
unable to offset declines in merchandise, and especially in coal. Within all of our markets, extreme winter conditions
across the network impacted customer production levels as well as equipment cycle times, which suppressed overall

first quarter volume.
As shown on Slide 5, the impact of severe winter weather was concentrated in January and February, with March
showing a fairly strong recovery. Mark will fill you in on the details of the operational challenges faced during winter,
but clearly severe weather in the quarter depressed certain economic activity and shipments in the first two months of
the year in particular.
Now turning to the individual market segments, coal revenue of $541 million was down $94 million or 15% for the
quarter. Within the utilities sector, volume declined by approximately 21,000 loads or 10% while volumes to southern
utilities held pace with first quarter 2013 volumes. Volumes to northern utilities climbed by 17%, primarily as a result
of a contract loss.
Export volumes, impacted by a continued weak pricing environment, were down 23% for the quarter due to reduced
metallurgical coal shipments both through Baltimore and Lambert's Point. Domestic metallurgical volumes were down
16% as a result of reduced customer demand related to plant shutdowns or production curtailments. And on a positive
note, industrial coal volumes were up 9% as a result of new business gain.
Now turning next to our intermodal network, revenue in intermodal in the quarter went to $596 million, up $23 million
or 4% over first quarter of last year, driven by a 3% higher volume. Domestic volume was up 4% due to continued
highway conversions and customer specific growth, while organic growth across our international accounts increased
by 1%. As weather and network operations improved in the quarter, we had two record-breaking weeks for inter-modal
shipments in the month of March.
Now turning to our Merchandise Markets on Slide 8, merchandise revenue was up 1% reaching $1.6 billion for the
quarter. This increase came as a result of higher revenue per unit for the quarter, which was up 3%. Iron, steel, and
scrap metal shipments were impacted by sourcing changes and a weaker overall market for scrap metal. Declines were
partially offset by gains in frac sand and cement shipments, leading to an overall 3% decline in metals and construction
volume in the quarter.
In our agricultural markets, strength in our corn and wheat markets was unable to offset declines in fertilizer volumes
compared to strong 2013 level comps and shifts in sourcing patterns reduced volumes of feed products due to the return
of normalized soybean availability in the new crop. On the plus side, chemicals volume was up 10%, due primarily to
growth in crude by rail which accounted for over 20,000 shipments in the quarter as well as gains in liquefied
petroleum gas volumes.
Automotive volumes were down 6% as weather-related issues across the U.S. rail network impacted empty multi-level
equipment supply and reduced loading capacity. And paper and forest products volumes were down 5% for the quarter
with weaker volumes of graphic paper and waste shipments.
Now let's conclude with our outlook for 2014. We see ongoing growth opportunities in our intermodal and merchandise
markets while the coal market continues to present both challenges and opportunities. On the plus side for coal,
extreme winter weather patterns improved the demand for utility coal with stockpile days at Norfolk Southern served
plants falling an estimated 34% from December. Additionally, natural gas prices are projected to be higher in 2014,
creating orders from utilities for additional spot coal volumes. We now expect our utility business to be flat with 2013
in spite of the year over year loss of about a 4 million ton contract loss in our northern utility network.
In the export market, we continue to see depressed export coal volumes and pricing due to lower commodity pricing
and increased foreign competition. And in our domestic metallurgical markets, we expect reduced volumes as a result
of plant closures and sourcing shifts.
Turning to our intermodal markets, our outlook remains bright there as we continue to add attractive freight to our new
corridors and terminals. The South Carolina Inland Port opened in the fourth quarter of 2013 and our new Charlotte
terminal officially opened in December 2013. Highway conversions and growth with our international shipping
partners represent ongoing opportunities and we will remain strongly focused on delivering superior intermodal service
and efficiencies across our double stack intermodal network.

In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued strength in crude by rail as well as shale-related liquid petroleum
gas shipments. Frac sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions are
also expected to increase. Within our metals markets, U.S. steel production is projected to expand by an estimated 5%
during 2014 due to increased steel usage in the auto sector and the recovering construction market.
In Automotive, automotive production will continue to grow as North American light vehicle production is projected to
increase by 3% to over 17 million vehicles in 2014. Also, as the national rail network improves velocity in the days
ahead, we expect deferred auto volumes to be shipped, which will bolster overall automotive volumes ahead.
In our Agricultural markets, with the favorable grain crop and stronger ethanol market, we expect ongoing growth in
these market segments for the balance of 2014. And finally, within our Paper and Forest products markets, we continue
to be challenged by the contraction of graphic paper consumption but see favorable conditions for lumber and related
wood products with projected improvements in the housing market.
In summary, we expect our Merchandise and Intermodal markets to generate overall revenue growth ahead with a
better outlook for utility coal, while export coal continues to present challenges. And as we recover from the
abnormally harsh winter, we are focusing on returning service to 2013 levels or better, which our customers expect and
deserve. We'll also continue to employ market based pricing that equals or exceeds rail inflation to support significant
investments in our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities; and we will remain laser-focused on developing new
markets by working collaboratively with our customers throughout our network.
Thanks for your time and I'll now turn it over to Mark, who will provide you the specifics of our first quarter
operations. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. Our first quarter operations were a weather impact story. The series of
winter storms across our service territory has been well covered by the media so there's no need to give you a
blow-by-blow timeline here today, but you'll see the impact has been felt in safety, service and productivity.
Our people, however, have done an exceptional job keeping our operations going through it all. Many of them worked
in extreme conditions and I'd like to acknowledge particularly the commitment of our transportation, mechanical and
engineering forces and even our operations support staff in Atlanta, who never missed a beat during an ice storm that
pretty much shut down the city.
Looking at our safety performance, we saw an increase in the injury ratio from 1.17 for a full year of 2013 to 1.37 for
the first quarter of 2014. This is tracking the same numbers we experienced in the second half of 2013. Some of the
increase is, no doubt, due to the operating conditions over the period and we did see an improvement in March, as
weather began to improve. We continue to focus on a transition to a behavior-based approach to improved safety and to
secure full engagement and commitment from all of our employees in reducing injuries. Training for our entire
company will be completed by the end of the second quarter.
Train incidents were flat at 2.4 incidents per million train miles for both full year 2013 and the first quarter 2014.
Crossing accidents increased slightly from 3.6 per million train miles for full year 2013 to 3.9 per million train miles in
the first quarter. And again, the increases are related primarily to storm related occurrences.
Turning to service performance, after two years of very strong service performance, the recent shocks from severe
winter weather and the resulting reduction in network velocity have had a significant impact on service this quarter.
The composite service metric, which combines train performance and connection performance, dropped to 73.4%
reflecting slower train operations and increased dwell time at terminals in the areas impacted by weather.
On the next slide, slower train operations are reflected in train speed, which was 22.3 miles per hour for the first quarter
2014. While higher than [indiscernible] (15:03) in 2010 and 2011, [indiscernible] (15:06) below the high performance
levels in 2012 and 2013. Velocity drives many of our operating efficiencies and is our key area of focus in our recovery

from the impact of weather issues in the first quarter.
Looking at terminal dwell, the impact of extreme temperatures and record snowfall took a toll on locomotive
availability in the first quarter, resulting in higher Bad Order Rates and a slower overall network velocity.
Consequently, terminal dwell in the first quarter increased to 25 hours; again, much higher than the record performance
for the last two years.
Moving to the next slide, we've talked before about the relationship between network velocity and operating
efficiencies. As you would expect, the weather resulting slow-down in our network had a negative impact on many of
our key measures of operating efficiency in the first quarter. Volumes were down 1% from the same period last year.
Crew starts were down 4%, due in part to reduced volumes but also due to train annulments and combos made due to
power availability. T&E overtime increased 9% and re-crews increased 5% due to slower over the road operations.
Carloads per unit declined 3%, due primarily to reduced train length requirements caused by extreme cold
temperatures. And diesel gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles increased 4% partly because engines were left running
during extremely cold temperatures to avoid freeze damage. With improving weather, we're seeing improving trends in
some leading measurements and would expect that this will also be reflected in network velocity over the coming
weeks.
On the next slide, the impact of weather on our locomotive fleet has been particularly difficult. While weather related
issues pushed the Bad Order Ratio to higher levels, we started seeing improvements in mid-March with bad order
locomotive counts declining, shown here as the blue line. Similarly, as the red line indicates, we've seen trains held for
power decline. The reduction in the Bad Order Ratio and the increase in power availability will continue to drive
reduction in terminal dwell.
The next graph depicts the number of road train re-crews. With improving train speeds, the number of trains that have
to be re-crewed has come down substantially in the last few weeks.
And looking at train speed, as you can see, it's been improving since mid-February, up about 6%, and improvements
should continue. Similarly, dwell is down 14% since mid-February and we expect this metric to continue to improve as
well.
With the winter finally behind us, we're confident that we will continue to see improvement in all of our operating
metrics and we're still confident that we'll achieve productivity savings of about $100 million for the full year.
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Marta.
Marta R. Stewart
Thank you, Mark. Let's take a look at the first quarter numbers. Slide 2 presents our operating results. As Don
described, railway operating revenues decreased by $49 million or 2%. Operating expenses decreased slightly by $25
million or 1% in spite of significant additional weather-related costs. The resulting first quarter income from railway
operations was $667 million, a decline of $24 million or 3%. The operating ratio increased 40 basis points to 75.2.
Slide 3 summarizes the major types of weather-related costs. As Wick mentioned, and as you saw in Mark's
presentation, the harsher winter weather this year slowed down the [ph] rail speed (19:06). This loss of velocity, along
with additional direct costs to keep the tracks clear and our equipment running, drove expenses higher in the areas of
overtime, fuel and material services and rent. We estimate the severe weather added approximately $45 million to our
first quarter costs, about equally distributed among these three groups.
Now let's go to the details of our operating expenses. The next slide shows the components of the $25 million net
decrease in railway operating expenses. As you can see, the overall decline resulted from a reduction in compensation
and benefit costs. Slide five details of $40 million or 5% increase in compensation costs. Post-retirement medical and
pension-related expenses declined by $32 million.

On our first – fourth quarter earnings call in January, I mentioned that pension and retiring medical pools would
decline, largely due to strong equity returns and a lower discount rate. During the first quarter, we amended our retiree
medical plan to provide for fixed contributions to health reimbursement account. As a result, since the company
contribution is now limited, we expect a further reduction in our accruals. We now project expenses for pension and
post-retirement benefits to be about $40 million lower per quarter for the remainder of 2014.
Also contributing to the decrease in compensation costs were reduced labor hours, resulting primarily from lower
traffic volumes and fewer trainees. Additionally, medical costs for active employees declined due to fewer employees
and a lower premium. These three areas of reductions were somewhat offset by increased pay rates and weather-related
overtime costs.
Moving on to purchased services and rent, our costs decreased by a net of $1 million, reflecting a variety of offsetting
items. While lower locomotive and freight car lease costs and reduced professional fees benefited expenses, these were
largely offset by increased weather related costs and higher intermodal volume related expenses.
Next, depreciation expense increased by $10 million or 4%, reflective of our larger capital base. As you can see on the
left hand side of the slide, net properties have grown by about $900 million since this time last year. As shown on Slide
8, fuel expense rose by $3 million or 1%. Because of the cold weather, consumption during the quarter increased 3%
even though traffic volume was down slightly. Lower prices partly offset this headwind, as the 2014 first quarter
average diesel fuel price was $3.10 per gallon versus $3.19 in the first quarter of 2013.
The materials and other category, shown on the next slide, increased by $3 million or 1%. Once again, the weather
affected our costs with a $9 million spike in locomotive and freight car maintenance materials. This rise was somewhat
offset by lower environmental related expenses, while personal injury costs were even with last year.
Turning to our non-operating items, other income net was down $109 million, or 81%, due principally to the absence of
the $97 million land sale gain which benefited the first quarter of 2013. Lower coal royalty and lower returns on
corporate and life insurance also contributed to the decrease. Interest expense on debt was up $10 million, related to the
debt we issued last year.
Next, income tax has totaled $186 million, and the effective tax rate was 33.6% compared to 35.4% in 2013. The lower
effective rate in 2014 was due to a $20 million deferred tax reduction resulting from a tax law change in Indiana. As
you may recall, last year's effective rate included a $9 million reduction from tax law changes.
Slide 12 displays the net income and EPS comparison. Net income was $368 million, down $82 million or 18%.
Diluted earnings per share was $1.17, down $0.24 or 17%. As I mentioned moments ago, and as shown here in the light
blue, last year's result included a large land sale. Excluding that gain, this year's net income is 6% lower and earnings
per share is 4% lower.
Wrapping up the quarterly overview, cash from operations was $588 million, covering capital spending, and producing
$207 million in free cash flow. We distributed $167 million in dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. Cash
and short term investments at the end of the period totaled $1.5 billion.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Well, as you've heard, we had what I would describe as a solid quarter given the weather across our service territory.
While we did incur some additional expenses in our train operations year-over-year, our people did a terrific job of
keeping our operations fluid under very trying conditions.
Our resilience and the resilience of our network is evidenced by the metrics which Mark showed you, indicating that
our operations are improving steadily. It will take us several more weeks to achieve the service levels that we
maintained last year and our progress will be at least partly dependent on the state of the rest of the North American rail
network, but we're confident in our ability to reach those levels and continue to recognize operating productivity

savings for the balance of the year.
As Don told you, we also see strength across much of our book of business for the balance of 2014. Coal continues to
be the wild card with utility volumes more stable but export volumes more certain. We are optimistic that overall
economic conditions will drive continued growth in most of our other business segments.
Our goals remain unchanged: to offer superior levels of service to our customers through highly efficient and effective
operations; and in doing so, to continue to drive superior returns to our shareholders. We have a great team at Norfolk
Southern and I'm highly confident of our ability to do just that.
Thanks, and we'll open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, we'll now be conducting the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Due to the number of
analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question
to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey Don, can I ask you to talk a little about
the intermodal markets? We all know we have a tight truck market; how much is the lag before you feel like you can
start to take advantage of this, both in volume and price terms?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Bill. With respect to truckload capacity and truckload pricing, we're seeing
encouraging trends, as you well know, in the first quarter. And also, as you know, a lot of our negotiations by our third
parties and intermodal parties, our partners, are negotiated in the first quarter for the year. So we are encouraged by
where truck capacity and truck pricing is right now and we think we will get some uplift in intermodal pricing as a
result of that as the year takes place.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Wick, can I ask you a question about the STB? We've got some hearings coming up
where they'll address revenue adequacy. What should we expect, or what can we hope for? What will you guys be
trying to get across to them in those hearings?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I'm not sure we know exactly what to expect. They've scheduled this hearing.
We'll certainly, as an industry and as Norfolk Southern, be making the case that revenue adequacy needs to be
considered in terms of the long-term replacement costs for our industry rather than just the way it's computed today.
And we'll also certainly be making the case that to the extent that we have been able to earn better returns as an
industry over the past 10 to 15 years, we have taken those earnings and invested very heavily in all of our networks,
with the result being that the industry is in far better physical condition than it was some years ago. Our service levels
are far better. We're taking a lot of trucks off the highway and we're accomplishing a lot of things that are good for the
country as well as our industry. So I think we have a great case as we go into this and we'll be making it very
vigorously.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Does the experience of the first quarter suggest that there are choke points in the system that
require more investment? Do you have to up CapEx?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think that the experience of the first quarter was certainly considerably out of
the ordinary. We did see issues as, you know, as everyone has commented. We certainly saw issues around Chicago,
but I will say that we saw issues on other parts of our network and at other interchanges as well. And there's always the
need for more infrastructure and more investment.
I think that what the first quarter also made the case for is that the last thing in the world that we need to be doing right
now is looking or having conversations about the possibly of decreasing our capacity through things like opening new

interchanges which in fact are not effective interchanges. So I think there were some cautionary tales in the first
quarter. I think there will be a lot of learning on the part of all the carriers, but it's certainly argued that the rail industry
needs to continue the course that it's been on for the past 10 years of constant investment in infrastructure and capacity
and service.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yep. All right. Thanks for the time.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Bill.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With the improvement in the merchandise
and intermodal segments, which are generally thought of as having pretty solid incremental margins, do you think that
within the context of an improving industrial environment you can return to, roughly, 60% contribution margins similar
to what you saw in 2013? Or will you need to add resources in terms of head count or equipment to handle the volumes
that you are anticipating?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Allison, it's a great question. I think I would tell you that right now, we feel pretty
comfortable that we have the resources that we need to add the volumes that we're anticipating this year and in out
years without adding significant resources. We have invested a lot in over the past number of years in adding capacity
and reducing pinch points on the network. We monitor our train and engine forces and mechanical and engineering
forces very closely and do a lot of modeling to project what we're going to need based on our traffic forecast.
We have a good locomotive fleet; we're adding more locomotives this year. We have a well-maintained fleet. So I think
we're pretty comfortable that we're not going to need significantly – any significant addition in resources to handle the
business that we think is coming our way.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, great. And then as a follow-up question, you mentioned that you're seeing pretty
strong growth in your – in LPG movements. I just wanted to ask what you think sort of the longer term opportunity set
for Norfolk is in terms of potentially moving NGLs from the Utica or wet Marcellus down to the Gulf Coast.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Allison, we see continued strong growth opportunity in NGLs. Our first quarter volume was
up 43% in that business. Now some of that was weather related, but we see continued opportunities both in Marcellus
and Utica not only for shipments to the Gulf, but shipments within our network from the south to the north and a
developing export market for butanes and propanes as well.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. Very interesting. Thank you so much.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Allison.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. So wanted to ask about coal yields a little bit first; I'm not sure if
you mentioned it, were there any liquidated damages of note in the quarter? And then, Don, can you help us think about
the direction of coal yields either year over year or sequentially from the first quarter? Lot of moving parts with export
maybe getting worse, less northern utility coal, maybe that's positive for mix. I'm not sure if you guys had to lower
export rates further in second quarter given the lower benchmarks. So, like I said, a lot of moving parts; if you can give
some color there, that would be great.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Very good question and the key word there is a lot of moving parts. In terms of the mix
within coal, as I mentioned, we had a decline in our northern utility base, while our southern utility business was flat.
And then the export business, I will tell you our thermal business held up year-over-year better than our metallurgical
coal, which is higher revenue per unit. So within coal, within the export segment, we had a negative mix effect of less
metallurgical shipment activity and stable thermal coal activity.
With respect to the liquidated damages, we did not have any material LDs in the quarter. So – and your other question
about pricing; our pricing was relatively stable on export coal sequentially from the fourth quarter through the first
quarter. I will tell you that the metallurgical market has deteriorated further since the fourth quarter and moving
through the first quarter. And we are taking a look at that with our customers and we're continuing to try to keep our
customers, our met coal and thermal coal shippers, competitive in their markets to the extent that we can actually
impact them. And with world markets and currency exchange activity being what they are, that's a difficult task for us.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Do you think we should expect some pressure on coal yield sequentially then, because of that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: On first quarter to second quarter on met coal, I think we will see some pressure on yield.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then, just a second question, the labor costs, particularly given weather, just really
impressive; how do we think about head count down 4%, comp per employee down 1% going forward? Can those run
rates continue all year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we obviously pay a lot of attention to that in terms of trying to manage our
head count. I think that as we look at additional volumes in the year, you may see some slight addition to our train and
engine work force. We still have a number of folks furloughed; we'd like to get them back, clearly, if we can get them
in the locations where we need them. But I don't see any significant pressure to increase head count other than in that
regard. I'm looking at Mark. Mark, you've...
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No, that's absolutely right. And with the – there's been a lot of good work done in the
engineering mechanical areas with some reduction through attrition and we may see a little bit more of that, but it will
be pretty steady through the rest of the year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And on the comp per employee side?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, the comp per employee is what it is for the – by contract. So I...
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: But I think looking at it in total, Scott, there's the two pieces; of course the wage rates, as
Wick mentioned, would put it up. And then the pension and post-retirement, where the accrual goes the other way.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Right. And Marta's given you the run rate on that and then I'm trying to remember
what – the contract wage increase this year is 3%, plus or minus. That's baked in, so that's the way we would look at it.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. All right, great. That's good to know. Okay. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a question on sort of the volume opportunity as you
move here into the second quarter. How much do you think you maybe left on the table revenue wise because of the
weather in the first quarter that maybe gets made up and how do you think about the cadence of potentially making that
up? Does it happen all in the second quarter, or do you sort of see this sort of play out over the course of the next two
quarters or so?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Chris. Good question. As I mentioned in my comments, we started to see a
recovery in volumes in March relative to January and February. We did our best to estimate what the weather impact
was on total shipment activity in our network versus what we expected in the first quarter. We came to a number of
about 30,000 shipments that were not handled as a result of the weather. Our best estimate is that we will handle about
12,000 loads of deferred business to make up that. So if you look at average revenue per unit in the first quarter across
the book of business, we're talking about $18 million to $20 million of make-up.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, that's very helpful. And then I guess just thinking on the other side of the income
statement on the cost side, Marta, I think you mentioned $45 million of costs associated with weather. As we're sort of
ramping up and getting fluidity back to the network in the second quarter, do we see any of that linger around? Do we
have to kind of worry about any incremental costs as you're getting crews ramped back up and getting those volumes
sort of moving through the network again?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: No, I don't really think so, except for the small ramp up in T&E employees, which Mark and
Wick described. The rest of the expenses that we incurred on that $45 million were just related to the weather, so
they're mostly gone now. And as Mark reiterated, his group is still expecting to stay on target for their productivity
improvements for the second through the fourth quarter, and so we are still expecting to actually reduce expenses in
many of the operating areas.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much for the time; appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: [indiscernible] (40:16) Real quick here, when I'm looking at your intermodal network, we're
seeing obviously a lot of tightness in truckload continue here into the second quarter. Where are you at in terms of
capacity and do you think you'll be expanding the network in terms of adding any facilities this year?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Good morning. With respect to the intermodal capacity, as you most likely know, we
completed most of the [indiscernible] (40:45) activity with respect to new terminals and expanding terminals by the end
of 2013 and with Charlotte being the last facility that was opened in December. So we have very good capacity
throughout the network and we are focused on filling that network up with quality revenue with respect to new
shipments.
I will tell you that in the first quarter, our Crescent Corridor volumes were up 10% and our Heartland Corridor was up
about 9%, so we're pleased with the volume growth activity in the corridors, but we have sufficient capacity to grow
over the next four to five years before we actually start layering in additional investment.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. That's fantastic color. That's what I was getting at. And I guess my follow up question,
Marta, you mentioned you had a tax gain in the quarter but you said that was due to a tax law change, so I'm assuming
that is going to impact us going forward. Can you give us a little more color around what we should expect?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, Jason, that was actually deferred taxes and so I'm actually glad you asked that question
because it doesn't go forward. What it is, is the State of Indiana changed their laws and said beginning in 2016 they're
going to reduce their state taxes so what we have to do at that time is adjust our deferred taxes that are already on our
books, so that's a one-time thing. That adjusted the deferred tax liability. So going forward through the second to the
fourth quarter, I think we're still looking at our normalized, about 37.5% effective tax rate.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Fantastic. That's what I was getting at. All right guys, I appreciate the time as always.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Good morning. Just wanted to ask with regard to intermodal, are you seeing any signs that
suggest that intermodal might be inflecting? I mean, obviously a lot of this good growth is coming from the highway to
rail and international seems to be still challenged. I'm wondering if you're seeing anything to give us some prospect of
recovery in that side.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning. With respect to international, I think we had a consumer demand impact in
the first quarter, particularly in those first two months of the first quarter. We saw our international shipment activity
pick up materially in March. It continues to pick up materially in the range of about 7% in April, so we think
international growth this year is going to be high. And of course, highway conversions in the domestic segment will
continue.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. Great. And then, can you comment on what percentage of your intermodal is up for
renewal or is exposed to spot?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We are – as of today, we are at about two-thirds of our book of business for intermodal that's
priced for 2014, so that leaves us that 32% to 33%, about a third, that are subject to further price activity. And I will tell
you, a lot of that is in our EMP container fleet.

Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Hey. Good morning everyone. Wick, I wanted to ask a more longer term question.
You've had a few years here of declining coal revenues and your top-line growth hasn't been as impressive as some of
your western peers or Canadian peers. And obviously the margin improvement for the other carriers outside of the East
Coast has been pretty robust. Is this finally the turning point where Norfolk can start to see some pretty robust return
improvement as well? I mean the top-line outlook from Wick seems pretty impressive and coal is a third less than what
it used to be now.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think as we said earlier, we do feel good about our volume prospects and our
business prospects going forward. We hear similar comments from our customers. So on that side, as you said, I think
we're optimistic. In terms of margin improvement, something we've been focused on for a long time and you can see
some of the results in terms of what we've been able to do in terms of controlling expenses and doing additional things
on the productivity side.
You know, the characteristics of railroads are different depending on the service territory, and the west doesn't always
look like the east, but I will say that we are very, very focused on growing the top-line and bringing more and more of
that to the bottom line every year. I feel good about all of the initiatives that Mark and his team have underway. I feel
very good about the service levels that we're offering to our customers and so we continue to be optimistic.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, I appreciate that. And as a follow-up, Don, given the outlook and what you're
sharing from your customers right now, do you think that there's a time where NSC's going to see growth above GDP,
for the first time in a couple of years?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Certainly I think in our intermodal markets and our merchandise markets across the segments,
we have an opportunity this year to do just that. Coal is going to be the wild card and we're very encouraged with
respect to utility coal; we think it's going to be better than what we thought it was going to be in December, for sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks, and good morning. My first question I had, I was wondering if you could talk about your
access to equipment as it relates to those locomotives and freight cars. Are you comfortable with the equipment
capacity you have today, or is that something that could be a potential limiting factor to your volume growth as you
look out over the remainder of 2014?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We feel – we do feel good about it. We're in good shape, as Wick said a little bit ago. We got
– we received 25 locomotives the first quarter, we've got another 50 coming in the second half, and we're sized in good
shape for all of our rolling equipment, so we feel good about it.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We – just to add to that comment, we do want to see our utilization of the equipment continue
to improve as the national network improves its service. We've been impacted in terms of equipment supply by slower
cycle times during the first quarter. I mentioned automotive equipment. We also had some other impacts with metals
equipment, things like that. So as the networks recover and ours ramp up, we will see more capacity in our equipment
fleet by nature of turning to cars at an equal cycle to last year or better.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, great. That's helpful. And as my second question, I think I've heard you say recently that on
the intermodal side you expect volume growth could be in the 5% to 10% range, as you look out over the next several
years. Could you talk about how much of that you expect to be driven by conversion activity versus just growth in your
existing customer base? Is it a 50/50 split, or what does that look like?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we generally don't project what we think the volume increases will be over
time. I will tell you that the highway conversion opportunity is a large opportunity, with a lot of shipment and revenue
moving over the highway, so we still see that as the number one opportunity for growth ahead. And we, of course, we
will continue to see organic growth with our international customers based on consumer demand and consumption as
well. And growth with existing domestic customers so, by far, the largest growth opportunity ahead is highway to rail.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, great, I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Hi. Good morning. If we could just step back a little bit on the – Don, you mentioned on the
mix in pricing, we're down; and I know you went into detail before on the coal side, but was mix a bigger issue or did
we see actual pricing contract a little bit? I just want to understand the contributors here given, obviously, a low
inflation and a lot – I guess a portion tied to inflation indices but just wanted to understand how do you look at pure
pricing in this environment?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ken, with respect to the overall price mix equation, mix was the driver. We did not have any
price degradation, as I mentioned, in our export coal markets. Price was essentially equal with fourth quarter
sequentially to the first quarter. Mix within coal certainly was a driver as our Lambert's Point metallurgical shipments

were off by about 30%, close to that; or 23% was the actual number. But when you look sequentially, we saw
metallurgical coal drop off from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we saw thermal coal stay stable, which
thermal, as you know, has a lower revenue per unit which drives next.
Also in a larger sense of the overall book, as we continue to grow intermodal shipments and coal shipments are down,
that's the ultimate in negative mix. So I know you'll keep that in mind, but no, we did not have any change in our
pricing structure. We did have a lot of impact on the mix side.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: I meant more – you already went over the coal, I meant more in the other stuff, so in terms
of within any of the other commodities like you explained in coal were there any other major things? I guess like you –
as you mentioned on the intermodal side outpacing coal, but was there anything on the merchandise that would mask
some of that change as well?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, Ken...
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Whether it's longer haul shifts?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, let me give you a couple of examples. And we're going to see this throughout the year
with our agricultural market. Last year, as you know, we had a crop that was robust starting August/September but the
comps are coming off of a year where we had a drought and we had a very, very suppressed corn supply, so we were
hauling long haul corn over the Chicago gateway into processors at Decatur, Illinois, into the southeast.
Now, with the grain crop being good from September/October of last year, that has reverted back to normalized
patterns where we are running gathering trains to Decatur that are 75 to 100 miles long as opposed to bringing that corn
over to Chicago from Iowa and Nebraska. So that's a great example of – that's going to continue as normalized patterns,
replace unusual patterns for grain shipment. So that's negative mix in the ag market.
In terms of other merchandise activity, I will tell you that our crude oil was up about 60% in the first quarter in our
chemical group. And while our chemical group had good performance with RPU and volume, as we've indicated in the
past our crude RPU is less than our chemical RPU on average. So it is a negative mix driver within chemicals. And I
could go on, but yes there's a lot of moving parts, mix overall in merchandise was not positive, it was negative. And it
certainly was negative in coal. And as we add more intermodal to the overall book of business, that is a negative mix
indicator quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: That's a great run down. That's exactly what I was looking for. Just, I guess, two quick ones
together, but on export, I know you tend to shy away from giving forecasts but could you see, given where the market
prices are now, could you see that a sub 20 million ton year given the pace of declines? And then I guess a quick one
for Marta; you've got $1.5 billion on hand. Any comments on what your plans are for that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: On the export we're just going to have to see how it progresses. It is a very, very unstable
market right now because of foreign competition, foreign demand in China softening. You know all those factors, I'm
sure, but it's – we'll just have to see how it progresses.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: And on the cash level that we have, we do have a lot of cash on hand, $1.5 billion as you
noted. And we still have our same order of spending which, as Wick mentioned, first of all is investing in the business
and then dividends and then share repurchases. And the amount is somewhat elevated because we had two debt
issuances last year, trying to capture the low interest rate which we didn't know would last so far into this year. But
other than that, other than a little extra carry that we have from that, we still are going to continue our strategy of trying
to, for the long term, get our debt structure set up so that we have a good weighted average interest rate for the
company.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: I appreciate the time. Thanks for the insight.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. My question I guess is on the regulatory side
with regards to crude by rail. Up here in Canada, they just released indications today that they will be requiring about
111 cars to be pushed out of service in a two to three year timeframe. That seems like a little bit quicker than I think the
industry was expecting in terms of cycling out of the DOT-111s. Do you see that as impacting your business in crude,
talking to your crude by rail customers, your interchange partners? Is 2 years to 3 years going to put a strain on the car
manufactures to be able to bring in the new generation of those tank cars and therefore limit the potential upside that
you see in the volume growth in crude by rail going forward?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, it's certainly an issue and we had heard that there would be something coming
out along the lines you mentioned in Canada. I think that we're going to have to remain – it remains to be seen what the
regulators do down here in terms of the phase out of the 111s. If it's a very rapid phase out, it's clearly going to be an
issue. There are a lot of tank cars being built to the 12-32 standard right now; there's clearly going to be a change in that
standard at some point or another as well and I think we're all just watching to see what happens.
But it's very clear that if the regulators aren't thoughtful about what they're doing and looking at how we can get
enough of the newer cars into the fleet that it could be a limiting impact on the shipment of crude by rail. So we'll just
watch and see what happens in the U.S. and what the regulators come up with. But it is clearly something to be
concerned about and watchful about.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And two to three years would qualify as that very limiting timeframe?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I would have to go back and look at the projected production of the current car
standard, but as I said, that standard will change as well. But I think that timeframe would probably present some
problems.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah, thanks for that. My second question, I guess, is more on a longer term. I guess, Marta,
you mentioned investing in your business is the first order priority. If you take a step back, and I know you did this
with your intermodal business a number of years ago, and looked at pinch points within your southern corridors and
decided to invest in there to expand your [indiscernible] (58:05) capacity.
If you take that same kind of approach and – I don't know if Mark, you're the best one to answer this, if you look at
your pinch points, I got a sense from Wick that perhaps Chicago, and correct me if I'm wrong, is not as big a problem
for you as it was at least in terms of the commentary, sounded like the Canadian rails and Burlington Northern are
suffering a little bit more from Chicago than the others. If you take a step back, where are your pinch points and where
could we see any let's call it meaningful capital dollars going towards in terms of those pinch points?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah, well as far as Chicago, we have fared pretty well in Chicago, actually. When you say
pinch points, when I think about that, we have been for, what – since 2004, 2005 we have every year very deliberately
been investing in additional infrastructure. And these days, with the kind of tools that you have in order to really
identify the spots that will make a big difference to you: we add a little bit of double track; we lengthen sidings; we add
sidings; we put in crossings. And you put them in the areas surgically where it really gets you a lot of bang for your
buck.
So we've done that every year for at least 10 years, and when you do that over a period of time, it's got the effect of
really ramping up your capacity so that's something we've really enjoyed as far as helping us with fluidity. And we'll
continue to do that, so that's a very good thing. So at this point, I wouldn't say we have any spots that we're really
particularly worried about.
We're looking, with the computer modeling we do, we look out three years and we try to look out a little further than
that; but realistically speaking, we try to look out three years with our modeling and we anticipate where those areas
are. That's what we'll continue to do.

Our latest project that we've got on the books, Belleview, that's a significant spend and we are virtually doubling the
capacity up at Belleview because the forecasting tells us, and what we're currently experiencing is, that that's where a
lot of traffic wants to go, up in that northern Ohio area, so that'll be a big help to us. So we will keep planning ahead

<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back on the loss of
the, I think you said 4 million ton Northern Appalachian utility contract. Wanted to understand if the coal is moving
maybe by water, or whether that was a natural gas substitution situation, or whether the coal supplier changed or
whether it was an aggressive pricing action on the part of a rail competitor?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning John. It's PRB Coal coming over Chicago, and it was rail-to-rail competition.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: But you don't think that's indicative of a heating up of a price competition in the utility coal
market?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We don't see that as an indicator of that, but obviously it's a competitive market and we
continue to monitor all conditions in the market.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Got it. There's been a lot written in the press here lately about the possibility of a West Coast
strike, the port workers out there perhaps shutting things down around mid-year. Have you seen shippers begun to take
steps to protect themselves, perhaps by shipping more freight to East Coast ports? Is that underway currently? Or is it
too early to make a call on that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: John, we think it's too early to make the call with respect to the ILWU negotiation on the
West Coast. But I will say that we're continuing to see robust growth in our all-water international service to the East
Coast. And that's been an ongoing trend, as we've reported previously, but we're seeing robust growth over our East
Coast ports.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: And just to follow along on that, any thoughts, perhaps new thoughts on what may happen
when ultimately the Panama Canal is finished and the larger vessels can proceed through the canal to the East Coast
ports?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, you know, we know that that will take place late 2015, maybe early 2016 now. In the
ensuing time, we're seeing more activity with the larger vessels coming through the Suez Canal to the East Coast ports
that can take – that can accommodate the large draft vessels, like the Port of Virginia, Norfolk or Baltimore – those are
the two that can do that right now. Chinese production is changing with labor cost and productivity changing in China,
and we're seeing more of those goods coming to the U.S. from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia. And as that shift in
production continues, we expect the Suez activity to continue to grow to the East Coast, which we're seeing very solid
signs of that today.
So, bottom line, the Panama Canal completion, it will be material with respect to being able to handle the larger
vessels. We expect to see more large, or Cape-size export coal vessels, for example, go through the Panama Canal. But
the question mark is just how – what kind of an impact it will make on containerization and containerships with that
shifting production.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you very much.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, John.

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. As a quick follow-up to John's questions about the
potential for dockworker uncertainty on the west coast as that contract comes up for expiration toward the middle of the
summer, can you give us a sense of what customers have been saying to you, Don, about their expectations for bringing
imports in? Are they indicating they're planning on bringing freight in early as a contingency plan?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We do not have a strong indication that there's a ship ahead taking place. But with the
strength of our April international numbers, we would deduce from that that we're seeing some activity that might be
related to a shift. We're just not being told that yet by our customers.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Yeah. They typically hold those cards pretty close to their chests. Mark, as a follow-up to an
earlier question about the operating leverage potential across your network, could you give us a sense of how much
train lengths can extend on average across your merchandise network before you'll have to start adding additional train
starts?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we have had some pretty good success actually in the first quarter with adding to train
length and we actually, on the merchandise side, we've added a little bit, about 3%. On the intermodal side we added
about 5% and there's still a lot of room. And of course, the balancing trick here is you've got some trains out there that
are 10,000 feet long and you've got others that are 5,000 feet long, so we make a – our network planning people, they
do a good job and they make a deliberate effort to try to work with marketing and try to increase train length where we
can. And right now where we've got our merchandise trains somewhere in that 5,000 foot, little bit less, average length,
in nearly all cases we can go up to at least 8,000 feet. So there's a lot of room to go there and that's what we'll continue
to do.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: That's all from me. Thanks so much.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of John Mims with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Great. Thanks guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. There's been a lot of questions
on intermodal, but let me beat that horse a couple more times. When you look at the growth that you anticipate with the
southern build-out of the Crescent Corridor and the South Carolina Inland Port at Charlotte, et cetera, is there a
negative mix issue that we should be aware of from a shortening length of haul? I know you're optimistic about core
pricing increasing with truckload but do you see length of haul shortening given where the growth is coming from?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly as we continue to convert highway business within our local East network,
we're seeing length of haul opportunities that are below our average today. And also, we're seeing projects like the
inland port in South Carolina where we're using double stack efficiencies to run dedicated trains between the Port of
Charleston and Greer, South Carolina. That is well below, that's in the 240 mile, 250 mile segment, well below our
average length of haul of about 740 miles. So we're going to continue to see opportunities with double stack technology
using a network that's 98% cleared for double stack where we can convert highway business that has length of haul and
RPU characteristics that are below the average, but are highly accretive to what we are doing financially.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Right. So lower RPU but in line incremental margins for that trade?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Equal or greater.

<Q - John R. Mims>: Equal or greater, okay. And then I heard recently, I was talking to some of the container
manufacturers that the 53 foot box backlog and demand outlook for 2014 is very robust, kind of the strongest in years.
Can you talk a little about what you're buying in terms of boxes for the EMP fleet, the growth that you anticipate for
some of your key IMC partners? And then how comfortable you are, I guess on a broader term over the next couple
quarters, with U.S. domestic box capacity given that some of your big western partners are probably going to take
longer to recover; there's some sloppy capacity tied up in the West. How quickly does box capacity need to come
online to meet the growth that you anticipate from the highway conversion market?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, certainly box capacity will continue to expand this year, not only in our EMP
fleet; in our contribution we're acquiring about 2,000 containers and chassis to support that. Our western partner in
EMP, UP, is also participating in the expansion of EMP. And I will point out that our intermodal marketing partners are
also expanding their fleets in a fairly significant way. So as we add those additional units and the national network
continues to improve in terms of velocity, we think we'll have the capacity there for the growth that we had targeted for
2014. And certainly beyond 2014, we're all modeling what that growth will be and what the capacity enhancements
will need to be as well as replacements.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Given that there's been a pretty substantial step-up in 53 foot boxes orders in 2014 versus 2013,
have you seen that reflected in the prices that you're paying for the 2,000 EMP boxes?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, we had our prices committed to, so we're not seeing a price impact.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Great, thanks so much, I'll turn it back over.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. Hi, everyone. Question for Marta and then a follow-up on CapEx;
Ken Hoexter earlier asked about the $1.5 billion in cash and you do have $440 million due later this year. Following up
on your thoughts, it just seems like normally you guys hold closer to $500 million in cash and is your thought maybe to
pay off the $440 million later this year in cash and bring the cost of debt down that way? Or your share repurchase
seems a little lower than I would have thought it would have been with that kind of cash balance, can you just give us a
little bit more detail into your thoughts on making the balance sheet better and why you should have a billion dollars
more cash than normal?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, Jeff, you're right that we have, I believe in September we have a debt payoff this year
and so we're going to wait until closer to that time period to decide whether we're going to use cash on the balance
sheet or refinance that. As I said, we are a little bit high now because we had the two debt issuances last year, in order
to try to get that long-term interest rate down for the future. If we had known that interest rates were going stay low into
this spring, we would have issued that $400 million – we would have issued one of them this year.
That having been said, we always look to the capital first and Mark's folks, it's not terribly significant, but Mark's folks
did pull off a little bit on the capital work in the first quarter as they shifted resources to deal with the weather. So we'll
still expect to have the $2.2 billion capital plan for the entire year, but some of it will shifted later so some of the money
will be absorbed that way.
We announced our regular quarterly dividend yesterday, so we'll keep look – and that was at run rate same as the first
quarter. But we'll keep looking the dividend and we have a history of steadily increasing those so we'll look at the
dividend. And the share repurchases really are going to be based on what the market is doing and the alternative uses of
our cash. So truly, even though the balance is higher we have not changed our priority order and we'll just have to see
in September what we do with that debt.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. We already had you pegged for the $2.2 billion in CapEx and we've got you now
projected closer to $2 billion in cash at year-end and I guess we'll see the answer. Going to CapEx then and use of cash,

you've got the Tier 4 locomotive standards that start at the end of this year. Can you give an idea of what your thoughts
are around locomotive CapEx? And any thoughts you have on continuing down a Tier 4 locomotive path with the
current diesel versus some of the natural gas technologies that are out there that are being tested?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, it's a good question. As Mark told you, we're picking up 75 new locomotives
this year. We'll look later in the year, obviously, but it's unclear to us that we're going to move into Tier 4 in 2014. It's a
new technology. We're certainly going to want to see it prove out. We're going to look at the pricing of those
locomotives. And we're going to continue to look, as all of the carriers are, at the development work that's being done
in LNG. I think that's a very interesting and promising technology. It's probably a year or two out from being proven.
There's still regulatory issues, as you know, but I think we want to keep some powder dry in terms of that technology.
Remember at the same time that we do have a very active locomotive, road locomotive rebuild program at our shops in
Juniata. So we are this year, and this will continue for a number of years, continuing to take some of our older road
locomotives and essentially rebuilding them in kind and producing what we feel to be pretty close to a like-new
product. So that keeps our locomotive fleet rejuvenated as well. So we think we have a good, thoughtful program.
Clearly, we want to do two things. One is ensure that we have the locomotive resources to move the business
effectively but also to manage our capital as prudently as we can.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Thanks for taking the question. Don, just a question for you on intermodal rates. How
closely should we expect Norfolk's portion of that rate to track with truck rate inflation? I'm trying to think if that
should be one-for-one? Or if you'd expect some leakage to pay for the yard to door truck rate inflation it would also,
presumably, be going up.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly intermodal pricing over time will track truckload pricing. That's the lead
indicator. Of course rail-to-rail competition is present as well, but I think we certainly are optimistic that we're seeing a
truckload market that's beginning to inflect with tighter capacity and the need to improve pricing, which certainly will
support further improvement in intermodal pricing.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: It will be a little bit less than the one-for-one that you'd see in truck rate inflation?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I think it will be a little bit less than the one-for-one.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Great. And then, Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up, the $160 million kind
of year-over-year reduction in pension and post-retirement benefits, what's the baseline for that? I'm looking at $177
million was your cost last year; is that full number just coming down to $17 million for your average benefit cost this
year?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: That's correct, David. The $177 million is in our footnote and that's the total of pension and
post-retirement medical. And so the $32 million in the first quarter plus $40 million each of the next quarters would be
what you would expect that to, in total, to come down.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So if we saw rates go up again in next year, is there a chance that you could start to see
a net periodic benefit in your labor line?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, it all depends, as you know, the components of the pension depends on the discount
rate and also what our assets do. And so the amortization for years past 2015 will depend on what happens with interest
rates and with our pension plan assets, which so far this year, as you would expect, are doing very well.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Excellent. Thanks very much for the clarification.

Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Quick question on coal. You mentioned the lost coal volume with PRB. What
was the quarter's utility coal mix by source basin? And would you share your expectations for [indiscernible]
(01:17:56) the next couple years, please?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah. In terms of our mix of coal sourcing, Illinois Basin was about 18%, PRB was about
16%, Central App was a little over 40% and Northern App made up the balance.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And could you add a little color on how this shift towards more of the Western Basin is
affecting your length of haul expectations to?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, the Illinois Basin affords us with opportunities to – for extended hauls, for length of
haul; that's helping. Also, Northern App coal that is beginning to flow materially into the south, that's helping as well.
The PRB coal really doesn't change our length of haul because it's a fairly stable pattern with the Memphis Gateway,
that's gateway received traffic. And we don't see a lot of change in that ahead. So stable length of haul there, extended
length of haul on Northern App to the south as that develops, and extended hauls from Illinois basin to the South as it
develops.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean of Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. I am following up right on Keith's question with another take of the basin mix. After
the condition issues that are still lingering through this year, how do you see your mix changing? Maybe more PRB
[indiscernible] (01:19:33)? Do you see more of the Appalachian coal come into the mix? And what should that mean
for the profitability of your coal franchise this year? Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We believe that as utilities restock their stockpiles, which are down materially coming off the
winter, we believe that we'll see more Illinois basin coal going to the south. We'll see more Northern app coal flowing
into the south, into North Carolina in particular. PRB coal will expand on the margin to replenish stockpiles, primarily
in the southeast for us. And as far as the margins go, the overall mix should be favorable in utility on that incremental
business as it moves longer haul from the Illinois Basin as well as Northern App. Central App utility business still
higher cost, but we do expect some volume increases out of Central App. But we believe that increase will be less than
from Northern App and from Illinois Basin.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. And as a follow-up also on the margin issue, could you please remind us of the big
picture on margins on the operating ratio as you see the business mix evolve and adding your productivity initiatives?
We are trying to see the noise at the level of the unit price through incremental margins, and several other colleagues
have attempted this question but if you could set us straight again on how we should think of margins a few years out.
Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we have a goal, obviously, of continuing to push the operating ratio down and
our margins up. We don't forecast what that will be, but I think that we do have opportunity for some more
improvement on that and I would hope that a few years out we will have driven the operating ratio maybe down a few
points, but that's going to depend a lot on market conditions and on a lot of other factors that are out there. But the best
answer I can give you is that we're focused on trying to continue to drive the operating ratio down.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Can you highlight any one movement in business mix or one productivity initiative that should
be a main driver in improvement?

<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, I think that when you look at our business mix, it's obviously volatile in terms of
coal. We have solid growth prospects in the others, but the volatility in coal will have an impact on our overall margin.
And in terms of productivity, I think that we have a lot of initiatives underway. None of them in and of themselves are
a particularly defining moment from a productivity standpoint, but when you look at them all together they're going to
do a lot for our bottom line.

Our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James and Associates, Inc. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Hey, good morning. Hey Mark, just quickly, can you give us an update on where you are on the
movement plan to roll out, maybe when all the 11 divisions will be fully implemented? And then in the division where
you did see it implemented this year, did your network respond better, given the weather?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We will complete that project by the end of this year, or just barely into next year so we're
getting close. And we have done a good bit of analysis, looking at movement planner to determine what kind of
improvement we get in velocity; and it is still looking like we're in that 2 mile an hour to 4 mile an hour, or 10% to
20% range. And it's early, so those are approximate figures but we think that just like it's helpful during the good
weather, it's helpful during the bad weather so we think it's very promising.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay, good. And then Don, just within the domestic intermodal gains, was there kind of anything
unusual there? I know you guys don't break it out any more, but did the premium traffic perform better than usual? I
just noted that your TOFC volumes are pretty good.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yes, we had a significant increase in our premium and LTL traffic in the first quarter. This
ranged from UPS, to FedEx, to the various less than truckload carriers.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: And just real quickly, do you expect that to continue and how does that impact yield?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We expect further growth in our business for parcel activity and LTL.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Perfect, thanks.
