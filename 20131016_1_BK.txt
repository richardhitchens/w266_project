Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As you saw from our release for the third quarter,
we reported earnings of $0.82 per share. Now this includes the benefit related to a recent favorable tax ruling, and after
netting out this benefit, we had earnings of $0.60 per share.
Now looking at how our business model performed, we believe we earned about $0.58 per share on a core operating
basis. And Todd will take you through those numbers and how we get there.
For the quarter, I see three key takeaways. First, we had strong year-over-year core fee revenue growth reflecting our
focus on driving organic growth, our ability to deliver enhanced solution sets across our entire company and improved
market conditions for most of our businesses.
Second, we continue to exceed the goals of our Operational Excellence initiatives while making targeted investments to
drive future growth.
And finally, our businesses continue to be a strong generator of capital and in fact we generated more than $1 billion of
capital this quarter.
For the quarter, we had total revenues of $3.8 billion, which is up 3% over the third quarter of 2012. Investment
management business performance continues to be strong and resulted in the 16th consecutive quarter of net long-term
inflows. Net long-term inflows were $32 billion in the quarter for a total in excess of $100 billion over the last 12
months.
We continue to have particular strength in the liability driven investments, but we also enjoy nice flows into more
active asset classes which have a higher fee realization. Our success in attracting new assets helped drive a 13%
increase in assets under management year-over-year to a record $1.53 trillion dollars. This organic growth along with
higher equity values helped mitigate the pressure from higher money market fee waivers and Todd will talk to that in a
few moments.
I'd also note that investment management continues to invest in its franchise, including the wealth management sales
force expansion, enhancements to the U.S. retail distribution platforms and leveraging our investment services
businesses particularly in the Asia Pacific region to deliver solutions our clients need.
In investment services, we had a nice year-over-year fee growth in most of our businesses. This growth was driven by a
new business, increased volumes and improved equity values. We're continuing to see increased interest and dialogue
around our purging or advisory services technology platform and that services advisors and wealth managers globally.
We see that as a long-term trend that we're well positioned to capitalize on. We have both scale and a leading
technology platform to deliver what the market is looking for. Global collateral services also contributed to the
investment services growth, as changes in the regulatory marketplace have created new business opportunities,
particularly in collateral segregation and optimization.
Investment services also benefited from better foreign exchange results. Certainly, increased market volumes and
volatility contributed to this growth. However, the enhancements we've made to our electronic trading platforms also
contributed to our improved performance.
On the expense front, we remain ahead of our Operational Excellence initiative targets. Our team has been focused on
reengineering our processes and creating a simplified end-state operating platform.
We have also leveraged our procurement function and reduced our real estate footprint to reduce costs. These savings
have provided us with the flexibility to make targeted investments for future growth and help absorb the impact of
regulatory costs which are not insignificant.
On the capital front, as said, we generated over $1 billion of new Basel III Tier 1 common capital and we achieved an
excellent return on tangible common equity of 21%. The supplemental leverage ratio remains a focus for us and the

market in general, and we're certainly supportive of strong leverage ratio standards and good liquidity management.
However, we've been meeting with policymakers to provide an opportunity for them to understand how the proposed
SLR affects the market, and we hope to see final rule which does not create a disincentive to hold strong liquidity
position.
In sum, it was a quarter with solid fee growth, good progress in our Operational Excellence initiatives and a
continuation of our strong capital generation.
So with that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review and we'll start on
page two.
As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.82. That's $0.60 after excluding the benefit of that recent tax court decision. The $0.60
includes a benefit of approximately $0.02 related to the sale of a property in one of our equity investments, so we see it
as a $0.58 quarter.
Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.8 billion, that's up 3%. In our investment
services businesses, we enjoyed growth in asset servicing, issuer and clearing. Investment management and
performance fees continued their upward momentum. FX revenue is up again strongly year-over-year; NIR increased
and expenses were up 4% on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to page four, where we call out some business metrics to help explain our underlying performance. You can
see that AUM of $1.53 trillion was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. That was driven by net new business
as well as the higher market values.
During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $32 billion benefiting from as Gerald said, from the strength on our
liability driven investments, but we also saw some movement into alternative investments as well as active equity and
index funds. Short-term inflows were $13 billion.
Assets under custody and administration were up 4% year-over-year to $27.4 trillion, primarily reflecting the impact of
improved market values and net new business. Linked-quarter AUC/A was up 5% due to improved market values and
also the impact of currency rates.
Many of our key metrics show good growth on a year-over-year basis. Most clearing metrics were up. Our estimated
DARTS volume and long-term mutual fund assets continued the recent strong growth trend. Average loans and
deposits and wealth management and investment services were up again nicely. And then market value of securities on
loans were also up. We did see some declines in the number of sponsored DR programs also in the average tri-party
repo balances.
Looking at our fees on page six, asset servicing fees were up 2% year-over-year and they were down 2% sequentially.
The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher market values, some organic growth and net new business and
that was partially offset by lower securities lending revenue and the securities lending revenue was down largely
because of narrower spreads. The sequential decrease primarily resulted from a seasonal decrease in SEC lending
revenue, lower activity as well as lower expense reimbursements in the third quarter.
We had an estimated $110 billion in new AUC/A wins for an estimated total of $700 billion in wins over the last 12
months. Issuer services fees were up 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Year-over-year increase primarily
reflects higher depository receipts revenue and that was partially offset by lower corporate trust fees primarily related
to lower money market mutual fund balances and higher money market fund fee waivers. The sequential increase
reflects seasonally higher DR revenue and that was offset a bit by lower expense reimbursements which we noted on
our second quarter earnings call.

Clearing fees were up 10% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by
higher mutual fund and asset-based fees and volumes and that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.
The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonally lower clearance revenue reflecting a seasonal decrease in
DARTS and higher money market fee waivers.
Investment management and performance fees were up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Year-over-year
increase was primarily driven by higher equity market values and net new business and that was partially offset by the
average impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonally lower performance
fees partially offset by net new business and higher market values; comparison to both prior periods were negatively
impacted by higher money market fee waivers.
Now in terms of money market fee waivers, the aggregate corporate impact to EPS this quarter was approximately
$0.06 and that's as high as we've seen it. From a revenue perspective, the incremental drag was $41 million on a
year-over-year basis and it was $23 million sequentially. If you exclude the impact of fee waivers, year-over-year fee
growth would have been approximately 4.5%. From a business line perspective, the drag was fairly evenly split
between investment management and investment services.
In FX and other trading, total revenue was down 12% year-over-year and 23% sequentially and let's look at the
underlying components there. FX revenue was $154 million. That's up 27% year-over-year. It's down 14% sequentially.
The year-over-year increase primarily reflects stronger volumes as well as higher volatility. The sequential decrease
was primarily driven by lower volatility while volumes increased a bit. As Gerald noted, we made some enhancements
to our electronic trading platforms and they have contributed to the improved volumes and results.
Other trading revenue was down $55 million over the year ago quarter and $22 million over the second quarter. Both
decreases primarily reflect lower fixed income and derivatives trading revenue. The year-over-year decrease also
reflects a loss on inventory positions driven by higher interest rates.
Investment and other income totaled $135 million in the quarter and that compares with $124 million a year ago and
$269 million in the second quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity investment revenue
which was partially offset by lower seed capital gains. The sequential decrease primarily reflects a gain related to our
equity investment in ConvergEx that was reported in the second quarter.
To provide some more color here; equity investment income included $36 million of revenue from an equity
investment, as we share in the profit of a piece of real estate they sold. So they sold a piece of real estate and that was
our equity share of it. This favorably impacted our EPS by about $0.02. The asset related gain item that you see here
included $32 million related to the pre-tax gain on the sale of [indiscernible] (13:18) private banking business. There
was really no positive line impact here on the transaction as the business had an extremely low tax basis, so the tax gain
wiped out the pre-tax benefit.
Turning to page eight of the earnings review, you'll see that NIR on an FTE, the fully taxable equivalent basis was up
$22 million versus the year ago quarter and $16 million sequentially. Both increases were primarily driven by lower
premium amortization on investment securities as well as a larger balance sheet with more interest earning assets. The
year-over-year increase also reflects a change in the mix of earning assets including a decrease in the size of the
investment securities portfolio.
During the quarter, we reduced the size of the portfolio which led to $22 million of securities gains. We also transferred
agency mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $7.3 billion from available-for-sale to
held-to-maturity. We expect that both of these actions will help reduce our capital sensitivity to other comprehensive
income in the event of a rise in long-term interest rates.
As our asset liability management strategy continues to limit our overall exposure to long-term rates, we'd expect to be
relatively defensive in our reinvestment in the near-term resulting in a modest negative impact to net interest income.
The net interest margin for the quarter was 1.16% that's compared with 1.20% in the year ago quarter and 1.15% in the
prior quarter.

Turning to page nine, total non-interest ex-amortization of intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring
charges were up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from
higher staff expense driven by the annual employee merit increase of 2% which was effective on July 1, as well as
higher incentive and employee benefit expenses.
Turning to page 10, we're pleased with the performance of our operational excellence initiatives and expect to beat our
targets for the year. Our efforts during the quarter resulted in $170 million in quarterly gross run rate savings as the $20
million of incremental savings came with about $11 million in program cost.
Among the areas that we continue to be focused on include reducing costs through our enhanced procurement process,
continuing to work on reducing our expensive real estate here in New York and as Gerald mentioned, we're already
generating some savings and see more opportunities to enhance our technology and operations.
At a conference next month, Brian Shea, our head of client service delivery and client technology solutions and Suresh
Kumar, our chief information officer will outline our efforts, progress and potential in these areas.
Offsetting some of these benefits, we've seen increased costs related to the regulatory environment. These costs
continue to grow as we strengthen our compliance, risk and control functions and work to make us an even more
resilient company.
As we've mentioned, we're also investing in our brand as well as other revenue producing initiatives such as building
the separately managed account business in APAC, increasing Dreyfus' share of the U.S. retail market, building our
global collateral services capabilities, enhancing our global markets capabilities and expanding our wealth management
franchise; all important investments in our growth.
As you can see on page 11, we generated $1.1 billion in gross Basel III Tier 1 common during the quarter and our
estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio has increased substantially. We purchased122 million shares of our
shares in the third quarter that's less than what we've done in the earlier quarters largely driven by defensive position
and given the ongoing uncertainty about interest rates and the potential impact on AOCI and ultimately capital.
As mentioned earlier, we've muted the potential impact to the AOCI through actions and in the third quarter. And that,
and in addition to our significant capital generation during the quarter has positioned us to increase our purchases in
Q4.
At September 30, 2013, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio, this is under the standardized approach
was 10.1% and that compares to 9.30% at the end of June. Now we've calculated these ratios on a fully phased-in basis.
So the 80 basis point sequential increase primarily reflects the benefit of capital generation. And if we looked at it
under the advanced approach, also on a fully phased-in basis, we're at a very healthy 11.1%.
Our estimated supplementary leverage ratio during the quarter did rise and is now approximately 4.3%, a little less than
anticipated because of a spike in the balance sheet that we saw at quarter end. Frankly, we permitted the spike because
we have significant capacity and plenty of time to take the steps to ultimately comply with the SLR. Some of those
steps will just happen naturally through the normalization of monetary policy and we'll see some decline in deposits.
As previously mentioned, we have many levers to pull if necessary to improve the ratio with only a limited impact on
our business. For the time being, we see no reason for immediate actions given the uncertainty around the final
definition and the fact that it won't take effect for five years.
Page 12 details the composition of our investment securities portfolio. You can see that at quarter end, we had a net
unrealized gain on the portfolio of $723 million. That's a little increase from $656 million at the end of the prior quarter
and that was driven primarily by lower credit spreads on foreign securities.
Moving to our loan book on page 13, the provision for credit losses was $2 million. That compares to a credit in the
year ago quarter of $5 million and a credit of $19 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter on
an operating basis that's excluding the U.S. Tax Court's reconsideration was 26% in line with our previous guidance.

Now a few factors to include in your thinking about the current quarter, the fourth quarter. We expect a significant
seasonal decline in our high margin DR fees, a portion of that should be replaced with the lower margin investment
management performance fees and it should be down somewhat due to our defensive investing. In the fourth quarter,
we typically see higher business development and marketing expenses. I also want to remind you that preferred
dividends will have an impact of approximately $0.02 because of the recent issuance.
The quarterly provisions should be somewhere around zero. We expect the tax rate to come in in the range of 26%.
And based on market conditions, we believe we're much better positioned and expect to execute on our buyback plans.
We should be in a range similar to the second quarter.
To recap, all-in-all a good revenue quarter in our investment services and investment management businesses. We
continue to execute on the Operational Excellence initiatives and we strengthened our balance sheet and improved our
capital position.
So with that, let me turn it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Great. Thanks, Todd. And I think we can now open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your
question
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, so two questions. One is on the outlook for NII. Todd, you mentioned during this
quarter that you were shortening the duration of the portfolio. And obviously it didn't come through in the NIM, in part,
given the premium amortization reduction. But if you could help us understand you know what kind of pace or rate of
change we should expect in the NIM given the actions you've taken on the portfolio?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think in the fourth quarter you're likely to see NIR given those actions and the rate
of the amortization premium, amortization of the premium, I would expect it to be somewhere in the range of what we
saw in the second quarter, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So what's the duration of the securities portfolio right now? And what's the targeted
duration? Maybe you could speak to you know the entire portfolio, not just the AFS or the HTM bucket separately?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, it's a little over [ph] 2% (22:13) and we target the duration of the AFS to be in the
[ph] 2% (22:15) range. So we're pretty close to where we want to be.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And was it higher last quarter, because I know you were trying to shorten duration?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. It had gotten a bit higher when we saw the extension that came late in the second
quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: All right.

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So we did sell out some securities and we then we just let some – we didn't add
aggressively to the portfolio in the third quarter. That's why it's down. So we just let some securities burn-off, natural
duration burn-off.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And that's the AFS book, not the HTM book?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It includes both, more directed to the AFS book.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Okay, helpful. And then just second thing is on the buyback. So I know you indicated
that given market conditions, you know, you'd be more likely to buyback more this quarter. I mean obviously, your
capital ratio is up significantly with earnings and the benefit of the court decision. But I guess I'm just honing in on
your comment that market conditions make it more appealing to buyback stock this quarter. Are you just talking about
seasonal weakness in the third quarter is what kept you from doing more buyback in 3Q?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, we're a little defensive around the AOCI issue too Betsy and so until we got the
portfolio better positioned, so we had less volatility to our capital account, that made us a bit defensive. Then we had
the good things at the end of the quarter play themselves out, and we're just in a much stronger position.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. 23:40
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just picking up on the last question, as you guys
approach this year's CCAR exam, it feels like there's a lot more elements you have to balance around and weigh in on.
So maybe you can just talk broadly about how do you expect to approach this year's stress test and when it comes to the
capital returns, should we still expect you guys to return more capital next year versus this year? Either, you know,
from the amount basis or as a percentage of earnings?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, Alex, we don't know what the stress test is yet. Our understanding is we'll get the
instructions around November 1, what the actual environment would look like. But obviously, we've grown our capital,
our ratios have improved. So we are well positioned to approach the stress test. But I think it's too early to say and
obviously, I wouldn't, I can't, there's no way I can talk about what our future actions would be, but we're certainly in as
good a position as we were last year.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Just to add to that Alex, I think we feel very good about the strength of our capital and
liquidity going into the stress test. You know we think the earnings are very solid, so we feel pretty good about our
position. We'll wait to see what the parameters are of the stress test and then layer into it what capital actions we think
are appropriate.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Great. And then on the core kind of asset services side of the business, I know you mentioned
there's some seasonal changes 2Q to 3Q, but I guess if you look at broadly, pretty good growth in assets under custody
and if you look at the servicing fees even excluding securities lending, they were down sequentially, and the fee raise is
also kind of down. So can you help us just flush out a little bit more? Is there any changes you see on the pricing front
or is this just a seasonally slower activity quarter for you guys? I think that would be helpful.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Lots of questions in there, Alex, maybe I can start and then turn it over to Tim. On a
year-over-year basis, you can see that our assets under custody and administration are up about 4% and our fees are
also up about 4%. The third quarter was a bit of an anomaly both in our AUM and Curtis can talk to that in AUC,
because we saw a quarter where the dollar was stronger for most of the quarter and then weaker at quarter end.
We saw fixed income prices down for most of the quarter, but then strengthening at quarter end and as you know, we're
largely a fixed income shop. So I think from time-to-time, you see these kinds of anomalies on a quarter-to-quarter
basis, so it's not necessarily reflective of what you might see in the fees.

And, Tim why don't you do a little more deeper dive on the fees?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yeah, hi, Alex, it's Tim. There are three things I'd point to worth mentioning on this
call. One is we saw pretty significant drop from second quarter to third quarter in out of pockets. These would be things
that would come from our sub-custody network and CSDs largely to support growth in handling corporate action
activity in our network.
The second thing which we expected to see a seasonal drop in overall activity, I would say across the board, whether
you look at middle office, outsourcing, transfer agency or accounting, we saw an across the board drop in activity, a bit
more frankly than I would have expected to see.
And then we also saw redemptions. I didn't quite expect to see the level of redemptions that we saw third quarter over
second quarter. I think if you would put all those things aside, I would have expected to see us flat to maybe up just
slightly.
And on your pricing question, it's still like hot at the high end, which is why we keep repricing the low-end of our
book. But the story I would maybe draw your attention to is around expenses, both Gerald and Todd talked about this.
You see expenses down for the quarter, 3%.
If you adjusted for the seasonality of DRs, you would have seen that our coverage ratio, so fees to expenses actually
improved by 0.5 a point despite increased fee waivers and soft [ph] SEC (28:02) lending and then year-on-year, you see
the expense story as well. We continue to be very, very disciplined and our operational expense initiatives are paying
off. So, bit of an anomaly on the quarter-to-quarter drop, but we're razor focused on Operational Excellence initiatives
and they're showing up in these results.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Got it. That's very helpful. And then could you just clarify the seasonal benefit in DR business
this quarter? Like how much was in that $322 million number?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Todd, you want to [indiscernible] (28:33)?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, sequentially it's about $70 million and just to give you a heads up into the fourth
quarter that fourth quarter tends to be our weakest. So it can be even larger than that.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Got you, understood. Great, thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi, good morning everyone.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Howard.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Thanks for taking the questions. First, with the government shutdown and looming default,
was just hoping you could discuss two aspects of it. One, recent client behavior across the businesses and two, what
have you all been doing operationally prepare, maybe including from a balance sheet management perspective or as an
important part of the tri-party repo market? Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. Howard, it's Gerald. Obviously, we're taking this very seriously. We have a variety of
contingency plans in place with a variety of different scenarios, because we're not quite sure what may come out of
Washington. And that being said, I think we're as well prepared as anyone going into this.
Client activity, not surprisingly, we've seen some various money market funds and various clients get more defensive
and put more into cash. So our balance sheet's up about $10 billion since quarter end. We are prepared to handle that.

We've talked to clients about utilizing our balance sheet at least on a short-term basis to accommodate their needs and
so we're sort of acting business as usual as it relates to client activity. As every day goes by, more people are getting
more defensive and liquefying more.
No real impact on tri-party per se. The market has been deleveraging for quite a period of time and you've seen what's
happening in our tri-party balances, they've come down a little bit, but generally holding pretty steady. So that's about
it.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks. And my follow up is on the core investment management franchise. Flows
have been excellent. You had another strong quarter of equity market tailwind, and I guess we would have thought you
might see a little bit more revenue growth in the core management fees from last quarter. Was hoping you could, as you
look deeper into the data, what do you see and then could we get sort of a check on what investment performance is
like for those strategies that generate year-end incentive fees? Thanks.
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Absolutely. I think what Todd talked about earlier around assets under custody and
some of the dynamics actually played out for us as well. So AUM, quarter-over-quarter up 7%, almost 3% of that came
from the movement in FX. So weaker dollar means that our non-U.S. revenues, non-U.S. AUM, I should say, were
boosted by we thought really right at the end of the quarter.
So we charge management fees primarily on an average FX rate. And the 7% number is actually a spot AUM
comparison. So we didn't get in this quarter the benefit of the weaker dollar and what it does to the AUM of our
non-dollar assets. Just to remind you, about 46% of our revenues are non-U.S., so it's pretty meaningful to know what
is happening on the FX front.
And then the remaining portion of the story really is about the AUM growth that we had in short-term assets and more
importantly the overall impact from fee waivers. So this is the second worst quarter we've had in terms of fee waivers.
Very low Fed funds rates and short-term market rates, significantly depressed the management fee revenues in our
business there. And so I think that is really the – those two really tell the story.
I would tell you that sort of the organic activities are pretty promising. We have, as you pointed out, we've had good
AUM growth, Todd, and Gerald mentioned that has come from some of the lower fee LDI oriented products over the
past several quarters, but in the third quarter we actually began to see some of the confidence that I think the market
was feeling earlier in the third quarter show up in our growth.
We had a good growth in active equity. We actually have been positioning our platform around a number of alternative
and absolute return products. They actually had great AUM growth in the quarter. Some of that came later in the
quarter and so the revenue impact is not felt in the quarter. You may get new revenues in the quarter, but not have
earned as much of the revenue yet. And in fact, so we look very closely at forward revenue streams from our assets, our
asset growth.
The third quarter is seasonally a low quarter. Generally, clients put money to work in the first quarter and it remains
reasonably strong in the second. The third quarter is lighter and then the fourth quarter is not usually strong as the first
quarter, but picks back up. We actually this year have a very different season. Our third quarter was quite strong in
terms of what forward revenue from new mandates.
Additionally, last thing I'll say is that our one not funded pipeline is also growing. The forward revenues from wins that
have not yet funded for various reasons just haven't happened yet or some of them are triggered based on market
outcomes has grown by over 20%. So I think the organic AUM story is more promising on both the AUM basis and a
revenue basis going forward.
Performance across the platform, as you can imagine, a firm our size with over $1.5 trillion in assets under
management, we have a number of strategies, quite large strategies that drive revenue. There are array of investment
performance outcomes. We continue to see pretty strong performance in some of the larger categories that I have just
gone through.

Our LDI team continues to have exceptional performance and has done a great job for those clients and that's why
Insight most specifically has won a number of awards this year for the great work they've done.
If I had to characterize our overall platform, we have a firm that I think is more built around equity and fixed income
management that is more conservative in nature, so we don't have big momentum strategies, sharp increases in the
market all at once, again this is a very blunt statement, but generally, we lag in those types of markets and then do
better as valuation analysis and finding value in markets becomes more important.
Again, we he have a big index business that follows the market and so it's important to understand the mix of assets that
we have on our platform.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay, great. Thanks for all that detail.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Lucas Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: So thinking about top-line growth, AUC, AUM, actually AUC. I was wondering if you
might comment on the decision of one of your clients to appoint a shadow servicer; whether you think that could an
increasing trend going forward? And if so, what underpins that demand and do you think there's a meaningful
opportunity for BNY Mellon?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Tim, why don't you take that one, it's....
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Hi Luke, its Tim Keaney. We're watching this situation very carefully. This is a large
hedge fund that's appointed us for their middle office. The reason why this is an interesting space for us Luke, which
we're watching very carefully is, the regulators are putting more and more pressure on clients that outsource activity to
make sure that they lower the risk of their operations. That's happening in Europe first. It's also gaining traction here.
And there are some companies that will look to provide or have shadow providers for contingency purposes.
So that's what's happening. This is the first major hedge fund to do that; I think there's a lot of interest in people
watching to see how this plays out between now and next May, June. I suspect we'll keep that on our radar screen. So
it's unique, but I think it's a function of risk management and risk tolerances and the fact that the regulators are putting a
lot of pressure on those that outsource activities to make sure that they've got good risk management plans.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Great, thanks. And then just switching gears a little bit, a question on your philosophy for
managing the securities portfolio. I think we often focus on top-line revenue and yield, but I think there's an argument
that the fixed income markets are relatively efficient and that the higher yields and the credit products are simply
compensation for risk.
And it also seems like most of the value in your balance sheet comes from the deposit. So I know these securities are
mostly A rated, but given what happened in 2008 and 2009, what's the justification for continuing to hold privately
label MBS, CLOs, et cetera? I'm not making a judgment. But I would like to understand the philosophy better. Is it
something you guys debate internally or not?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Look, we don't buy private label [indiscernible] (37:50) there's no production of it
anymore. We don't buy private label MBS. These are remnants from what we owned back in 2008. So if you look at the
quality of our securities portfolio, it's primarily agencies, treasuries and other top rated sovereigns. So it's extremely
low risk.
The legacy assets that we've chosen to continue to hold, we actually like their interest rate characteristics a lot, because
as rates have moved up, those things have performed very nicely and they've held their value, so they were so

depressed back in 2008 and 2009, we reviewed the portfolio very carefully. We sold about 30% of the portfolio. We
retained the other securities and we're letting them burn-off and act as a nice interest rate hedge and they performed
exactly as we hoped they would.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I would just add to it. It is our philosophy to run a very conservative investment portfolio.
Our clients entrust their most precious assets with us as a custodian or as a trust [indiscernible] (38:55) organization or
as an investment manager. We don't want to do anything that has the appearance that we don't have the capital strength
and liquidity to be able to manage through any crisis or any cycle, and so our posture is to run a very conservative
investment portfolio; short duration, high quality.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And that spills over into our loan book as well. So it's a very clean, high quality loan book.
Our philosophy is not a lot different than what you just said to be a buyer of securities. We don't think is creating
tremendous value, perhaps if we were originator, we may think of it otherwise.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Luke.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America. You may ask your question.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Hi, thanks a lot. Apologies if you covered this, but it looks like in terms of the AUC in
the earnings release, you mentioned the increase attributed to higher market values in FX. And I'm just wondering, does
this mean you didn't have net wins in the quarter and just in general, how's your win-loss trend?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Tim, why don't you take that one?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Okay. Pardon me. Yes, Cynthia, we had three things happen, with obviously
currency and market helped a lot in the 5% linked. We did add some new business convert during the quarter, about
$145 billion. It didn't all convert in the beginning of the quarter, but one point I made to an earlier question was around
redemptions.
We did see an awful lot of redemptions in the market that basically ate away what we did convert during the quarter.
But took more broadly to your point, it is a competitive environment, pipeline and asset servicing year-on-year has
grown substantially. It's up about 30%. We pay very close attention to our win rate. That's been pretty steady on the last
four quarters, a little over 50%. So I don't know if that directly answers your questions, but that's what the way I
describe it.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Yeah, it does, thank you. And then you mentioned, I think you mentioned core EPS at
about $0.58, so I'm just wondering if you can just go through the what you exclude there and how you think about that
versus the adjusted?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. It's a pretty clean quarter; we had a little bit of unusual gains on the asset gains and
one of them was related to equity accounting, one of our minority interest sold a building and the gain on that sale, our
percentage of that – our pro-rata portion of that is in the P&L. That was about $0.02; the rest of it's pretty straight
forward.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may ask your question.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning, guys. First, just a couple cleanup things; can you tell us either the premium
amortization amount was or at minimum what the delta was sequentially?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, the delta was about $25 million, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And is that a substantial reduction of what the overall carry is of it?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I mean, the way to look at that was probably a little more than 20% reduction in the
amortization that we had seen in the previous quarter.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: All right, that's helpful. And the accounting accretion was [ph] 55 (42:30)?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That's right. And that was about flat.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: That was flat, okay. And then my bigger picture question is, you guys are doing a really good
job on the cost containment and are obviously well ahead of the original plan you guys had laid out. But I just wanted
to ask you guys just conceptually and structurally, where are we from here in terms of incremental cost reduction and
what initiatives are going on, given than we're still in this kind of so-so revenue environment to either reduce or control
the rate of expense growth from here given that you're already kind of well over your original plan, so to speak?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Ken, its Gerald. You know, obviously, we have a philosophy of continuous
improvement of our operations and technology areas. We talked in terms of the opening comments that we are working
very diligently and very focused on simplifying our operating platforms and models. We think there's more upside to be
had from that. We were finishing out sort of what I call the [ph] lift and shifts (43:36) in terms of labor movements,
towards the end that, but we do see a lot of upside still to be had in continuous improvement in the operating and
technology areas. So you'll hear more about that as time goes on.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks Ken.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with ISI. You may ask your question.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thank you very much. So I heard your comments loud and clear on leverage ratio before, but
I'm curious, is about a third of the balance sheet is sitting in deposits with banks or deposits with the Fed. Is that one of
the big primary sources of your confidence that if and when you need to adjust, you can adjust? And then just a follow
on to that is how else does the leverage ratio focus make its way impact from a business standpoint, because from a
balance standpoint it looks like you have the flexibility?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I mean I think there's a number of things that we can do. We actually on that big
balance sheet right now, we consolidated some asset management funds which the accounting is likely to change and
we'd be able to deconsolidate that before these go into effect.
The other thing is, you point out well that a lot of those are central bank deposits and cash, and we would think, Glenn,
just in the normal course, we are sitting on an awful lot of balances, because of the very unusual interest rate scenario
that we're in right now and we would expect at least $50 billion or so of that to be reduced just in a more normalized
interest rate world.
Then we are, you know, even if we continue to pay out at the same levels that we pay out, we're also creating quite a bit
of capital. And we can also manage the balance sheet more tightly in a number of places, including we make some
loans out of a holding company, we don't need to do that. So there's tens and even twenty billions of dollars of things

that we can do outside of just the normalization. So we don't see any business model action that we need to take. We
think that during the normal course, it will work through it. It's also we don't know what the final rules are going to be.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So there's some possibility that could change in our favor or not, and we will adjust to
them as we need to.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Appreciate that. I agree with that. Last one is just on LDI. I mean, it seems like Insight
is doing great, looking at $93 billion total inflows for the year-to-date so far. I'm just curious what percentage is LDI?
What's the average fee rate? What are the type of clients that they're landing, because those are pretty long dated
mandates right?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yeah, they are. I think it's a very important trend to understand and in the big debate
about the great rotation that is on the top of everybody's mind, I think it really is important to understand the accounting
changes that have happened in the pension industry and that will start to also take place for public funds after June of
next year where volatility in pension plans is less welcome and so there are a lot of pension plans globally, both
corporate and public, that are focused on being able to manage against their liability stream and Insight is the world
leader in being able to help those plans with that.
The fees – there's a lot of mandates, because the liability is fixed income in nature, a lot of the fees are oriented more
towards fixed income type fees that are lower fees in general on an absolute basis, but as you point out that the size of
the mandates are very large. So as rates go up, actually it becomes easier for pension plans to address their managing
against their liability as they become more funded. So again, I would tell you that we're very excited about the business.
One of our initiatives is to – we've actually invested in helping Insight grow its business in the U.S., and in Asia, they
have been primarily focused in the UK and also growing in Europe.
And so really excited about what they are doing there and I would also tell you their products extend, when you have
the ability to evaluate liability streams and hedge them very effectively and manage portfolios of assets that are
outperforming the liability, those are a lot of the same skills that are broadly needed by a larger group of clients in the
absolute return space where we think a lot of clients are growing, everyone from wealth clients to other institutions that
are just simply looking for less volatility but still trying to get some return in their investment portfolio. So very excited
about it and think they have a great future as many of our investment firms do as well.

<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Thanks Glenn.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Can you guys come back to the planning that you're doing with the government problems
that we're having and tell us, do you guys own many short-term T-bills that may be maturing in the next 15 to 30 days?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Todd can talk to the – our own ownership.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we have very few, but we do have a little bit that mature within this year, probably
in the $60 million range or so.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And then second, over the years you guys have done a number of acquisitions.
Obviously, you haven't done anything materially recently. Do you get the sense aside from market conditions as maybe
the reason nothing has happened in the custody rules in terms of acquisitions? But do you get a sense that the regulators
are more or less supportive of banks your size going out making sizable acquisitions?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, let me put it this way, Gerard. I think we have so much opportunity internally to invest
in our existing businesses and our operations and technology platforms it's not a high priority. We think we can get a
much better return on investments in our own businesses and our own products and services that we have so much on
our plate right now, so much in motion right now that I think is a much better return to our shareholders in even
considering what you're suggesting. So I know [ph] you want to (50:14) comment on the regulatory part. It's really a
matter of our choice to invest in ourselves.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Gerald, we have done a couple of small things and we've done something in asset
management...
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Where we closed on our German JV where we had a partial ownership of it, and we own
all of it and we took Pershing international a little bit more too in Australia. So we've done fill-in things but I don't
think we believe we need to do anything major, certainly not in the asset servicing space.
