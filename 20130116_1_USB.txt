I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. 2012 was a great year for our company and I'm very proud to share our
fourth quarter and full year results with you this morning. I'd like to begin with a few important highlights on Page 3 of
the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.6 billion or $2.84 per diluted common share for the year 2012. We
achieved record total net revenue of $20.3 billion, which was higher than the previous year by 6.2%, driven by growth
in both net interest income and fee revenue. We achieved industry-leading profitability with a return on average assets
of 1.65% and return on average common equity of 16.2%, and an efficiency ratio of 51.5%, and we realized positive
operating leverage year-over-year.
Average loans grew by 6.9% over 2011, and we experienced strong year-over-year average deposit growth of 10.6%.
Credit quality continued to improve with a decline in net charge-offs of 26.2% and an 18.9% decrease in
non-performing assets, excluding covered assets. Our capital position ended the year stronger with the Tier 1 common
equity ratio of 9% and we were able to return $3.4 billion of our 2012 earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends
and buybacks.
Now turning to Slide 4 and our fourth quarter highlights. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the
fourth quarter of 2012 or $0.72 per diluted common share. Included in the current quarter was an $80 million expense
accrual for the recently announced mortgage foreclosure settlement which reduced EPS by $0.03. Recall that the fourth
quarter of 2011 included two notable items that increased EPS by $0.05.
Total net revenue of $5.1 billion was slightly higher than the same quarter of last year. Excluding the prior year
merchant settlement gain, however, total net revenue grew by 5.6%. Importantly, we achieved positive operating
leverage year-over-year.
Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.4% and as expected, 1.5% or 6% annualized linked quarter. We
experienced strong growth in total average deposits of 9.2% over the prior year and 1.9% over the third quarter of
2012. Credit quality continued to improve. Total net charge-offs decreased by $70 million or 13% from the prior
quarter.
You may recall that the third quarter net charge-offs included $54 million of incremental charge-offs related to our
regulatory policy clarification. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, declined by 4.6% linked quarter. We
generated significant capital this quarter and ended the quarter with a Basel I, Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9% and a
Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.1%. We
repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter.
Trends in our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on Slide 5. Return on average assets in the fourth
quarter was 1.62%, and return on average common equity was 15.6%. Both ratios declined from the prior quarter
primarily as a result of the mortgage foreclosure-related expense accrual. As a reminder, our company's long-term goal
is to achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%.
Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4 (sic) [Slide 5]
(5:12). This quarter's net interest margin of 3.55% was five basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, and as
expected, four basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.59%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a
few minutes.
Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 52.6%. Slightly better than the prior year but higher than the previous
quarter primarily reflecting the $80 million mortgage-related settlement expense accrual that was included in our
current quarter's results.

We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and expect that this ratio will remain in the low 50s going
forward as we continue to invest and grow our businesses.
Turning to Slide 6. The company's reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion, a slight increase over
the prior year's quarter and a 1.3% decrease from the previous quarter. As noted on the slide, the year-over-year
increase in total net revenue would have been 5.6% excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of 2011 gain. The
company's revenue has benefited from continued growth in both our balance sheet and fee-based businesses,
particularly mortgage, as we have significantly increased our market share over the past few years.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $13
billion or 6.4% year-over-year. Overall, excluding covered loans of run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 8.6%
year-over-year and 2% linked quarter.
Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by a strong growth in average commercial loans which
grew by 18.4% year-over-year and 3.3% over the prior quarter. Residential real estate loans also continued to show
strong growth, 19% over the same quarter of last year and 5.3% over the prior quarter.
Within the other retail loan category, home equity in line and loans continued to decline on average while auto loans
and leases showed steady growth over both comparable periods.
We continued to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage
production plus new and renewed commitments totaled over $49 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled over $176
billion for the full year 2012.
Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 15.6% and
2.5% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remains stable at approximately 25%, basically where it's been through
the entire year of 2012. Total average deposits increased by $20.5 billion or 9.2% over the same quarter of last year and
by $4.6 billion on a linked quarter basis with growth in low-cost deposits, particularly strong quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to Slide 8 in credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter decreased by $70 million or 13% from
the third quarter of 2012, while non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $100 million or 4.6%.
The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding declined to 0.85%, indicative of the high quality of our
portfolio.
During the fourth quarter, we released $25 million of reserves compared with $50 million in the third quarter and $125
million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Given the mix and overall quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs to be
relatively stable to modestly down in the first quarter, while non-performing assets will continue to trend lower.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Our
diluted EPS of $0.72 was 4.3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2.7% lower than the prior quarter.
Slide 10 details notable items that impacted earnings in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011. As previously mentioned,
the current quarter included an $80 million foreclosure-related settlement expense accrual that reduced EPS by $0.03.
In the fourth quarter of last year, non-interest income included a $263 million litigation settlement gain related to the
termination of our merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked $130 million expense accrual related to
other mortgage servicing and foreclosure-related matters. On a net basis, these two items increased EPS by $0.05 in the
fourth quarter of 2011.
The key drivers of the company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 11. The $70 million or 5.2%
increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a slightly higher net revenue, slightly lower expense, and a

decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the net after-tax impacts of the notable items detailed on Slide 10,
net income year-over-year was higher by approximately 17%.
Net interest income increased year-over-year by $110 million or 4.1%. The favorable variance was largely driven by
the $17.1 billion increase in average earning assets in addition to strong growth in low cost deposits and reduced rates
on wholesale funding. The 5.8% growth in average earning assets included planned increases in the securities portfolio
as well as growth in average total loans and loans held for sale.
As expected, the net interest margin of 3.55% was five basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily
due to the increase in lower yielding investment securities, partially offset by growth in low cost deposits, lower cost
wholesale funding and a reduction in cash balances held with the Fed.
Non-interest income declined by 4.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the settlement gain recorded in 2011. Excluding
this prior year gain, non-interest income was higher by 7.4%.
Mortgage banking revenue was strong year-over-year largely affecting a 27% increase in production and improved gain
on sale margin and higher servicing revenue. Also contributing the fee income growth were increases in trust and
investment management fees, retail and corporate payments revenue, commercial products revenue, and investment
product fees and commissions. These positive variances were partially offset by a 6.3% decrease in merchant
processing; the net result of higher volumes offset by lower rates and the reversal of revenue share accrual in the fourth
quarter of 2011.
In addition, ATM processing services revenue was lower, the result of a reclass within occupancy expense, and other
income declined as the fourth quarter of 2011 included a $29 million Visa gain.
Non-interest expense was lower year-over-year by $10 million or 0.4%. The majority of the favorable variance can be
attributed to the net $50 million impact of the notable items listed on Slide 10 as well as lower ORE and FDIC
insurance expense partially offset by an increase in professional services, primarily due to the market servicing review
related projects, higher compensation and benefits expense, and an increase in cash credit investment cost and
technology expense.
Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $54 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to the $80 million settlement
expense accrual. Excluding this charge, net income was essentially flat in the third quarter as a result of a 1.3% decline
in net revenue, partially offset by a 9.2% reduction in the provision for credit losses.
On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was flat as growth in average earning assets which grew by $3.3 billion
was offset by a four basis point decline in net interest margin, primarily due to the repricing of the investment securities
portfolio and lower loan rates.
The average balance of our investment securities portfolio was $72.9 billion in the fourth quarter, $4.1 billion higher
than the fourth quarter of 2011 and just slightly higher than the previous quarter.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $67 million or 2.8%. This unfavorable variance was
primarily the result of a decrease in mortgage banking revenue. Although mortgage production was higher linked
quarter by approximately 2.7%, applications were lower by 6.7%.
The change in mortgage banking revenue also reflected a lower gain on sale margin and $16 million increase in the
addition to the reps and warranty repurchase reserve to cover the 2004 and 2005 vintage Freddie Mac bonds. Other
income also declined linked quarter as a result of the net effect of the third quarter credit card portfolio sale gain and
the write-down of our investment in Nuveen.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense was higher by just $77 million, primarily due to the $80 million
settlement expense. Going forward, as a result of this settlement, professional services expenses will decline as the
costs associated with the mortgage servicing review, which had been running at approximately $50 million per quarter,
end.

Turning to Slide 12, our capital positions remain strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the full
impact of the current proposed rules for Basel III standardized approach, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1
common equity ratio was approximately 8.1% at December 31 versus 8.2% at September 30.
At 8.1%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.
Slide 13 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage purchase-related expense and the reserve for expected
losses on repurchases and make-whole payments.
As we indicated in December, after discussions with Freddie Mac, we booked additional reserve to address the
put-back risk of the loans originated in 2004 and 2005. Consequently, the addition to the reps and warranty repurchase
reserve this quarter was $16 million higher than the third quarter of 2012. Our outstanding repurchases at make-whole
request balances at December 31 was $131 million compared with $118 million at September 30.
We continue to expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.
I'll turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy. 2012 was a record-setting year for U.S. Bank. We achieved record earnings and record total net revenue
resulting in industry-leading performance metrics; and further we continue to invest in our businesses and strategically
acquire new partners. We added more customers and grew market share, we maintained strong and growing capital and
liquidity positions, and we returned $3.4 billion of the company's earnings to our shareholders. And next year we
expect to return more.
In 2013, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of U.S. Bank. Since our charter was signed in 1863, we've managed
through the times of prosperity and adversity. We've grown by investing in our business through acquisition. We've
learned from and capitalized on the lessons of our past and become what we are today, a company with a
well-diversified business model and a prudent risk management, a company with the ability to produce consistent,
predictable and repeatable results.
We're focused on the future and continuing to build momentum into 2013 for the benefit of our customers, our
employees, our communities, and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Good morning. Question for you on loan growth, good average loan growth but it looks like
the period-end loans are maybe even a little bit higher, a little bit better; and curious if there's anything notable about
the growth, and if you've noticed any change in sentiment of the borrowers, maybe positive or negative, early on in the
year?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Jon, this is Richard. There's a – it's pretty much the same story. I think the fiscal cliff
uncertainty caused the very last couple of weeks to be a bit muted. But if you take quarter four and look into quarter
one, I think at the end of the day you're going to see a pretty sustainable range of that 4% to 6% annualized. We came
in at the high end of that range in quarter four. I think we're on track for the high end of that for quarter one, but I
wouldn't jump outside of that range based on what I'm seeing. I don't think that people care as much about the debt

ceiling and the debate that will occur later in the quarter as they do about the bottom line to their paychecks as they did
about the fiscal cliff, but I do think it's still a fairly uncertain environment and people at the first of the year aren't
jumping on anything new.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. And then you just – you touched on it but maybe if you could provide us a little more
color on how you're thinking about capital allocation on 2013? You talked about returning more money to
shareholders, but just walk us through your thought process.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. Thanks, Jon, this is Andy. Our goal has always been a 60% to 80% return, the
combination of dividends and buybacks. We're within that range in 2012. We would expect and we plan to be within
that range in 2013, that's how we submitted the CCAR and as discussed, we'll hear back somewhere towards the end of
March regarding the results.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: And, Richard, you said more I believe was the phrase in your...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I did. So, yeah, we're in the lower range of that 60% to 80% range, it's our goal to move
further into that range. I doubt that we'll get to 80% and part of the reason for that is we're still investing in the
company. You guys are allowing us to do that and I think we're getting good returns for those investments but the
CCAR results will be known in a couple of months and we have put in a request that we think is very fair and
reasonable and will help us move that deeper into the 60% to 80% range.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Jon.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. On your mortgage production side, do you break out what you do
for retail versus wholesale?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: We don't break that out, but let me give you a couple of facts, Paul, just to maybe round out
some of the story. Right around 69% of our production was refinance activity and gain on sale margins that you see are
down a bit, but I think an important fact too is the application, because we book the majority of our revenue at app and
our net apps or our gross apps both of them were down about 6.7%. Now, some of that can be attributed to the
seasonality factor that occurs in the fourth quarter, particularly around the holiday season. We still expect the first half
of the year to be relatively strong from a mortgage perspective, but the fourth quarter was down a bit principally due to
seasonality.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And, when you say gain on sale margins is down slightly, was it mainly – was that also due to
seasonality, or was that more of a – did you do more wholesale versus retail in the quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Probably a combination of a little bit of both and if I do my gain on sale from a perspective
of apps, it was down maybe 10 or 15 basis points.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And then on your loan growth, are you seeing any – I know Wells Fargo talked about
seeing a lot of C&I and whatnot in the late part of December as people try to get some things done before the fiscal
cliff. Did you see the same thing, or could you add some color around that?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Not really. I wouldn't have brought it up, I knew you'd ask and the M&A activity was higher
at year's end for all the reasons that people are trying to time and sequence their activities before a fiscal cliff
possibility, but not notable. To us it was not a real impact. As I said, everything kind of slowed down at the very end of
the year. That happens anyway, but to a more of a screeching halt, just because people are waiting to see what

happened and there is a bit of that recovery in the first few weeks, as Jon's question might have implied, but if you take
the two quarters in total, I don't think you'll see any distinction about that fiscal cliff when it's all said and done. And
for us – I'd like to give you a color on loan differences by geography and type or customer and it really isn't much
different than the last couple of quarters we've had in 2012. So for us it's a lot more of the same.
I guess the recession ended 14 quarters ago as I'm told. It probably doesn't feel like it to all of us, but whatever recovery
we've been under continues to be slow and methodical and we're feeling the exact same thing, just a little bit better
every month, every quarter but so small you have to go back and add it together just to notice it. So we're seeing that
same phenomenon, not much to report.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey, thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Paul.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Morning.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. Andy, what are some of the puts and takes for the net interest
margin looking forward and what's your best guess on the near term outlook for the NIM [net interest margin].
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes, John. So, we talked about the fact that we expected the fourth quarter to be down four
to six, it was down four. I would expect a similar decline in the first quarter perhaps a little bit more because the first
quarter is seasonally lower with regard to loan fees both on the wholesale as well as retail side. So, down similar level,
perhaps a bit more because of loan fees.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. If rates stay low, the longer they stay low does the reinvestment rate pain begin
to ease eventually, and when does that happen if rates stay where they are today?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes, it does, John. So, the reinvestment risk right now is that $2 billion to $2.5 billion that
runs off every month and I'm putting it back on in a conservative fashion. The differential on spreads or rate is about 70
to 75 basis points. Because the duration is not that long, as I move into the end of this year and into 2014, that starts to
compress because what's coming off now is at a lower rate, so that will dissipate over time.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And with the loan growth dynamics that Richard talked about, do you still
hope to grow net interest income this year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: That is our goal.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yup.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on credit, Richard, you still expect charge-offs to move lower, but it
sounds like maybe at a slower pace; and then just what was the outlook on reserve releases?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: The answer is yes and slightly a little bit more but we're coming to an end on reserve
releases. So we're at 85 basis points for the portfolio and we've always said, especially with our credit card business, we
should be at about 1%. So we're going to move below that 85, probably into the high 70s, reserve releases come down
to zero over the course of the next few quarters, because it should and our reserve coverage is sufficient in both – and
has always been and will be I think be well within the range of what some of the regulators have been seeking, because
we don't want to under reserve or prepare for over the cycle. Our credit portfolio has been really, really predictable and
if you just draw a straight line, you can just keep drawing it with the sloping settling curve on charge-offs and it

continued kind of transition to lower non-performance for a little bit longer. Bill, do you want to add any color to that?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, no. The – I mean we're getting at the bottom for some of the gross charge-off rates if you
look at credit cards, autos, even some of the commercial; and some of the commercial real estate categories are pretty
strong now. So on the wholesale side, some of the impact will be really on the recovery levels that we see which can –
those are more difficult to project so we might see a little bit up and down based on recovery levels. But overall, it's just
still working out some of the residual residential mortgage and home equity which will still take another year or two.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And regarding the new FASB proposals suggesting a life of loan, expected loss
approach, do we have to start thinking – or do you have to start thinking ahead to that now, or is it too early yet?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, we're certainly going to comment on it now. There's the comments due from the industry
and we'll comment on it between now and April. Probably the biggest area of impact which is still the most uncertain is
credit cards. Credit cards take big reserves and it's just not clear what life of loan means on an open line of credit like
that. So, a lot more work to be done.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And it's not affecting your reserving behavior right now?
<A - P. W. Parker>: No.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: No.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No, not changing anything.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, great. Last thing from me, does the foreclosure settlement costs, Andy, that $50
million a quarter, will that pretty much end in the first quarter and you'll be done with that right away?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, but – well, we experienced about $50 million in quarters three and four. We may have
a little bit of a tail on that in the first quarter, $5 million to $10 million, but then it'll go away.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Erica.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: My first question was just a follow-up to John's, in terms of the foreclosure review expense
of $50 million, is that directly going to impact the bottom line, so we shouldn't expect the bank to reinvest it back into
the franchise?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, the answer – this is Richard. The answer is yes. That is the cost that we had primarily
to third-party overseers. The entire mortgage servicing business has gotten more expensive because of the new rules,
some of which will get finalized in a week or two from the CFPB, but under the consent order the rules have been very
stringent and so we have many, many more employees and run rate costs to managing a servicing portfolio than we
used to; those do not change. But the $50 million that Andy cited were primarily to third-party overseers and that does
end, and yes, we can reinvest that back in the company.

<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: So we shouldn't necessarily just lop off $50 million from the second quarter run rate
expense?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, yes, you could. You could.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Oh, okay.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: No, you could. That's – yeah – I'm saying but there are other costs that we're not talking
about which are still burden in there.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: I see.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Compared to period – from prior period. It's a lot more expensive to run a mortgaging
service business than it used to be. We're up to it. We're making enough to offset it, but I didn't want you to think that
$50 million was all of the incremental cost of doing this business cause it's gotten a lot more expensive over the last
couple years.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: I see. Thank you for that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yup.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: And just my second question is on capital return. Your message on capital return is always
dead consistent. If we're just sort of looking at what could be different from this year versus last in the process of the
CCAR, what was interesting to me and some investors is in the adverse case scenario the Fed is now requiring to stress
test against rate shocks, which clearly impacts the securities portfolio. I guess, as you went through the process, I
understand the color you may give us may be limited, but does the average case scenario even matter as you thought
about your application for this year? And is the message from the Fed as they think about accelerating capital return
from the banks, as credit risk diminishes, do we have to start thinking about AOCI [accumulated other comprehensive
income] risk on a go-forward basis?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Erika, certainly the adverse case matters, but in our case anyway the severely adverse
case was more of the binding constraint from the perspective of capital return. And that was the harsher economic
downturn and the lower GDP, the higher unemployment, and that was a more material factor particularly related to
credit costs for our numbers. With regard to AOCI, as we talked about, we are keeping our own cushion of 50 basis
points over and above what we project to be our [ph] SIFI (28:33) buffer of 50, that's how we get to the 8%, and that's
to accommodate the fluctuations of volatility that occurs with OCI [other comprehensive income], and that's why we
keep that cushion.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You bet.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hey, Ken.
<Q - Ian Foley>: Hey, it's actually Ian Foley in for Ken. Just want to ask a couple questions on the mortgage business,
specifically if volume does start to fade next year, when we look at expenses, how much is fixed versus variable and
how quickly can you bring those expenses down if you do see a falloff?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Ian, I would say that the variable expense component of the mortgage business, depending
upon the type of production and where it's originated from would be anywhere between 25% and 40%.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: We have been very careful not to build a church for Easter Sunday. I mean, we're able to
accommodate all of our volume today, but we've got a pretty good variable capability of reducing quickly, adding
quickly. And as you look at the future, while it may be higher refis today, we're building this bank to handle new
purchases and to be a market leader in that area, which is why we are spending so much care on high-quality today,
because that will affect the reputation we have for the clients that will use us in new purchase money when rates start to
go up and we start replacing the refi activity. So, we're going to over-perform the service quality. We're going to have
more than enough people in all the places today, but we can adjust very, very quickly. It's one of our best talents around
here, and you can well bet that we won't be caught with overhang, but there's that change somewhere along the way.
<Q - Ian Foley>: Okay. And my second question is more involved in the servicing side. I think with the refis, people
often overlook just kind of what it means for MSR and reevaluation. I was just hoping you guys could comment on
how the hedging strategy has changed? And if refi rates do decline, what that could mean for just the servicing income
stream in general? Thanks.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: We're fairly – Marty's team is very good at the hedging process here. Our net hedge results
this quarter was about a $29 million gain versus about $9 million last quarter and about the same level, $30 million a
year ago. So, we are very conservative in our approach and we do take into account all the factors that you described.
<Q - Ian Foley>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush would NAB Research LLC.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys. Richard, could you just comment on the QM, what your general
impressions were of the QM, and whether you think there's going to be an impact of the QM on other retail lending?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So, my impressions are actually very positive. I thought they did a nice job of what I'll call
soft landing against what would otherwise have been a risk of really muting a slow but assured recovery. Not only is
the 43% debt-to-income a fair assumption, a fair starting point, but the very, very slow transition they're going to have
with the Freddie/Fannie rules standards and being able to imply those for some time. It's – I'm not going to say it's not a
non-issue, but it's not a huge issue. I think they gave us a lot of time to manage that, never mind we have a whole rest
of 2013 to get it right. So I think for the industry, it's something more like 5% to 10% impact. We would be in that
same range, but I believe as we look over the course of time, if I look at it in the cold, light heart of day, if some of
those rules had been around for the industry particularly the sub-prime and non-bank providers, we actually would have
had a better outcome and less of a problem. So, I actually think they were quite good.
What it means to the rest of the other loans, I don't think it has an infectious impact yet. I only say that because I
haven't heard that as one of the next steps. I think there's plenty of other things to work on with the CFPB, particularly
non-banks and another activities related to deposit gathering and service charges and things. But, Nancy, I think
undoubtedly it will start to take on non-mortgage activity, things that are asset-based but are not necessarily in the same
category as the high risk or bringing down the world. So, probably over the next few years, we'll see some of the same
attributes, but I don't think that they are at all immediate and I don't think when they do come they'll be that bad.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Question for you, Andy, or maybe for both of you; there was an article on the Wall Street
Journal a couple of days ago about the fact that the banks are not making public their Basel leverage ratios. Could you
just comment on that? And they inferred or implied that there was a risk-weighting asset kind of trickery going on.
Could you just give me your commentary on that?

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure. In our case, Nancy, our risk-weighted asset number to total GAAP assets is about
88%, so we don't have a big difference. The differentials for a bank like us and our business model is just not that
material. And if you think about our leverage ratio on a – it's not significant, in fact it's higher on a Tier 1 number
versus our Tier 1 common number. So, it isn't a material impact for our company.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Greg.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Greg.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Maybe a bigger picture question, if you look at revenue growth in 2012 compared to 2011
when you guys put up some very nice revenue growth in light of the environment, and as you look into 2013 with
maybe slower loan growth, maybe the risk that mortgage weakens in the second half of this year which remains to be
seen, and you think about revenue growth in 2013, what – how do you think about that, what are the areas that you
think you can achieve it? Do you expect it to actually slow compared to 2012?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I'll go first. We do expect it to slow compared to 2012 because we're prudent and
careful. And I tell you that because I also promised you positive operating leverage for 2013. So that just means we're
going to be watching our expenses. And, Greg, if you followed the story for the last five or six years, you and your
peers have allowed us to be pretty aggressive in spending, in catching up on our CapEx, some of our acquisitions, and
some of our investments in the company have been pretty high; and yet we've continued to keep our expense
relationship to revenue quite good. That's what we're going to continue to do, but we're on the tail end of that area of
investing so extensively. And so the good news is this is a good year for us to keep our expenses more run rate-related,
more in check from not having to play any kind of catch up, and it's going to be perfect because revenue is expected to
grow a little bit less than last year, still positive, still both growth; revenue will grow, expenses will grow by less. We'll
grow the balance sheet, have positive operating leverage; we'll make good net income, but each will be muted from the
year before.
And if by any chance things start to get better and the world warms up and we can benefit from that, then the expenses
are easily adjusted and we can be more aggressive in some of our investments inside the company or organic. So we've
got a pretty good ability to move those levers quickly but I want to make – so it's heard clearly, we will grow revenue
but we will just grow it at a pace that's commensurate with the kind of expenses that are needed to keep that in positive
operating.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And I would also comment that we have a couple of businesses that are at their early stages
of the growth curve, our commercial products group, our [indiscernible] (36:10) bond business, municipal
underwriting, our wealth management area, all areas that I think will grow in an accelerated fashion in 2013.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Great. And I guess along those lines, maybe things that we're not seeing that's coming
through revenue growth, do you feel like that U.S. Bancorp business model has even more leverage when we see the
business conditions improve and we actually could see even more positive operating leverage generated as a result of
that?

<A - Richard K. Davis>: We do. Yeah, Greg, we do. In fact, one of my favorite lines around here is we might be
doing really well in tough times, but we're building the bank to be great in great times. That's a real important
distinction because we're able to handle the kind of muted environment, but when things get good and they get good
fast when that happens, we want to be up at the front. The highest debt ratings in the business, the reputation we've
been able to create over our service quality, and some of these new businesses that have kind of rounded out the rest of
the capabilities for this company are serving us really well right now; but those are the things that will really – meant I
think the kind of profitability we want in good times. So, I'm quite optimistic about it.
We used to call it a window of opportunity where our high position compared to our peers; the high quality of the
company, the balance sheet was serving us benefits. That window has been open longer than I thought it would and it's
getting wider as time passes. And I might close with our staff is better now at leveraging our strength. They're more
proud of the company, they're more assured that the company is distinctively performing better in most categories, and
they take that story to the customer and they do a better job of developing better relationships and getting more
business. So, I'm quite robust in my comments about what this will do for us when times start to get better. We just
need to get it over the trends in the industry until the economy warms up again.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne, Agee [& Leach].
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: A couple of questions; just, Andy, going back to your comments in terms of reps and
warranties and repurchase requests remaining relatively stable, just curious with the settlement now and basically
capturing all vintages and the improved dialogue with the GSEs, is there a sense that – I guess what I'm saying or
suggesting is, on a go-forward basis the requests are more in line with the production, or alternatively why wouldn't we
necessarily see more of a decline in terms of those requests relative to the settlements in the dialogue?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, I think it's just a timing factor, Todd, so I don't expect a blip like we saw this last
quarter, like we saw last year as the vintages increased, I do not expect that and it'll work down over time but in the
short-term, I think it'll just be relatively stable because it takes a fair bit of time for the request to work up their way
through the process.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Okay. And then just in terms of your provisions have kind of varied over the course of the
year, can you give us a sense of where you find that settling out relative to that request outlook?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: The provision blipped a couple of quarters and the principal reason for that blip was the
increase in the timeframe that the GSEs were looking at. So, for example, you saw a $16 million increase this quarter,
that was entirely due to that increase in vintage to '05 and '04. So, again, absent that, which I do not expect any more
changes going forward, I would expect that to moderate and go downward.
<Q - Todd L. Hagerman>: Okay. And then just finally, on the mortgage side, one of the things that's been a focal
point, everyone's kind of has a good outlook in terms of at least the first half of '13, but I'm curious specifically for U.S.
Bancorp, what is being done on the front end as the company's look to ramp up the production side relative to that refi,
at some point is going to tail off. Your servicing income continues to grow fairly steadily, but I'm just curious what
you're doing to prevent a more significant decline in mortgage revenues on a go-forward basis particularly as refis
slow.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, this is Richard. We continue to add people, so we're actually flying into the face of the
wind here by continuing to believe that until the refi business is assuredly slowing, which we thought two years ago, we
thought a year ago and I actually don't think even this year will slow, but if it did, we can handle it for the earlier
question. But we're also actually putting more into it, so until it isn't strong, we're going to be stronger. So, we're
putting more and more into that business, Todd, and building market share value.
As I mentioned, we're also probably putting a little bit more than even some of our peers because we want our service
quality to be top quality, we want people to want to do business with us because they'll come back again in the future
when they're looking for purchase as opposed to refi and we want to be a market share leader in both circumstances.
And I'll tell you what you already know but unless the refis have just absolutely hit some saturation which they haven't
so far and nobody has ever figured out how many times people can refinance their house, they seem to be able to do
that endlessly, but when that happens, it is going to be probably as a result of rates starting to trip up. And when rates
start to move up, the other things in the company's balance sheet and income statement that actually will offset the loss
of what would be mortgage momentum and they will twist – turn it into a different spread on a different, more
purchase-related portfolio and we'll be getting benefits somewhere else.
It may not be an exact moment in time, but we actually see that to be a pretty good transition when that happens. But
more importantly, we're adding more and more to our business and growing it right now while refis are strong and then
able to turn that in a heartbeat if and when that moment comes we've talked about.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Given your comments about revenue growth and operating efficiency and
slightly positioning the company for a better environment, can you talk a little bit about what areas you'd likely want to
reinvest the most to drive more growth? Where do you think you can be the most competitive?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, so Andy teased it out a minute ago when we mentioned that we've got some business
plans that are still in their teenage years. Our capital markets, some of our wholesale lines of business, wealth
management for sure and those investment curves are behind us mostly but the benefits are still ahead of us, and in fact
in a couple cases they've been actually negative to the bottom line in this course of getting them to where they are now.
So, we've got some natural intra-company opportunities that will mature in another year, it gives them the chance no
matter what the environment is they will get better and stronger.
The second thing is we're continuing to build into our technology and our infrastructure, the mobile banking and mobile
payments capability, which you know is – everybody has a little of that but that's one of our sweet spots. If you think
about U.S. Bank a couple of years ago, you'd like us for a lot of reasons not the least of which is you like our payments
business. We should expect us now is to make that payments business more than corporate, more than government,
more than merchant and more now mobile payments for all consumers, and by the recent acquisition of [ph] FSV
(43:27), the prepayment company, and some of the other activities we've been doing in payment, you should expect a
lot more from us there; a real leadership position.
That investment curves is probably in its middle stages, but already parts of it are going to start driving some benefits.
And those are fee-based opportunities that don't exist today that we haven't yet been able to bring to the income
statement. So, I'm quite optimistic about our own intra-company maturity and the things that we've invested in that will
start coming to bear. And that's why I said we'll do well even in tough times; when times get really good, all that stuff
gives kind of a trebling effect and it's all very positive.

<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Just one other quick follow-up and that is on a somewhat related topic, you know in the past
you've talked originally thinking to try to recapture the lost revenue from Durbin by pricing up your checking account
product and then wanting to be more competitive. How do you see that kind of shaking out from a competitive
standpoint, the core retail banking offering product in your markets?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, so we did two things there. We promised you that we would still get to that 50%
recovery but we told you we're not quite there; and we're not there yet. Two things have happened because we've given
ourselves more time. One is we're just growing a lot more net customers. You guys don't suffer through us talking
about net customers and going through that because it's a real hard number to measure and everybody can say it, so I
just don't waste our time on that. But the fact is, is that our numbers would belie in hindsight that we are growing the
company. We don't have our free checking product, which is a good thing because we do have customers now that are
here on purpose; they don't have second and tertiary accounts that really don't make any money. We've established a
relationship on a package basis where we can add attributes and/or upsell into something more reasonable for which
they know they're buying and for which they have value for.
And on top of that we've taken the same time on consumers and we've gotten really good at small business. Rick
Hartnack is the Head of Consumer Banking who's retiring next month. He actually succeeded me in running consumer
banking and small business. The thing he did that I didn't do what I ran it was he took small business and put it on the
map for our company; and we are now a very capable and an industry-leading small business provider, both checking
accounts and loans and lines. And mostly that has been a huge benefit kind of under the watermark. We can't see it
under the surface but it's a huge driver for the company. It is deriving a big part of the closure of some of that fee
businesses that we lost through Durbin or some of the CARD Act or things like that because now we just have more of
those customers and they're buying stuff, paying for it, they're aware of it, and they want it.
And so I'm pretty excited about what that caused us to do, which was get good at more things for more people; but
we're still not quite where we needed to be to recover all that fee. We'll have to do it again over the course of time. And
I think mobile payment is going to be – to tie to my last question – is going to be one of the things that will help us to
derive a new revenue stream that doesn't exist today.

Our final question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: What percentage of your residential originations were HARP in the fourth quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It was about 11% again. It's been pretty stable.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. And would you expect an increase in volume due to the changes in reps and
warrants provision rules that were implemented by the FHFA on January 1?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Essentially, no. I mean...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: We're not a big card company and so those are small nuances for us, Kevin, but our company
based on the way we originated in the first place, we just don't have a lot of our volume attributed to that. So, when you
saw last year a lot of the volume and refis was HARP related, it is a good question to ask is when did that start to slow.
For us it won't matter in the first place, it was never a big part. And those new reps and warranties and things coming
out are very de minimis for us and they're not going to change our forecast.

<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. And you mentioned a major increase in the servicing costs due to the regulation.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Are there any things you could do or there any mitigating factors that you can implement
in order to lower those servicing costs on a go-forward basis?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, there's – the answer is of course – and that comes in the form of getting better at it,
centralizing more of it, automating more of it. But a fair amount of it is a derivative of what started out as a settlement
discussion with the big five mortgage services, which we weren't part of. Then the consent order and now what we're
waiting for is what will be the final servicing rules that the [ph] FBP (48:00) owes everybody by January 21. Whatever
those will be, I expect they won't be any more onerous than the consent orders provided which requires us to do very,
very high bar servicing.
So, for instance as an example, a thing called single point of contact. If you were a customer in a modified situation, we
have to assign you a person, you get Andy Cecere, but if Andy Cecere weren't available anytime for you, then you have
to know that Richard Davis will be there for you and Andy and Richard always have to be there, one of the two of them
and perchance they are not, then we have to make sure that Bill is there and that you know Bill is taking over – I mean,
very, very tedious right. So I suspect that might be an overreaction to a consent order process to make sure that we all
get something right that wasn't at the level they wanted it so that's the kind of cost we're baring today that we weren't
around a couple of years ago and is it worth it. As a better servicing model, I'm sure, but I think the new rules will give
us kind of a steady answer.
So, 90 days from now on this call, ask me again and we'll tell you looking back what the final rules look like. I suspect
they'll be more expensive than they were before rules. I suspect for our company, it might actually be less than they are
today because we are trying to over-perform in the consent order to make sure we can get out of it.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: So if you were to estimate the additional cost to service a mortgage as compared to what
it was two years ago, would you say it's approximately doubled what it was or do you...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'd say it's probably 25% to 50% higher. So, if we're done, we get out of the business because
there is not much margin, but it's a new run rate that we've had in the company now for six quarters, so for us it would
only be upside if it were to be lesser than it is today and if it were the same then we're already bearing that burden and
we can manage to it because the overall business is worthwhile. But I don't expect it to get worse so the good news for
us is I think we're at our high watermark and we'll look forward to I think some sustainable new results and that's why
we'll go back to consolidating and automating and getting the rules set. Once we know it's permanent, then we can lock
down a final protocol.
<A - P. W. Parker>: It's the back end costs that have gotten more expensive and as the housing market improves we
see fewer and fewer people with underwater mortgages, so over time, the volumes will go down over the next two to
three years.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: But overall, you would expect core servicing expenses to be roughly – would you say
25%, 30% higher than what they were on a normalized basis when delinquency levels were much lower?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Kevin, I don't give that number. I'll tell you it's not zero and it's not 100%, I don't know what
it is. We actually don't think of it that way because we don't think we're in a permanent circumstance. So, I can answer
that question in 90 days when we figure out and look back on new servicing rules. It will be higher than it used to be,
but it won't be inordinately too high [indiscernible] (50:48) stay in the business.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Okay.

That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I hand the presentation back over to management for
any further comments or closing remarks.
Richard K. Davis
I just want to thank you all for giving us the support you've given us last year. As much as I wish we had some huge
banner headlines to give you, I'm kind of glad we don't. I also appreciate the fact that we try to tell you what we know
when we know things. When we have an opportunity for a public disclosure, we'll tell you what we see. We'll continue
to refresh that in March when we get another chance to be in a public setting and we value transparency and
consistency and predictability, and we're going to continue to deliver that to you. So, thank you for a good year.
Judith T. Murphy
Thanks, everyone, for listening to our results. If you do have any follow-up questions, please feel free to call myself or
Sean O'Connor in Investor Relations. So, thanks, and have a good day.
