MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Monsanto Co. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr.
Hurley. You may begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thank you, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Monsanto's third quarter earnings conference call. This
morning, I'm joined by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO, and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me are
Manny Cruz and Ruben Mella, my colleagues in Investor Relations.
This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also
be available at that address. We're providing you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing
business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the
press release, both of which are posted on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.

For today's call, I'll walk through a brief review of the financial results. Hugh will then take a deeper look at where we
stand on our overall strategy in this fiscal year, and how that informs 2012. Finally, Pierre will focus on the guidance,
and the translation of that strategy to our financial outlook.
For the financial review, I'll anchor off our guidance update, which starts on Slide 4. For ongoing EPS, we've stepped
up the full-year guidance range to a new range of $2.84 to $2.88. That translates to ongoing earnings growth of
between 17% to more than 19% over last year. That means, against our target to reestablish momentum with mid-teens
earnings growth, we now anticipate delivering ongoing growth in the high-teens this year. That step up also flows
through our free cash flow outlook, where we've raised our guidance for the second time, with a revised full-year
outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.
Pierre will go into greater detail on our overall guidance outlook, and the drivers, so I'll focus on a snapshot of the
financial performance on Slide 5. The strength of the wrap-up of the U.S. season, in combination with the contribution
across our businesses, resulted in a better than expected third quarter and underscores the new growth expectations
embedded in our guidance today. Q3 re-emerges as one of the most significant annual earnings drivers this year, with
ongoing earnings per share at $1.26, compared with $0.81 in Q3 last year.
Looking at the detail, the starting point is Seeds & Genomics. In a critical quarter for the U.S. and for our Seeds
business, Seeds & Genomics gross profit increased more than 20% year-over-year. That keeps us on track for
double-digit gross profit growth across the segment for the year, as each of our core soybean, corn, and cotton
businesses have delivered double-digit gross profit growth in Q3 and for the year-to-date.
Corn Seeds & Traits gross profit is up 19% in the quarter and 10% for the year-to-date, reflecting growth across the
globe in our corn business, and the absence of the 2010 restructuring items. Soybean Seeds & Traits gross profit
increased 17% year-to-date, translating to an increase in gross profit margins of nearly 7 points, to 66%. That reflects
the mix benefit from Roundup Ready 2 Yield, as well as a portion related to benefits we're seeing this year, both from
the lower cost of goods in the U.S., and the trait collection for Roundup Ready Soybeans in Brazil, where the
combination of strong yields and a healthy commodity price provide upsides on the royalties we collect through our
value-capture system there.
Following the trends from the first half of the year, Cotton Seeds & Traits continues to perform at the high end of our
expectations, with gross profit growth more than 30%, as cotton acreage rebounds and we see greater trait contributions
from the U.S., India, and Australia. Vegetable gross profit is effectively flat through the first nine months. With this
segment's largest quarter coming in the fourth, we began to see the positive product sales mix in the third quarter, and
we expect that to continue, resulting in full-year growth.
Shifting now to Ag Productivity, this is our second quarter of reporting consolidated results for the Roundup, selective
chemistry, and lawn-and-garden businesses. Year-to-date, Ag Productivity has delivered a cumulative gross profit of
$565 million. From a continuing business standpoint, the gross profit contribution comes from two sources. One of the
most significant relative to our initial expectations is the contribution from our lawn-and-garden business, which is on
pace for a second year of above-historical profitability for us, despite wet weather this spring. The second factor is the
good response from our customers to our Roundup repositioning, which is driving volume and keeping branded pricing
at the high end of our expectations.
Below the line, expenses are tracking along the pattern we expected. In the quarter, SG&A expenses stepped up to $591
million following a run rate near $500 million in the first two quarters. This tracks with the uptick we expected as the
year progressed and we realized more expenses for investments in our people through annual salary adjustments,
typical sales commissions, and annual incentives, as well as the scale-up for new product launches. R&D expenses for
the quarter, and the nine months to-date are tracking higher than last year, as we continue to invest along our expected
growth path to make annual incremental investments in R&D that help fuel our future growth. Our tax rate was 28% in
Q3, translating to a rate slightly above 29% for the year-to-date.
From a free cash perspective, today's guidance increase reflects the continued strong translation of earnings into cash
from our core business growth and through our working capital management. Through the nine months, free cash flow

was a source of cash of $237 million, compared with a use of cash of $1.15 billion last year. That's an improvement of
$1.4 billion that comes from a couple of key factors. Notably, free cash flow for the 2011 period does not include the
cash effect of the Roundup repositioning that was reflected in the year-to-date period for 2010. From a direct business
perspective, the early-year trends have held, as our overall free cash flow for 2011 is benefiting from higher net income
and from our improved working capital management.
Our most significant uses of cash in the quarter continued to be our share repurchase and dividend payments. On share
repurchase, we spent an additional $105 million in the third quarter, taking our cumulative total to $487 million, or
nearly half of our current $1 billion repurchase authorization.
With that backdrop on the financial performance, let me hand the time over to Hugh, who will walk you through the
strategic scorecard.
Hugh Grant
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line today. I'll focus today on a strategic look at our business,
but before I do that, I want to bring up one item that doesn't directly relate to our third quarter business performance.
As we indicated in our press release earlier today, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting
an investigation regarding Monsanto's customer incentive programs relating to glyphosate products in fiscal years 2009
and 2010. Monsanto's received a subpoena for documents from the staff, and while at this point there's not much
additional color that we can add, when there's a development like this, I want to be upfront and share it as directly as I
can with you. We take this seriously, and we're cooperating with the SEC.
So, having noted this new item, let me move back to a discussion of our strategic focus. I recognize that this is a call
where you expect to hear about the performance of the business. Fiscal year 2011 is an important year for us as we
implement our new strategies, and just as importantly, the third quarter is a significant checkpoint. With Latin America
well into harvest, and the U.S. selling season practically complete, the third quarter effectively concludes 2011 from an
operational standpoint.
I'd tell you that we believed momentum was building in the business, and momentum's a really interesting thing. When
it's shifting, you feel it when you talk to your customers long before it shows up in your numbers. Now, we have the
numbers to back that feeling. As we do the diagnostics on 2011, here's my view. First, at the beginning of the year, we
said we'd build a business powered by a seeds and traits engine, and we expect that, on average, over time, that engine
delivers annual mid-teens earnings growth. We expect to make good on that target. In fact, our new guidance positions
us to deliver growth in the high-teens in this very important foundation year. That doesn't alter our long-term view on
the engine itself, but it does mean that, going into 2012, we believe the elements are in place, particularly within our
seeds and traits business, to sustain mid-teens growth, even off this higher base.
Second, that gets to where we stand in 2011, because even more than the pure numbers, what we've accomplished
strategically this year sets up our opportunity for the next stage of growth. We made some significant changes to our
product strategy on both the seeds and traits side, and in our glyphosate business. These changes were big, and they
reflected the feedback that we had directly from our customers. So, delivering out of the gate was important, and at this
point, I can tell you that the results of those product strategy changes are going well. We hear it from growers, we see it
in our numbers, and we feel it in the momentum I mentioned earlier.
So I think of this as a strategic scorecard for the business, and that's reflected on Slide 6. I'll walk you through the detail
behind some of the most prominent factors, but let me summarize my takeaway. First, we're back to a growth mode in
seeds and traits, and we're seeing that show up in our global volume growth, including the opportunity for share gains
in all three major crops in the U.S.
Second, our primary new U.S. products, the Reduced Refuge family in corn, and the Roundup Ready 2 Yield products
in soybeans, both stepped up by at least 10 million acres apiece, to become Monsanto's new platforms in these crops.
And third, we've demonstrated significant growth as we expand our base business into a broader geographic set,

particularly in the areas where technology use is expanding, and where we see the next wave of growth.
On the specifics, the place to begin is corn. We anticipated that our new product strategy would re-ignite volume
growth in the U.S., and it has. In the U.S., our branded corn volume has grown by the largest increment in the past few
years. That means that, against a U.S. corn market that's set to expand over last year, our volume grew faster than the
market, so even with some shifting still happening on acre projections, and the potential for higher returns coming out
of a wet spring, we are well-positioned for organic share growth in our U.S. brand platform, including our DEKALB
brand.
The U.S. growth is complemented by volume growth in Latin America. With harvest in Brazil and Argentina nearly
complete, we have volume growth in our brands in both countries. In Argentina, the overall market expanded
significantly, and our volume outpaced that growth, further expanding our leading share position. In Brazil, planted
acres rebounded some, and with our volume growth, we've maintained our leading share position. If you widen the lens
and you look globally, we grew volume in every significant corn-growing country.
Another factor in corn highlights the importance of mix, and in particular, our trait platforms. We made a significant
product strategy shift last year in U.S. corn. We moved the product ladder spanning the three products in our Genuity
Reduced Refuge family. Those were SmartStax, VT Double PRO, and VT Triple PRO. Getting that three-product
family established in 2011 was a key milestone to set our future growth, and we targeted the range of mid-teens
millions of acres as our foundation. If you go to Slide 7, today we can say that we've delivered in that range, and more
importantly, we established the Reduced Refuge family as the corn foundation of our future in the U.S.
As we projected, from a base of about 3 million acres last year, the acreage planted for the Reduced Refuge family
stepped up roughly 10 million acres in total, to approximately 13 million acres, in just the second year of commercial
scale. To put that in context, that's the largest second-year step-up of any previous corn-trait package in our history.
Just as importantly, the Reduced Refuge family is well-positioned to expand farmer choice, and it's expanding our
high-value technology penetration, and thus our mix.
In 2009, our triple/stack products peaked at about 31 million acres. By this year, the combination of triples, and the
Reduced Refuge family is on approximately 37 million acres, which in turn upgrades more acres to our highest-value
offerings. With the momentum of customers, and the adoption trajectory to say that the Reduced Refuge family has
established itself as the platform for our growth in corn, and from here, we'll do two major things. We'll scale up all
three products again next year to increase availability to farmers and make them the leading product set we offer in
every zone as we launch new traits. They'll be available to be stacked on each of the products in the Reduced Refuge
family. The first opportunity will come as we launch Refuge-in-the-Bag for SmartStax, and following regulatory
approval, also in Double PRO.
The final corn highlight is Latin America corn-trait penetration, as covered on Slide 8. As you think about new areas of
growth, the ramp-up of Brazil and Argentina in both trait adoption and upgrade is one of the most significant elements
that define the landscape in the next few years. In Brazil, we're just in our third year of commercial trait offerings, and
trait penetration in our brands jumped to 64%. Just as importantly this year, we launched a second-generation
above-ground insect package, and we received in-country regulatory approval for two more next-generation stacks. I
think that really underscores the speed at which Latin America is moving. Before any one trait reaches full penetration,
we already have an upgrade available.
The story is similar in Argentina. Our trait penetration expanded in a growing market, but the pacesetter here comes
from the fact that we received approval for our Genuity Triple PRO in Argentina less than a year after the commercial
scale-up in the U.S. With less lag time on approvals and a strong appetite from farmers, the opportunity to see faster
adoptions puts countries like Argentina and Brazil on a different trajectory than we saw in the early days of U.S.
penetration.
If we shift over to soybeans, our focus was establishing Roundup Ready 2 Yield as our platform in U.S. soybeans,
shown on Slide 9. As in corn, we can definitively say that we've delivered on our 2011 target acre range, with Roundup
Ready 2 Yield now gone into its third year of commercial availability. We started from a base of about 6 million acres

last year. We saw, again, a 10-million-acre-plus step-up in soybeans like what we saw in corn, which lands third-year
Roundup Ready 2 Yield at the high end of our target, at approximately 17 million acres.
Rapid farmer adoption means, today, Roundup Ready 2 Yield has clearly achieved the status as our platform in
soybeans. With increased adoption by farmers reaching mid-teens millions of acres, we've reached a scale where we
can effectively move to unconstrained production and availability in the areas that reflect the largest part of our
business, with the only next-generation trait package available to offer customers the option to upgrade to Roundup
Ready 2 Yield and improve their productivity. In our brands, Roundup Ready 2 Yield represented about half of our
volume this year, and we expect that it will step up again next year, as it becomes the leading product in the key
relative maturities.
Also, despite the discounting battle by others in the first-generation Roundup Ready, the strong uptick in Roundup
Ready 2 Yield allows us to reverse the share erosion trend that we've seen in the past two years, stabilize our brand
share, and see the opportunity for share growth this year. This success story gains leverage as Roundup Ready 2 Yield
moves into Brazil as a stacked offering, and we crossed a major milestone in soybeans with the in-country approval of
insect-protected Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans this year. As happened with corn, this approval came sooner than
we expected, and it puts us on track for a commercial launch in the early part of our fiscal 2013, pending approvals in
our key export markets. In fact, we're using this head start in the upcoming season, as we'll be doing on-farm trials with
some large customers to build their experience ahead of commercialization.
In the interest of time this morning, I won't cover everything on the scorecard, but I wanted to share a quick thought on
cotton, since the relative contribution has been so positive in 2011. If you go to Slide 10, cotton is showing real strength
this year, as the renewal of acres in the U.S. comes at a time when the breeding improvements, and the trait
commitments that we made when we bought Deltapine are now paying off.
While everybody today is watching the terrible drought effect on Texas cotton acres, it appears that, overall, 2011 U.S.
acres will expand, and we expect to grow volume, return to branded share growth, and reach the highest penetration in
our history of second-generation traits. This, combined with continued growth in India and Australia, allows cotton to
emerge as a quiet star in this year's landscape, as well as an important foundation for our continued success globally.
The one area that we don't touch in our review is the forward look on our expectations in products and price for the
2012 season. On our second quarter call, we spent quite a bit of time on pricing, but I think the bottom-line outlook
may have lost a little bit in translation. The way I think about pricing is captured on Slide 11. We haven't
communicated our pricing to our customers yet, but as we do, we'll put a big emphasis on new products, whether that's
new hybrids entering the lineup or new technology opportunities like SmartStax and Double PRO RIB.
In fact, our product strategy is focused around creating new value for farmers, and price lift is an outcome of that new
value. We see real pricing opportunity in 2012. This pricing opportunity comes from mix lift, as new products increase
the overall average prices in our portfolio, and also, from the pass-through of the higher costs associated with
production. That's a meaningful lift, and one that also reflects our interest in continuing the momentum, and the
positive feedback that we've experienced with our customers that I described earlier on this call.
It also sets up the conversation that we'll begin having with growers very soon, as we start thinking about the next
season coming in 2012. As we do, I'd tell you that I feel that we're offering farmers the best lineup of products since we
introduced the first biotech traits. The next milestone is the U.S. harvest, and since we don't have a scheduled field
event this year before our annual Investor Day in November, we're planning a key harvest update for investors in the
late summer to share with you the end-season feedback on our product strategies, what harvest conditions look like, and
our early 2012 positioning.
So if you put all this together, and these factors ultimately show up in our financial guidance, but before I hand it over
to Pierre to discuss that, I'd like to share a few final thoughts with you. Importantly, we accomplished what we needed
to do this year operationally. The results of this achievement aren't measured solely in share points or in trait acres. It
also comes in the form of momentum, and I believe we now have that back again. There's still work to do because this
plays out over more than one year, and we're committed to working even harder to support the success of our

customers, and I like our direction.
What I like about what we saw in 2011 is that our growth wasn't from one source. Our performance speaks to the
balance in our strategy. It's more complex than tracking a single trait introduction, but it's contribution from more crops
and more products in more geographies, and it embeds a greater degree of flexibility and opportunity than we've ever
enjoyed before.
All this culminates in carving out a unique space for Monsanto. In an Ag space that needs innovation to meet future
demand, we continue to be the demonstrated technology leader, and we back that with a business engine that translates
innovation into the opportunity for mid-teens annual earnings growth and significant cash flow.
So, with that, let me hand the remaining time over to Pierre, who can give you some color on how all this translates into
our financial outlook. Pierre?
Pierre Courduroux
Thank you, and good morning to everybody on the line. Today, I'll put my emphasis on the step-up in our earnings and
free cash guidance outlook. But before I go through the detail, let me step back and summarize my view as CFO on
where we are. First, we are seeing the translation of strategy into results, and that gives me confidence that our business
is on track. Second, this year, we've been able to translate an even greater portion of that business performance into
financial growth, as we've positioned ourselves very well across our global portfolio. Even off that higher base, I expect
we'll again be able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth in 2012, and that speaks to the continuing opportunity. Even in
an industry like agriculture, where weather and global markets play a role, we have built a business with balance and
opportunity where, over time, we believe we can deliver within the range of mid-teens earnings growth.
Let me walk you through how this comes together this year in our results and our financial outlook on Slide 12. For
bottom-line earnings, we increased ongoing EPS guidance to a range of $2.84 to $2.88 for fiscal year 2011. This new
higher range means we expect to deliver growth in the high-teens this year. The fact that we've reached high-teens
growth underscores, for me, the capability of our core business to deliver meaningful growth, and the leverage that
comes from operational discipline.
As we look at the guidance, the largest contributor to our gross profit growth is our Seeds & Genomics segment.
Entering the year, our target range for Seeds & Genomics gross profit positioned us to grow to $650 million over last
year. Through the first nine months, we've already grown by a little more than $500 million, and with that, we've
crossed the $4.5 billion mark in absolute gross profit and are already within the range of our total gross profit for all of
last year. This is real growth in the business and not timing-related. So, it puts us well on track to be at the top end of
the $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion gross profit target for the full year. Equally important, we expect the growth trajectory
continues in the fourth quarter, with record Seeds & Genomics gross profit growth as our Latin American momentum
carries into a new season.
The next guidance contributor is Ag Productivity. Up to this point, Ag Productivity has delivered gross profit of $565
million, which already puts it within our original guidance range for the full year. Our revised earnings guidance for the
total company reflects a step-up to put Ag Productivity gross profit in the range of $700 million. As Bryan noted, the
largest driver of this increasing Ag Productivity related to our initial expectations comes from the lawn-and-garden
business. Despite less than ideal spring weather, the lawn-and-garden business is on track for its second-largest
historical contribution behind the record year of 2010.
Supplementing that is some additional gross profit contribution from Roundup related to our initial expectations. For
the first nine months, we remain on track with our original volume target of 250 million to 300 million gallons. We've
regained significant brand share, and the strength of pricing outside the U.S. is translating to branded pricing at the
upper end of our expected $8 to $10 range.
If we move below the line, I'll focus on our G&A. At the beginning of the year, we targeted minimal growth for the
fiscal year 2010, in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.16 billion. With the expected step-up in second half with G&A

costs that we described last quarter, we'd expect to land around the top end of that range. That step-up comes from a
couple of key factors we identified in Q2. First are the typical seasonal costs that come as we invest in our people and
support distribution through incentives and commissions. Second, we are making some incremental investments to
support some of the new product launches Hugh described in Latin America. Given that cautious approach to our
spending, I'm satisfied that we are making disciplined investments where SG&A supports future growth.
We are also making some incremental investments in our R&D as we accelerate some development work to support
those Latin American product launches. We will start some technology development work in South America earlier
than we originally planned, which accelerates some of the R&D spend we planned for 2012 into this year. With that
incremental investment, I'd anticipate we'll be slightly above the top end of our original R&D projections, at around
$1.35 billion for the year.
The final factor in our earnings guidance is our tax rate. Year-to-date, our rate is slightly above 29%, as we've realized
a number of discrete tax benefits beyond our original planning. We now expect this rate to carry forward for the fiscal
year and that the tax rate will land in the 29% to 30% range for the year.
If I bring all those elements together, let me tell you how I see the earnings concluding in our final quarter to deliver on
our updated guidance, on Slide 13. As we described in our second quarter call, the fourth quarter in 2011 sets up as a
larger loss than we've seen over the past couple of years. Specifically, with our ongoing EPS of $3.14 through the first
nine months, we expect a loss of $0.26 to $0.30 in our final quarter. The most important driver of earnings will be the
contribution from our Latin American seeds business, on Slide 14.
I'd highlight that the fourth quarter is the beginning of a new season for both Brazil and Argentina, and with the current
momentum, we expect strong growth in the fourth quarter, corresponding to the acceleration Hugh described, as Brazil
and Argentina upgrade their trait mix. Year-over-year, this will be a significant portion of the growth, as we expect
Seeds & Genomics to deliver more than $150 million in incremental gross profit, which would put us at the top end of
our expected GP range.
Ag Productivity is a modest contributor to Q4 earnings, and we expect it to be considerably less than it has been for the
past several years, now that the Roundup portion of the segment is at a lower steady-state level. So, even with a record
Q4 Seeds & Genomics contribution, I expect the decline in Ag Productivity to drive a slightly lower total company
gross profit in the fourth quarter versus last year. That overall GP contribution is not expected to offset the full load of
SG&A and R&D spend I described.
With the incremental investments we are making in both categories, we expect those expense lines to reach their
quarterly peaks for the year. The Q4 run rate for SG&A should continue the step-up we saw in Q3, and our R&D
expense should track similar to the rate we recorded this quarter. Taken together, those expenses are expected to drive
the larger loss we see in the fourth quarter this year. However, as we look into the future, the continued growth in Latin
America should outpace spending growth, so the Q4 loss should come down from this year's volumes.
The last piece I'll cover is the outlook for free cash flow on Slide 15. With the strong cash generation we've seen
to-date, we've raised our free cash expectation for the second time this year, now projecting a range of $1.1 billion to
$1.3 billion. This increase in free cash flow reflects the increase in net income that drives our revised earnings
guidance, as well as the conscious effort we've put behind working capital management as we focus on disciplined
growth. The importance of converting earnings into cash while maintaining a strong balance sheet is one of my
fundamental priorities. It is our cash that allows us to invest in the business for growth and return value to share
owners, and that's how we'll continue to look at cash deployments. For example, for the third quarter, we've used a total
of $938 million on dividends and share buybacks. This is already roughly three-quarters of our new projected cash flow
guidance directly returned to our owners.
Let me conclude by stepping back from the numbers for a moment. I'd summarize by telling you that the importance of
our improved outlook does two things. First, it is the punctuation mark that validates we're on track to come in above
the financial guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year. And that tells me we have the right strategy in place,
we've put the right emphasis on the operational discipline to execute on that strategy, and we've been able to translate

plans into results. Second, it's the first look at what we expect for next year. From this point, we've just established a
higher base. It is still early to set guidance for 2012, but with the business engine we have in place, and the discipline
we've demonstrated this year, I am confident we can carry our mid-teens growth expectations into 2012.

Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA. Please state your questions.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Yeah, if you could tell us – you've got the shift in R&D from Latin America. Can you give
us a sense of how R&D is going to break out in 2012 and over the next couple of years between Seeds & Traits and
breeding after the big bump you made up in breeding in the last couple years?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. I don't think – Mark, I don't think we've projected that, but a rough rule of thumb here is
roughly 50/50 between the breeding, and the biotech piece. And I think the interesting thing – and we've kind of
organized around this – we see an increasing blur between biotech and breeding, that there's a lot of interchange
between those two groups. And then the other piece in Latin America – I don't know, Pierre, I think the main emphasis
and shift in spend there is really pre-launch?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, I think what's important to note is – and that's also one of the drivers of our Q4, is
that, thanks to the earlier-than-expected registrations we got in Latin America, we've been pulling forward some of our
expense into 2012 to be ready to start our field trial work almost a year in advance, so that's one of the key things we
see right now.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please state your questions.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Wanted to talk about corn growth going forward, specifically the Reduced Refuge family.
Hugh, you mentioned you grew about 10 million acres this year. Can we expect similar growth next year, or could it
accelerate? Because I know you were somewhat limited in your availability of VT Double PRO, and I would expect
that to accelerate as you get into 2012, so just a comment on the trajectory of growth for the corn portfolio in 2012.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Don, thanks for your question. So, as we look forward, we will continue – and we built this
strategy this year premised on volume growth, and as we look at the coming year, that will be the continued premise.
And as we laid out this strategy, we built on a 2011, 2012, 2013 view, so this is the ground floor on a three-story
building, so we look for volume growth next year. We could have sold more this year in some of our product, so we'll
be ramping on Double PRO, we'll be ramping on Triple PRO. We've organized around SmartStax to the North. And I
think – from all the grower feedback, I think the Reduced Refuge – there's a lot of enthusiasm around the Reduced
Refuge product. So, getting the regulatory approval on Double PRO, I think, is going to be a – you can never call it

until it's there, but that's going to be a big deal for us. So, we're going to continue to hold the line on pricing and drive
volume growth for the new season.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And the RIB Complete, is the plan to have all your SmartStax in RIB Complete and, assuming
you get that permission for Double PRO, to sort of totally convert the portfolio to RIB Complete?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So, we've been retrofitting plants in advance – production plants in
advance, so our intention would be to make that complete switch across the Reduced Refuge portfolio.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please state your questions.
<Q - Vincent Andrews MBA>: Thanks, and good morning, everyone.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Vincent Andrews MBA>: A little bit of a follow-up on Don's question, but from your comments, if you do $13
million in Reduced Refuge, is it reasonable to assume that SmartStax within that is at least in line with what the
triple-stack did in year two, which was 6 million acres? And then going one step further, the triple-stack in year 3 did
$18 million. Is there any reason to believe that the trajectory of SmartStax in year 3, particularly with RIB Complete,
would not follow along something similar to what the triple-stack did?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So, Vincent, thanks for the questions. As you know, we haven't dissected out the components of
that $13 million, and the rationale for that is I think it delivers a playbook in advance to our competitors. But if you
look at trajectory of growth, I think the telling number is when triples peaked out at 31 million, and you take our
Reduced Refuge family plus triples today, and we're now at 37 million, product ladder, I think, has expanded choice for
growers. It's introduced a wider spread of price point, and I think what we're seeing is SmartStax naturally migrating to
the shorter-season Northern segment, where we'll get much more hybrids. And in Illinois – south-central Illinois, we'll
see our Triple PRO triple mix building out there, and frankly, if we'd had more, we would have sold more this year in
those segments. So, we're taking that into account for production in this coming year.
<Q - Vincent Andrews MBA>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please state your questions.
<Q - Prashant J. Juvekar>: Pierre, I'm looking at your Slide 11, and it seems like germplasm upgrade gives you a
pricing lift of about 5% a year. So, when you offer RIB, which is neither new traits or germplasm, how do you see that
pricing? Would that be offered at a premium because of the convenience?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, P.J, thanks for the question. So, a couple of points – and I'll maybe ask Pierre to add
something to this – but very briefly, you're right. When we look at germplasm, about 20% to 25% of our base seed
offering in the corn, so the hybrids, the germplasms – turns over every year. And if you look at the price spreads in any
given year between our brand-new hybrids, and the exiting hybrids, the price spread is 30%-plus. So, there's about 30%
spread between our new hybrids, which always sell out, and the exiting hybrids. And if you look at that average over
the entire portfolio, to your point, that represents about a 5% to 7% price increase in any given year, and farmers will
happily pay that because those are the best-performing hybrids.

When you look at RIB pricing, in the last six months, we were saying there's two options – we either give away RIB
and use it as a share driver, or we price RIB fully against the convenience and performance that it represents to the
grower – and I think we're erring somewhere in the middle between those two. And as you see RIB price on a bag of
seed, it will be an embedded price within the overall bag. We won't break out a separate line for RIB.
But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, there's a ton of interest out there, because RIB changes the game, and how
they farm. It allows them, with the same amount of manpower, to farm more acres. And in a really wet year like this
one, it would have allowed them to get operations done in a more timely manner. But we're going to take a moderate
pricing approach and allow farmers the benefit of experience, and the technology. Pierre, I don't know if you have
anything...
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, what I like about our pricing strategy right now, I think it touches on all the
components of gross profit potentially because we give farmers a choice between a range of Reduced Refuge family
product – [audio gap] (42:27) – from there, we've got a mix of great opportunity, and then RIB would be a driver of
that. We've got a volume opportunity, and Double PRO would be potentially a driver of that, and obviously, we've got
pure price. So, I think the choice we give to farmers optimizes our potential for growth next year, so I feel really good
about the way we've positioned ourselves right now.
<Q - Prashant J. Juvekar>: And so do you think you have won back enough goodwill from growers that you can look
at some price increases again next year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Say that again, P.J.?
<Q - Prashant J. Juvekar>: So do you think you've won back enough goodwill from growers that you can look at
raising prices again?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Well, I don't think about it like that. I don't think about it as creating goodwill against runway and
price. I think what we've done in this last year – I think it's interesting because we made a strategy shift only in the
U.S., and predominantly in corn in the U.S. It was a product strategy shift, and we spent – and personally I've done a lot
of this – we spent a lot of time getting back to the basics of listening to growers. We've gained high marks, based on
our research, on responding to that grower feedback.
And as I think about the earlier question about '11, '12, and '13, the goodwill that we're generating with growers, we've
been talking about a three-year strategy in this in how we continue to drive, on our side, volume growth; on their side,
improved choice. And that choice will show up in a range of technology offerings and a segmented price, depending on
where we play in the product ladder. So, I think it's going to take a couple of years, but I think this year – this is really
the closeout quarter for us, P.J, and I feel very good in the first year of this. You make changes in a strategy in one year,
but you execute over three or four. So, this is the first chapter.
<Q - Prashant J. Juvekar>: Great. Thank you.

questions.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: I guess, just to tease out one more question about your pricing philosophy, as you look
farther out at the traits in your pipeline, do you see any that you feel comfortable already can give you a significantly
higher rung in the ladder, as opposed to just pricing for penetration?

<A - Hugh Grant>: It's a tricky – let me try it this way. We think that in the long run, the value share between the
incremental bushels that we create, between that one-third to two-thirds split with the grower, is a good rule of thumb.
And there's no new acres on the planet, so the focus increasingly is how do you unlock new bushels. And the grower's
kind of agnostic whether that comes from an improved trait or improved genetics. He's just looking for what comes
over that yield monitor. So, as we look forward, I think a piece of this is going to be to continuing to improve the
genetics, and how we morph between biotech, and the genetics, and the investment there.
The other one, I think, is continuing to drive better bug and weed control, and then unlocking some of these yield traits.
And you're going to see the next wave of that I think in soybeans, which for 10 years has been a little bit slower than
corn, but we're beginning – I think with what we've done this year with the new platform, you begin to see cause for
hope around that Ready 2 Yield. So, I don't think it's any one silver bullet in this, but you have to satisfy the grower's
demand for driving yield. I think it's about as fundamental as that.

Our next question is from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray. Please state your questions.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks a lot. Congratulations on a nice quarter, guys. My question is on the glyphosate side of
the business. Considering the success you've had this season and, as you indicated, the higher end of your pricing
range, what are your thoughts on pricing action as you look ahead to next year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. It's still early, but, philosophically, as we think ahead, we will continue to focus on
competing directly with generic material, and I would anticipate that we will lay our Roundup pricing pretty much right
on top of where we see generics. It's still early days for that, but we're going to keep a vigilant eye on generic material,
and we will compete directly with that. And it's kind of to my earlier point, when you lay out one of these strategies,
you can't change course every year. So, that was the strategy we laid out last year, and I anticipate we'll continue to
execute that through the coming season. And I'll tell you, it's early days, but we've seen a nice rebound in brand share
and – albeit, at very different price points, but nice rebound in brand share and good feedback from growers.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please state your questions.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning, Hugh. Based on your commentary, you seemed pleased with the
Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybean sales results this year, and yet if I look at the commentary on Slide 6, your scorecard,
you seem to stop short of endorsing market share growth there. Can you comment on what's transpired on
first-generation Roundup Ready soybeans and implications for where your share may have trended in the U.S. market
this season?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Kevin, thanks for the question. I think as we look across the board this year, it's always one of
these awkward things, that tomorrow morning the crop report comes out, and we get another snapshot and clarity on
how big the U.S. plantings have been. So, there's always a bit of reticence on guessing the day before, but – so if you
take the caveat of uncertainty on acres and you take the caveat on likelihood of higher returns, given the wet spring, as I
look across our key crops, I feel good about share growth in each of these, so in beans, corn, and in cotton.
The interesting thing in beans is the kind of yin and yang, because tremendous progress on Roundup Ready 2 Yield, but
a price fight in the market on Roundup Ready 1, and the older technology. And you see some counterbalance between
those two, but if you look at – to your specific question, if you look at beans overall, this was transitional year for us,

and after three years with 17 million acres, we built a platform.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Just to follow up, Hugh, what is the magnitude of the price pressure on Roundup Ready
1?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So this is real rough, and it's going to vary all over the country, but from a marketing point of
view, the interest and insight I think as you see – if you look at the spread between 2s and 1s, and what the farmer's
paying, there's probably – the discounting involved, there's probably about a 10% spread between the old technology
and the new. And that – again, that varies by market segment.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line with Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please state your questions.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. If I can try to translate your qualitative commentary on corn and soy share in the
United States this year into quantitative terms, is it that you think that you've gained about a point of share in corn and
your soy share change is about zero?
<A - Hugh Grant>: No, I – Jeff, thanks for the question. So, with all the previous caveats on who knows how big the
market is, if you were – if I was guessing this today, I'm guessing in both these crops it's around a point, but I – we'll be
wiser with data, but I think in corn and soy, it's probably about a point of share gain, and in cotton, it would be several
points. There's been a significant – we saw – not just in the U.S., but we saw in Australia and in India real strength in
the market. But if you look in the U.S., we saw the effects of breeding and technology really coming together in the
Deltapine business. Here's the significant piece. If you look at corn and you look at that point, it's organic growth. It's
not acquired, it's not bought, it's not bolted on. It's organic growth, and I think that's a nice temperature check on a new
product strategy.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: And then lastly, in terms of the SEC investigation into Roundup or glyphosate incentives,
do these incentives tie glyphosate to seeds, or are these incentives located solely in the glyphosate or Roundup sector?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, they're – it's the latter. So, there's no tie to our seed business, Jeff.

Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital. Please state your questions.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Yeah, good morning. If we could go to the Seeds & Traits business, in the quarter you actually
grew gross profit more than you grew sales, so your incremental margins were more than 100%, and that's at a time that
the underlying seed price with your contract farmers should have been going up as the crops themselves were going up.
So, can you walk through the benefit buckets of how you were actually able to grow gross profit more than sales when
at least some of the COGS had some upward pressure on it?
<A - Hugh Grant>: I'll maybe ask Pierre to cover that, Duffy. Thanks.

<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, Duffy, when you look at cost of goods, based on our production cycle, based on the
way as well where we hedge our cost of goods – I mean, our grower contracts basically, actually the impact of the
commodity price raising doesn't have a direct translation into the quarterly earnings. That's part of the way we run our
business. Actually I think we talked about that during the last call. We have a hedging strategy that covers the
production cycle from one year to the other. So, it's no surprise you don't see that reflected during the quarter. So,
regarding the upside you see in the Seeds & Traits margin, so definitely soy would be one of the big drivers where
we've seen great improvements into our margin, and it's a factor of a combination of things.
So one would be the success of our Roundup Ready platform, and as Hugh was saying, the fact that we chose not to
participate into some of the Roundup Ready 1 fight in terms of pricing, so definitely having a positive impact on our
margins. The second one is, this year, actually, we enjoyed very favorable cost of goods in soy actually. So, we enjoyed
very nice cost of goods in soy. And then, still in soy, there is an element that may be lost and – our business is a global
business, and the Brazil POD actually this year is having a very, very nice impact on our earnings. And PODs basically
fuel margins, so that's also a very nice piece. So, obviously this one is, depending on commodity price, it is, depending
on yield, on acre planted, but this is one of the key drivers we've seen into our margins. So, I hope it helps you think
about that.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. And then just, Hugh, on the comments you've been making relative to corn seed, either
market share or volume growth, I'm assuming that's excluding the Holden's business. And what would those numbers
or commentary be like if you lumped everything together, so the Holden's plus your branded business?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. So, Duffy, you're right. That does exclude Holden's, and I don't think we've done a breakout
on Holden's yet. But, Bryan, I don't think -
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Yeah, I think just too early in the season, given that they report to us later in the season.
<A - Hugh Grant>: They're usually the last piece in, Duffy.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. But is it fair to assume that that's maybe where some of the share gain is coming from, is
from those guys?
<A - Bryan Hurley>: I would say it's probably still too early to tell just because we literally don't have that data yet.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research Co. Please state your questions.
<Q - Michael Piken>: Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit – we've been hearing about some insect
pressure a little bit in the Midwest and a lot more than maybe last year. Could you talk about, as you think about how
you're going to market sort of the Reduced Refuge family, how much of it is going to be based on its ability to combat
insect pressure versus the convenience factor of RIB as you sort of take the product to market for next year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Great question. So, a super wet spring, still early, you're beginning to see the first rumblings on
bug count because they don't like wet springs. Nobody does. So, early indications are populations took a bit of a ding.
I'm encouraged, if you step back and you say, despite that, what did farmers do, you see – my point earlier on triples, if
you look at the peak on triples at 31 million acres, and then you look at triples plus Reduced Refuge now at 37 million,
I think that speaks volumes on how growers are thinking about this. Particularly with commodity prices where they are,
even moderate infestations, they're not going to risk losing a bushel. So, that's the first point.
The second point is, with this new product strategy, with a ladder in there, they can dial in the product that they want to
use relative to the infestations that they anticipate on their farm. And then the last point I think is really where you were

starting, which is the convenience in this. In a wet spring, the convenience, if you're struggling with manpower on
eliminating that refuge, on taking down the number of passes on that field, even in a light bug infestation, that's a great
timesaver, and time equals leverage and efficiency. So, we'll be positioning this obviously on bug control, but also on
the leverage of just pure convenience.
<Q - Michael Piken>: Great. And then one other question, just as we think about the cotton market, and you sort of
indicated you got several points – obviously Texas has had some issues with the drought, and what not – what market is
there specifically that you're gaining the most share in? Is it in that Texas area or is it back in sort of the delta Southeast
area, where maybe the Triple Nickel was historically really popular, if you could just give a little more color in terms of
where you're picking up that share?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes. We've seen probably the biggest shift in the mid-south. You're right. Texas has gone through
an absolutely dreadful year, and growers have really suffered in that market, but for us, it's been the Mid-South. And
we've been talking for two seasons now about some of the new varieties, and how they had the capacity to supplant
Triple Nickel, and that's really playing out in the field now. The feedback from growers has been phenomenal. And
when you see share shift in cotton, that happens in larger increments than in corn, so we're seeing nice traction in those
markets.

<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks. Thank you.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Rob, this is Bryan. I'm conscious that we're running up against the hour, so maybe if we could
take one more question, and then give just a minute for Hugh to wrap things up.

Sure, Mr. Hurley. Our next question is from James Sheehan of Deutsche Bank. Please state your questions.
<Q - James Sheehan>: Good morning. Could you just explain, if you can, why the investigation on glyphosate is the
SEC rather than the U.S. Department of Justice or some other agency, and what would you see as potential downside
risk there? Would the penalty be fines or reimbursement of customers, or what would you see as a remedy if there was
misconduct?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the question. I think, out of respect for the SEC, and their processes, there's really not a
great deal that I can say at the moment. It is focused on glyphosate. It's focused on our customer incentives, and it's
focused on the 2009/2010 timeframe. And it's early days, but we'll just starting to document from here. We're
cooperating to our full ability. But beyond that, I don't think there's a great deal I can say at this stage.
<Q - James Sheehan>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the question.

So maybe – let me just quickly wrap up. I know we're a little bit tight on time, and I will be brief. But I did want to
reiterate that the third quarter for us is really – it's really the turning point before we start shifting our attention to 2012.
And in a lot of ways, we'll be living in our new year, in our next fiscal year, well before this growing season is too far
along. So, as we start looking at 2012, as we use this quarter as the punctuation mark of the closeout for this year, let
me just summarize my thoughts about this year and beyond.
First, I feel really good about 2011. This was an important year for us in many ways. It was an important year to
demonstrate that we had the strategy right, and more importantly, we can deliver on that strategy, and I believe we've
done that. I feel equally good about '12. I think about '11 as a starting point as we play into '12 and beyond that into '13,

and with what we've accomplished this year, I believe that our engine's in place to continue that momentum into the
next season.
And finally, that speaks to the continuing opportunity that we see in a world that's increasingly going to need greater
productivity on every acre everywhere the agriculture is conducted in the world, and we're a company that can deliver
better technology in a way that positions us well for balance, consistent mid-teens earnings growth going forward.
So thanks for your attention this morning. Thanks for your support. And I wish you all the best over the coming holiday
weekend.
