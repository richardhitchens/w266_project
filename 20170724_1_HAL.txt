promissory note that Halliburton intends to execute with its primary customer in Venezuela. Additional details and
reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press
release which can be found on our website.
Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up
during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone. Our performance this quarter demonstrates that Halliburton is the
execution company and we are the leader in North America. Here are a few key highlights.
Total North America revenue increased 24%, outpacing the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 21%.
North America margins grew into the double-digits. And although our international operations continue to be
challenged, the numbers came in about as expected and we continued to tailor our business to the market as we wait for
a recovery. And we outperformed our major peer in every single geomarket, demonstrating once again that we continue
to grow our market share globally.
Since this is my last call, today, I want to share with you my view of the evolution of the North America land market,
our customer base there, and why I believe it will continue to surprise to the upside.
Now for 25 years, I've had a fantastic front row seat to the development of U.S. unconventional resources. We have
become the largest service company in North America and that growth didn't happen by accident. First, it was due to
the leadership of Jim Brown and his visionary management team. They saw the potential of unconventional resources
in the region at the same time as a group of key early mover customers. As a result, we decided to work together using
lots of trial and error to unlock this resource. We established enduring customer relationships and gained unparalleled
base and knowledge that still provides us a sustained advantage today.
I think it's important to look at the North America unconventional ecosystem to understand our customers' behavior and
why their ability to so quickly increase production has expanded rapidly. Currently, there's a strongly held view by
energy investors that the U.S. independent operators behave as a group. That view is wrong.
When thousands of companies make discrete decisions about the same market each day, they do have a tendency to
swing the activity and production pendulum too far one way or the other. That is not groupthink. It is the impact of
individuals trying to do the right thing for their investors. Our U.S. customer base is not ten or so countries like OPEC.
It is made up of thousands of companies from IOCs to individually-owned businesses.
When you look at them separately, you see thousands of entrepreneurial, smart and motivated risk takers. They readily
adapt to the quality of their reservoirs, have almost unlimited access to capital, aggressively apply new technology and
quickly morph their business models and structures to meet changing market conditions, and yes, sometimes even take
advantage of U.S. restructuring laws. They are your classic American entrepreneurs and their success should be
recognized.
In Silicon Valley, such a success would be greatly celebrated as another industry disrupter. The unconventional
disruption is not widely celebrated beyond the energy space, but it should be. The development of U.S. unconventional
resources has been as disruptive to the global energy markets as Amazon has been to big-box retailing or Uber to the
taxi business. It unleashed a wave of cheap reliable energy that has disrupted global geopolitical and energy dynamics,
made the U.S. more energy independent, caused OPEC to react and changed the fundamental economics of offshore
production. And I believe it has created hundreds of billions of dollars of economic value, added hundreds of millions
of dollars to government tax coffers and provided untold savings for consumers. So unconventionals is what I would
call a disruptor, so let's celebrate that.

Now, I've heard energy investors say that today's customer behavior shows nothing was learned in the last downturn.
That simply is not true. Our customers are smart and adaptive and they do learn from the past. Their business DNA is
to be survivors and they are. Look at the reaction in the past several weeks. Today, rig count growth is showing signs of
plateauing and customers are tapping the brakes. This demonstrates that individual companies are making rational
decisions in the best interest of their shareholders. This tapping of the brakes is happening all over the place in North
America. I can tell you the market will respond. It will rebalance and these companies will stay alive, survive and
thrive because that is what they do.
I said several quarters ago that customer animal spirits were back and they are with a vengeance. And they are now
running free through North America. Here is my last piece of wisdom for you: Do not bet against the animal spirits that
our North America customers embody. I never have and I never will because that is a bet that you will lose.
Now, today is my last conference call and I'd like to take a moment to thank our analysts and investors. It's been a
pleasure working with you. And although we haven't always agreed, I've always enjoyed the spirited debates and
intelligent conversations. I would also like to thank the employees at Halliburton for their hard work throughout my
career. We have been through many cycles, emerging stronger from each one, and I am proud of what we have
accomplished together.
And even though I will be absent from future calls, I look forward to the next 18 months, serving Halliburton as
Executive Chairman. I am happy to leave these calls in the capable hands of Jeff, Chris and the other members of our
experienced management team. I have no doubt they will continue to lead the company as a customer-centric and
returns-focused business. And remember one thing, we are the execution company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Well, thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. We continue to execute
our strategy to maximize asset value for our customers and deliver differentiated technology and services that we
believe will generate superior returns over the long-term.
Here are some highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5 billion, representing a 16% increase
compared to the first quarter this year. Total adjusted operating income was $408 million, primarily driven by
continued strengthening of market conditions in North America which were partially offset by pricing pressure
internationally.
Our North America revenue increased by 24%, outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of
21%. The completion and production division revenue increased 20% and operating margins improved by an
impressive 700 basis points to approximately 13%, driven by the strength of our production enhancement, cementing
and completion tools product service lines.
Cash flow from operations delivered about $350 million. I'd like to take a moment now to welcome Summit ESP and
its employees to the Halliburton family. We were pleased to announce this recent transaction and are excited about
what it means for us as we continue to strengthen our artificial lift capabilities.
Now, I'd like to provide some regional commentary around our quarterly performance. I believe we found the bottom
of the international rig count in the first quarter. However, I don't expect a near-term rebound in the international
markets for several reasons. First, the lengthy contracting cycles will mute any near-term pricing inflection. Second,
our international customers need confidence in commodity prices in order to overcome the duration risk in their
projects.
We continue to collaborate with our customers to lower the cost on these projects. And while some are moving towards
FID, it's important to remember that there's a significant time between planning FID and revenue generation for
Halliburton. And, finally, I've been consistently more conservative on the international market and it's played out

exactly how I called it. Today, I expect that there will be improvement in activity over the remainder of the year, but
these improvements are not concentrated enough to offset the continued pricing pressure. As a result, the international
markets will continue to move sideways.
With all of this said, it's important to understand that we're now into the third sequential year of significant
underspending in the international markets. This implies that the production declines outside of certain OPEC countries
will begin to accelerate, particularly next year, as the backlog of new projects are completed and additional projects are
not coming behind them.
In the meantime, we're actively managing cost, while protecting our valuable international position for the eventual
market recovery. With the current level of underinvestment internationally, production declines are a certainty and you
know where that leads. Our Drilling and Evaluation division is driven in large part by our international footprint. And
while we experienced a modest increase this quarter, largely driven by increased drilling activity in Latin America and
the seasonal rebound of North Sea and Russia, the overall market continues to move sideways with continued pricing
pressure.
Now, turning to North America. After the operational update we gave in the first quarter, some of you were skeptical
when we accelerated our equipment reactivation. But based on our performance during the second quarter, there is no
doubt we successfully executed our plan and that this decision was not only right but dead on target.
Why is that? Well, during the second quarter, we continued to see strong incremental demand for completion
equipment from our customers. The reactivated equipment we brought back went to work at leading edge pricing and
has been accretive to overall margin and is expected to deliver acceptable returns that exceed our cost of capital.
Our sand war room and logistics infrastructure allow us to manage the completions' intensity our customers demand
today and we've been successful passing along supply cost increases to our customers. Our internal manufacturing
capability is a proven differentiator in today's environment. It allows us to be flexible by being able to build what we
need, when we need it, particularly in a rapidly changing market.
Now, today, we believe that current customer demand has outpaced the supply of completions equipment. And this
should create a runway for a strong utilization through the second half of the year. We remain committed to generating
industry-leading returns and reactivating our equipment was the first step towards delivering the results you have come
to expect from us.
As some of you have heard me say before, customer urgency is the foundation for the path to normalized margins.
Today, our customers remain urgent, and, therefore, we believe our path to normalized margins is achievable. We get
there through a combination of increasing leading pricing, improved legacy pricing, better utilization and continued
cost control.
Let me be clear. Our pressure pumping equipment is sold out in the third quarter. As we gauge the utilization of our
equipment on a 24/7 basis, we see a significant opportunity to improve and drive the downtime out of our calendar. In
this environment, it's imperative to be aligned with the most efficient customers where we can create value for them,
while delivering the best returns for Halliburton. Filling our calendar with hyper efficient customers is an important
part of what allows us to achieve our margin goal.
Looking forward, it's too early to tell the impact of commodity prices on customer plans for 2018. However, as Dave
said earlier, at Halliburton, we never underestimate our customers' ability to adapt to the environment. In the first
quarter, we experienced significant inflation in sand prices and increased volumes. As we continue to pass through sand
cost to our customers, we expect to see greater technology adoption, making better wells through engineered solutions.
For the first time in years, in the second quarter, we experienced our first decline in average sand pumped per well. Let
me repeat that because I think this is important. We saw a decline in the average sand pumped per well. And while this
is only one data point, it's something we'll be watching. We believe current sand price levels have encouraged operators
to optimize their completion design using more science as opposed to simply maximizing sand in a trade for increased
production.

We maximize returns on our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our
customers' cost per BOE. Our strategy around technology development is to make returns for Halliburton. Very simply,
our decision process around technology can be summed up into three questions. First, does it reduce costs? Second,
does it produce more barrels? Or third, does it do both? As a result, we create cutting-edge technology that sets new
standards for service quality and performance while making better wells for our customers.
For example, in a recent effort in the Permian Basin, we used our Transcend permeability modifiers to increase
production by over 60% compared to previous completion methods. The Transcend permeability enhancer portfolio is
our premier offering for flow enhancing technology. Using proprietary microemulsion technology, Transcend
enhancers expand the reservoir contact area and improve fluid flow to increase the recovery factor for our customers.
For unconventional mature fields, we developed the BaraShield light fluid system tailored to reservoirs with salt
formations and low fracture pressure to reduce circulation loss and washout. This custom tailoring allows us to reduce
mud loss, increase drilling efficiency and ensure zonal isolation for an efficient completion. In today's environment, it's
crucial that technology be adaptable to customer demands and improves efficiency.
During the second quarter, our industry-leading cementing technology NeoCem was used in over 350 wells per month,
including cementing the longest onshore lateral in history, a well that we are now completing. NeoCem delivers high
performance compressive strength, elasticity and sheer bond at lower density than conventional systems, saving time
and providing improved performance.
Now, these three examples show the creativity of our chemistry-based research and development teams. We have
terrific engineers and scientists looking at every way we can create efficiencies, reduce cost and make more barrels.
Internally, we have similar initiatives of continuous improvement, including reducing the time for R&D projects to
come to market like our very deep resistivity tool, which went from design to field in only nine months. Our surface
efficiency initiatives with hydraulic fracturing reduce the downtime between stages. We are always pushing to improve
our processes and optimize the services that we bring to market.
Overall, I am confident about Halliburton's ability to grow North America margins and maintain the run rate for our
international business for the remainder of the year. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course.
We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain absolutely focused on delivering best-in-class returns. North
America is clearly serving as the world's swing producer, which means this is where the game will be played, and
Halliburton is the distinct leader in this market.
Now, I'd like to welcome Chris Weber to the Halliburton team as our new CFO. Throughout his career, he has worked
in consulting, operations and finance with significant international experience. These combined traits will help
Halliburton and they make him an excellent fit for our team.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Chris to provide some details around our financials. Chris?
Christopher T. Weber
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a summary of our second quarter results compared
sequentially to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, representing an increase
of 16% while operating income doubled to $408 million. These results were primarily driven by the improved activity
in pricing in our completion and production division in North America.
Now, let me compare our divisional results to the first quarter of 2017. In our completion and production division,
second quarter revenue increased by 20% while operating income increased 170%, primarily driven by increased
activity in pricing in our U.S. land pressure pumping business. We also experienced increased well completion activity,
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by pricing pressure in the Middle East.
Turning to our drilling and evaluation division. Revenue and operating income increased by 9% and 2% respectively,
primarily due to increased U.S. drilling activity. In the United States, our drilling and evaluation revenue grew in line

with rig count. On the international side, revenue was up due to increased drilling activity in Latin America, North Sea
and Russia, partially offset by price pressure across the international markets.
Now, let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially,
primarily driven by continued improvement in pricing and activity in our U.S. land business, particularly our pressure
pumping and well construction product service lines as well as higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In
Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 10%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela
and Columbia as well as higher stimulation activity in Argentina.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue increased 12%, primarily due to a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and
Russia, resulting in higher drilling, well completions and pipeline and process service activity. For Middle East/Asia,
revenue increased 2%, primarily as a result of increased fluid services in Asia Pac and higher wireline and well
completion activity in the Middle East. Partially offsetting these increases was pricing pressure throughout the region
as well as declines in fluid and stimulation services in the Middle East.
Our corporate and other expense totaled $114 million in the second quarter, which was higher than originally
anticipated, primarily due to approximately $42 million in litigation settlements and one-time executive compensation
expense during the quarter. Of which, $29 million is a loss contingency in connection with an understanding with the
SEC staff to settle the previously disclosed investigation of certain past matters related to our operations in Angola and
Iraq. The settlement is pending approval by the commissioners of the SEC. Separately, the DOJ has advised us that it
has completed its investigation of these matters and will not be taking any action. We anticipate that our corporate
expenses will be approximately $70 million for the third quarter of 2017.
During the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax charge of $262 million for a fair market adjustment, which is required
by accounting rules related to an expected exchange of $375 million of our Venezuela receivables for an
interest-bearing promissory note of that same value. This note is with our long-standing primary customer in
Venezuela. Similar to the Venezuela notes exchange we did in the second quarter of 2016, this new instrument will
provide a defined payment schedule while generating a return. We intend to hold the notes to maturity and expect to
collect 100% of the principal. It is important to note that to-date we have received all payments required by the 2016
notes.
As a function of our reduced debt balance, we reported $121 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking
ahead, we expect net interest expense for the third quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the
second quarter came in lower than expected at approximately 23% due to certain discrete items related to prior year
audits. For the remainder of 2017, we still expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%. Cash flow
from operations during the second quarter was approximately $350 million and we ended the quarter with
approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. These results were largely driven by an improvement in days sales
outstanding.
Historically, our annual cash flow is backend loaded for the year and we don't believe that 2017 will be any different.
Continued improvement in our earnings and a number of working capital initiatives should strengthen our cash
generated from operations as the year progresses.
Now, I would like to provide some color on our near-term operational outlook. The macro market dynamics make
forecasting a challenge, but this is how we see the third quarter playing out. For our completion and production
division, we expect that our North America sequential revenue will outperform average U.S. land rig count, while
international revenue will remain flat.
In addition, we expect margins for the division to increase by 225 to 325 basis points. In our drilling and evaluation
division, we are anticipating North America revenue will grow in line with the average U.S. land rig count, while the
international market will remain flat to slightly down. We expect margins for this division to remain relatively flat
sequentially.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff?

In closing, there are a few things I want to highlight. Our second quarter results clearly demonstrated the strength of our
franchise in North America and our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. If you believe in energy, you
should be invested in North America. Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of the year will remain strong
as a result of our ability to grow our North America margins and continue to maintain revenue and margins in our
international business. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. We will continue to drive superior
execution and remain focused on delivering best-in-class returns.
I want to take a moment to thank Dave for his leadership with Halliburton during his 17 years as CEO. He created an
amazing legacy and our employees, customers and shareholders have benefited greatly from his management of our
company. I've had the pleasure of working with Dave for almost 30 years. He's an important mentor to me. Together,
we developed a strategy and leadership team for our company and I look forward to working with him over the next 18
months.
Before we open the call up for questions, I'll go ahead and ask the first one myself because I know it's on everyone's
mind. What are we doing around newbuild equipment? The simple answer is that we are first and foremost a returns
focused organization. We have the ability to make a series of discrete decisions around equipment and we'll only bring
it out under certain conditions.
First, that it's backed by customer commitment. Second, that it captures leading-edge pricing, which is accretive to our
margins. And finally, it generates acceptable return on investment. So let me remind everyone that we have not
invested in our legacy fleet in two-and-a-half years. Prudently managing the health of our fleet is important to maintain
the type of service quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect. Therefore, some replacement of
equipment will be necessary over time. Our manufacturing center in Duncan is a powerful competitive differentiator
for our organization. It allows us to be nimble and build equipment as needed with short lead times. This flexibility
allows us to control the rate at which we manufacture, building as little as 2,000 horsepower at a time if need be.
We delivered what we said we would on the reactivation plant. When we build additional equipment, we'll do it with
the same discipline around returns. Halliburton is the execution company and you have to trust me to do the right thing.
Run the business in the right way and make the right decisions. That answers it.
Now, let's open it up for other questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning, Jud.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Great. And, first, let me say, Dave, congratulations on a great career as CEO of Halliburton. I
enjoyed working with you the last several years.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Same, back at you.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. Thanks. First question, I wanted to just circle back on the impact of reactivations in 2Q
and how to think about any impact on the third quarter. It was talked about in terms of negatively impacting margins on
your first quarter call. You still had incrementals in C&P close to 50%. Could you maybe walk us through how you
were able to offset some of the reactivation costs? And then to what extent will reactivation cost impact the third
quarter? And do you intend to reactivate any more equipment or is it more refurbs or newbuilds at this point?

<A - David J. Lesar>: Look, Jud, thanks. Bottom line is the costs were lower than expected in Q2. And that's because
we got there faster and cheaper than we thought. Our Duncan manufacturing team just simply way outperformed both
by speed and bringing down the cost of everything. The other thing that happened was our people went back to work
faster and that's principally because of all of the demand that we saw for our equipment. I suppose one other thing is we
were successful in bringing back a large quantity of former Halliburton employees, which is something we always
wanted to do, but that also means that they go back to work more quickly with substantially less training.
But, as we look ahead to Q3, obviously, there'll be new challenges to deal with. For example, our employees. Our
employees haven't had raises in three years and so we plan to, for example, provide our employees with raises. But
what I would like you to do is listen to Chris' guidance on completion and production. We said we'll outperform the rig
count growth on revenue and continue to improve margin. So that's really how we see that.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. And I guess just as my follow-up, just to kind of think about the progression on – I'll
just stick there to C&P for now. One of the scenarios that's talked about if oil prices stay between $45 and $50 is that
we continue to step up in terms of completion activity next couple of quarters, then maybe level off. Is getting to
normalized margins a realistic scenario in your mind? And if so, do we hit those by the fourth quarter? Or would it be
reasonable to anticipate being at normalized margins in next year if activity were to kind of level off at 4Q levels?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, look, we're not backing off our expectation on normalized margins. As I'd said and I
won't give you a date, but I don't have a crystal ball, but I expect it would be into 2018. But it starts with customer
urgency as I've described and that really means having targets to meet targets, and that's where we absolutely shine it
on. That's what our value proposition does. And we still see supply and demand tightness. I mean, our calendar is full
as we look out. And so I don't see any change in my outlook.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll turn it back.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning, James.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey, James.
<Q - James West>: And, Dave, my congrats as well on one hell of a run at Halliburton.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you.
<Q - James West>: Jeff, I know you've answered my question already to a certain extent at the end of your prepared
comments there. But as we think about newbuilds in the market, you laid out your three criteria for newbuilds. Are we
at those criteria yet? And are you contemplating newbuilds kind of as we speak besides replacements, incremental
newbuilds?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. Look, I'm going to go back to what I said on this, James. And I'd be crazy to lay out
our market strategy in detail here. But I laid out the conditions, which is committed client contracts or commitment
from clients, leading-edge pricing, and then the ability to generate adequate returns. Short answer is we haven't built
anything so far this quarter, but I would say if the opportunity above does present itself, then we have the ability and
the capability to quickly meet that demand with Duncan.
<Q - James West>: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jeff, as my follow-up here, we have seen some additions by smaller
companies that are mostly the ones that have either IPO-ed or trying to IPO and need to show some growth to do that.
But as you look at your major competitors and look across the pressure pumping marketplace, do you see much
additional or incremental horsepower being added outside of kind of what's probably the natural attrition in the market?

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No. I mean, our view had always been that there would be attrition. We see that. And
today, our view of the market is in fact sold out. And that's part of the reason we see DUCs building and other things.
And we've really got the same amount of horsepower that's been in the market. It's changed hands in a couple of
instances. But with respect to the headline amount of horsepower that was there in 2014, we're well short of that today.
<Q - James West>: Right. Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks, James.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, a quick question here for you. Just given the absence of
reactivation friction, or at least not as much in the third quarter, assertive pricing that you're gleaning given the
undersupply nature of the frac market and the sense of urgency that you talked about and the leveling off of the supply
chain inflation, and yes, you sort of mentioned some wage inflation, but why wouldn't incrementals in the third quarter
for C&P be better than what they were in the second quarter? Because your guidance implies, assuming a low
double-digit rate of revenue expansion, somewhere kind of in the 40% to 45% incremental margin range. That strikes
me as conservative based upon the facts as you have laid them out.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, first of all, I won't go lay all of that out, but let's think about what Dave said in terms
of tapping the brakes. And so we see some tapping of the brakes, which in my view is better described as, let's say,
going from 80 miles an hour to 70 miles an hour. But it hasn't limited the ability to push on price. And our guys are
absolutely doing that every day. And as I've said, we still see the customer urgency. So we are moving on price all of
the time, but I think that if we go back to Chris' guidance, I mean, that's solid progress particularly as I described kind
of the macro environment that we I guess all have talked about.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. With regard to the cadence of reactivations during the second quarter, would you
describe those as having been relatively evenly distributed over the course of Q2, front end loaded, or backend loaded?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: That is ratable sort of Q1/Q2.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: There was no particularly weighting one way or the other.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks very much.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks, Bill.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.

certainly be missed, and we wish you well on your new role.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you.
<Q - Angie Sedita>: So, on the question, for Jeff or Dave, on the completion of frac intensity, is it fair to say that you
haven't seen that yet peak? And if so, when you think about North American revenues going into 2018 in a flat rig
market, should we still see revenues starting to flatten out as well? Or could you see still some growth in that revenue
cadence with the completion intensity, your thoughts on 2018 in this flattening rig market?

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, Angie, it's too early to call on 2018. What I would say is the pace that we see we see
a solid ramp in terms of our ability to execute and deliver on the things that we've talked about with respect to
normalized margins. We do see currently DUCs building. There's backend weighting to activity. And quite frankly, the
science continues to drive the business. And so I think in terms of peak, the peak is going to be probably more
science-based in the future and maybe less volume-driven.
<Q - Angie Sedita>: All right. Fair enough. And then on pricing and pressure pumping, thoughts on the outlook for
pricing as we go into the back half of 2017 and even into 2018. Have you started to see a deceleration in recent weeks?
And then again, going back to that flat rig market, thoughts on pricing in a flat rig market?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, as I've said, Angie, I'm not going to lay out our pricing strategy here on this call by any
means. What I would go back to is we push price all the time. What we do is in high demand. And particularly in a
market like we're in now where urgency matters, delivering targets matters to our customers and that's where hyper
efficiency and the technology that we bring are so valuable. And so I am confident that we are continuing to work. We
talked about the levers that we have in terms of leading-edge price, the legacy fleet and then obviously cost and
efficiency. So we'll work on all of those all the time.
<Q - Angie Sedita>: Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Morning.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: So, Jeff, you made a point of emphasis around sand demand perhaps starting to get smarter.
But is it fair to say that service intensity likely continues to increase on an average well basis going forward? How
would you characterize the rate of change on overall service intensity?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, the intensity continues to increase both rate and numbers of stages, and those sorts
of things. So I think it's more – I bring it up simply because I have always believed that sand A is not infinite and it's
not free. And so, as we started to put constraints on sand in terms of availability and cost, it's actually had a very
rationale impact on driving thought around where it goes and how much in terms of total volume.
But I would say in terms of how it gets placed, and I talked about a couple of technology examples in my prepared
remarks, but those are the kind of things that the equipment works just as hard. But it is how it's applied. So that's why I
bring that up. We haven't seen that before really, gosh, in five years, six years. And so it's one data point, but it's one
that I'm certainly going to watch.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Absolutely. And then just wanted to also touch base on the acquisition on Summit. Can you
give us maybe a little more detail on the expansion strategy for that new business? And just as you're thinking about
M&A, are there other tuck-ins needed to keep filling out that lift portfolio or can you build off of Summit here to really
get where you think you need to go?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, thanks, Sean. I mean, the Summit deal is – I mean, fantastic fit and fantastic people
is what I can say about that. I mean, it was a great add for our artificial lift business. When we put our business together
with Summit, it creates a solid number two position in U.S. ESP, other technology and really love their value
proposition. I mean, they are so dialed in to how they respond to customers and they built the plumbing around that to
do it very, very well. And so the strategy going forward is to use our footprint to create even more value, which we
know we can do starting here in the U.S., but also internationally. We've talked about M&A before and I don't see – we
continue to be interested in growing our production group, which includes all forms of lift. Happy with where we've

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Good morning, guys. And, Dave, it's been a fabulous almost two decades, but you're not gone
yet, so we'll see you other than on the conference call, but congratulations on a great run.
<A - David J. Lesar>: You're right, and I am not gone yet.
<Q - James Wicklund>: I got to bring that up, make sure everybody understands he's hanging around for 18 more
months. Jeff, you make an excellent point on the pricing of international saying that while overall activities quit going
down, there's not enough bulk of activity in several markets to really get pricing improvement. Where do you expect to
see internationally the first level of activity getting high enough that we're not giving away price anymore and a
beginning of recovery?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Jim, it's going to be in some spot where there's a discovery or there is enough sort of base
load of activity to move quickly. If I had to guess, there's probably some places in Latin America that might fill that
bill. But as far as a broad region, that's really part of the issue, Jim, is it's like peanut butter being spread around the
world, and it never gets enough traction in a particular spot. And so that's why what makes it tough is simply because it
will be very concentrated in a place when we start to see that. Now, the other side of that, that's one of the reasons we
do protect our international franchise. We think that the investment we made over the last several years is valuable and
will be more valuable in the future when that time comes. But it's not – I think we're moving sideways for a little while.
<Q - James Wicklund>: And in drilling and evaluation, you note that you had $150 million increase in revenue but
only a $3 million increase in income. And that clearly points to price issues. I'm just wondering, you had a seasonal
recovery in the North Sea and in Russia, and those are two places we normally don't associate with Halliburton being
leading-edge. Were those two of your better markets or your worst markets? Can you talk about just on the drilling and
evaluation side where those two markets fit?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, I mean, on a relative basis, relatively smaller, but quite frankly very good markets
for us. And ones where – I really want to give kudos to Joe Rainey and that team who have absolutely executed and
built those businesses. So those are businesses that are in my view gaining traction in the D&E part of our business,
better alignment around customers, I think closer alignment with customers, particularly in Russia today and very
encouraging.

<Q - David Anderson>: So, Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing a slightly different
way. You talked about getting leading-edge pricing on your reactivated equipment, but I'm curious about your legacy
fleets out there. I think that's been one area you've been trying to keep that. You want to keep those relationships there.
What's that spread now in the pricing between legacy and kind of new equipment going on the market? And when do
you think that starts to close? Is that a year end? Is that kind of a 12 months it takes to close that gap? What's your
thoughts there?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, that's something that is closing, I'd say, sort of every day as we work it. But let's go
back to why there is a spread there. And it's because we're aligned with very good customers. They're very efficient.
And so we want to be a part of their business. And we believe we can do a lot to help drive down sort of their overall
cost and lower their cost per BOE. And so that's why we never had a – we abandoned half the market to go move
somewhere else. We absolutely want to support all of our customers. So I'm not going to give you that spread, but I will
tell you it's something I think I'd said in Q1 that we would be closing in on that over four quarters. So look for some
time early in 2018 to have that done.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then in terms of your fleet now, what percentage of your overall
fleet has your modern Q10 pump out there? And I was wondering if you can expand a bit upon that pump and how that
changes in terms of the useful life of your equipment versus what's out there in the market? You touched on it before
about the attrition out there, but trying to get kind of a sense as to kind of how your equipment is different in the market
than other equipment out there and why we should think about that differently?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, so I mean, I would say we're probably in the 60% range or so for the following
reactivation. The important thing about that equipment is that it is built for total cost of ownership. I mean, we don't sell
this equipment in the market. Our guys at Duncan are absolutely motivated by one thing, what is the most resilient,
efficient piece of equipment? And I go out and check to make sure that it is competitively priced, which it is. But more
important than its cost is what it does for our guys in the field and the way that it's integrated. So it runs at higher rates.
It uses all available horsepower. It's more efficient by still about a 20% efficiency compared to what we see in the
market. So, when I think about how do we make the best returns in the marketplace, we always think about how do we
drive capital off of location. And first thing to do is have more efficient pumps on location.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning. And, Dave, congratulations, and all the best.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So, Jeff, you brought up a very interesting comment a little bit earlier about seeing the first
quarter here where sand used per well has declined. Just wondering if you might be able to elaborate on that a little bit
more. Do you sense that, as you mentioned, that it is truly purely an economic decision? Do you think it's an anomaly?
Do you think there's a shortage of sand that's driving it? Just kind of trying to look for a little bit more color on what
you may be seeing.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, I think it really is part of the science of frac. And that is it's not the only thing. It's
not that customers are running from the economics, but they are making very thoughtful, economic decisions. And as
the availability or actually the applicability of science and the better they understand and we collectively understand
how to make more barrels, that gets put to work with clearly an economic backdrop.
And I think that, back to Dave's earlier comments on our customers, I mean, this is an incredibly adaptive group of
customers that I think have demonstrated through toughest cycle in our history an ability to consume science, consume

lessons learned, and move the cost per BOE down almost in the face of anything. And so I think what you're seeing is
really the natural evolution of, okay, as inputs move up, what are better ways to get more barrels? And, in some cases,
we're seeing that. And this is not across the board. But on an overall basis, that was the data point we saw.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Thank you. And just maybe on the international front, I know you mentioned the
spreading of peanut butter analogy. But it seems like there is more concentrated increased activity levels going on in
Latin America, in a number of different countries. Do you feel like you could get pricing power moving in the right
direction in Latin America before some other regions?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, again, I'm not going to give our strategy around price anywhere. But what I would
say, Latin America is not too different in terms of the contract cycle, in terms of – the length of contracts typically have
a muting impact. There's plenty of – quite a bit of equipment in the world today. And so certainly, look forward to that.
But I would not – it's not enough to change the overall trajectory.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Thank you. And, Dave, congratulations again. And you will certainly be missed and your
comments would be missed greatly on the calls.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Appreciate it.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: My question relates to the Permian sand that's been – recently got refurb, new capacity additions
have been announced and there's a good chance that prices are going to fall quite sharply in the Permian for E&P
companies there. What impact does that have for pressure pumping companies as sand prices fall in the Permian? Is it
neutral or is it negative or positive? And then also, how do you think about your own investments in transloading and
rail transportation? Would that change if most of the sand is regionally sourced?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, that's great for us. It's good for our customers. It's good for us in terms of lowering
cost per BOE. I've been fairly vocal about why we don't own mines and this is an example of why not – from
Halliburton's standpoint, why we wouldn't want to be invested and tied with sunk cost to a place as technology moves a
different direction. The transload infrastructure that we have is valuable. I would say probably the toughest spot to get
to realistically is the Permian Basin and local sand in my view opens up a whole new avenue of what is lower cost. And
some of the things that we're doing around delivering sand, we're always looking at how do we get sand delivered at a
lower cost point. And I think our containerized solutions that we're implementing are right in the sweet spot of that kind
of development.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay. And you don't see – are there any long-term negative implications – cost implications for
railcars or other things that you may have leased or the industry may have leased?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No. I mean, the stuff works all over the country and that's a fairly localized solution. So I
like what we're invested in. And we've always been careful. Again, we target about 50% of our capacities managed
internally and we do that, so that we can flex with the market. And that's how I see this.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much. And, again, Dave, congratulations with the very solid run at Halliburton.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Jeff, a quick question to you again regarding kind of the sand logistics and the changes in
completions again. I mean, before you highlighted that Halliburton doesn't really have any interest in owning sand, but
wants to focus on the logistics because of the changing nature of the type of proppant that's preferred. So can you talk a
little bit about the kind of capacity that's being added at the moment in West Texas as kind of 100-mesh largely and
some 40/70 and address that in context of other proppant and how you see the mix evolving? And how that impacts
Halliburton?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, look, we're in large part agnostic to the type of sand. The reality is we study sand
closely to understand how to better design chemistry to make better fracs. Cost is always a component of that. But
we've seen other media sort of go into vogue and out of vogue and we've got MicroScout, which is a nano style
solution, a micro style solution. So I think that obviously what's being talked about today is consistent with what I hear
from customers and what is being consumed today. But again, the drive for better science is always going on. And
that's one of the reasons our labs are constantly looking at how to take what's available and make it better and how to
either – or to substitute with things that are better. So I think the sands are evolving and appropriate.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So, in your view, the reduction that you saw on per well basis, was that a function of shortages of
sand pricing, and therefore, forcing the industry to adopt different methods? Or do you see this trend continuing even as
kind of sand gets debottlenecked?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, it's one data point. And so I will clearly be watching that. The sense that I get is
more around design and what is the most – I mean, our clients are dead focused on lowest cost per BOE, making more
barrels and at a lower cost. And so designing things that can consume less sand, but deliver more barrels or as many
barrels is clearly what they want to do.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Well, thanks for the insights, Jeff. I'll hand it back.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to
Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Candice. Before we close, there are a couple of points I'd like to highlight. First, our second quarter
performance demonstrates the strength of our North American franchise and our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing
environment. Second, Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of this year will remain strong as a result of
our ability to grow North America margins and maintain revenue and margins internationally. We look forward to
talking with you next quarter. Candice, you may now close out the call.
