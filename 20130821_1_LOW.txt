After my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance and Bob Hull will review our financial
results in detail. But first, I'll provide some highlights of the quarter as well as our view on the economic landscape for
the second half of the year.
Comparable sales for the quarter were positive 9.6%, driven by a healthy balance of ticket and transaction growth. As
expected, we recovered most of the outdoor sales we missed in the first quarter from unfavorable weather conditions
and we also capitalized, as planned, on consumers' natural mindset shift during the second quarter from lawn
maintenance early on to outdoor enjoyment in the mid to latter part of the quarter. Our Time to Shine campaign
resonated with customers looking forward to spending time outdoors and celebrating summer with family and friends.
While outdoor categories were strong, we also saw strength in indoor categories. In fact, all 12 product categories had
comps at or above 5%. Likewise, all regions had positive comps in the quarter and our Pro Services business continued
to perform well.
We're focused on improving our core business through cross functional collaboration and consistent execution in store
and across other selling channels. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and continued dedication to
serving customers. Home improvement demand was strong during the quarter, and the team's improving execution
allowed us to capitalize on it.
Gross margin expanded 42 basis points in the second quarter as we made further progress with our value improvement
initiative. We also continued to effectively control expenses and deliver earnings per share of $0.88 for the quarter, a
37.5% increase to last year's second quarter. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders; in
the second quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock and paid $174 million in dividends.
I'm also pleased that we made further progress with our previously announced bid for Orchard Supply Hardware. The
government antitrust review has concluded and yesterday the bankruptcy court approved our bid for the 72 stores that
we chose to include in the transaction. We expect the deal to close at the end of August and to be funded with operating
cash flow.
Strategically, the transaction will provide Lowe's with an attractive opportunity to increase our footprint in California,
where we're currently under-stored through a neighborhood format that is complementary to our strength in big-box
retail. Orchard's hardware and backyard stores have a loyal customer base and are situated in high-density prime
locations. We see significant potential for Orchard as a standalone business within Lowe's portfolio and we look
forward to the opportunity to participate more fully in California's economic recovery.
Now looking at the landscape in the second half of the year; the stronger than expected pace of home improvement
industry growth so far this year was fed by modestly stronger gains in housing turnover and job growth than originally
forecast, further offsetting the negative effects of higher taxes.
The industry outlook for the second half hinges on the impact of steep increases in mortgage rates experienced over the
last few months. The rate increases will likely take some steam out of the recent housing market rebound, but shouldn't
derail it as long as job gains persist, homes continue to appreciate, and rates rise more gradually going forward.
The macroeconomic transition from recovery to sustainable expansion together with our initiatives and improving
operational collaboration give us confidence in our business outlook for 2013. Bob will share those details in a few
minutes.
Before I turn it over to Rick, I'd like to share why I'm enthusiastic about Lowe's long-term prospects. Our business is
sound and our brand is strong. We're the second-largest player in the home improvement market, which provides
tremendous buying power and economies of scale. Additionally, we're generating solid cash flows even as the economy
emerges from the worst housing downturn in generations. We'll use that cash flow first to make strategic investments in
our core business and other opportunities that draw on our ability to serve developing home improvement markets,
second to pay dividends, and third to repurchase shares.
Thanks again for your interest in Lowe's. Rick?

Rick D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert shared with you, our performance for the quarter was
balanced across categories, where our comps range from mid single-digit to double-digit; and across regions, where our
comps also range from mid single-digit to double-digit.
Additionally, ticket and transaction growth contributed evenly to our overall performance. We also saw balance
throughout the quarter with comps above 8% every month. Finally, we were pleased that this top line sales performance
was accompanied by continued improvement in gross margin rate.
We achieved this balanced growth by executing well within the second quarter strengthening home improvement
market and ensuring we were ready to sell outdoor products as customers responded to the warmer spring and summer
weather.
In fact, our outdoor product comps increased approximately 13% in the second quarter, compared to a decrease of 7%
for the first quarter, resulting in an outdoor comp of 3.5% positive. We achieved very strong second quarter growth in
products needed to improve and maintain the yard, tools and outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden were
among our best performing product categories in the quarter.
However, strong growth wasn't limited to outdoor categories. Kitchens and appliances also outperformed in the quarter,
driven by robust growth in appliance sales as the LG line gained further traction after its first quarter rollout. We are
excited about the innovation that LG adds to an already strong lineup of national brands and the most extensive
in-stock offering of appliances in the home center channel. In fact, this month, J.D. Power and Associates ranked
Lowe's highest in appliance retail customer satisfaction for a fourth consecutive year.
We were also pleased by strength in the core of the store, where categories such as hardware, paint and fashion
electrical not only achieved mid single-digit comps, but did so with solid growth in gross margin rates. This balance of
sales and gross margin rate improvement within these categories reflects the progress we're making in our value
improvement initiatives.
At the end of the second quarter, we had completed resets representing approximately 70% of our business and we
expect to substantially complete the initial round of resets in 2013. Examples of resets completed in the second quarter
include core products like plumbing tools and wall plates and décor products such as blinds and shades, ceiling fan
accessories and hardwood flooring.
A recent example of how value improvement was used to more effectively assort a product grouping was in power
tools sandpaper, where the team created a clear price point progression and enhanced inventory productivity. They
eliminated price point and design duplications and established exclusives within the mass retail channel with the Gator
Grip and Shopsmith brands.
Gator Grip offers opening price points and the Shopsmith line offers premium film-backed, ceramic grained
sandpapers, which are more aggressive and durable and appeal primarily to the Pro customer.
As a result, a financial benefit of value improvement is greatest once we have reached stabilization. That is, when we
are past the clearance and selling only new product assortments. We estimate that roughly 50% of our business was at
this stage in the second quarter. We continue to expect average mid-single-digit comps and roughly 100 basis points of
improvement in gross margin rate for product lines that have reached stabilization.
As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the second quarter was not only balanced across categories, but across
regions as well with all regions achieving mid-single-digit comps or above. Those regions that struggled from cooler
and wetter weather in the first quarter, including most of the East Coast and Midwest, recouped most of those sales in
the second quarter. In our North division, we achieved our strongest performance in the upper Midwest, which suffered
from droughts last year and experienced a delayed spring this year.
Additionally, we estimate that the stores most affected by Superstorm Sandy contributed approximately 30 basis points
to our total comps. Housing recovery markets on the West Coast and Florida and healthy markets along the Texas Gulf

Coast continue to show high single to double-digit comp improvement. We expect to see continued strength in these
markets and further improvement along the Southeast Coast and in the Midwest where the recovery is now taking root.
Looking at payroll, as expected, strong second quarter sales growth generated solid payroll leverage across all regions
of the country, as we leveraged the fixed component of store labor hours.
As a reminder, we added approximately 150 hours per week to the staffing model for nearly two thirds of our stores.
These additional hours are dedicated to the interior sales floor. We continue to monitor performance and make
adjustments as necessary.
As Bob will share with you, our expectation for year-end inventory is approximately $200 million higher than we had
forecasted last quarter. Part of this increase is due to air conditioners and ceiling fans. The cooler and wetter summer
to-date has greatly reduced our sales of these items. We expect to sell them to the end of the summer, but we will carry
over the remainder to sell next year.
The greater part of this inventory increase reflects our commitment to further lean into increasing demand as we bolster
job-lot quantities to benefit Pros, increase overall in-store service levels and present compelling end-cap displays. We
expect that these incremental inventory investments will be completed this year and that we will be positioned to
achieve greater inventory productivity in 2014.
Before I hand it over to Bob, I am pleased to share that for the first half of the year, approximately 80% of our U.S.
stores have qualified for a service and sales employee incentive or SSEI payment. As a reminder, SSEI is our profit
sharing program for hourly associates. This quarter payment will be the highest we've made since the start of this
program.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's and I will now turn it over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull, Jr
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $15.7 billion, which was an increase of
10.3% driven by positive comp sales and new stores. In Q2, total customer transactions increased 5.3% and total
average ticket increased 4.7% to $65.60.
Comp sales were 9.6% for the quarter. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 9.5% in May, 8.5% in June, and 11.3%
in July. For the quarter, comp transactions increased 5% and comp average ticket increased 4.4%.
With regard to external factors, we estimate that the recovery of lost Q1 sales from the delayed spring aided second
quarter comps by approximately 120 basis points. Also lumber inflation and sales related to Superstorm Sandy
recovery efforts added roughly 60 basis points and 30 basis points to comps, respectively.
Our internal efforts including value improvement, product differentiation, lowes.com, proprietary credit value
proposition, outside selling positions and the weekday labor hours investment drove approximately 250 basis points of
the Q2 comp.
The balance of the comp growth, 5% or so, we believe was driven by improving execution and strengthening industry
demands. Year-to-date, sales of $28.8 billion were up 5.1% versus the first half of 2012 driven by a 4.6% increase in
comp sales and new stores.
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.35% of sales, which increased 42 basis points over Q2 last year. The
biggest driver of the increase was value improvement, which helped gross margin by approximately 55 basis points.
Our estimate of the improvement nets the clearance impact of the reset against the benefit of the stabilized line. For the
quarter, the percentage of resets completed increased from 50% to 70%, while the percentage of resets stabilized
increased from 30% to 50%, which was consistent with our plan.

Also, more effective promotional activity relative to Q2 last year aided gross margin by an estimated 20 basis points.
This improvement was offset somewhat by the following items: first, our proprietary credit value proposition
negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points, this is driven by higher penetration of our
proprietary credit program, which reached 24.7% of sales, a 90 basis point increase over Q2 2012; also, the mix of
products sold negatively impacted gross margin by 14 basis points; lastly, lumber inflation negatively impacted gross
margin by roughly 10 basis points.
Year-to-date, gross margin of 34.56% of sales is an increase of 26 basis points over the first half of 2012. SG&A for
Q2 was 21.73% of sales, which leveraged 53 basis points.
During the quarter, store payroll leveraged 30 basis points. Payroll dollars were up approximately 7% versus Q2 last
year, which includes the additional weekday hours investment that Rick noted. While payroll grew in the quarter, it was
at a lower rate than sales, resulting in expense leverage.
Similarly, insurance, both casualty and employee, advertising, utilities, rent, profit taxes and other costs leveraged as a
result of the 10.3% sales increase. Also, expenses incurred last year for the voluntary separation program resulted in
roughly 10 basis points of leverage this year. These items were offset somewhat by incentive compensation expense,
which de-leveraged 31 basis points as a result of higher expected attainment levels relative to last year. Year-to-date,
SG&A was 23.04% of sales, which leveraged 36 basis points to the first half of 2012.
Depreciation for the quarter was $367 million, which was 2.33% of sales and leveraged 26 basis points compared with
last year's second quarter, as a result of the sales growth. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased
121 basis points to 10.29% of sales. For the first half of 2013, EBIT was 9.02% of sales, which was 82 basis points
higher than the same period last year.
For the quarter, interest expense was $110 million and de-leveraged 2 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.
In Q2 2012, we settled various tax matters that resulted in lowering interest accruals by $22 million, causing the
interest expense de-leverage in this year's second quarter.
Total expenses for Q2 were 24.76% of sales and leveraged 77 basis points. Year-to-date, total expenses were 26.31% of
sales and leveraged 52 basis points to last year. Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 9.6% of sales. The effective tax
rate for the quarter was 37.5%, which is down slightly from Q2 last year.
Net earnings were $941 million for the quarter, an increase of 26% over Q2 2012. Earnings per share of $0.88 for the
second quarter were up 37.5% to last year. The $0.88 per share compares with our plan of $0.83, with a nickel beat,
driven primarily from higher than planned sales. For the first six months of 2013, earnings per share of $1.36
represented a 27% increase over the first half of 2012.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets; cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the
quarter was $1.1 billion. Our second quarter inventory balance of $9.1 billion increased $407 million, or 4.7%, versus
Q2 last year. The increase was driven by higher inventory levels to support demand, inflation in lumber building
materials, as well as the air conditioner and ceiling fan carryover that Rick noted.
Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing four quarters cost of sales, divided by average inventory for the last
five quarters, was 3.73 times or essentially flat with last year. Return on assets determined using a trailing four quarters
earnings, divided by average assets for the last five quarters, increased 114 basis points to 6.38%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet; accounts payable of $5.7 billion represented an 11% increase
over Q2 last year, caused by the timing of purchases this year relative to last year. At the end of the second quarter, we
suggested debt to EBITDAR was 2.05 times.
Return on invested capital, measured using a trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest, divided by
average debt and equity, for the last five quarters increased 201 basis points for the quarter to 10.62%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows; cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of $560 million
over last year, largely due to the timing of purchases that contributed to the higher accounts payable balance, as well as

growth in net earnings. Capital expenditures were $376 million, a 40% decrease from last year. As a result, year-to-date
free cash flow of $3 billion was 37% higher than the first half of 2012.
For the quarter, we repurchased 24.4 million shares or a little bit more than $1 billion. Also in the quarter, we received
approximately 2.7 million shares as part of the final settlement associated with the accelerated share repurchase
program executed in Q1. We have approximately $3 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Before getting into the details of the Lowe's business outlook, I'd like to note that the income statement impact from the
Orchard Supply acquisition is not expected to be material and, except for dealer-related expenses, it is not included in
these figures.
Also, I wanted to note that our outlook for the second half of the year is unchanged from our prior outlook. Our 2013
outlook combines the above planned sales and earnings performance in Q2 with our previous assumptions for the
second half of 2013.
Now to our outlook for 2013; we expect total sales to increase by approximately 5%, driven by comp sales of
approximately 4.5%. We expect continued momentum for our internal efforts tempered by moderating home
improvement industry demand. We expect to open approximately 10 stores for the year.
For the fiscal year, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 65 basis points. The effective tax rate is
expected to be approximately 37.9%. As a result of these inputs, we're expecting earnings per share of approximately
$2.10, which represents an increase of 24% over 2012.
For the year, we are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $3.9 billion, which is lower than our
prior forecast, due to the higher inventory levels that Rick described offset somewhat by higher earnings.
Our 2013 forecast for fixed assets acquired is approximately $1 billion. This climbed from our prior expectations
relates to spend rationalization, lower expected cost and project timing, primarily related to information technology.
This results in an estimated free cash flow of $2.9 billion for 2013.
We expect to close the Orchard transaction in the quarter. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.6 billion in share
repurchases for 2013, which is lower than our prior expectation as a result of the $205 million Orchard purchase price.
For the year, we expect lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR will be at or below 2.25 times.
We continue to execute against a long-term strategy that we outlined during our Analyst Investor Conference last
December. Our initiatives are gaining traction and we are pleased with our results for the first half of 2013.
In addition, housing is turning, so for the first time in a while, both internal and external forces are moving in the right
direction. We will not be holding an Investor Conference in 2013, but look forward to updating you on our strategy in
mid-2014.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Congratulations on a great quarter. It seems like
a lot has gone your way here. Bob, I just wanted to follow-up a comment you made as you were talking about the
guidance about the moderating home improvement demand. I mean, July was – seemed the strongest category; it
seemed like it was – it seemed accelerating throughout the quarter?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: So, as we think about Q2, I talked about some improving execution. So, we have
implemented some procedures, specifically sales and operations planning that allows us to work on behalf of the

customer in a more collaborative and coordinated fashion; so that's aiding this year's performance.
But if you think back to Q2 last year, we had a lot of moving pieces as it relates to the value – a voluntary separation
program, the change in commission for some of the sales folks on the store floor, we had some reset challenges, the
execution of resets related to value improvement, we had inconsistent promotion activity in Q2 last year, so some of the
benefit in Q2 was specific to recovery of some disruption in Q2 last year.
Also, as you think about the external factors I described, the recovery of the lost sales from Q1, lumber inflation and
hurricane Sandy, 200 basis points or so, largely doesn't continue into the second half of the year.
And then lastly, Dave, I'll talk about interest rates. We're seeing positive momentum in housing, but the wildcard is
interest rates...
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Yeah.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: ...and the impact that has on housing affordability. So, we're kind of watchful of that
potential impact.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: I guess along those lines, one follow-up question here, yesterday Best Buy and Home Depot
talked about really strong appliances, you are talking about really strong appliances out there. Is there something like –
is there something in the industry that's happening that's driving sort of just such dramatic demand in that space?
Each person had incremental brands and so on, but it just does seems like the category has expanded fairly dramatically
recently. And I'm just trying to understand a little bit more about what may have driven that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Dave, I'll start and then I'll have Greg jump in. This is Robert. I think part of it is underlying
economic fundamentals we talked about, which we attributed part of the increase in the quarter to, that – as home prices
started to move up, I think it does have homeowners feeling gradually better about willingness to spend, particularly as
you get to big ticket durables. And I think some of the appliances – some of those things are probably some of the
purchases that consumers have otherwise delayed during the downturn, because they could get better clarity with
regard to, where the value of their home was moving.
So, I think, part of that is coming into – you're seeing part of that come into play, it's no different than what you're
seeing in the auto industry and other places, where you're seeing consumers have a willingness to move towards some
of those big ticket durables, as they're feeling gradually better about things. But specific to appliances and what we're
seeing, Greg, if you want to add something, so...
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Sure. Dave, I agree with Robert that from a kind of a household economic trend
standpoint, I think, we are seeing the impact of what's been some delayed spending now coming into our favor. And
what's worked for us and what drove our share increases in Q2, was innovation. The launch of LG continues to provide
a lot of momentum for the category.
Also, new innovative products from Samsung, innovative products from Bosch, some new rollouts of GE and
Whirlpool, that's been – have been driving our sales in appliances and I think we've gotten into the cadence. You know,
Bob mentioned it earlier, I think, we've gotten into the cadence of the proper balance of traffic driving promotions and
ticket building promotions too. So, that's been a big hit in terms of driving sales and driving margins simultaneously.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Great. Congratulations on a nice quarter.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: Thanks, Dave.

<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning and I'd also add my congratulations on the quarter and thank you for taking my
questions. I guess, my first question comes on the penetration of the Pro business. Typically, I think, it's been around
20% for you. Can you give us some flavor and comment on what you're seeing in the Pro and maybe how that
penetration is moving?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah, Budd. This is Rick. We continue to see good growth in the Pro for the quarter. Our Pro
business outperformed our sales totals – our comp totals. You look at it overall, it's roughly, we say, approximately
25% of our total volume at this point in time. If you think back to several initiatives that we launched mid-year last
year, we're gaining tractions with those. When you look at the focus that we've got on the MRO, the maintenance and
repair customers, when they come into the stores, as well as the reorganization that we went through and talked about
our account executive Pro Services in the field, getting them focused on building strong relationships with our core
customers and really pulling that together as a cross-functional program across the organization to make sure that we're
really doing the things that benefit the Pro.
I talked a bit little bit about it in our opening comments, the job-lot depth – the job-lot inventories, making sure we
have the right depth of inventory. Being able to present those effectively to the Pro customer has really benefited. You
look at Northlake and our product differentiation aspects and the freeing up of end-cap space have allowed us to
present our contractor pack value offerings to the Pro customer, which is a way to give them discounts on multi-unit
purchases.
And then the everyday val prop on our proprietary credit has also really benefited that category. So, we've been
extremely pleased with the programs the teams have built, the progress that we're making and the traction we're making
as the Pro continues to rebound in the marketplace.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And my follow-up really has to do with the air conditioner issue. Did I hear you correctly
that you're going to pack away about $200 million worth of air conditioners? And just my question is, do you risk –
what risk of obsolescence do you have? And have you done this before? And what risk is there in this particular
strategy?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: So, Budd, this is Bob. The $200 million relates to many factors, not just ACs. So, it does
relate to, as Rick described, as we think about going through the lines, we're adding greater depth of inventory to the
products that are the eight items, the highest velocity items, so greater in-stock levels there. Also, we do have some
seasonal – so that's the bulk of it.
We do have some carryover from both air conditioners and ceiling fans. As we think about seasonal product, we
evaluate the quality of that product, whether it makes sense to mark it down at that point in time, or carry over.
ACs is a category where there's not much change year-over-year, so as we think about carrying over air conditioners,
there's really no impact to the 2014 line, there's no risk to the line, there's no risk of damaging the product as we carry it
over through the season. So, yes, we have done that before and feel comfortable with that decision.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: All right. Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much. Good luck on the balance of the year.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: Thank you, Budd.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Budd.

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, overall, Laura – this is Robert. I'll – I think we feel really good about our in-stock
positions. A lot of the cross-functional work that we've talked about, certainly our strength with our extensive logistics
and distribution network that we have out there has allowed us to stay very comfortable with in-stock positions that we
have. And we've said, the seasonal categories, the air conditioners from a follow-up on the last question, there's still
time to sell through part of that, and it's an easy product to carry over to next year. So, we feel really good about
in-stock.
But, Rick, I'll let you....
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah, Laura, this is Rick. As you think about inventory, in general, I think it's important to go
back and realize some of the changes that we've made to our strategy this year that it is helping us impact our in-stock
levels in the stores today and what we're continuing to do.
We talked about previously, as we looked at opportunities for inventory moving into 2013, that we saw some
opportunities to improve our in-stock positions. Actions that we took were greater than the job-lot inventory, meaning
that we have greater depth of inventory available for our Pros and our DIY customers, when they come into the stores
to complete those projects.
We also increased our in-store targeted service level across many items, particularly those that have gone through the
value improvement line initiatives, to drive greater in-stock levels of those – of that inventory when those categories
come out of that line review. So, that has helped us meet those demands as well.
And then as it relates to Q2 related to seasonal categories, remember we talked about in Q1, the way that we built our
inventories more aggressively to hit those high seasonal peaks and demands for the consumer allowed us to capture that
upside from – and that initial spike from the consumer was ready and it allowed us to proactively flow that inventory
through the remainder of the season. So, I think, collectively, all of those initiatives have played out very well and have
us in a good position going into the second half of the year.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: And Laura, this is Greg Bridgeford. The only thing I'd add to Rick's comments would
be that when you look at the top four categories that had above-average performance for the quarter, three of the four
are what we'd call flow through and sellout categories. And, one of the keys to the quarter was really a tremendous
performance on the part of our vendors, our logistics teams and our store operations teams, for being able to flow
through that much inventory and putting it in the hands of the customers, whether it's in outdoor power equipment, live
goods, lawn and garden hardlines or appliances. That was one of the keys to the quarter.
<Q - Laura A. Champine>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Thank you.

<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on a really nice quarter.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Brian.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: I'm going to ask the same question – I asked this to Home Depot yesterday too, but you called out
as part of your outlook some concern, or maybe in the Q&A, some concern with respect to potential for rates to climb
higher. The question I have is, interest rates have already ticked higher by a bit here. I mean, have you seen any
indication yet in your business that this is having an effect? And given the histories you have with Lowe's, I mean, how
would you think – if interest rates continue to climb higher how could that impact Lowe's business in the coming
quarters or year or so?

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Hey, Brian. I'll start. This is Robert. Certainly, if you look at any of the numbers out there
with regard to refinancing or new home sales, housing turnover, those type of things, certainly you're seeing the impact
of interest rates starting to show up in some of those numbers.
As I said earlier, I think, however, the biggest impact that we have seen – so far positive impact we think on the
business to-date, has been the fact that overall from a macro environment, home prices starting to move up and the
strong housing turnover job gains that we've seen to-date, we think that that's contributed to what we've seen in the
business.
Yeah, interest rates, I think over the past – since May or something, are up about 110 basis points or so. So, it is starting
to have an impact on refinancings, those type of things.
As long as it kind of stays in this area, moves up a little more gradually, we think it has some impact, but we're not
overly concerned about it. If you were to start seeing interest rates that were to – yet to move north of a 6% interest rate
for a 30-year mortgage, we think that, that would probably start to have some impacts that we would start feeling in the
business, so...
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up and I apologize if you addressed this in your
prepared comments. But any update on the remerchandising and resets and what lift you see in your comps in the areas
of the store you touched?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Greg, do you want to address that?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Sure. Brian, as we discussed, we're – as Rick discussed, we're making a lot of progress
with value improvement. We did perform a normal amount of resets for the second quarter and provided the bulk of the
– when you look at the list that Bob detailed, the 55 basis points we attributed to value improvement. It's – we continue
to see progress being made into what I call the interior categories, which is the center of the stores. We execute resets
and refresh the lines, that's provided a strong basis for the business, because you saw very balanced performance across
the categories for Lowe's.
And then going into the season, obviously, we performed line reviews pre-season for categories such as the lawn and
garden. And we actually do line reviews about twice a year on the appliance categories as new models and innovations
roll out. So, continue to be a major foundational factor in our performance, and it's at the point now as Rick mentioned
with 50% of lines reaching a form of stabilization where it is becoming part of our business. And it's a solid foundation
for our business.

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On the 150 labor hours that you added to
the store, how much do you think that you have opportunity to maybe push a little further on that, increase service
levels even more? And what sort of benefit might you be able to see from that?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah, Michael. This is Rick. I'll take that. Right now, we're comfortable with the program that
we have in place and executing against that 150 hours. I think it's – when you go back and you look at the analysis that
we did when we put those numbers – put those sales hours back in, we felt confident that that would get us back to
where we were from a service level and an hours level to meet the sales needed for the quarter.
So, we feel confident in that program. We're still making adjustments to that program as we move into Q3 and looking
at how we allocate the hours, what departments we allocate the hours into and how we mix them across the floor. But

we're still comfortable with that – we're – the 150 hours is the appropriate number; we don't see at this point in time, a
need to increase those hours.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. And my follow-up question is on your outlook. I'm curious about the level of
conservatism that you've baked into your outlook. Can you kind of frame how you see the upside, downside, and
potentially what type of momentum have you carried into the current quarter from a very strong July? Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Michael, it's Robert. I'll start and then Bob maybe want to jump in on the details of the
outlook. But if you think about – if you remember back, Michael, at the end of the first quarter when we fell short of
what our internal plan was, we didn't really change our guidance, because we anticipated that with the impact we saw
from a delayed spring we would make up the majority of that in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, we actually covered most of those sales and then had actually performance above what our
internal plan was. So, our thought process has been we take the amount that we exceed our internal plan for the second
quarter, roll that into the annual guidance combined with what our plan was basically for the second half of the year.
So, we've got good momentum going into the third quarter, so that gives us additional confidence. There are some
headwinds out there, as Bob outlined in his comments, including some unknowns out there with things like interest
rates that we just went through and the impact that, that could potentially have on the industry. So, we feel good about
our – the outlook for the second half of the year, but that's kind of how we got to building the revision to our guidance
for the year. So, Bob?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: Yeah. So, two comments, one related to the – your guidance question, Michael. So, you
asked about, where we were so far. So, if you think about our 4.5% comp for outlook for the year relative to the 4.6%,
that implies that the comp of 4%, 4.5% in the second half of the year. I would tell you that August to-date, we are
running somewhere between that 4% to 4.5% and the 11.3% we ran in July; so nice big range for you.
The other point I'll make, Michael, really ties together your question on payroll and prior questions on inventory. So, as
we think about the second quarter, we saw a ramp in industry demand that we haven't seen for quite some time. In fact,
reported our highest quarterly comp in almost 10 years. So, we were focused on capitalizing on the opportunity. As you
heard from Rick, we'll focus on the inventory productivity that we outlined in 2015. We'll get there, but we didn't want
to lose sight of the opportunity that was in front of us this quarter.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. Thank you very much. That's a pretty wide range. I think you could drive a
sledgehammer through that. Maybe no chance you could narrow that a little bit for us?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: You can build your model as you see fit, Michael.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. I thought I'd try. Thank you very much. Good luck with the rest of the year.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about guidance, but rather top line on the
flow-through. Specifically, on the margin guide, you basically only increased the guide by 5 basis points even though
second quarter was up 100 bps. So, I'm just wondering why that was? Is there something going on with the
flow-through from the resets that's maybe a little different than you thought? Or on the SG&A side, as comps
decelerate, help us understand the difference based on whether that deceleration is traffic or ticket in terms of the
leverage?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: So, following up on Robert's responds to Michael's question, our outlook for 2013 is a
function of taking our year-to-date performance plus our prior expectations for the second half of the year. So, yeah, it

looks like, on a 1% sales increase, the EBITDA only goes up 5 basis points. We didn't change our second half outlook.
We do expect a 4% to 4.5% comp in the second half to be balanced across ticket and traffic. We do have some expense
pressures that we talked about previously, the 10 basis points from additional labor hours. Reset expense is actually 20
basis points. We talked about 10 basis points previously. It's now 20 basis points for the year instead of comp, we
modeled the year at – performance at target.
Given where we are today, sales and earnings are forecasted above our plan, which means that we're accruing a bonus
above target, which is another 10 basis points or so. So, we've got some expense pressures that are probably resulting in
a flow through rate looking less than what we've guided in the past, which is the 20 basis points for each point of comp;
that what's taking place in the second half of the year.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. And then if I could, Bob, on the D&A; that's been pretty choppy and bouncing around.
Should we use this quarter as the right run rate or how should we think about that?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: I think you can use a number of about $1.5 billion for the year.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: As an average and then just accept that it's bouncing around a little bit more?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: It should be more steady going forward. As we think about the nature of timing of asset
adds, the last big store ramp was Q4 of 2005, a lot of 7-year assets become fully depreciated or ramping up a couple
years ago, some IT which is three-year lives, that caused some of the lumpiness that we saw in 2012. I think we'll see
more consistent depreciation going forward.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.

Next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. I have one follow-up question on guidance and then one
question on demand. My question on guidance, sort of phrasing it another way, it looks like the implied operating
margin guidance for the second half of the year would be up about 10 basis points. And that's actually a little less than
you did in the first quarter with a 1% comp decline. Obviously, you levered much more in the second quarter on a
much bigger comp decline, despite throwing a lot of money into expenses, probably a little more than you had initially
intended. Are the expense pressures – those discrete pressures you discussed sufficient to limit operating leverage to 10
bps, if you do comp 4% or so? Or could that be a conservative number in the event that the top line gets to that level?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: Yeah, I guess, Matt, I'm not sure where the 10 basis points comes from. We're at 82 basis
points for the first half of the year; expect 65 basis points for the second half. So, the 10 basis points...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: I guess I was looking at it on a non-GAAP basis and that might be the difference.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: We report on GAAP and guide to GAAP, so...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Fair enough, understood, understood. So, all right, we can move on from there. I guess the
second question relates to the kind of visibility of big ticket sales. If you could talk about some of the projects that have
sort of longer life cycles from the consumer's initial visit to completing the project, what is traffic in some of those
categories looking like today and what can you glean about the sustainability of demand from your interactions with
consumers in your stores?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Matt, I'll start and then anyone else want to add in, but what we've seen is – again, probably
the most – one of the most balanced performances that I've ever seen from a category performance. So, we saw strong
demand for the bigger ticket project categories in a way that we haven't seen in recent time periods. Whether it's

kitchen cabinets, whether it was appliance sales, or whether it was fashion plumbing sales. We're seeing strength in
those categories and interest and traffic in those categories that we haven't seen in previous quarters.
So, as we look at the focus of a lot of our VIP work over the last nine months, we're coming into somewhat of a sweet
spot as we get into the second half of the year, because 60% of fall projects sales come from flooring, paint, bath and
appliances. And we put a lot of effort in those categories to make sure that we're able to capture that customer demand.
As I mentioned before, we're really working hard to execute and maintain a good cadence of promotional activity that
is margin accretive, it is foot traffic driving, builds basket and is margin accretive in the process. And that's part of this
plan as we head into the second half of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks and good morning. Looking at the benefits from the value improvement
program, the gross margin was a bit higher than the math would suggest based on the percentage of resets completed
and through clearance and so forth, so that was a little bit better there. Was that a sort of catch up from the first quarter?
And then thinking about the math both on the comp and the gross margin into the back half, I mean, should that
normalize back to what the basic math of the percentage completed and through reset and times a percentage, the
mid-single-digit and 100 bps comp lift?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Chris, your first question was on the 55 basis point improvement relative to the 50% of line
stabilized?
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Right.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, so, it's really somewhat of a function of the lines that are reviewed and the timing of
the reviews within the quarter. As Rick outlined in his comments, we still believe and still are seeing the average
mid-single-digit comp increase 100 basis points of gross margin, stabilize, so nothing would indicate that we'd see
anything different in the second half.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Okay. And then thinking about the acceleration during the quarter and looking at two
year stocks accelerating during the quarter and clearly the seasonal business peaks in the Memorial Day to July 4
timeframe. So, can you talk about the texture of demand within July? How much was the moisture levels, maybe
carryover impact to July versus what you would consider more core and sustained demand as you look to the back half?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: I'll start, Chris. This is Greg Bridgeford. We did see probably more moisture on a
nationwide basis in July, more moisture in the ground than we've seen in years, maybe a decade. And it did drive the
opportunity for sustained live good sales, bagged good sales and in particular outdoor power equipment sales as the
normal dryness that hits in July and August didn't retard the growth of grass. So, we had a very strong performance in
the outdoor power equipment categories, in particular. And we were able to execute against that because we were
ready.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: Chris, this is Bob. You mentioned two-year comps in Q2. Given that we had some shift in
demand between Q1 and Q2, I'd encourage you to take a look at the two-year stack for the first half, which is 5.6%.
And then you take a look at the outlook for the second half, basically assumes that a two-year comp would be in the
5.5% to 6% range. So, we do have tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, but on a two-year comparable
basis, we're expecting relatively the same performance second half versus first half.

<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Understood. And one final one, as you think about sort of the disruption last year around
sort of the promotional variation throughout the quarter and things that were successful and not successful, did that
impact – was that more of a June issue last year impacting comps or was that more of a July issue?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr>: A little bit of both. I think, specifically, as we talked about last year, we had probably two
lighter promotions for Memorial Day, didn't get the attachment rate and we responded by larger big ticket promotions.
We didn't get the unit movement. So, I think it's a little bit of impact all across the quarter.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Yeah, I'd say, I'd agree with Bob, Chris. It was a May issue – May to mid-June issue
and then a separate issue in the latter half of the second quarter. The cadence and the integration and the collaboration
that we're executing through our sales and ops planning process today is helping to drive the balanced performance that
you saw in Q2. We intend to improve on this process and it's really driving – it's really enabling us to meet expectations
in terms of our performance.

Your final question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Wondering if you could give a little color – I heard you – I understand you talking about adding
some inventory to the business, but curious of how the progress – the focus that you've had on margin and now it seems
like there's a – you're having obviously very good success with sales; but, how you're thinking about sales and market
share performance relative to margin and how that's playing out in the strategy and how you're executing the strategy.
What's changed or what's evolving within that, if you could speak to that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Eric, I'll start and get others to jump in. Certainly, as we've talked about with our sales and
ops planning, I think we're doing a much better job approaching the business on a cross-functional basis, which is
helping getting the promotional cadence right, helping with the lines, helping – making sure that as we responded to
demand that we saw in the second quarter. And, certainly, with the resets, the value improvement those types of things,
we think we're starting to hit our stride. So, that we're moving through those, got a good cadence to them continuing
with the markdown and clearing of the older inventory as the offsets get more normalized. After we've done that sell
through, we're starting to continue to see the margin performance that we anticipated.
So, we're optimistic about the path we're on and as we've indicated, expect most of those – a majority of those resets to
be done by the end of the year. So, we feel good about the – that and be able to – be able to deliver our margin goals for
the second half.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah. Eric, this is Rick. I would just add a couple of things to that. First, being – and this
reference is back to the sales and ops planning that Greg's talked about. Dennis Knowles and the Store teams have done
an outstanding job this year in driving attachment items to the project item. Much better than we've done in the past,
increasing the basket size, so that we're able to add those higher margin components on to the total transaction, from a
store standpoint.
That goes back to a lot of the training that he and the leaders in Store Operations rolled out in the past year of selling at
Lowe's, getting the stores to really understand attachment and assisting the customer throughout the entire project has
really been beneficial to helping us drive that margin. And again, that goes back to a lot of the sales and ops planning
that Greg spoke about earlier.

The other thing, I think, that we've done a great job from – on is understanding the recent activity itself. We talked
about a lot of missteps when we first started rolling this out last year. Going back into understanding the flow of the
reset and making go, no-go decisions based upon preset guardrails and criteria before we allow it to hit the store;
driving a better overall reset for the store to execute against and the consumer when they come in; helping us manage
the amount of non-productive inventory to a greater degree, so we're not seeing that have as big a drag on us as we did
