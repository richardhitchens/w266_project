outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we
provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be
promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Now 2015 is off to a very good start. This quarter we had solid underlying business performance, offset by the
continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lingering headwinds from U.S. patent expirations of Cymbalta and
Evista. Our continued focus on cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line, and we saw positive progress
with our pipeline, spanning regulatory approvals, submissions and Phase III data readouts.
Now I will begin today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since our last quarterly earnings call, and
there have been quite a lot of them, starting with commercial milestones. Our U.S. colleagues began promotion of
Cyramza for second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after receiving FDA approval late last year, while in
Europe our colleagues launched Cyramza for the treatment of second-line gastric cancer.
In Diabetes, following EU approval in Q4 we launched Humalog 200 units per ml KwikPen, the first 200 units per ml
no-time insulin that is targeted for people who take more than 20 units of rapid-acting no-time insulin per day. And
following FDA approval at the end of January, along with Boehringer Ingelheim we launched Glyxambi in the U.S. in
March. We're excited about the potential of this product, which is the first approved single-pill combination of a DPP-4
inhibitor and an SGLT-2 inhibitor.
Turning to regulatory milestones, in addition to FDA approval of Glyxambi, Boehringer Ingelheim received a positive
opinion from Europe's CHMP for the single-pill combination of empagliflozin and metformin for the treatment of
patients with type 2 diabetes. If approved, the product will be marketed under the trade name SYNJARDY.
In Oncology, we achieved a number of regulatory milestones for Cyramza. After receiving a priority review, Cyramza
was approved in Japan as a treatment for patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric cancer. Given the
regulatory timelines for pricing and access decisions, launch is expected midyear. We also submitted Cyramza in both
the U.S. and the E.U. for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. I would note that the FDA's review of this sBLA isn't
moving very quickly. And also in the E.U. we submitted Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer. We're
very pleased with the progress we've made in bringing Cyramza to the market, having received regulatory approvals in
the U.S., the E.U. and Japan within less than 12 months.
As I will discuss later, we are also excited about life-cycle opportunities for this brand. In our Biomedicines business,
we submitted ixekizumab to the FDA for review as a treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,
and along with Pfizer we announced that the FDA removed the partial clinical hold for tanezumab. As a result, we will
begin Phase III trials in multiple pain indications before the end of the year. Our decision to proceed with the
development of tanezumab triggered a $200 million payment to Pfizer.
On the clinical front, along with Incyte we announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint of improved ACR20
response compared to placebo in the Phase III RA-BUILD study in patients with moderately-to-severely active
rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant of, at least one conventional DMARD.
At the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March, we presented detailed results from the positive Phase III
UNCOVER-1 study evaluating ixekizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Also for ixekizumab we
issued a top-line press release earlier this week announcing positive results from the Phase III SPIRIT-P1 study
evaluating ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who were naïve to biologic treatment.
I am also pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment of the EXPEDITION3 trial evaluating solanezumab
in amyloid-positive patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Given that we completed enrollment ahead of schedule, we
now expect last patient visit in October of 2016.
For our CETP inhibitor evacetrapib, we announced that the ACCELERATE Phase III study in people with high-risk
vascular disease will be extended by approximately six months. Last patient visit for this study is now expected in July
of 2016. And we announced that regulatory submission of our basal insulin peglispro will be delayed in order to
generate additional clinical data to further understand and characterize the potential effects, if any, of changes in liver

fat observed with BIL treatment in the Phase III trials. We are working with regulators to determine specific next steps,
but we do anticipate the regulatory submission is likely to occur after 2016. And we look forward to presenting detailed
Phase III data at this year's ADA meeting.
On the business development front, we announced three deals. The first was an agreement with Hanmi for the
development and commercialization of Hanmi's oral BTK inhibitor for the treatment of autoimmune and other diseases.
Lilly will have worldwide rights excluding China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea.
The second was a collaboration with Innovent for the development and commercialization in China for three
investigational cancer treatments. In addition, Lilly will be responsible for the development and commercialization
outside of China for a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule and for up to three preclinical bispecific
immuno-oncology molecules from Innovent.
And the third deal, which we announced last week with Bristol-Myers Squibb, was for the transfer back to Lilly of
Erbitux commercial rights in North America. These rights were scheduled to revert to Lilly in September 2018 but we
expect this deal will accelerate that transition to Q4 this year.
In other news, the German Court of Appeal ruled that the vitamin regimen patent for Alimta would not be infringed by
a generic competitor that intends to market a dipotassium salt form of pemetrexed in Germany once the compound
patent expires in December of 2015. We will seek permission to appeal this ruling to the German Supreme Court.
And finally, we repurchased just over $300 million of stock in Q1, leaving $3.4 billion remaining on our $5 billion
plan. In addition, during the first quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain
committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. 2014 was a
productive year for execution of our innovation-based strategy. Likewise, 2015 is off to a strong start with more to
come.
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?
Philip Johnson
Thanks, Derica. Before I review our Q1 results, it may be helpful to comment on the presentation of our GAAP results
and non-GAAP measures. For our GAAP results, remember that we closed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on
January 1.
So when interpreting our GAAP results and growth rates versus 2014, please keep in mind that 2014 does not include
Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated
with the acquisition, including financing costs, integration costs, inventory step-up costs, amortization of intangibles,
and other miscellaneous adjustments.
For our non-GAAP measures, recall that like our peers we are now excluding amortization of intangibles from our
non-GAAP measures. To provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business based on our current reporting
practices and business configuration, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense
associated with the amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we closed the acquisition on
January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we are reporting our financials this year.
In addition, to aid in your analysis of our non-GAAP measures, you will see we posted an Excel file to our Investor
Relations website that contains our 2014 non-GAAP measures adjusted to remove intangible amortization and to add
Novartis Animal Health. With that background, let's take a look at our results for the quarter.
Slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. As I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted
measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, please refer to today's earnings press release for
a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter reported or GAAP results.

Moving to slide nine, you can see the Q1 revenue was just over $4.6 billion. The decrease of 6% compared to Q1 2014
reflects significant FX headwinds. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue on a non-GAAP basis was essentially flat. As we
discussed on our guidance call, this year we will still feel the negative effect of the loss of U.S. exclusivity for
Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter, sales of those two products in the U.S. declined by nearly $200 million.
Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and Cymbalta-Evista in the U.S., the rest of our
worldwide revenue increased 5% this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 3.6 percentage points,
going from 74.6% to 78.2%. This increase was entirely driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on
international inventories sold, which increased cost of sales in Q1 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q1 this year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent declined by 1.1 percentage points, going from 76.4% in last year's
quarter to 75.3% this quarter. Please do take note of the level of our gross margin percent excluding the FX effect on
international inventories sold. Again, you will see that this is running at roughly 75%.
As we discussed when updating our guidance on our Q4 earnings call, in 2015 we expect a substantial FX benefit that
should push our gross margin percent into the 78% range. However, if FX rates stay at their current levels, that benefit
will essentially go away in 2016. So as you construct your estimate of our 2016 gross margin percent, you should be
making adjustments off of a 2015 base level of roughly 75%. As in past quarters, you will find a supplementary slide
providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined by 7%, or nearly $200 million, compared to
Q1 of 2014. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses declined 6% while R&D declined 9%. The reduction in
marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign exchange as well
as to ongoing cost containment efforts.
The reduction in R&D expense was driven primarily by the lower late-stage clinical development costs and, to a lesser
extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. As implied by our full-year guidance, we do expect the level of
R&D spend to be higher for the remainder of the year as we start Phase III trials for tanezumab, our CGRP monoclonal
antibody, olaratumab, and additional indications for Cyramza.
Other income and expense was income of $93 million in Q1 2015 compared to income of $36 million in the first
quarter of 2014. This increase versus last year was due to a favorable legal judgment and larger net gains on
investments. Our tax rate was 22.9%, an increase of three percentage points compared to the same quarter last year.
This increase is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit realized in Q1 last year. Also, our tax rate in both periods did not
include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit, as those provisions had lapsed. At the
bottom line, net income increased 16% while earnings per share increased 18%, reflecting the benefit of our share
repurchases.
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these
adjustments on slide 19.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue. On slide 11, in the yellow box in the middle of
the page, you will see the total revenue decline on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier of 6%. The significant
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline as you see the 6% negative effect
from FX that we booked this quarter, with a favorable price effect of 3% offset by a volume decline of a similar
amount.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 4%, driven by price, partially offset by volume. A
number of pushes and pulls affected the U.S. pharma revenue growth this quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier,
Cymbalta-Evista declined following their patent expirations. Excluding Cymbalta-Evista, the rest of our U.S. pharma
revenue increased 18%, with over seven percentage points coming from volume.
Also, recall that in our Q4 earnings call we mentioned that an extension of shipping days through the end of December
2014 resulted in lower wholesale inventory build in Q4 of 2014 than in Q4 of 2013. As expected, this led to less
wholesale inventory burn in Q1 this year than in Q1 last year, benefiting this year's growth rate. So when adjusted for

wholesaler buying, as well as Cymbalta and Evista, our U.S. pharma revenue grew 14% this quarter, with three
percentage points coming from volume.
Moving to our international operations, in Australia, Canada, and Europe, or ACE, you will see a negative 13% rate
impact was the primary driver of the overall 16% decline in revenue, while on a constant currency or performance
basis, ACE revenue decreased 3%, driven primarily by the initial effects of a loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta.
In Japan, pharma revenue decreased 23%, with half of the decline coming from the weaker yen. On a performance
basis, our Japanese pharma revenue decreased 11%. You may recall that we experienced substantial wholesaler buying
in Q1 2014 in advance of an increase in the local consumption tax. Adjusting for the increased buying we saw last year,
our pharma revenue grew about 9% on a performance basis, driven by volume.
Turning to emerging markets, we saw mid-single-digit performance growth, driven by volume growth of 7%. As a
result of the significant negative effect of FX, our reported emerging markets revenue declined 4% versus last year. Our
pharma revenue in China grew 6%, with nearly all of that growth coming from volume.
On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we had completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1
last year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 4%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased
2%. This performance increase was affected by competition in the U.S. for companion animal products.
Moving to slide 12, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q1 2015 results. Given the
significant and swift strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this is one of those quarters where FX had the opposite effect on
the top line as it does on the bottom line. This quarter, FX was a top-line headwind reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by
six percentage points. In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit, which led to FX
providing a tailwind or benefit for operating income and EPS. Excluding FX, you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in
the first quarter grew 7% while, including FX, non-GAAP EPS grew 18%.
Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of April 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows
showing progression, red arrows showing attrition, and stars showing molecules added through business development.
You will see that ixekizumab has moved into the regulatory review column following regulatory submission in the U.S.
Following our agreement with Zosano to develop their proprietary formulation of parathyroid hormone 1-34 using a
microneedle patch system, you'll see that asset showing up in Phase II. And in Phase I, you'll see two assets have been
added through business development activities – an ultra-rapid-acting insulin through our deal with Adocia and a BTK
inhibitor initially being studied in immunologic diseases through our deal with Hanmi. In addition, we began Phase I
testing of a small molecule for diabetes and another for Parkinson's disease, and we terminated development of a Phase
I small molecule for cardiovascular disease.
You'll also see that we've moved blosozumab from Phase II to Phase I. Our efforts to identify a commercially attractive
formulation have been unsuccessful and we've decided not to move blosozumab into Phase III development for
osteoporosis at this time. We will evaluate our strategy for the blosozumab development program to determine next
steps.
Now let me turn the call back over to Derica.
Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Phil. I'll recap progress we've made and our key events for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance.
Turning to slide 14, you may recall that when we showed this slide on our Q4 earnings call in late January we had
already achieved two events – presentation of data for ramucirumab in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and
completion of the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.
Since that time, we have achieved a number of additional milestones. We began our second wave of Phase III trials for
Cyramza, initiating a pivotal trial in first-line gastric cancer. In terms of the additional lifecycle investments in
Cyramza, you'll also see that we've specified that the Phase III lung cancer trial will be in the first-line setting in

patients with the EGFR mutation positive and we've added two new Phase III trial starts to our list of 2015 events, one
in second-line bladder cancer and the other in second-line liver cancer in patients with elevated baseline alpha beta
protein levels. This is a population where we saw a pronounced overall survival benefit in the Phase III REACH trial.
You'll also see that we've added a key event for our CGRP monoclonal antibody. In the coming weeks, we expect to
start a Phase III trial in patients with episodic cluster headache.
Moving to the next section, as mentioned earlier we issued a second positive Phase III top-line press release for
baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, and earlier this week we issued a top-line press release outlining positive results from
a Phase III trial of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis. Also for ixekizumab, but in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,
we presented detailed results of the Phase III UNCOVER-1 trial at the AAD meeting in March.
In the regulatory submissions category, you'll see the green checkmarks for the ramucirumab and ixekizumab
submissions I mentioned earlier as well as the red checkmark for the delay in submission for basal insulin peglispro,
while in the regulatory actions section you'll see the green checkmarks for the approvals received in Japan for Cyramza
in gastric cancer and for Glyxambi here in the U.S.
Finally, we've reflected the progress made with tanezumab, lifting of the partial clinical hold paving the way to resume
Phase III trials, as well as the negative appeals court ruling on Alimta in Germany.
2015 represents another year for execution of our innovation-based strategy, and we're pleased with our progress so far
and are excited for what lies ahead. While we know not all of the remaining events are likely to be positive, we are
increasingly confident that a significant majority will break our way and solidify our near-to-medium-term growth
prospects.
Now turning to our 2015 financial guidance, I'd first point out that our substantial EPS beat in the quarter relative to
consensus came from two line items – lower R&D expenses and higher other income. In both cases, we believe these
represent differences in timing between our expectations and consensus, not differences in expectations for the full
year. In terms of our non-GAAP guidance for 2015, at a high level we are reconfirming our full-year guidance, both the
individual line items and the EPS range. To provide some more color, we have seen further strengthening of the U.S.
dollar since our call in late January. And this is causing further FX headwinds at the top and bottom lines. However, the
underlying performance of our business is offsetting this additional downside.
Specifically on FX, when compared to our late January outlook we expect the continued strengthening of the U.S.
dollar to trim an additional $150 million to $175 million from revenue and another $0.05 to $0.06 from EPS. For the
full year, we now expect FX to reduce revenue growth by about 7.5%, or about $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. In terms of
EPS, we now forecast a negative FX effect of about $0.13, comprised of an operational FX hit of about $0.60 offset by
benefit to cost of sales of nearly $0.50. As we've discussed, should FX rates remain at current levels, this cost of sales
benefit in 2015 would essentially go away in 2016. You'll want to consider this as you model our gross margin percent
and EPS for 2016.
For our GAAP guidance, you will see that we have incorporated changes related to our decision to proceed with the
development of tanezumab and the deals we signed with Hanmi, Innovent and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Finally, keep in
mind that our 2015 GAAP guidance is based on our current estimate for how we'll account for the Novartis Animal
Health acquisition and the Erbitux deal and could change based upon revised estimates and final accounting treatment.
In summary, while our first quarter revenue reflects the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and the lingering effect
of U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista, Lilly remains on track to return to growth in 2015, driven by
excellent progress in our innovation-based strategy. We had solid underlying business performance, and our continued
focus on cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line. Recent new product launches along with the growing
success of our late-stage pipeline reinforce our confidence in our future.
Since our last earnings announcement, we've seen one FDA approval and two FDA submissions, in addition to
approvals and submissions in Europe and Japan. We've also seen a continuing series of positive data readouts for our
late-stage assets. We are pleased with the performance of recently-launched products as well as growth at several

established products. Excluding the hit from unfavorable exchange rates and lower U.S. sales of Cymbalta and Evista,
the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 5% this quarter. We've started 2015 in a position of strength, and our
continued cost-containment efforts allow us to build on our innovation-based strategy through both internal and
external investments.
As we transition from a period of unprecedented patent expirations to an era of growth, we are seeing tangible results
from our innovation-based strategy and we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunity we have to bring
innovative new medicines to patients and create value for shareholders.
As we discussed in January, throughout the balance of this decade we aim to drive revenue growth and expand
margins. You'll see us sharpen our focus on areas where we are best positioned to compete and win, and finally to
increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?

Thanks, Derica. Keely, if you could prompt the folks on the line for the procedure for getting into the queue and asking
questions and then move to the first caller, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI.
<Q>: Hey, guys. This is [ph] Saleem (29:48) for Mark. Thanks so much for all the color on the call. It's really helpful.
Two questions. One on Glyxambi, could you just give us your thoughts where are the patients going to come from? Do
you expect cannibalization of your current products or are these going to be new patients to the Lilly franchise? And
then Cyramza, if you could provide, please, a breakout on gastric versus lung sales? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. [ph] Saleem (30:11), thank you for the questions. Obviously, Enrique, first question for
you on Glyxambi, and then over to you, Sue, for the Cyramza question. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Very good. On Glyxambi, clearly we are looking at the benefit that this product could
provide for patients that are not achieving good control on metformin. So we see this as a very attractive option for
many of those patients. And that's basically what our clinical results also say. So we are excited. We're in the very early
stages of our launch. We launched in late March, so we are at this time basically introducing this product to healthcare
providers.
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure. And with Cyramza, the vast majority of the sales that we're seeing is in gastric cancer. In
fact in the U.S., where we launched last year, we're seeing use – with the majority of the sales coming from use in
combination with paclitaxel, as we expected. We did see in Q1, though, a proportion of sales coming from the lung
launch. It's early days yet on lung, but we are seeing uptake there, and the feedback so far is positive from physicians in
the use of Cyramza in lung cancer indication. And clearly in Europe we just launched – beginning of this year in
Europe, and where we are seeing access, for example in countries like Germany, again early days but the uptake in the
gastric indication there is positive.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Yes. Just I did not answer the question on what impact will Glyxambi have on both
Tradjenta and Jardiance. We are not really thinking about the cannibalization aspects when introducing this product.
We think this product is a very unique product. And if anything, we believe that this product is actually going to
strengthen both Tradjenta and Jardiance as it basically gains acceptance in the marketplace.

<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, Enrique, Thanks, Sue. [ph] Saleem (32:33), thanks for the questions. Keely, if we can
go to the next caller, please.

We'll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. I'd love to get your updated perspective on solanezumab in
Alzheimer's opportunity in light of the Biogen data. Mechanistically, of course, both products target A-beta; they do it
in reasonably different ways. Yesterday, Roche, who has two monoclonals, suggested that they may push forward with
the plaque-targeting version of their drug versus the other product that hits multiple forms of A-beta. Your product
targets soluble A-beta, yet you also have in development a plaque-specific monoclonal. So given the totality of the
data, what's your latest thinking here? What has the best chance of success – a drug that targets soluble or deposited
plaque? And then another question, if last patient visit is October 2016 does it mean that we would only learn of results
downstream of that or would we possibly learn of a top line ahead of that last patient visit?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Tim, thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to take a shot at the two questions.
Jan, do feel free to chime in as well, particularly on the first portion of Tim's question, if you'd like. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Thanks, Tim. Yes, obviously, excitement and interest in Alzheimer's these days. As you know,
for a long time we believed in solanezumab's mechanism clearly in the side of A-beta. It's exciting to have a complete
enrollment in EXPEDITION3 and now we're on the clock for the last patients achieve 18 months of therapy. In the
past, we've communicated there was a chance – we had allowed for an interim [ph] lift (34:28), but as I've said before
that feature of the program was only viable in the case of a slower enrollment rate. Again, at this point we haven't made
a definitive decision, but I would continue to guide people to focus on the end of the study as when we will be learning
really about the effects of solanezumab. So to your question, that would be after the October 16 last patient visit.
As you rightly point out, we also have plaque-specific interest in a Phase I program in that area. We're also excited
about that mechanism. Recognizing that the mechanisms may in fact be complementary in some sense, either
sequentially or combined together, that plaque-specific antibodies to date, the ones we have published data on, also
have a safety side effect profile that's to our eye quite different from solanezumab from a patient-adherence perspective,
etc., that may have an impact. So we will have to let both of these mechanisms play out, and we're excited about both
of them and I think for Alzheimer's it's truly a unique moment here as we see these modifying effects from multiple
different programs.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Jan, you have any additional comments, or ...
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Let me just add that I think it's very likely that these mechanisms are complementary, and
clearly solanezumab has also shown a preferable safety profile, particularly in relation to [indiscernible] (36:09) on the
brain edema dilemma that you see with this plaque-specific antibodies, at least from competitors. So I think we now
need to wait and see what happens with these bigger trials.
<A - Philip Johnson>: And Tim, just a little more color on your question about hearing results downstream from that
October 2016 date. As we've been through this a number of times, you may recall that after last patient visit there is
time that needs to transpire for the database to actually be locked, cleaned and validated and then for us to run tables
and figures and whatnot. So typically top-line press releases have been after last patient visit by multiple months, so
you should expect to see a top-line press release downstream certainly of that October 2016 last patient visit date.
Keely, if we can have the next caller, please?

<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. I was hoping you could provide a little more color on some of the softness in the
quarter for Alimta and Animal Health? You mentioned some competitive pressures there. Could you expound a bit?
And then on the pipeline, Jan, on the CGRP product are you still pursuing chronic and episodic headache as well, and
when might we see data on those products? And then lastly, on the glucagon receptor antagonist can you frame for us
what you're trying to accomplish there and where it might fit in to the broader spectrum of treatments? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Gregg, thanks for the questions. Sue, if you could comment on the Alimta performance
in the quarter; Jeff, obviously for Animal Health. With CGRP actually having transitioned to Dave's organization, I
think from a planning perspective, Dave, why don't you take a first crack at talking about our development plans for
CGRP. And then Enrique and Jan, if you want to fill in for the glucagon receptor antagonist, that would be great. Sue, I
will start with you.
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure. Alimta performance was mainly impacted by FX worldwide. We had a 1% volume
decline with a 7% rate and a 1% price. If we look at it by geography, we actually increased in the U.S. by 3%; that was
mainly driven by price. In Europe we had a 2% volume increase, and that was offset mainly by FX with also some
price impact. In EMBU we also had a volume increase again offset half by price and half by rate. In Japan, we had the
same impact that was mentioned earlier with regards to the buy-in that we saw last year on the consumption tax
increase. So we did have a volume decrease versus last year's quarter but also a rate impact in Japan.
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: On comp-animals, real quick like we've seen and really expected these headwinds with
increased competition really coming in a couple of areas. Two new competitive entries as well as a reentry in the
marketplace were two drivers. I would add an additional one which has really been some distraction from the
integration. We've really used a rapid pace with the integration of both companies, and from this being the first and
second quarter critical with the comp-animal business this also had an impact.
I will note, though, on the integration it's going better than expected. We're three months in, and I do believe that both
Novartis and Lohmann will be enablers to our medium and long-term growth in the comp-animals segment as well as
globally. We've re-launched as well Interceptor three weeks after the closing. The management teams have both been
combined. We've got a management team that includes some Novartis executives and I believe that we've now got the
majority of the global sales force in place. So again we're finding far more positives than negatives at this stage with
the Novartis integration. It will be an enabler for growth, and as we've previously communicated the savings level of
$200 million will be our minimum expectation.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Dave, on CGRP development plans?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yes. So I think your question was what are our plans for chronic and episodic headache,
remembering there's actually two types of headaches we're looking at here. What we've been talking about today is the
addition to the pipeline advancement chart of moving CGRP into Phase III here in the coming months for a condition
called cluster headache. We will be studying that in both the chronic and the episodic forms. This is an orphan type
indication that we're moving into. We are also continuing the development in episodic migraine. Lilly is not planning to
study chronic migraine at this time, and we have impressive results from our Phase II program in episodic migraine.
We will be seeking to replicate those results in Phase III. Right now we have a Phase IIb program going on to further
define the dose for that larger migraine program.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. And then to either Enrique or Jan on the GRA?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Maybe I'll start, and then Jan can help here. But clearly our glucagon receptor antagonist
is right now in Phase II. What we basically have seen is rapid reductions in hemoglobin A1C without increased hypos
or weight gain. The way we're thinking about this product is this product has to offer a benefit vis-à-vis a number of
oral options that are available today and that in the future will be available in generic form. So we are thinking that this
product could be an attractive option in the early segment for patients that have impaired renal function where beta cell
health might not be great. We don't see lots of options for these types of patients and GRA could be an attractive option
there. Jan?

<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yes, and just to complement there the metabolism of this agent is independent of renal
function, so therefore it's suitable with patients that have some compromise in their renal function.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you. Keely, if we can go to the next caller, please?
Operator
And that will come from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners.
<Q - Charles Anthony Butler>: Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much. Number one, Jan, if you could comment on
restarts for tanezumab. Would the focus again be NOA or osteoarthritis? Number two, what actually led to the decision
to delay the evacetrapib look? Was it just simply the DSMB making some judgments about event rates? And then
finally, again back to Alzheimer's, I think there is data supporting combination – maybe it's totally in animals – but
combinations of A-beta antibody and the base inhibitor, and just trying to understand how you think about, really from
a cost standpoint and also from a mechanistic standpoint, think about combinations versus solanezumab versus one or
the other antibodies alone as we progress over time, so something beyond 2016. Thanks very much.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Tony, thank you for the questions. Dave, actually I think I'll ask you to take a crack at
these since these assets are currently sitting with your business unit. Jan, obviously feel free to supplement his response
if you think it's appropriate. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Okay. Sure. Phil, can you hear me well?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Yes, we can.
<A - David A. Ricks>: I'm at a new location. Okay. Good. So at it relates to tanezumab, yes we're pleased to be able to
now move off of clinical hold and do plan to proceed into Phase III as soon as later this year with Pfizer. There will
actually be three indications that will be pursued – osteoarthritis, as you mentioned, Tony. We'll also be looking at
chronic lower back pain and then chronic pain associated with cancer. And that program is similar to what had been
previously studied and then stopped in Phase III.
On evacetrapib, as we mentioned earlier in the quarter, the extension of time is really not related to the evacetrapib
study ACCELERATE. It was a set of recommendations made by our academic advisors and accepted by the company
based on information coming from other major long-term cardiovascular event studies where it has been noted that in
immediate or recent ACS patients that the impact of lipid management is a bit delayed in these patients. We wanted to
make sure we fully accounted for this new information in sizing the trial; thus, the six-month extension into middle of
2016.
Maybe just briefly on Alzheimer's, and Jan perhaps can elaborate on the Lilly-generated combination data, but we have
no doubt that this disease, when we find and have approved these modifiers, will be requiring multiple mechanisms to
fully arrest its impact. And we do think mechanisms such as plaque-targeted antibodies, such as base inhibitors and
soluble A-beta antibodies and maybe even tau-based therapies, could be combined in all kinds of forms to achieve
optimal results. Of course, the science in this space is evolving rapidly and frankly pretty new. We don't have human
data in combinations that I'm aware of, so that's a whole field that will need to be explored hopefully after a positive
solanezumab study in late 2016.
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Let me just add a comment about tanezumab being nerve-growth factor antibody, which I
feel is highly exciting based on the chronic pain area is really needing a new agent. And if you consider the current
dilemmas and problems there are with opioids in relation to addiction, tolerance or even deaths due to abuse and so on,
an NSAID has a number of gastrointestinal side effects, and there is an increased cardiovascular risk. So I think the
opportunity for a new chronic pain agent is a major one.
In relation to the Alzheimer combos, it's quite intriguing to think about different mechanisms, again, and if you have
existing plaque they need to be cleared and most likely by some microglial activation. And we have our N3pG
plaque-specific antibody that can do that. And then you need and to prevent further buildup of plaques with A-beta and

that can be achieved either by a base inhibitor or potentially by solanezumab binding then the free A-beta. So we are
looking forward to making not only the preclinical experiments in a further solid way, but also to test this in the clinic.
But first we need to have good data with these different agents before we can combine them.

Yes. We will go to the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jay Olson>: Hi. It's Jay Olson in for Jami Rubin. Thanks for taking the questions. On Alimta, can you help us
understand when should we expect to get news on the appeal of the German and U.K. court decisions regarding the
Alimta method-of-use patent? And then do you expect the approval of PD-1 antibodies for use in lung cancer to impact
the sales of Alimta? And then just on Trulicity, any details if you could provide on how the launch is progressing?
Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Jay, thank you for the questions. Sue, the first two are for you and then we'll go over to
Enrique for the last question on Trulicity.
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure, Jay. With regards to the Alimta patent, the German court, as you know, ruled in our favor
last year on the infringement case. In March that was appealed, and the appeal ruled against Alimta and so basically has
ruled that the regimen patent would not be infringed by a generic competitor if they intend to market post the loss of the
compound patent at the end of December of this year. We do think we will seek permission to appeal this decision to
the German Supreme Court. We anticipate that that appeal hearing will happen, though, after the compound patent has
expired in Germany.
In the U.K., the High Court ruled against Lilly in the first instance in May of last year. We have appealed this ruling.
The appeal was heard in March of this year. We have yet to hear the outcome of that appeal. And as a reminder, that
case covered the U.K. but also from Italy and Spain. So we're waiting to hear what the outcome of that appeal will be.
Regarding your question on the PD-1 inhibitors, on Alimta, the main use of Alimta and where we promote Alimta,
because we believe that's where we see the best benefit for patients, is in the first-line setting and in the maintenance
setting. As you're aware, the Opdivo launch and the data that we're seeing in some later lines of therapy, so we do not
see an impact in the near future on Alimta.
Clearly there are other studies ongoing in the first-line setting. We'll need to see what those readouts are over the
coming years. Additionally, we do believe that combinations are going to be important going forward, and so we have a
collaboration with Merck to look at combining KEYTRUDA and Alimta in the first-line non-squamous settings, so
clearly we need to see the data for all those trials over the coming months and years.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So far I think the launch of Trulicity is going well. Let me comment first on the
market, the GLP-1 market, because we had shared that we felt that Trulicity could be an important catalyst for the
overall growth in that class. And long-term for us this is critical as we think about the prospect for this product.
A year ago, when we look at Q1 of 2014, this class was growing 6% when we look at TRx growth. This year this class
is growing 10 percentage points higher, so the growth is at 16%. And importantly, the growth is still accelerating as we
look at new prescriptions. So it is an important start, because we do believe that Trulicity will be a major player in this
class, but we want to make sure that this class is as relevant as it basically could be.
To give some details on our penetration within the class itself, Trulicity today has an 11% new to patient, new to brand
share. This is comparable to Bydureon at 23% and Victoza at 51%. We are pleased with what we see. Importantly,
because we have to put into context that in Q1 what we share is that our access discussions are going well, and just to
provide some color in Q1 we had 65% availability in commercial and no availability in Part D. Commercially, it's

about 75% of the overall market, so clearly what this basically means for Trulicity that we had access to about 50% of
the market, so we need to look at 11% new to brand of course in that context.
What we have shared is that we feel good about our access in commercial. We continue to advance those numbers, so
we're closer to 70% now. In Part D, we had shared in the past that we were expecting access, most likely starting in
2016. I'm pleased to report that we have already some limited access in Part D, and we believe that access will continue
to increase through Q2 and Q3. So we're getting access faster than we had expected, and this I think responds to the
value that the payers see in this particular product.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thank you. Keely, if we can go to the next caller, please?

We'll go next to the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. Just back to a question for Enrique on Trulicity while you're
still on it, with that kind of growth, 16% growth, can you just maybe talk about how the launch with the primary care is
going? What percent of the business or prescriptions that are generated are being generated by endos versus primary
care? And then you'll approach about six months post-launch about midyear. With that kind of growth in the market,
one would think a good dose of direct-to-consumer advertising might be useful in driving uptake of the product, so just
commentary around that. Second question has to do with the Alimta ruling in the U.K. on the appellate decision.
Just your thoughts around timing of that. Is that something you're expecting to happen in the second quarter? And then
I noticed in your slide deck you do have outcomes coming on U.S. and Japan. Can you just remind us what's going on
there? And then lastly, on Alzheimer's disease and tao, you made some acquisitions of some diagnostics in 2013 on tao.
Neurofibrillary tangles are a little bit different. When might we potentially, Jan, see some assets targeting the tao area
coming out of your pipeline? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, John. Enrique will start with you for the Trulicity questions. And, Sue, if you
want to comment on Alimta and, Jan, for the tao.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So providing a little more detail when we look at both endos and primary care.
Endos, which represent slightly under 30% of the overall GLP-1 market, our new-to-patient share is 18%, so clearly
this reflects a fact that we've been – we launched to endos earlier. In primary care, our share is still in the high single
digits when it comes to new-to-patient share, but it's increasing fast so we feel good in terms of where we are today. I
think it's important to note that in primary care we basically really have about two and a half months basically since we
launched, so it's still very early. But we're seeing week-to-week progression when it comes to our new-to-patient share.
And clearly the continually improved access I think is going to play very well for us. In terms of our plans as we seek
to build this brand, I won't comment but clearly we're not ruling out direct-to-consumer or any of those investments.
Clearly there's a lot of direct-to-consumer investments in the U.S. right now and that's something that we look very
closely for all of our brands.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Okay. With regards to the Alimta hearing or the Alimta patent, the U.K. decision will clearly
depend on the timing from the court. But we do anticipate we'll hear sometime later this year on that. In Japan, the JPO
hearing was heard in February, and again we're expecting to get a determinate on that case again sometime later this
year. In the U.S., as you're aware the district court has ruled in Lilly's favor on validity. The case has gone back to the
court regarding infringement. That case is now being heard on May 28 of this year.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. And, Jan, on tao?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yes. First, the tao imaging agent is making intriguing progress and seems to differ in relation
to what you can achieve compared to the amyloid imaging. The tao imaging seems to correlate quite well to symptom
decline and progression then of Alzheimer's disease. It also has a regional distribution in the brain that also seems to

correlate with symptoms, and there's a great interest in the overall academic and pharmaceutical community for these
particular agent. We are also testing whether the tao imaging could potentially be a surrogate marker then for
Alzheimer's disease progression and how you can influence that with pharmaceuticals, and there will be a subgroup in
EXPEDITION3 for solanezumab that will have the tao tracer before and after treatment.
In relation to tao therapeutics, we are very interested to see if we can inhibit the spread of tao misfolded protein in the
brain, which seems to happen in the prior like fashion, and we have a monoclonal antibody in preclinical development
that, if everything goes well, we should have that in Phase I next year.

And we'll go next to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<A - Wendy L. Lin>: Good morning. This is Wendy Lin on for Chris. Thanks for the questions. Just a couple. How
are you thinking about what insights you have learned from the recent DPP-4 AdCom panel and the impact it might
have on the DPP-4 class? And can you talk about your relative confidence in Jardiance with regard to the CV outcome
study and the possibility that the study could show a net benefit to patients? And then in Oncology, in light of the Pfizer
Ibrance approval and the early stoppage of their second-line study, can you update us on your program? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Sure. Thanks for the questions, Wendy. So Enrique, obviously to you for the DPP-4 AdCom
question and our CV outcomes trial for Jardiance, and then Sue for the bemaciclib update.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Well, on DPP-4 I think we all have seen or heard the discussion at the advisory
committee. Clearly, there was a lot of focus on both CV safety but also all-cause mortality endpoints. It is difficult for
me to speculate any action that the FDA may take. I think what I can basically say as far as Tradjenta is concerned,
even though I would have to keep in mind that these numbers are very low, so we cannot have any type of conclusive
interpretation from this data, but when we look at randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials and when we look at the
data for Tradjenta, in both cases when it comes to CV mortality and when it comes to all-cause mortality, our
[indiscernible] (1:00:45) ratios were below 1.
So we have no signals that would indicate that linagliptin would have an issue when it comes to either all-cause
mortality or CV death. When it comes to the data for dosage-specific DPP-4, I think you would have to ask the
respective companies. As far as Jardiance is concerned, we are very excited to be able to get to see the results from our
outcome trial. At this stage, I have characterized our chances as decent but we have to wait and see, so we will be
basically having a chance to look at these results over the summer and we expect to basically publish top-line results
when we have these data available.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. And Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Okay, regarding bemaciclib, we are very excited by this molecule and we believe that the latest
news with Ibrance validates the CDK 4/6 class. We believe that we could have a best-in-class molecule here with
single-agent activity, continuous dosing, and also our molecule crosses the blood-brain barrier. We're moving quickly
on our trials. We have our two Phase III trials ongoing and enrolling, one which is our Phase II trial ongoing as well as
our KRAS lung study ongoing. So we're moving quickly. Our plan is to enroll these trials as quickly as possible so we
can get data out hopefully over the next year or so on these trials.
Also we have started a breast cancer study for women with brain mets. That will be – because we know that bemaciclib
could cross the blood-brain barrier we believe that that could be a good opportunity for this molecule. So we're excited
and we look forward to sharing more data with you.

<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much. So maybe if you could just update us on some key data sets through
the balance of this year and maybe if you could focus a little bit more on the data sets for Phase II that could actually
have products entering into Phase III, that would be very helpful. As a second question, this may be for the CV team,
but maybe you could talk to us a little bit about the target event rate in that study, and just update us on what your
expectations are for the baseline LDL. And when you talk about that, could you just confirm that the baseline LDL is
on a maximized statin background. And then lastly, can you just help us better understand, in the sort of evolving
pricing environment, what do you think are the thresholds of benefit that are going to be necessary for you to show to
really achieve an appropriate payment scheme for the anti-NGF therapy? Thanks a lot.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Seamus, thank you for the questions. So Dave, I think probably the second question, the
third, are up your alley. I would say, Seamus – this is Phil – we have not yet published the design paper for the
ACCELERATE trial of evacetrapib. I think we were close to doing that last year, but when the [indiscernible] (1:04:39)
data came out, as Dave mentioned earlier, we wanted to make sure that we could fully analyze that and take into
consideration how that might impact, if at all, the trial designed for ACCELERATE.
As you have now seen, that has impacted, resulted in an additional six-month extension of the study to accrue
additional events and additional late events. So Dave, if you could maybe start out talking about, to the extent that you
can, target event rates, baseline LDL and if it was on max statin background, and then talk a bit about the pricing
environment as you see it for the anti-NGF. And we will come back to your first question, Seamus, in particular Phase
II data that could read out this year and more broadly data readouts that you should have on your radar screen for the
balance of 2015. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yes. Sure thing, Seamus. As it relates to the target event rates and specifics about the
population in the ACCELERATE program, and I know we've said this before but we are anticipating publishing a
design paper for ACCELERATE which include those details. So until that is published it's probably not appropriate to
comment further.
I will only generally say that ACCELERATE is a study designed to study secondary prevention in high-risk vascular
disease, and as a result we're expecting a decent event rate in this population. In fact, that's what we're observing having
enrolled it. The details of that again will be published in a forthcoming journal. As it relates to NGF and tanezumab and
the pricing scheme, of course we're not going to go into the detail on that here but I think Jan touched on this earlier,
that we see chronic pain management – different from acute pain management – chronic pain management as an area of
very significant unmet need, particularly in the United States. The patients that will be targeted with tanezumab will be
patients who have exhausted other pain management options and other more significant intervention is the likely next
step in their disease course.
We think in this space there's creation both for a pharmaceutical but in the health system itself, not to mention the side
effect and addiction issues for the current therapies. Tanezumab has demonstrated already in a large [indiscernible]
(1:07:15) program pretty substantial effect size [indiscernible] (1:07:17-1:07:22) that we think there's clearly a place
where this drug can be reimbursed in chronic pain management.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave. This is Phil.
<A - David A. Ricks>: And...
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay. Go ahead.
<A - David A. Ricks>: No, I wrote down the questions here, but a question about baseline LDL, and the baseline LDL
is, just to confirm, in ACCELERATE and we haven't published that number, but patients enroll on the maximum
tolerated dose of the [indiscernible] (1:07:48).

<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Seamus, let me start with some of the trial readouts that you should be
expecting and/or detailed data presentations that we think you should have on your radar screen. And then Jan, Sue,
Enrique, or Dave, if there are other Phase II readouts that you want to highlight, please do so.
So as Derica mentioned, at the ADA meeting this year we would expect to have detailed data from a large number of
the Phase III trials for our basal insulin peglispro. We also hope in the middle part of this year, in the summer, to have
the first detail of the Phase III data disclosures for both ixekizumab and for baricitinib, respectively in psoriasis and
rheumatoid arthritis. Recall as well, Enrique mentioned the CV outcomes trial for Jardiance that we expect around the
middle part of the year, and then the solanezumab extension data from the two-year extension we would expect to be
presented at the medical meeting this year as well.
If you think about some of the additional top lines that are yet to readout, probably the main ones that I would highlight
for you would be the latter part of the year when we expect to have data from the remaining two of sort of the four
main pivotal trials for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. We've also talked about moving over a 2-mab or 3G3 into
Phase III trials in soft tissue sarcoma and would hope at an upcoming medical meeting to have some of the detailed
data presented to allow you to see our reason for optimism with that drug. Clearly ASCO would be a great venue for us
to do that.
With that, let me turn it over to Jan or the other business unit presidents if there are additional readouts you would like
to highlight. I think I've hit them all, but ...
<A - Susan Mahony>: I think you have.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay. Great. Keely, with that, if we can go to the next caller, please?
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next in line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sir, your line is open. If you
have your mute button on, please take it off. Mr. Risinger? We will move on to the line of Vamil Divan with Credit
Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Hi. This is [indiscernible] (1:10:04) on behalf of Vamil Divan. Thanks for taking the questions, I have a few here.
First on the Animal Health business, can you talk about the pricing environment for food in companion animal health
products and the outlook longer term? And the secondly, on baricitinib, we've now seen some initial Phase IIb data
from another competing oral JAK. How do you see baricitinib's profile stacking up now against competitors and when
should we expect to see additional detailed data from the program? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, [ph] Ari (1:10:31). So Jeff, if you'd like to handle the first question on Animal
Health pricing, and then, Dave, back across the pond to you for baricitinib.
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Yeah, the pricing environment overall remains stable in Animal Health. We saw last year,
as you know, a 4% increase in our business. Industry averages have been between 2% and 3%. And I believe that we've
got different economic conditions across geographies and species, but a pretty stable market so I would see it in the
range of this industry average of between 2% and 3%.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you. And Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yes, so baricitinib, we're right in the middle of Phase III readouts. As Phil mentioned
previously, the first two studies we have top-lined already, and you should expect to see some of that data presented
next ILAR coming up in the middle of the year; this is the BEACON and BUILD studies. Additionally, we have an
early RA study and then a first-line biologic comparative study, which is a fully powered [indiscernible] (1:11:37).
Both of those studies we're excited in the second half of this year we'll be top-lining those. So exciting year for
baricitinib and then shortly following off that we'll be submitting to FDA and other global regulators. In terms of how
we compare our results to others, of course it's not appropriate to make direct – there are no direct comparison studies
between [indiscernible] (1:12:03) and baricitinib or the recent Galapagos data. But I think we've said all along we like

the JAK1/2 signaling pathway, particularly in RA, and we feel like baricitinib has a chance to be the best in class, that
product, if you think of this as one whole class, and so far we're pleased with results from the studies that have read out.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, Dave. Keely, if we can go to the next caller, please?
Operator
And we'll go to the line of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathy M. Miner>: Thank you. Good morning. Just two topics. First on ixekizumab, can you comment, I think on
clinicaltrials.gov it shows that the trials for ankylosing spondylitis was withdrawn. Can you comment whether you're
still pursuing that indication? And also recently we've seen some top-line data from one of your competitors which had
some very strong PASI 100 scores and is that something mechanistically there's differences between these products, or
how can we look at that?
And second question is just on guidance for 2015. I appreciate that you've had a very strong first quarter and there were
some timing issues and also you've highlighted very clearly the currency impacts going forward. But can you tell us
whether Lilly has ever changed annual guidance in the first quarter historically? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Kathy, appreciate the questions. Dave, if you could comment on the ixekizumab
questions. And Derica, we've got one finally for you on financials, if you want to talk about the guidance. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Sure. Yeah. Thank you for the question on ixekizumab. To clarify, the ankylosing spondylitis
study that was withdrawn was originally designed to be a supportive study for exposure to the PSA program as we are
– several years ago, and as we are midstream on the initial indication work for ixekizumab we changed the strategy.
And that supportive evidence wasn't required any more under the approach. So what we have with ixekizumab now is a
complete set of studies in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis – the UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, UNCOVER-3
studies.
I'm not sure which competitor you're referring to on the PASI 100 scores, but we are pretty impressed with our PASI
100 scores which, as you know, at the high end have achieved up to 41%, and I think that's as good as I've seen but
interested in of course if you have other insights on that. And IL-17 as a class, we do have differences. Necitumumab,
which has now launched from Novartis, an IL-17A antibody to the protein. So are we. Whereas others have taken
different approaches; you noted the Amgen approach, which is a receptor antibody. So it would be not unexpected to
have slightly different types of clinical results and safety profiles as a result of those differences.
In terms of other things around ixekizumab, we recently top-lined our first psoriatic arthritis study and there's another
psoriatic arthritis study ongoing. And as it relates to AS, back to the original question, we remain interested in this
indication and we think turning IL-17 is a logical step and could advance care for this very debilitating condition.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, Dave. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: As for our guidance this year, historically, yes, we have; it has happened. I would say it's not
common. But we do look at it each and every quarter to see if there's anything meaningful enough to cause us to move
our estimates. As I stated earlier in my opening remarks, we are off to a very good start to the year despite the FX
headwinds. We are driving volume growth in those areas we had anticipated, at least versus our internal expectations.
And that coupled with the good cost-containment efforts really is driving our strong bottom-line performance. And as
importantly, we do expect to return to growth for the year this year, in 2015. So we're very encouraged by our start to
the year, and we'll keep you updated as we progress through the remaining months.

And we'll go to the line of – back to David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. Sorry about that earlier. So I have three questions. First, with respect to
the two-year extension sola data that is forthcoming, could you just please provide a framework for us for what data set
we should be expecting, how you might carve out the mild patients, any caveats that you would highlight before we see
the data? Second, with respect to glargine, could you just remind us your timing for launch in Europe and in the U.S.?
And then on the Erbitux deal, Derica, maybe you could just explain some of the income statement mechanics we
should be thinking about for late this year and then the accretion from that deal in 2016. Thanks very much.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great, Dave. Thanks for the questions. For Dave Ricks, if you could talk about the two-year
extension, sort of how people should be thinking about that, general framework of what they might be expecting to see
in the data or what we'd like to be seeing in the data, we'll be carving out mild patients and any caveats to be provided.
Enrique, over to you for the timing for launch for glargine, both U.S. and E.U. And then Derica, if you want to
comment on the Erbitux mechanics. If not, I can chime in as well. So, Dave, over to you first.
<A - David A. Ricks>: Sure. Thanks, Dave, for the question. We said previously that we'll be hoping to disclose that
data in the middle of this year, the two-year extension from EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2. We have disclosed at
CTAD, November 14, some of the earlier data, and just on limitations, just a few comments. Of course this is open
label data. It's a progressive and significant disease burden on the patients and so you never get 100% that complete it
all the way through. And probably most importantly, patients in EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2 were not
deselected for lack of [indiscernible] (1:18:50), and so we still have a mixed-cause dementia in the study which, of
course, we've corrected in EXPEDITION3.
That said, I think there's two primary effects one would hope to see. To answer your question, did we see disease
modification in the controlled phase of EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2, and we will be focused on the mild
patients. You'll see that broken out. One is that there's no catch-up, meaning that if you start later you can get to the
same point. I think one definition of disease modification is that it's abating the progression; therefore starting earlier is
better. But I think then you'd also hope to see that the later started patients would also follow a parallel curve decay to
those who were on the drug the whole time so that there is a drug effect. And in a sense one could say you didn't just
get lucky with randomization in the first set of studies. So those are two comments and color to frame what we'll see in
July.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So when it comes to glargine, we are anticipating launching in Europe late in the
summer of this year. In the U.S., as you are aware, we are subject to a 30-month stay. We do have a trial happening
later this year in the month of September. Assuming of course that we have a favorable resolution of that trial prior to
the 30-month stay, we would be launching earlier, but the 30-month stay basically takes us into Q3 of 2016.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Enrique. So, Dave, on Erbitux, it might be helpful just to review really quickly
the current accounting. So essentially when you look at things like our investor workbook we post on the website and
look at the detailed product revenue tab, you'll see that there are two different lines. One is for the net revenue that we
book, which is essentially 39% of the revenue that actually is sold, for example, by Bristol, offset by some of the
third-party royalty obligations that exist. And then you'll see a second line which is the sale of bulk product to Bristol,
for which we book the cost of sales and our cost of sales as well. That sales number for the API that we produce and the
cost of sales are not largely different numbers.
As you think about going forward, once we transition the product back to Lilly from Bristol, we will sell to end
customers and book the full sales. We will have no longer any kind of bulk sales out to them, so the full cost of bulk
will hit our cost of sales. And we'll also have the full finished cost of sales through third parties that Bristol currently
would show on their income statement. We'll also have additional selling, marketing, and R&D expenses related to
ongoing support of the brand. And then on a GAAP basis, we would also have amortization of intangible, and I'm not
sure exactly which line that hits.

I think it's likely going to be hitting our cost of sales line for our reported or GAAP results. There are likely be some
other accounting-related effects that could happen essentially as we are monitoring over time and truing-up the asset
that has been created as well as the liability that has been created as part of the essentially business combination type
accounting that was applied for this particular business development deal. But the major effects I believe are the ones I
just outlined for you.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: We would expect it to be accretive starting in 2016. I'm not in a position at this point in time to
quantify how much. I would underscore that the basis for the deal really is value. As the long-term owners for the asset,
because it was already originally scheduled to come back to us in late 2018, we believe we are best positioned be the
stewards of it up until that time and overall this should allow us to drive better value for the company for the life of the
asset.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Got it.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Do you have a follow-up question, David?
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thank you. So the benefits of it coming back to you in late – I think you said late 2018
basically are shifting forward to 2016?
<A - Philip Johnson>: That's correct, but there is a different set of economics that will govern those two periods. Since
Bristol had a larger economic right through the end – or near the end of 2018, we'll have different economics between
now and September of 2018. After September of 2018, both currently under the existing agreement as well as under the
revised agreement once it's implemented, we have full North American rights with no trailing obligations to Bristol.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great, thanks very much for all the answers.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Sure. You are very welcome. Keely, next caller, please?
Operator
We do have a follow-up from the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robison Humphrey.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the question. Just on evacetrapib, just has to do mechanistically and also in
your clinical plan, you're capturing [ph] Ivis (1:24:11) data. Can you maybe just address the HDL elevation component
and whether you're going for a slowing of the progression or a reversal of the regression – or reversal of the
accumulation of plaque in the arteries? And then any animal model data that potentially substantiates what you're doing
on the [ph] Ivis (1:24:33) side. I guess Crestor's one of the few molecules that have been able to get a slowing of the
progression in their label from using [ph] Ivis (1:24:41). Just your commentary on that would be helpful.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, John, for the question. Dave, if you want to answer, and obviously, Jan, you're
probably well positioned to provide some comments as well. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Sure. Yeah, and, Jan, please jump in. Of course all along we've been saying with this program
we've powered it to boost on the LDL impacts and what you're expecting around 30%. However, we also believe that a
very high level of HDL reduction can impact cardiovascular risk, and of note at the recent cardiovascular meeting in
San Diego in March Dan Rader's lab presented some interesting data regarding cholesterol efflux with evacetrapib,
which demonstrated a very substantial degree of efflux out of the plaque to the macrophage back to the liver
[indiscernible] (1:25:42) cholesterol. And this is sort of the mechanistic underpinning for believing in the type of HDL
raising we're providing being additive to that cardiovascular event reduction. And I'm sure off-line we can refer you to
that paper, John. Jan, do you have anything else to add?

<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. And then one follow-up, then, for Dave's question. My counterpart over at Bristol-Myers
Squibb, John Elicker, would probably want me to point out that there will be during this period on Erbitux from Q4 this
year through late 2018 a payment that we will be making to Bristol-Myers Squibb. I believe subsequently they will be
disclosing the amount of that payment with their SEC filing, and that payment for us would show up in cost of sales.
