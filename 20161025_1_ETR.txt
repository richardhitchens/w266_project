Leo P. Denault
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're announcing another solid quarter with operational
earnings per share of $2.31. Adjusted earnings of $1.98 for our core Utility, Parent & Other business were substantially
higher than last year and in line with our growth expectations. We remain on track to meet this year's guidance for
Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share.
As our results show, we continue to execute on our strategy and meet our objectives both at the Utility and EWC. At
the beginning of the year, we set out our to-do-list as shown on slide three. And with three quarters of 2016 now behind
us, I'm happy to say that we've successfully completed most of those tasks.
Each of these accomplishments supports our objective of steady and predictable growth at the Utility, while managing
risk and reducing our EWC footprint. At the Utility, we continue to make needed investments, which will modernize
our system and enhance its efficiency and the reliability for benefit of our customers. We have a number of generation
projects in front of us, which will meet this purpose.
First, the St. Charles Power Station is a 980-megawatt CCGT to be constructed and placed into service in Montz,
Louisiana by June of 2019. The administrative law judge recommended supporting this certification of this project in
July. And we are waiting a final regulatory decision from the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
The Commission is facing some scheduling challenges. And it has been difficult for the full Commission to take up
major items for vote. However, we anticipate that the Commission will be able to make a decision on this project
before the end of the year.
On October 7, Entergy Texas made its filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking a certification to
construct the Montgomery County Power Station. This 993-megawatt highly efficient combined cycle plant will
provide reliable power at significantly reduced energy costs. The plant will produce an expected $1.7 billion in net
benefits to our Texas customers.
In addition, the plant will use state-of-the-art emission control technology to lower air emissions. And construction
anticipated to begin in 2019 will provide more than 2,800 direct jobs in Texas and nearly $1 billion in economic
activity for the local economy.
In June, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to construct a
New Orleans Power Station. 226 megawatt CT will provide a modern cost-effective local resource to enhance
reliability and operational flexibility, mitigate market risks and aid in restoration efforts following major weather
events. The construction of this plant will produce hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits for the state and
local economy.
We are currently working with the City Council to set a procedural schedule. And we expect to make filings with the
Louisiana Commission to begin the regulatory approval process for the Lake Charles CCGT later this year. This also
will be a highly efficient plant that will support the growing customer base in the Lake Charles area.
Additionally, we estimate the plant will provide around $1.4 billion in savings to customers over its lifetime. Our
transmission grid is equally vital for the operation of our system and ongoing investments are required for compliance,
reliability and efficiency. We continually make upgrades and additions to the grid to enhance our level of service and
make room for growth.
At the end of June, we completed Phase 2 of our Pine Bluff voltage support project in Arkansas, constructing a new
230 kV substation and transmission line. In July, we also finished the installation of a 230 kV line, a 500 kV to 230 kV
auto transformer and a 230 kV substation to better serve our customers in Texas. Some of our transmission investment
decisions are made through the annual MISO Transmission Expansion Planning process also known as MTEP. We are
nearing the end of the MTEP planning process for 2016.
Currently, we have 48 projects totaling roughly $480 million under consideration. The MISO Board will make its
selections and give final approval to projects in December. On September 15, we submitted about $700 million of

proposed projects for MTEP 17 and we will work with MISO on the selection process for those proposals over the
course of the next year.
For the last several years, we've been executing on these and other traditional generation and transmission projects.
We've also begun to outline investments, which will lay the foundation for an integrated energy network. To that end,
on September 19, Entergy Arkansas was the first of our jurisdictions to make regulatory filings, seeking approval from
its commission for advanced metering implementation.
These were followed by filings from Entergy New Orleans on October 18. In each filing, we requested that our
regulators find the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure to be in the public interest. Entergy Arkansas
expects to recover its investment through its forward-looking FRP. Entergy New Orleans has requested approval to
implement a phased in customary charge.
Deployment of this infrastructure, including advanced meters, is expected to bring total net benefits of approximately
$260 million to our customers in Arkansas and New Orleans in addition to improved outage restoration, enhanced
customer service and tools to better manage energy usage. Contingent on approval by the Arkansas Commission and
the New Orleans City Council, meter deployment would begin in 2019.
Ahead of meter deployment, we are focused on constructing and integrating the back-office systems that support this
technology and make it smart, a meter data management system, a new outage management system and distribution
management system, as well as designing and installing the infrastructure for our communications network. Advanced
meters are a big step forward and the advantages they provide to our customers as well as the follow-on technologies
and services they enable represent the future of our company and our industry.
I'd like to take a moment now to extend our sympathy to the family and friends of Clyde Holloway, the Louisiana
Public Service Commission Chair, who recently passed away. Commissioner Holloway was consistently fair, dedicated
to serving the public interest and true to his convictions. We appreciate his many years of public service. Last Friday,
the Governor of Louisiana appointed Charlie DeWitt, Former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, to fill
the remaining months of Commissioner Holloway's term. We look forward to working with Commissioner DeWitt.
As you know, we spent the last few years working with our regulators, Commissioner Holloway and others, for
improvements in our regulatory constructs. These constructs are now facilitating our investments in the utility
infrastructure. For example, this quarter, Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement in its first FRP filing with the forward
test year. We have requested any potential rate adjustments to be in effect on December 30.
Entergy Mississippi completed its FRP filing with the stipulated settlement for a $19.4 million rate increase. New rates
were effective in July 2016. Entergy Texas filed for a $19 million annual increase to its transmission cost recovery
factor rider in September reflecting $210 million of incremental transmission investment since its last base rate filing.
Entergy Texas also presented its view on alternative ratemaking mechanisms to the Public Utility Commission in Texas
through a filing made in August. This filing was in response to the Texas legislature's request for the Commission to
conduct a study and make recommendations regarding appropriate reforms to the ratemaking process.
In its comments, Entergy Texas asserted that a formula rate plan with the forward test years and effective mechanism to
reduce regulatory lag. This mechanism would provide utilities with an opportunity to earn their authorized returns and
is also beneficial to a utility's credit ratings, providing access to capital at lower cost to customers and facilitating the
infrastructure investment to support economic development and the creation of jobs in Texas.
The Commission will consider the filing along with the recommendations from others and provide its final ratemaking
report to the legislature in January. And our FERC regulated system agreement came to an end on September 1 after
more than 50 years of existence. This agreement has been a source of litigation between Entergy and various retail
regulators for years. And its elimination moves that risk and – removes that risk and allows us to focus more
specifically on the priorities and policies of local regulators.
You've also heard us talk about the importance of controlling bills for our customers. Our rates continue to be among
the lowest in the country and these low rates are one of the factors that make our region attractive for industrial

development. We said there are a number of levers available to keep overall customer bills reasonable. In one such
example, last month, $55 million of Mississippi storm restoration bonds for Hurricane Katrina were fully paid off and
we were able to remove that charge from our customers' bills. These are the first storm securitization bonds to roll off
bills and more will follow for our customers in Louisiana in 2018 and Texas in 2021.
Shifting to our nuclear operations. We recognize the importance of nuclear power as part of the national energy
landscape and the significant benefits our plants bring to our stakeholders. Nuclear power is a source of low-cost steady
reliable baseload power. It provides fuel diversity to our generation portfolio and reduces fuel price volatility. It
minimizes our environmental footprint by creating virtually no emissions. Each plant anchors its surrounding
community with steady, good paying jobs, a significant property tax base, and other ancillary economic benefits. And
last but not least, we believe the plants are necessary to ensure the continued reliability of our electric grid.
We must preserve the benefits our plants provide and ensure that our operations are in line with evolving nuclear
industry standards for operational excellence. This requires that we look at what investment is needed to ensure safe
and reliable operations in the near-term as well as what it will take to prepare plants to operate to the end of their
expected operating lives. As a result, going forward, the cost to operate our plants will be higher.
Prudently investing to preserve these valuable resources for our customers, communities, employees and owners is an
important part of our utility strategy. Our financial plan now includes the investments we believe are needed to meet
our goals for nuclear operations as well as mitigating actions in rate creep. Drew will discuss our revised earnings
outlook and other outlook information in his remarks.
Turning briefly to EWC, operational earnings for the quarter were essentially flat to the same quarter of last year. Like
many merchant generators, we faced market challenges, including very low commodity prices. These challenges are
apparent in revised EWC EBITDA outlooks we provided today and further validate the progress we've continued to
make on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint.
On August 9, we announced our agreement to sell the FitzPatrick Plant to Exelon. We recently received early
termination of the HSR waiting period and we continue to work through the required regulatory approvals with the
NRC, FERC and the New York Public Service Commission. We are targeting the second quarter of 2017 to close the
transaction. We also continue to proceed along two parallel paths, both the plants refueling and potential sale and the
possibility of permanent shutdown and decommissioning. Once again, I'd like to thank our FitzPatrick employees who
continue to operate the plant safely and reliably throughout this transition.
We also entered into agreements this quarter to sell our EWC wind assets in Iowa in Texas and expect to close on that
transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We will continue to be disciplined in our assessment of every remaining
asset in our EWC portfolio to execute on our strategy to reduce our merchant footprint.
Many of you have heard about the mid-August rainstorms in south Louisiana, which brought devastation to so many of
our customers as well as our employees. These historic rains dropped an estimated 7 trillion gallons of water in one
week, damaging roughly 60,000 homes and businesses and causing outages to more than 32,000 of our electric
customers. Our crews worked tirelessly to restore power quickly and safely to customers.
After the water receded, hundreds of Entergy employees from four states, friends and family members, all logged over
10,000 hours of volunteer service helping to clean flooded homes. In addition, they collected needed tools and supplies
and provided meals to those in the area, coming together admirably to support each other in the affected communities.
To that end, Entergy contributed $525,000 to local non-profit organizations to help them respond to the storm.
I'd also like to acknowledge those who were recently affected and suffered losses in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.
Along with many of our peer utilities, Entergy provided over 400 workers to assist with restoration efforts. We were
eager to respond to this call for help as others have done for us many times in the past.
In many ways, events such as these are an important reminder of who we serve and what we do best. Supporting the
communities where our customers and employees live has always been a part of who we are at Entergy and one of the
many ways we power lives. In recognition of efforts such as these, as well as our other sustainable business practices,

Entergy has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for a 15th consecutive year. We earned top scores in the
areas of corporate citizenship and philanthropy, climate strategy, biodiversity, and water-related risks. The index
confirms that we're focused on the right things and successfully providing value to each of our four stakeholders.
Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's Top 10 Utilities in Economic Development in 2015. This
is the ninth year in a row that we've been named to the list recognizing our integral role that resulted in nearly $10
billion of capital investment and the creation of over 4,800 jobs in our service territory. We know that economic
development is important for our customers across the region and it's also good for business. And we'll continue to
work with our state agencies and local communities to promote growth across our service territories.
In summary, this was another solid quarter. Both our consolidated operational earnings and our adjusted earnings for
our core business were substantially higher than last year and in line with our growth expectations. Our solid results
to-date demonstrate our ability to continue to execute on our strategy.
With that backdrop, I'll also note that our financial outlooks now reflect our prudent decision to position the nuclear
fleet for sustained operational excellence, along with other non-fuel O&M adjustments such as increased benefit
expenses due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and the industrywide reality of flattening consumption
from residential and commercial customs.
Despite the near-term effects, the incorporation of these items in our financial outlooks strengthens our confidence in
our ability to deliver on our long-term goals as reflected in our unchanged 2019 outlook. As we look down the road to
2019 and beyond, we continue to see the benefits of the progress and accomplishments we've made over the past 24
months to execute on our objectives of steady predictable growth on Utility, Parent & Other earnings and corporate
dividends.
We look forward to talking with you some more about our plans and our outlooks at EEI next month. And, with that,
I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing the quarterly results, I'll take some time today
to talk about our longer term outlooks. We know that you're all anticipating an update on our nuclear investments and
its financial effects. We decided to give you key information in advance of the EEI to help you better prepare for those
meetings.
I'll start with key takeaways from our third quarter results on slide four, beginning with the consolidated results in the
top-left corner. As-reported earnings included special items related to EWC nuclear plant that we've identified to close
or sell. Last year's results included significant impairments for the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants.
On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $2.31 per share in the current period. This compares to $1.90 a
share a year ago. The increase was due to growth in our core Utility, Parent & Other business shown in the top-right
corner. Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased more than 25% above last year, which I'll discuss shortly.
Just a reminder, our adjusted view normalizes for special items the estimated effects of weather and income taxes.
Looking at the bottom-left corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat. Operational earnings per share for
Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.40 quarter-over-quarter, shown on slide five.
Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, Utility, Parent & Other results increased $0.42. This growth reflects
late actions to recover productive investments to benefit customers and improve returns. Specific drivers include
Entergy Arkansas rate case, Union Power Station acquisition, Entergy Mississippi's recent formula rate plan and
Entergy Texas' new transmission cost recovery rider.
Though retail sales for the quarter were lower than a year ago, we continue to see weakness in both residential and
commercial sales. Industrial sales were also lower, even considering the continued growth for new and expansion
customers. This is consistent with our comments last quarter. Despite the lower sales volume, industrial revenue was up

excluding rate effects because of the demand components of the build and the new customers.
For the full year, we anticipate industrial growth to be in line with our original guidance assumption of approximately
2.9%. And we expect industrial growth to continue into next year at around the same level. Also contributing to the
UPO earnings increase was non-fuel O&M, which declined. Lower pension and other post-retirement benefit expenses
were the largest driver.
During the EWC's third quarter results, summarized on slide six, operational earnings were $0.19 in the current quarter
compared to $0.18 a year ago. Effects from 2015 impairments were partly offset by lower energy prices.
Decommissioning expense was also higher due to the establishment of decommissioning liabilities for Indian Point 3
and FitzPatrick as a result of our agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust and liabilities to Entergy.
Slide seven shows operating cash flow was once again around $1 billion, consistent with the same quarter last year.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on slide eight. As you can see, we are affirming our 2016 guidance for
consolidated operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS.
For the consolidated operational view, positive weather in the third quarter is being more than offset by lower EWC
revenue and higher decommissioning expense with the NYPA Trust Transfer transaction. We also expect a slightly
higher effective tax rate. Overall, we currently expect consolidated operational results will be within the bottom half of
the range.
For Utility, Parent & Other, we still expect adjusted earnings for the year at around the midpoint of our guidance range.
That said, there are a few things that we're keeping an eye on. As you know, we have the Waterford 3 steam generator
replacement project before the Louisiana Commission and that issue is not yet fully resolved. Grand Gulf is also in an
extended outage and we will continue to monitor this with potential implications.
On the positive side, we recognized that our non-fuel O&M is favorable to our plan through the third quarter. And we'll
continue to monitor our spending for opportunities in the fourth quarter. Just under two weeks at EEI, we will discuss
our strategy and longer-term views. However, I'd like to take a minute to talk about our financial outlooks starting with
Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS on slide nine.
At Analyst Day, we knew that we would have significant incremental spending to ensure the longer-term sustainability
of our nuclear plants. Since then, we have spent the last few months going through the process that Chris Bakken
outlined to help us understand the magnitude of the investment needed to position our fleet for sustained operational
excellence. The low interest rate environment and its effect on our pension and post-retirement benefit expenses was
also discussed at the Analyst Day.
More recently, residential and commercial sales have been lower than our expectations. And we now expect a lower
growth rate. Our goal is to fully mitigate these effects by identifying opportunities to operate our business more
efficiently, reprioritizing projects among the business functions and utilizing regulatory mechanisms available to us, as
needed. Considering all of this, we now expect our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings to be lower in 2017 and
2018. However, we are still on track for greater than 5% three-year growth based on the midpoints of our adjusted 2019
outlook versus our 2016 guidance.
Slide 10 illustrates the major changes from our original Utility, Parent & Other outlook to our current expectations.
Primary drivers for our changes are the aforementioned higher nuclear cost, lower pension discount rate, and lower
retail sales, which are expected to be about $0.75 in 2017. Partially offset by mitigations we've identified over the past
several months, which total about $0.25 in 2017 and increased net revenue from rate actions and other items, which
will help about $0.20 next year.
Regarding mitigations, we've worked hard over the past several months to identify opportunities. For example, on the
last call, we talked about interest expense reductions from economic refinancings. We've also issued new debt at rates
lower than we planned. In addition, we've identified O&M savings from various employee-led initiatives throughout
the company, driving improvements in sourcing, benefits, insurance, outage, operational and other costs over the next
few years. Our outlook now reflects recovery of our prudent spending, net of mitigations through our normal

ratemaking mechanisms.
On slide 11, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA outlook also reflects lower expectations. A summary of what's
changed is provided on slide 12. Like Utility, Parent & Other, net revenue and non-fuel O&M are the two key drivers
for the changes at EWC. Revenue estimates declined due to lower core prices and reduced volume from revised
assumptions on outages, including at Indian Point to more conservatively planned additional time for potential
replacement of [indiscernible] (26:18).
As noted on slide 13, we'll have additional details at the EEI Financial Conference where we will continue the
discussion of our business strategy, including our nuclear investments, longer-term outlooks and 2017 drivers. As has
been our practice, we anticipate that we will provide earnings guidance for 2017 and our detailed three-year capital
plan on our fourth quarter earnings call.
We realize that we've covered a lot of new information today. We've also included some information on our nuclear
investments and our preliminary three-year capital plan in the appendix of our webcast presentation. We'll be listening
to your questions today and over the next week and we'll provide information that you need to understand and analyze
these changes at EEI. We look forward to moving ahead with the strategies to create value for our owners, our
customers, our employees and the communities we serve.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Greg.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I am just wondering as we look at the magnitude of the rate actions that you think you're going to
be able to recover over the next several years associated with the increase in nuclear spending. How we think about the
prudence of those – that spend and the recovery? Can you explain to us what your benchmarking looks like in terms of
your current spending on those plants? And with the increase in spend then where that puts you relative to other nuclear
operations across the country and how you are going to show that those recoveries are necessary and prudent for
customers as opposed to being a function of some level of mismanagement historically that should be borne by the
shareholder?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Greg, that's a good question, because, as you know, customer bills, customer rates is an
extremely important factor in our business and something that we spend a lot of time trying to maintain. As you know,
we already have some of the lowest rates in the country, 20% to 25%, and below the national average. And as far as the
expenditures go, if they weren't prudent expenditures to make we wouldn't make them. Between our mitigation actions,
as well as other items that are rolling off like securitizations that I mentioned in this $50 million, $55 million in 2018,
we have roughly $1 billion of securitization bonds rolling out of the Louisiana jurisdictions and that in utilizing our
normal regulatory processes.
We do believe that all the prudently incurred expenditures will be recovered. And you also keep in mind here that when
we look at the jurisdictions that are most impacted by the nuclear spend, namely obviously Arkansas and Louisiana
where the plants reside, you put everything together, not just the spend that we've got, this addition here, but
everything. And, over the period that we're talking about we wouldn't expect the customer rates to increase by much
more than 1%, including everything so far less than the rate of inflation annually.

And so, the impact here we're trying to manage as much as we can. All of the expenditures will be prudently incurred.
We're putting all of our operations in line with what the industry is. As you know, every plant in the country is
different. But that's certainly something that we've kept in mind when we've outlined this plan in terms of amount, in
terms of timing, in terms of what we need to do to balance the equation, not only for the operational side of things, but
for our customers. And, again, we would envision we come out of the back side of this. By the time we get to 2019,
we'd be still having some of the most competitive rates in the country.

EWC net of the reduction in EBITDA as a function of the increased operating costs, but also the increased CapEx, am I
right that it looks like you're actually cash flow negative over the next several years at EWC or are there some – is there
some mitigation happening here that will allow you to maintain sort of at least the neutral value proposition there as
you unwind that business?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Hey, Greg. This is Drew. And we haven't ever discussed kind of specifically, but you can do
the math, like we can. And so, as Leo mentioned in his remarks, we continue to remain vigilant and disciplined on our
approach to reducing the footprint in that business. And so I think that you could count on us to continue to maintain
that posture.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: But to the extent that the business is cash flow negative, how would you fund that?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: To the extent that it is in any given period, it's going to be mostly from the parent. And, as
you look at this overall forecast, including the changes at EWC, the incremental investment at Utility, we have a parent
debt level that could go up about 150 basis points from where we were originally targeting it. So we would – which is
slightly above our target range. Our target range is 18% to 20%. And we were talking about a forecast that got us
around the neighborhood of 21% that we were working on. Obviously, this adds, as I said, maybe another 150 basis
points to that. And so that's not going in the right direction and that's if we finance everything with parent debt. And so
we're thinking about other options around how do we manage it starting with the business itself and can we continue to
find ways to be more efficient.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Greg.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just again on the mitigating rate actions that Greg was asking about, can you give us a
little bit of a sense of where the trajectory there is coming from, which jurisdictions, which kinds, which is formula,
which will be actual rate cases, just so we can get a sense of what we should be tracking to see that offset come in?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I'll start and then Theo can follow up, Greg, or Jonathon, sorry about that. We're not
planning on using any special regulatory mechanisms at this point in time. Everything would just flow through the
normal mechanisms. So, for example, Arkansas would flow through the FRP, Louisiana'd flow through the FRP in the
near-term, but we do have some reset capability by the time we get out to 2019. Those are the major implications in
terms of where the plants reside.

And, again, from a – you asked about the trajectory and if you look at the plan as we've laid it out now and not just that
spend, but everything together in those jurisdictions, we're talking about a trajectory of about – that we wouldn't expect
to be more than 1% a year from a rate standpoint. And remember, it's not only our mitigating actions that Drew
outlined that are on the slides on your deck, things like the securitizations, rolling off the load growth that we have, the
continuation of the investments that we're making.
As I outlined all those investments related to the new power plant, et cetera, we envisioned that those are going to
provide production cost benefits, as they're more efficient, et cetera. So, all that kind of works together to keep that
trajectory still in line with one of the best in the industry. I don't know if, Theo, if you want to add to that.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. Jonathon, this is Theo. Just a couple of other points. The other plant, clearly what
we're making investment is Grand Gulf which is owned by SERI, [ph] life unit PPA, about two fully (35:20) operating
companies. That plant is subject to FERC formula rates cost of service base rates. Also, in Louisiana, just additional
clarification, we've got a opportunity for FRP reset in the 2018 timeframe. And we would expect that reset to occur
such that rate changes would happen within the 2018 calendar year. So you'd see a full impact of that in 2019.
Also, in Arkansas, the forward-looking test, the FRP with the forward-looking feature also has a true-up mechanism
associated with it. So if in fact our forecasted test year is different than actuals, we have the opportunity to come back
and implement rate changes to true that up to the actual cost within the context of that particular test year.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Great. Thank you. And then might I just ask on the mitigation sort of expense line
where you have it at $0.25 already in 2017 and then sort of holding more or less at that level through the period, how
much of that have you sort of already identified and/or implemented?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Hi. This is Drew. And pretty much all of it we've already identified and implemented. So a
lot of that – $0.10 of the $0.25 this year or in 2017 would be associated with interest expense. And so, that all the
financings that we've done this year would contribute to that. And then, after that, the other $0.15 are various elements
from the long laundry list of things that I read off that have already been put into place.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Great. Thank you. And then could I just follow up. You made some comments about
dividend growth and talked about giving us more of an update at EEI. Last year, I think, you had a dividend increase
right at the end of October. You're coming up to the – can you give us some thoughts about how does this sort of
dampening of the trajectory in the short term kind of feed into your thinking around dividends? And obviously it seems
to be the timing of the year where you last raised it?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: That's another good question, Jonathan. Obviously, the dividend is a board of directors'
decision that they'll make in due course. You're right on timing. Traditionally the fall is when we make that
determination. As far as what this has done to our trajectory, again, the earnings trajectory here through 2019 is pretty
similar to where we were before. It's the same number by 2019. We still see growth in 2017 and 2018.
So while obviously it's a consideration through our mitigating actions, the rate levels that we have, the regulatory
constructs that we have and the work of a lot of really talented people here at Entergy, we still see the growth outlook
that we've been on for that Utility, Parent & Other earnings that supports the dividend growth. So our objective to
continue to grow the dividend is still out there. It's still something that we take very seriously. Steady predictable
growth in earnings and the dividend that's our objective.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Thank you, Leo.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: I wanted to focus on slide 10 and the revised retail sales growth. Could you just layout
what's your revised growth rate is and what the sensitivity is? You have a appendix slide that shows the sensitivity
near-term so 1% change. I just wanted to confirm sort of sensitivity to changes in low growth assumptions in the
out-years.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. This is Drew. So you're referencing the slide in the back. Is there anything in
particular, Stephen, that you wanted to discuss on that sensitivity slide? I think that's slide 42.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Sure. Yeah. I guess, so on slide 10, what's the revised retail sales growth percentage for
residential and commercial and what was the 1% movement in that assumption to? I think the appendix would imply a
$0.11 for commercial and residential commodity. I just wanted to confirm that.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. I think that's still fairly correct, Stephen. So we saw two quarters or three quarters of
this year were down about 0.06% versus a 1% or so, just below 1% expectation for this year. And so we have a
different starting point going into next year than what we're anticipating. That's the first thing. And then the second
thing is the growth rate going forward. And we've brought that down, as I mentioned in my remarks. But I think it
would be probably closer to about 0.5% rather than almost 1%.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Understood. And then just shifting gears to the sale of nuclear assets to Exelon. I
know there were several conditions that were listed in the release in terms of approval by federal and state agencies.
There was recently a lawsuit filed in court opposing the credits provided in New York. In the event that in court the
credits were overturned, what would be the impact to the sale of those assets?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Stephen, it really depends on the timing of the court actions. So our point of view is that that is
unique and that it places a value on the carbon-free attribute of the units. So we feel pretty strongly that we will survive
that legal challenge, but it really would depend at what point in the transaction that occurred. So, right now, we're
anticipating approval by the PSC on November 17, approval of the NYSERDA contracts November 23, and then NRC
approvals to follow and closing of the transaction in the second quarter of next year.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. And if the actuarial return to floor second quarter of next year, would that trigger
a cancellation of the transaction?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, certainly, it could be a consideration there and then it really depends on who has taken
responsibility for that. And so the contract has some commercial terms which deal with that specific issue. So, it really
becomes more of an issue of can you close and then who has liability for the investments and the refueling, et cetera.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys. Couple easy ones. First, does your Utility, Parent & Other guidance incorporate
any external equity or equity like security issuances over the next few years?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: It is true, Michael. It does not incorporate anything like that.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Second, on the EWC side, when you look at Palisades and Indian Point and kind of the
guidance of increased cost, how do these plants look from a cost structure relative to what you would consider their
benchmark peers?
<A - A. Christopher Bakken>: This is Chris Bakken. The Indian Point cost structure is reflective of the marketed
operation, which is the high labor cost. But the product spending, we believe, is appropriate for the remaining life of the

plant. In terms of Palisades, I would say, it's consistent with the industry. And, again, we're making prudent investment
in the plants given the remaining lifecycle of the plant.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Last thing, back to the regulated side, can you put some numbers around the size and
scale of the AMI program filings in Arkansas and New Orleans? And how should we think about what kind of size and
scale through 2019 or 2020 or so you anticipate in some of the other jurisdictions?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah, Michael. This is Theo. I don't have the specific numbers in front of me in terms of
Arkansas versus New Orleans. I know when we talked about this initially we've talked about on a system basis, the
investment being $900 million or so when we think about it as it relates to, again, the entire system. In terms of timing,
as you can see, as you go through the filings, you will see that there was some costs we are asking to defer that will get
fully incurred prior to the full optionality of the meters themselves. And we believe that's consistent with the matching
of that cost with the benefits that you will see that are going to be implemented as a result of the implementation of the
meters themselves.
There is also, I think, as you recognize, as Drew mentioned, some asset investments that's made in advance of either
deployment basically to develop the backbone to support the meter deployment. And our view is that asset investment
is consistent with what we've seen from kind of a timing perspective and the necessity to get it in place in order to
allow the efficient use of the meters themselves once they are fully deployed and to recognize the full benefits of it.
We also believe that infrastructure which you spoke for other – a lot of other systems as well. I think our perspective is
the cost is consistent with what we've seen in implementations across the country and it would be supported and
supported well with the benefits that Leo mentioned as we think about implementation overall. I'd have to get the
specificity for you in terms of years, but we don't view that investment to be a significant investment and risk in
advance of the meter deployment.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Hey, Mike. I'll just add. I think in the forecast period, the $900 million that Theo was
discussing, it's a couple hundred million in the forecast period. Most of it's beyond 2019 when the significant portion of
the meter deployment really kicks in.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Drew. Much appreciated.

Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Thank you so much. Hey, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Hey, Praful.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Hi. So, first question is more strategic which is there seems to be a lot of defense right now
which is both on EWC, where the focus is just to kind of reduce the size. And even on the Utility side, things like retail
sales growth isn't coming out where you guys expected. So, I'm trying to figure out from offense perspective or future
growth, how are you looking at what are the dimensions that you can kind of push and grow going forward coming out
from the defensive kind of view right now?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah. We don't view ourselves in a defensive view at all, Praful. So, we're on offense here. We
had a significant amount of investment that I outlined that goes into the generation of transmission footprint of our
regulated utility. That has not changed. I mean we continue to make those modernizing investments. That lower
production cost provides significant benefits to our customers, improve the reliability, reduce our environmental
footprint, which is continuing to grow service territory, particularly as it relates to what we see on the industrial side, all

while we maintain some of the lowest rates in the country.
In addition to that, what we just – in response to the question from Michael around AMI, AMI is the first step. We've
just now started to make regulatory filings. But, first, we'll get the back-office and the backbone of the systems and
make it smart. We don't want to deploy the meters until they will actually have something to do for us. So, we're
putting all of that in place in advance of actually beginning to deploy the meters in 2019. There are other technologies
that we will deploy on the system then that we're looking at today in terms of asset management technologies and other
things that will go from that point and forward. That will provide even greater benefits, savings, helping us to manage
the load for our customers and provide that immediate investment that will provide us earnings opportunity, but at the
same point in time it will help customers manage their bills through the ability to manage how much they use, when
they use it, et cetera.
So, that, for us, is again total offense and extremely exciting for us as we look to the future. When we look at EWC, our
objective has not changed. It's always been to separate that business from the Utility. And we continue to execute on
that. We sold wind assets or are in the process of selling those. We sold the [indiscernible] (49:31) plant last year. We
made decisions unfortunate as they are, to shut down – Pilgrim shutdown Vermont Yankee. And we're going to
continue on that path albeit with a different price deck that we see continues to erode. But we're still working as
diligently as we can. And I think the proof of that is in our discipline around first making the decision at FitzPatrick to
seize operations there, but at the same time never giving up and never wavering from the idea that we might come up
with something better that resulted in the creation of the working with Exelon in the state to come up with the sale of
that plant, the continuation of its economic benefit and its reliability benefit in the state of New York and certainly to
our employees in the community.
That, for us, isn't defense at all. It's all offence. Like everyone else, we're in the merchant market and gas prices have
been low, particularly in the Northeast. And we've got to manage around that. But it doesn't change what we're doing or
how hard we're working or what we think we can accomplish there. And we've accomplished a lot. And we would
anticipate over the course of the next couple years we'll continue to accomplish a lot. So, all that said, we're pretty
excited about what we have the opportunity to accomplish here. And, again, just going through all that we just talked
about with the sustainability of the nuclear fleet, the investment in AMI, the investment in the generation business, the
investment in transmission, going through the normal regulatory constructs that we have today and still maintaining our
2019 outlook, sounds like offense to me. But strategically that's where we're headed, the same place we were headed
before. And we just updated some of the information for you. That's all.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. Fair enough, Leo. Thank you. And on slide 16, just a more detailed question. With the
increased CapEx around EWC, you also made the point about your remaining useful life of – consider remaining useful
life of assets. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about remaining useful life for both Indian Point and
Palisades. Is there any change in view? Obviously I understand the relicensing. But, apart from that, is there any change
in view around that, given the CapEx spend?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: There is not a change in view around that, Praful, other than what we always do is we continue
to evaluate those facilities. But, right now, there is no change in point of view around those plants. Palisades, we've got
the contract through 2022 and then we've got the ability to see where we think the MISO market goes. At that point in
time – and Indian Point continues to be a very, very valuable asset. I think the ISO just came out with their study
showing that it was required for reliability in the region. So it continues to be needed in that region. So there is really
no change in outlook for those assets at this point. That said, we continue to be disciplined in how we look at these on a
regular basis. And we'll look at them – we're always refining our point of view about them. That's all.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Fair enough. Thank you, Leo.

<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: I wanted to go back to an earlier question about the court challenge to the Zero-Emissions
Credits proposal. If that challenge is successful and the court overturns, I think you made reference to it's possible
under certain conditions that it might impact the sale. Did you mean that to say that those conditions are spelled out and
there is one party who might be at fault at that? Can you just give a little bit more clarity on what exactly you meant?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's difficult to predict what the impacts of it could be without understanding kind of what
the specific ruling is. But we have put terms in the commercial agreement that try to separate those risks. I really can't
tell you what the eventual outcome of that would be. I mean, typically, we don't discuss litigation, especially future
litigation, but we have tried to address and mitigate those risks in our sale agreement with Exelon.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Got it. Right. That's all I -
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Brian, one thing that I'll add to is the way we're working through this process, we're going
down the parallel path. We're confident that we'll close the transaction, that we'll get to the end game. But certainly the
way it's structured, worst case for us, we'd get back to the position we were in beforehand, and that is we have to make
the decision to shut down the plant around the same time we were planning on it.

And our last question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Your line is now open.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Just I have a simple question – hey, Leo. Could you just be clear kind of what is not working
right in the nuclear program right now that you are spending so much money?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: The first and foremost the plants are safe, Steve, or we wouldn't run them. I'd say that the
challenges that we face stem from a desire to run a lean operation and that lean operation to benefit our customers and
getting the right balance between operational excellence and the cost structure. What we've found – obviously we've
had a couple of situations with plants going into Column 4. What we've found is that we potentially can get the
balances right as we want. And so to get ourselves up to the standards that we hold ourselves to and to the standards of
the industry, we've got to change our strategy around how we operate the plants.
As you know, we made organizational changes last year, six months ago, that we brought Chris in and Chris has been
responsible for developing what that strategy is. We've changed not only who it is, but where he reports, where – he
used to report into the COO and now reports in directly to me. And so Chris and his team, along with his discussions
with people in the industry and with our regulators, et cetera, has devised this change in strategy to get ourselves up to
where we need to be to meet our own standards and the operational excellence standards of the industry.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: And will there be some filing at the NRC that kind of goes through the kind of the full plan or
is it going to be like plant-by-plant?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: No, no. There's no filing. We're just – the only filings would be when we include these in our
retail regulatory – these costs just like the cost of the new CCGTs and CTs and AMIs. These plans are vital to the
reliability of the system. They provide over 30% of the energy used on our system. They are large baseload,

zero-emitting resource that's very valuable. They're anchors to the community in terms of the tax base and jobs and
community support.
So, these are very vital assets. They limit fuel volatility when you look at what could and has happened in the natural
gas markets and the reliance on natural gas of us and others. So, they're very, very vital. They fit right in with the
strategy that we've got everywhere else, whether it's investing in CCGTs at reduced production cost and improve air
emissions or whether it's looking at something in the gas and ground kind of investment that would limit fuel volatility.
So, these assets fit right into our strategy, right into the need for our communities or customers. And we just, again,
have to kind of change the strategy from that lean operations into one more focused a little bit more on the operational
excellence side of it. And then we'll get right back on track. And, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're not going to use
any special regulatory mechanisms in those special filings with the NRC; it's just us working through this process and
getting it right.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: And is this spending – I mean, part of that it sounds like higher ongoing spending. Part of this
next three years – is there a way to split out between spending to kind of fix the program where you want it to be versus
spending that's just ongoing higher levels?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: No, I think that -
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Is it ongoing higher levels?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: The way to look at it – and obviously you've got to remember too, Steve, capital dollars are
lumpy in these big plants and things like that. But the way we're looking at is what does it take to run these plants? And
Chris's task has been to put together a plan of what does it take to run the plants on all in basis and so we're doing that.
Certainly getting ourselves out of Column 4 and things like that are going to be important and those are costs that will
go away. But for the most part, all of it, we've tasked them to do was come up with beyond any capital plan required to
put us in the operational excellence category that we want to be.
And this is it and we've included it all in the plan. We're going to use the regular regulatory mechanisms to recover it.
And, as we mentioned earlier, between our mitigating actions, between those things that are happening in the company
like the securitization roll-offs through low growth that we have and investments that we're making, that lower cost, the
impact on our customers is going to be minimized as much as it can.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: And just one last thing. Grand Gulf, can you just talk about what the outage is related to?
<A - A. Christopher Bakken>: This is Chris again. First and foremost, I would stress the Grand Gulf was and is safe
to operate. However, reflecting on some of our equipment and human performance over the last several months that
didn't meet our standards of excellence, we've taken a decision to take the unit out of service, systematically understand
the performance shortfalls of excellence. We have training programs and some maintenance plans to correct that. It's
well understood and we're in the process now of working through those issues and expect to have unit back in service
early part of the next year.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.
