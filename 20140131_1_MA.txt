This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor
Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. The earnings release includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures
to their GAAP equivalents. The release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC
earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through February 7.
All of the EPS figures in our press release and those discussed on today's call are presented on a post-split basis,
consistent with the SEC's reporting requirements following are ten-for-one stock split that was effective at market open
on January 22. In order to provide a bridge for you between the pre-split and post-split EPS figures, we have added a
page in the Appendix section of the slide deck that breaks out the 2013 EPS by quarter and full year as well as the 2012
figures recalculated on a pro forma basis.
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include
some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially
from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are
summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. So we're very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results in
2013. Those results basically were in line with our expectations. Our net revenue growth was 13%, both as reported and
adjusted for FX. It was driven by solid operational performance in process transactions, in gross dollar volume and
cross-border volume growth. And we were able to deliver some margin growth in spite of investing more back into the
business.
For the full-year 2013, excluding special items, we saw net income growth of 15% or 14% adjusted for currency and
reported EPS growth of 19%, or 18% on an FX adjusted basis. And looking at the fourth quarter, we came in about
where we thought we would, even after signing more agreements than we had anticipated, some of which I will talk
about in a moment as well as putting some money and investing some money back into the business. But I'll let Martina
get into the quarterly financial details a little later.
So let's go to the global economic trends, starting with the United States, where it feels like the economy is beginning
to show a bit of forward momentum. Our SpendingPulse data showed that U.S. retail sales growth ex auto for the
fourth quarter was 3.9%, and that includes the fact that holiday retail sales grew faster than last year, with particular
strength in the E&M commerce space.
Economic indicators, such as housing and employment, also showed some improvement during the quarter and
consumer confidence bounced back from what was the low of October. We saw an increase in our United States
business in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 7%, driven by improvements in consumer credit and in debit.
In Europe, overall economic growth in the fourth quarter remained subdued, although there are some indicators of a
potential recovery. Consumer sentiment continued to slow, but very steady climb, as did business sentiment across our
major markets. Northern Europe continues on a solid footing. Southern Europe is moving up although it's coming off a
lower base. Key contributors to our 14% fourth quarter volume growth in the region were Russia, Sweden, the Ukraine
and Poland.
In Asia-Pacific, consumer and business sentiment levels declined in the fourth quarter across major markets, including
Australia. In addition, worries about slowing growth in China go beyond being just a domestic issue and have broader
implications, as you all know, for other markets that depend on Chinese demand.
In Latin America, economic growth slowed during the fourth quarter with consumer confidence declining in both
Brazil and Mexico, but across the rest of the region is fairly positive. So despite these sluggish economic indicators in
both regions, our Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa GDV growth was 20% and our Latin America growth was 17% in

GDV with transaction growth in the high 20s and the high teens all for – sorry, high 20s for Asia Pacific, Middle East
Africa, high teens for Latin America, all relatively similar to previous quarters.
The factors that a significant proportion of our growth in emerging markets comes from the secular shift to electronic
payments, which I think is relatively uncorrelated to some of the economic cycles that we see the emerging markets
currently going through.
Overall, it feels like the U.S. and Western Europe, markets where we generate well over half of our revenue, are slowly
starting to regain their economic footing. The general consensus is that Europe should have a decent economic growth
in 2014 and there is increasing optimism about Europe. As these developed markets recover, it could be a catalyst to
start further growth in Asia and Latin America.
So now before moving on to the business highlights, let me say a few words on the legal and regulatory front. In
December, as you know, Judge Gleeson issued final approval of the U.S. merchant litigation settlement. We anticipate
that most of the larger merchants who opted out will initiate separate actions and based on that analysis, we have taken
a $95 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter. The cases filed to date are in the early stages but most have been
consolidated under Judge Gleeson's court.
Also in mid-January, both the Federal Reserve and the merchant plaintiffs presented oral arguments to the appeals court
in response to Judge Leon's January decision on the Fed regulation around implementing the Durbin Amendment. The
appeals court will likely issue a ruling sometime in 2014.
And with regards to the proposed European legislation, you've probably all seen the amendments to the EC's initial
proposal. But you should know that there are also more than 300 amendments submitted from other members of
Parliament, so the process is quite complicated. A committee of Parliament will now deliberate and vote on all of this
in late February and a vote by the full Parliament is currently scheduled for April.
Also in late February, the Council of Ministers is expected to start a separate parallel review of the legislation. So we
kind of continue to believe that the timeline for final adoption appears ambitious. And, obviously, we are watching that
situation very closely on the ground.
We were disappointed to learn yesterday that the Advocate General in Luxembourg issued an opinion siding against
our appeal of the European Commission's 2007 decision regarding our intra-Europe cross-border interchange rates. The
court now has to rule and we'll find out what they say at some point this year. But keep in mind that we had already
modified these interchange rates to 20 and 30 basis points for debit and credit, respectively, in mid-2009. So in effect,
this changes very, very little in that space for either the banks or the merchants or us as of today.
So now let me move on to some of our recent business activity. As I mentioned, we finished the year signing even more
deals than we anticipated, which is good. It sets us up well for future growth. So let me just sort of call out a few of
these that I personally found interesting. So, first, we were very pleased to be able to continue and, in fact, enhance our
partnership with Citi on the American Airlines portfolio. That's an important gold mine for both of us. As you know,
American Airlines is now the world's largest airline after this recent merger.
Second, we recently completed a new agreement with Chase for their U.S. commercial card portfolio providing
corporate, purchasing, and fleet cards for their customers across many industry sectors and these customers range from
mid-sized companies all the way up through large multinational corporations.
In December, we also renewed our agreement with Bank of Montréal, which for us was a very important partner in
Canada and the United States and, in fact, in the U.S., we expanded our relationship to include consumer credit.
And we also recently extended our agreement with Tesco Bank and, as you know, Tesco Bank is a part of the third
largest retailer in the world, for their U.K. consumer credit card portfolio. That's a very good partnership for us with
lots of future scope for expansion.
And finally, capping off a year of advancements in Africa, from a 13 million identity card pilot being launched in
Nigeria that we've talked about to the Nedbank conversion in South Africa, we have now recently signed an agreement

with Ecobank. Ecobank is the largest Pan-African bank. It has a presence in 23 countries in Africa reaching 65% of
Africa's population. The bank will now issue our debit, credit, prepaid, and other payment solutions and also allows us
to expand our acceptance in these markets.
Meanwhile, momentum around MasterPass continues. And by the end of last year of 2013, we are now live in five
markets with actually many more in the pipeline. You probably saw our U.S. advertising campaign with J. Crew and
MasterPass over the holidays, but we also had a number of other major global retailers agree to accept MasterPass,
including Brooks Brothers, [ph] Always (11:08), Live Nation, Ticketmaster, Singapore Airlines. That brings the total
number of merchants to more than 50,000, with most of them already live.
We're continuing to add new banking partners around the world as well, including UniCredit in Italy, the three largest
banks in Sweden – SEB, Swedbank and Nordea, and Caixa in Brazil, and this adds on to the ones we signed up in
previous quarters. So that's it regarding MasterPass.
Now another big area of focus for us is processing and that goes beyond our traditional role of switching transactions
but it also includes swipe processing services on either side of that switch to surround the transaction. As some of you
heard from Gary Flood at Investor Day back in September, the more transactions we touch, the bigger our ability to
deliver a wide range of services and generate additional revenue. That single transaction, even if we don't switch it, can
be very valuable to us.
So let me give you a flavor on a few recent initiatives in this area. We have not completed our acquisition of Provus, a
provider of issuer and acquirer processing, prepaid solution and ATM processing services in Turkey. That's going to
enable us to increase our processing presence in the high-growth markets in the European region. TREVICA, our issuer
and acquirer processor in Poland, will provide processing services for one of the largest retailers in Portugal. In the first
half of this year, that retailer is expected to roll out a new store card that will be able to accommodate credit, prepaid,
private label, and installment payments.
And we recently announced a partnership with BICS, a Belgian telecom company, and eServGlobal, a mobile money
solutions provider. We have formed a joint venture that will enable their HomeSend platform to connect to any
financial institution across the MasterCard network. That service we already offer in 50 countries with mobile network
and money transfer operators, and, as we build our B2B initiatives, this joint venture along with our relationship with
Western Union gives consumers more places to send money both domestically and internationally.
And finally, before I hand this over to Martina, let me talk about the topic of safety and security of payments, which
has received a great deal of attention given all that's happened in the recent past on data breaches. In last quarter's call,
we discussed safety and security in some depth. The fact is this is fundamental to everything we do and it's what
consumers expect and what they deserve.
In the United States, migration to EMV is a necessary and critical step. It makes stealing data much more difficult, and
also, it makes stolen data less valuable to a fraudster. That's why we announced two years ago our plan for the U.S.
migration from magstripe to chip technology starting October 2014.
Earlier this month, we reiterated that we are holding firm to that date because we believe it's the right thing to do.
Beyond the zero-liability protection, for which our rules already provide, consumers should not be at risk of having
their personal information stolen and face enormous inconveniences and distress as a result.
While EMV works to protect in the physical space, we also do need to make sure that we're ahead of this issue in the
digital space, and that is why we announced tokenization standards with all our other partners back in October. What
we would now like to see is that all players within the payments ecosystem come together with a sense of urgency to
ensure that the highest payment security standards are put into place. This is not easy, but it's key to doing the right
thing and sustaining consumer confidence and trust.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics.

Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As Ajay already said, we are very pleased with our 2013 performance of
13% net revenue growth. EPS growth was 21% adjusted for foreign exchange and normalized for discrete tax benefits
in 2012, which is consistent with the calculation of our long-term EPS performance target. I will now focus on the
details of the fourth quarter results, excluding the $95 million pre-tax charge that we took this quarter related to the
opt-out in the U.S. merchant litigation.
Let me begin on page 3 of our slide deck, and here you see the differences between as-reported and FX-adjusted
growth rates for this quarter, ranging from 0% to 2% for each line item, and all of my comments today will pertain to
the FX-adjusted growth rates. So net revenue grew 11%, driven by strong underlying operational metrics but primarily
offset by an increase in rebates and incentives as a result of signing a significant number of agreements in the quarter.
Based on our net revenue and operating expense growth, net income increased by 11%.
EPS growth was 16%, benefiting from our share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 9.8
million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $750 million. Quarter-to-date through Friday an
additional 4.2 million shares were repurchased at a cost of approximately $350 million, with $3.3 billion remaining
under our current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis. And cash flow
from operations was $1.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of
$6.3 billion.
Now let's turn to page 4, and here you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar
volume or GDV was up 14% on a local currency basis to over $1.1 trillion. U.S. GDV grew 7% with credit volumes
growing 6%. U.S. Commercial credit growth was in the low teens, down from last quarter. U.S. consumer credit
growth of over 3% was about the same level as what we saw last quarter. And our U.S. Debit growth was 9%, driven
by solid growth across our consumer and commercial debit and prepaid programs.
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 17% on a local currency basis, and this continues to be driven by Asia
Pacific, Middle East and Africa with 20% growth and mid-to high teens growth in both Europe and Latin America.
Fourth quarter volume grew 18% on a local currency basis, including more than 20% in Latin America and Asia
Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and growth in the mid-teens in Europe.
Let's turn to page 5. Here you can see processed transactions growing 13% globally to more than $10.4 billion. We saw
double-digit growth in most regions around the world, with particular strength in our Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa
region, driven by Australia and South Africa, and compared to last quarter this growth rate was down slightly.
However, when normalizing for the number of processing days, processed transaction growth for the fourth quarter was
similar to what we saw in the third quarter. Globally, the number of cards grew 9% to almost 2 billion MasterCard and
Maestro-branded cards.
Now let's turn to page 6 for some insights on our revenue. We're very pleased with the 15% growth in gross revenues,
which was in line with our expectations and driven by increased volume and transactions along with some contribution
from pricing. In addition, beyond the two functional currencies that we adjust for, revenues were slightly impacted by
the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the euro versus other currencies. However, net revenue growth of 11% came in
a bit lower than expected as a result of signing more deals in the quarter, which Ajay already called out. So the rebates
and incentives line increased by 23%, but we view this as a good thing for long-term revenue growth.
Growth in domestic assessments continues to be driven primarily by stronger volume growth outside of the United
States, much of which comes at a lower yield. And one last note on revenue. Excluding pricing, fourth quarter revenue
growth was 12%. The resulting gap between cross-border volume and revenue growth continued to be mainly due to
the higher mix of intra-Europe activity.
Moving onto page 7. You can see that total operating expenses were up 11% in the quarter, as we took the opportunity
to reinvest more back into the business, similar to what we did actually in the third quarter. First, the 12% increase in
G&A expenses continues to be primarily driven by investments related to all aspects of our growth strategy, including

initiatives such as MasterPass and tokenization.
Part of our investment was in people, and we ended 2013 with approximately 8,200 full-time employees, up 9% from
year-end 2012. But what's more interesting is that the people that we've been hiring for the last couple of years are
coming from sectors such as technology, retail, consumer goods, and government, which have been helping us to
execute in these areas.
Second, advertising and marketing was up by 8%, mainly due to higher customer marketing support and media spend.
And while not on these slides, I would like to note that the other income expense line was $9 million negative, i.e., it
was an expense, in line with our expectations and primarily due to a number of our joint ventures such as the two with
Telefónica. As we ramp up these initiatives, you can expect this line to continue to be negative.
Let me now turn to slide 8, and here we discuss first what we have seen in January through this past Tuesday. Each of
our business drivers were flat or slightly higher in the period compared to the fourth quarter. So the numbers through
January 28 are as follows. Globally, our cross-border volumes grew about 18%, and that's about equal to our fourth
quarter growth rate. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 9%, about 1 percentage point up from what we saw last
quarter due to improvement in consumer credit.
Processed volume growth outside of the U.S. grew 17%, and that's also a slight increase over the fourth quarter. In
particular, our European processed volume growth was in the teens, a continuation of the growth rate that we saw
throughout 2013. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, and that was also up about 1 percentage points over
what we saw as a growth rate in the fourth quarter, driven by higher growth in the U.S. and in Europe.
Looking forward, let me first start with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period. We remain
confident that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR, which includes a modest contribution from
pricing over the three-year period and an at least 20% EPS CAGR. These growth rates are on a constant currency basis
and exclude new M&A activities. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%.
So just one other comment about our EPS CAGR objective, which we said was based on a normalized tax rate that
excluded the impact of several one-time benefits that we were able to achieve in 2012, which you will recall resulted in
a pro forma EPS number of $21.44. But after adjusting for our recent stock split, you should now be modeling EPS
growth beyond 2012 using a base of $2.14.
So now I'd like to share with you some thoughts about 2014. With respect to net revenue, we have signed, as you just
heard, a significant numbers of deals over the last couple of years, and as the new deals onboard, they will provide a
tailwind for 2014. However, we are also expecting a headwind from one portfolio conversion to a competitor. As you
all know, back in 2012, we lost our portion of Chase's consumer credit portfolio and while we expected some attrition
would occur in 2013, that did not happen.
We don't have any specifics on how these cards will migrate, but we are now assuming an impact in 2014. Given the
size of this portfolio, we can offset some but not all of this attrition with our wins, and thus we expect net revenue
growth for 2014 to come in at the lower end of our three-year range. We also expect to return to more normal growth
rates in rebates and incentives in the second and third quarter this year, versus what we saw in 2013.
We anticipate totaled 2014 operating expenses to grow less than the 9% that we saw in 2013. As we have always said,
any upside to top line growth may provide the opportunity to reinvest more back into the business as well as determine
how much, if any, operating margin expansion we can deliver in 2014.
As I've just mentioned, the impact of new M&A activities is not reflected in our long-term performance objectives. At
Investor Day last September, I talked about how we are looking more actively at potential M&A opportunities that
address our strategic priorities and provide us with critical capabilities.
We're pleased that we recently completed the Provus and HomeSend deals, both investments that add to our
capabilities, and they will contribute some revenue, but together with the base expenses in our integration work, we
expect to see $0.01 to $0.02 dilution to our 2014 earnings per share figure. We will continue to update you as we go
forward on these numbers as well as on the impact of any additional M&A activities we may have.

For your modeling purposes, you should assume a full-year tax year rate of about 32%, which does not recognize the
impact of any discrete items such as what we've seen in the recent past.
Finally, with respect to foreign exchange, if rates remain similar to where they are today, that is, the euro trading at
about the $1.35 level and the Brazilian real at about the BRL 2.42 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the
euro and the real would essentially offset each other for full-year 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange
had a slight impact on our fourth quarter beyond adjusting for these two functional currencies that we typically call out.
Given the current volatility in the FX markets, especially with a depreciating U.S. dollar and euro versus other
currencies, we are carefully managing those exposures but we could see some impact depending on how these
currencies behave in 2014.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin our Q&A session. Barbara?
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. In order to get as many people as
possible the opportunity to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for
additional questions. Clifford?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel. You may go ahead.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you give us a little color on the progression in 2014
of the cross-border price increase? I think you mentioned still about 1,000 basis points of benefit on your cross-border
revenue growth. When does that start to anniversary and is there any limiting impact from additional pricing increases
on your cross-border revenue growth? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So, Chris, we put the cross-border acquiring price increase in place in April of 2013, so
you would see that basically anniversary at the end of the first quarter of 2014.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Any additional pricing actions that could mitigate that?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: No. I said, as part of our long-term objectives, we will only see some modest pricing,
so this is still a big one that is basically going to anniversary.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Thanks so much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA. You may go ahead.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. The advertising and marketing, could you just provide some
additional color on what drove that number up in the fourth quarter, what opportunities you saw? And does the Chase
deal include the same kind of network separation as you're seeing from Visa? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Hi, Craig. It's Ajay. I'm not sure I understood the second part, you're talking about
Chase, our commercial deal, and that's just a regular deal like we would do with any other institution in our commercial
business, so that's how that's done.

The part about advertising and marketing, actually, the fourth quarter is when the maximum transactions occur across
most parts of the world, and we've been trying for some time to get our advertising and marketing to fit and match the
right time periods for when it should be correlated to our transaction spend and it kind of depends how it works. In
some cases, you get the right opportunities; in others, you don't.
In this particular one, we had a great deal of opportunity around the end of the year to sign up a few things to
participate in activities in social media and physical media around the New Year in different places to give us a chance
to put ourselves back into people's eyes and minds at the right time of the year. That's kind of what that is about. So it
wasn't out of normal. If you look at our fourth quarter spend on advertising and marketing, we should be spending this
kind of money to correlate back to the kind of revenues and transactions that happen in the fourth quarter, gross
revenues.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Let me just add a comment for 2014 because I'm sure everyone of you would like to
know a little bit about the cadence of our A&M spend, and the cadence will be relatively similar to what you saw in
2013. The only thing that we're trying to do, and Ajay already referenced that, is maybe smooth out a little bit the first
and the second quarter. So you might see a little bit more in the first quarter, and we're talking just a bit more, taking it
out of the fourth quarter. The second and the third quarter should be, from a cadence point of view, very similar.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. You may go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Hey. Thanks, guys. So can we just get a little bit color and clarity on the full year 2014
rebates? I mean do you think they'll be – will they grow faster, slower or about in line versus gross revs? And do you
guys think you can grow U.S. consumer credit in 2014 with the Chase volumes coming off that you mentioned?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: First of all, with your last question, we are obviously growing credit because,
otherwise, we wouldn't be able to offset some of the losses that we might see from the Chase before here in 2014,
right? That was in my prepared remarks. What was your first question?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Rebates and incentives.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Rebates and incentives. So let me just tell you, rebates and incentives, we think that it's
– from a cadence point of view, it's going to grow back much more normal to what we have seen prior to 2013, right?
So in the second quarter and then the third quarter, you see normalized growth rates. It's very tough for us to be telling
you what you should be thinking about as a percentage of gross revenues, but I would – when I look forward, I would
look at something not too different to what you saw in 2013, which would also suggest that overall the annual growth
rate is not too different for 2014.

<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks. Good morning. In Europe, you guys are significantly outperforming one of your key
competitors, who's still operating under an association structure, and it seems like you're able to offer much greater
value to both banks and merchants given your much more innovative offerings. Can you talk a little bit about your
confidence in your outlook for market share gains in Europe, and perhaps just give us some color around,
competitively, how you feel you're positioned there?

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So, look, we enjoy our position in Europe. And I've said a few times that I actually
consider Europe to be a decent growth market for our company, even the developed markets of Western Europe,
primarily because of the relatively high levels of cash that still exist in some of those economies. And if you take out
the Nordics, where cash is actually very small, and come to Germany or France, it's still a overwhelming majority that's
in cash, and those are very attractive markets.
We have a good position. We've been gaining shares. That's absolutely correct. We bring a lot of things with data
analytics, with contactless, with fraud early warning systems, with inControl, and so all of those help us win deals. And
now we're focused on trying to process more and more of the transactions in Europe as we go along. So even this
quarter, our process transactions grew by 14% or so in Europe in SEPA. So that's a good thing for us. And we're
focused on that, and a lot of the work we're doing with Provus and TREVICA are all aligned around that aspect.
So between digital and Advisors and data, in addition to what we already do in our core business, we have a decent line
of sight the way Europe's going. But Europe is not without its challenges. It has regulatory challenges that are unique to
the way Europe is constructed and the way it functions, and I've talked a little bit about those in the form of the EC
legislation as well as this recent ruling by the AG.
Now, the AG's ruling doesn't impact anything directly because the rates were already there, but could that spill over
tomorrow into some other way of looking at regulatory arbitrage or thinking in that space in Europe? Sure, it could and
that's something we are always conscious of. And we're always trying to make sure that we work well within that
environment.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. Could you maybe give us a little bit of that kind of give-and-take between
the two pieces of the Chase relationship? Like, how you do see the growth on the Commercial side versus the risk of
deconsolidation on the consumer side?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: It's tough to say because I really can't give you that much detailed information about one
set of clients and books. But you should know that Chase is a very, very large consumer bank with a very large
consumer portfolio and they've got a strong corporate banking business that's growing, but there's no way that those
two are comparable. So I don't see us making up what we are losing in the consumer side if it goes away in 2014.
I can't estimate what'll happen. I'm kind of assuming it's going away. And I've heard the earnings call that Visa had
where they talked about getting it, so I'm assuming that they're both thinking similarly that 2014 is the year that it goes
from us to them. [indiscernible] (37:23) going to make up for that. But it'll help just as all the co-brands will help. And
there are co-brands that we haven't been able to announce because of certain circumstances with those retailers and
those issuers, which will all become clearer to you over the next few months.
So I'm hoping that we will eventually come up in the right place, but 2014 is going to be the year of transition. We have
tried to factor that in when Martina said that we think the revenue could be at the lower end of our long-term guidance.
Now if it comes in better, that'd be great because if the attrition is slower or these co-brands come on quicker, that'll be
great as well.
But typically, a co-brand, after we announce it, takes somewhere between a year, a year-and-a-half to start onboarding
and kicking in. So there's that time lag in our business and that's what we are providing for. Look, underlying trends in
our business in the U.S. and elsewhere have been good. In our fourth quarter, our gross revenue actually came in better
than our plan, and what happened is we signed more deals, and I'm actually happy to sign those deals. And so that's
what I'm thinking about, this whole circumstance around how to think about where our revenues and our company is
going over the next couple of years.

Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. You may go ahead.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on some of your macro discussion, Ajay.
When I look at the payments volume, the purchase volume by region, this had a decent slowing in pretty much every
market, except for Latin America, and I think you're suggesting that you thought you were seeing a little more strength
incrementally. I guess the January numbers do suggest that you see a pickup from the fourth quarter. But do you think
given the slowdown that you see across the board in payment and purchase volume, doesn't that suggest that the
economy at best is stable and at worst maybe we're seeing a little bit of global weakening?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I actually don't see it that way. I see the U.S. as – if you just look at the U.S. as a whole,
if you look at the drags on U.S. economic growth that contributed to whatever happened in 2013, and 2013 turned out
to end in a stronger way than people expected. Bu there were lots of drags, right, drag from the sequester, to all the
other kinds of stuff that happened there. So I don't see the U.S. as being slowing in any way. I see it improving. I
actually, see Europe showing signs of life as well. Northern Europe, even the U.K., which a year ago people talked
about as being in very difficult and dire circumstances, that's clearly showed a recovery in where it's headed.
And that brings us to Asia, and Asia is dominated by what happens between China, Japan, Australia and India. If you
think about China, yes, China's growth has slowed, but China's growth has slowed first in domestic expenditure, which
impacts us very little, because we don't get to play in the domestic processing yet. Right? Japan is actually beginning to
show signs of life. Australia, it depends a great deal with what happens with China because Australia's economy relies
a great deal on the exports into China.
And India is just India. India's being India right now. It's going through all that it's doing with its elections and all that's
underlying it, but India's economy is two-thirds consumption and that consumption is still growing. And while China
and India may be growing slower than in the past, they're still growing in the very attractive numbers beyond the ten.
So, yes, that's the question about slowdown. We've got to remember the number of days in the fourth quarter, number
of processing days, and Martina went a couple of times to explain that if you took out the bits of the impact of the
smaller number of days and look at the normalized data, you will find it's kind of similar growth. But if we went to
Asia and you went back four quarters in Asia, you'd find Asia today is a little slower in PCE growth than it was four
quarters ago. That's what I'm addressing when talking to you. I'm not addressing the specifics of the processed
transactions, because I think Martina addressed those a couple of times in her opening remarks.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. You may go ahead.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Thank you. Two questions. First, Martina, you said that OpEx would probably grow a little
less than 9% this year. Can you give us a sense where you might have operating leverage this year?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So, David, what we are doing is – I didn't say a little less. I actually said less than 9%.
There's a little bit of a difference on those kind of numbers. And what we are really doing is, as we said, that we
opportunistically put some more money into the business in the third quarter into the fourth quarter and then we look at
our budget going forward, we are not assuming that we are going to have a repeat of that.
But as we have said before, depending on how our top line will develop, right, and our top line is subject to what we
just discussed on the potential migration of cards from the Chase portfolio, we might be putting extra money into the
company if we can do it, okay? But it all depends on how we see the top line developing and the bottom. So at this

point in time, the budget basically just says operating expenses will grow less than 9%.

Operator
Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. You may go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. Just to dive a little deeper on the underlying trends in volume and we saw in the
fourth quarter the trends shift from about 9% down to 7.5% then back to 9% again, you're saying, in January. If you
could just explain a little bit of what's driving that first? And then really going forward, we're seeing underwriting
standards loosen a little more at the banks, which I think should support more credit growth going forward as well and
when you couple that with the churns you're talking about with all these deals, is that helpful for you on pricing? If
Chase comes off, I imagine the pricing on that, given the size, was a little bit tougher than what you're bringing on. Is
that a fair way to look at that? And then just one quick follow-up, what drove other revenues up 22%?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Okay.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Guys, can we please respect the one question?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Okay. Let me take the easy one first, which is what drove other revenues up. Other
revenues were predominantly driven by our Advisors revenues as well as Access Prepaid. So the other things that we
are really focusing on from a service point of view – and Ajay had already said something that we are really focusing
on putting Advisors out on the globe and you're actually seeing a really great benefit from that, and that's why you see a
20% increase in other revenues going up.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Got it. All right.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: That tends to be fee-based revenues, just to be clear.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes. Not volume or transaction based; this is all fee-based revenues, right? Darrin,
you're asking us one tough question on the underlying trends, okay? In terms of really figuring out why a quarter moves
up and down for 1 percentage points or 2 percentage points is pretty tough to do.
All we can see is when we triangulated with the data that Ajay was already referencing from a GDP and from a PCE
number, we actually felt that the fourth quarter, both in the United States as well as in Europe, was pretty healthy,
okay? So even though we had some move in the growth numbers, it was pretty healthy and you can see that on the
credit side and you could see that on the debit side.
Now, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, we know that there was some impact given what is happening from a China
production point of view, and hopefully, if the work gets into a better footing, that will resolve itself, but it's very tough
to be putting that down to very specific changes.

Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Thanks. So just quickly on the G&A, you mentioned Ajay, MasterPass and tokenization were
two of the key reasons for that to be up, but there's a lot of incremental people that are put into that, and that seems to
be disproportionate for those kind of technologies. So I'm wondering is this back half kind of ramp of, call it, $161
million or so, is that a function of also putting more feet on the street with these deals that you've done in order to get to
local-market processing? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So we are adding people in different areas. It's not just in MasterPass and tokenization,
although that did add a fair number of engineers and development teams. But we are adding people in sales, we're

adding people in client delivery, we've added people in product management, and when we open new countries, we try
and have people in the control functions so they open in a way that is well-handled for the future. Right? All those
things add up. We have opened a number of new offices around the world as well over the last couple of years. All that
tends to add up.
What we're really doing is adding people who bring to us a different perspective on how we look at our business, so
we're adding people, not just from banking and consulting, although that still is a good source of people. We're also
adding people from consumer product companies and from technology companies and from marketing organizations
and from government background and experience.
So when you put all that together, that's the kind of people we're hiring. It's not anything specific in the fourth quarter
or in the third quarter or the second quarter. We've been adding people consistently over the last couple of years as
we've tried to create the ability for us to have the right footprint and the right infrastructure to go into so many new
areas. So when you see us talk about Advisors and generating fee revenues from Advisors, I can't get them without a
certain quantum of people to have feet on the street as well as people who are doing analytics.
When you talk about Access Prepaid Worldwide, that didn't exist in our book a couple of years back. So when you sort
of add all that together, our company's changing and morphing, and in that change and morph, what I'm trying to do is
to maintain our operating margin at a very healthy level but put money back into building the skills, capabilities and
technologies that are going be required for this digital-physical convergence combined with the data opportunity that
our company is talking about. So that's kind of what I'm trying to do.

Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie. You may go ahead.
<Q - Kevin D. McVeigh>: Great. Thanks. Hey, I wonder if you could give us a sense, just the uptick in data breaches,
how that's impacting the value proposition as you go out to clients and, ultimately, what's been the feedback on that?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Great question. Right now, fortunately, I haven't seen a great deal of impact coming out
of that and, as we just told you, our first few days of January looked like they're actually a little better than the quarter
that went by or similar. It's a little better in some cases, but there's no one specific data breach that causes trouble. It's
an ongoing feeling that consumers get about their safety and their security of their information. And these recent data
breaches are not just about cards. They were about other consumer data, tens of millions of stuff that went away. And
that creates its own angst in everyone's mind.
Fortunately, our technology, the technology of our competitor networks, combined with some of the great tools that the
banks and merchants have built along with us over the years has meant that people have tried to keep fraud under
control and trying to help the consumer. So I'm really – that's less of the issue. I'm far more concerned about getting the
right thing done so we get ahead of this as we go forward. Otherwise, they're going to have this keep coming in, and the
more often it happens, the worse it feels. So that's what I'm looking at.
And it's not about who did what, and it's not about finger-pointing, and it's not about, I said this and they said that. I
only want to get past all that nonsense to the real stuff, which is we need to get EMV in place. In January, Chris
McWilton issued a letter to all our issuers and the merchant partners saying, we are standing by our deadline. We need
to get this going, and everyone needs to be on the bandwagon. Banks need to be there, merchants need to be there,
governments are clearly there. We need to get the networks there and the acquirers there and I think there is a lot of
progress on that front.
I know a large number of the big merchants are very committed to create new terminals and new terminalization. I
know that the terminal manufacturers have geared up for that. I know that a number of the banks have begun to issue
chip cards already. You can see people are making all the right efforts. This should only redouble our desire to get this

actually said that we assume that something would have happened in 2013 and it did not.

revenue or how much?

<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: All right. Thanks. Thanks so much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. You may go ahead.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, getting back to the fraud issue, with
your experience and what you've seen around the world, the move to EMV, how significant is that in reducing, either
the sorts of things we've had in the United States or just really the fraud that existed in places like Europe before they
went EMV, or even Canada?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Very significant. It very significantly reduces the impact of breaches. Look, every time a
chip card is used, it uses the technology inside to create a unique data point for that transaction. That kind of bolsters
the security and the security of that transaction. That's why chip transactions are mostly impossible to fraudulently
replicate and, of course, because the darned chip is there, it's makes it hard to counterfeit the card in the first place.
So if I say this differently, EMV would not prevent a data breach. I mean, look, in the target case, there were stuff with
cards, there were stuff with data that happened in the target system. EMV is not going to protect from that data breach.
What it will do it makes that any data stolen much, much, much less valuable to a fraudster because it's tough to
counterfeit the card, and it's almost impossible to duplicate all the unique data that flows for that transaction to get
approved, so it's kind of like double layers of protection inside it.
That's what it's about, but you need to understand that while it's good at addressing counterfeit fraud, it's not the only
solution. Other single solution to drive security in the payment space. There's going to be a lot of things that happen
that our data is secured, how it's kept, how it's encrypted in motion and address things that we all do, things that very
often you cannot expect small merchants to do in the same way or smaller acquirers to do in the same way.
That's one of the reasons why in the future with digital technology, tokenization is actually a key because in
tokenization, that data doesn't even go to be stored in that location. It's encrypted with a key that only the network from
the banks recognize and, therefore, the concept of that data lying in the weakest link in the chain will go away. So it's
both EMV, tokenization, fraud tools, all the things that are going on. It's not a one thing but EMV is a really big arrow
in the quiver.

Our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America. You may go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thank you. Good morning. You've pointed out on a number of occasions that you're moving
into processing. I would like to ask specifically what you see as the strategic imperative and the financial implications
beyond the EPS dilution that Martina mentioned as you are looking at the issuer and acquirer processing?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So the strategic implications really are back to what Gary has talked about at Investor
Day. Obviously, if you switch the transaction, as you know, we only you get to do a little around 50% of our
transactions, and I'd love to be able to get beyond that because as you switch the transaction, first of all, you're in a
much stronger position in the system. Second, you see all aspects of it coming and going, and if you, in addition, even
if you don't switch it but you see it pass through because you're either helping the acquirers process or helping the
issuers process, then you still have a lot of data that you can then use for developing fraud scores, behavioral scores, the
Advisors fee revenue, all that kind of stuff. So getting in front or behind of the transaction is useful for someone like us.
I don't want to be a bait and switch. That's not the business that long term can give us the ability, and by long term I
mean out a decade. I'm targeting more than that. I want to be using our data to create the right revenue streams from
data. I want to be able to use in the digital world all the things we can do from before, during and after the payment.
You can't do all that if you aren't a little smarter about processing. So that's what we're trying to do.
Now in countries like the United States and Brazil, we process almost all of our transactions. However, when you get
into some of the emerging markets and, of course, as you know in China, we don't process domestic transactions. When
you get to places in the emerging markets or the high-growth markets in Europe, that's where these things can help us.
And as you know, SEPA opened up the ability for us to reenter the processing market in the developed countries of
Europe, which we are trying our best to do, and we're making very steady progress on that as well.
So it's a long way of answering that being in the center of the transaction and being there before, during, and after the
transaction, being on both sides of it, are very, very useful for this company.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: And just to add to this, we already own a processor in Poland, which is called
TREVICA, and now we are owning the independent processor in Turkey, Provus. And when you look at these
processors on an isolated basis, of course, they have a lower margin profile than our business, but what we found, with
all the work that we did around TREVICA in the last couple of years, that that really helps our main business, and that
we are able to win deals, that the deals are more sticky and that we're actually able to give more services to the clients
because we actually saw the transaction. So we really think from a strategic and from a financial point of view, this is a
very good way to go.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Before we take the next question, I just got an e-mail from somebody in our fraud area, and
going back to Chris's question about how significant has EMV been in reducing fraud when it's been adopted, we have
seen anywhere between 60% and 80% decrease in counterfeit fraud after EMV has been installed in the market. Next
question.

the life of those cards. That's different but when Chase did the relationship with the Debit Visa on the network. At that

time, one of the items that Visa and Chase both announced was this migration of the consumer book inside of Chase,
the rest of it to our competitor. It didn't happen in 2013. That's what we're referring to.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. You may go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but I just want to make sure I understand the
Chase assumption that you guys are making. For 2014, you're basically assuming some piece of that goes away, and
there may be residual impacts as we look out to 2015 and onwards?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: No, I'm assuming that it goes away in 2014.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Okay.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: But, by the way, who did you call a dead horse?
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: No one.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: No one.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from Janney. You may go ahead.
<Q - Thomas C. McCrohan>: Hi. A follow-up on EMV, I think people are aware that it reduces counterfeit fraud, but
fraud migrates to the online channel. I'm just wondering if the tokenization efforts that you're working on, they're going
to be packaged with any EMV implementation? Because currently it doesn't really address that, and that's what I think
what merchants are kind of digging their heels in on. They want some line of sight into protecting the online as well.
Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yeah, absolutely. That's what we're doing with tokenization, and that's exactly why we
like it. And we're actually hopeful that it will all get done and start being out there in the marketplace, as we said,
sometime in 2014, and then it'll keep rolling along from there. And it's going to accept everything from secure elements
to SIM-based solutions to other kind of efforts to get secured information into MasterPass and the tokenization. We're
very committed to that.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Our last question comes from Don Fandetti from Citi. You may go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes, Ajay, just to kind of wrap up on the strategic side, we've seen Apple and Amazon talk a
little bit more about payments. We're just curious what your perspective is, how that might change the payment
landscape, and is it sort of in line with your expectation and timeline of what those companies might be doing?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Sure, Don. Thank you. It's exactly what I expected. You're all aware that they're all
thinking about this. And the fact that Google is out there first and actually doing something didn't mean that the others

weren't working on it. They're all working on it. And they're all trying to figure out what the right role to play for their
respective strengths and weaknesses are, as this payments opportunity evolves.
And it's not just payments. We have talked to most of them. They will tell you it's about the before, during and after the
transaction. So Google tends to think about it as a method to look at enhancing their advertising and consumer outreach
business, not really as a payments business. Others think differently and everybody comes at it from a different
perspective.
So that's why what we're trying to do is to partner with as many of them as we can, and we have managed I think well
to shift the dialogue from one of disintermediation to one of partnership, because we bring some very strong assets to
the table in terms of what we have and possess and also what we're investing in. And so that's kind of where we're
going with it. I'm not the least surprised. I believe it's the right thing to do anyway with all the strong players in the
digital world will have a role to play in some way to enable payments for their consumers. It's the right thing to do.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Thank you.
Ajaypal Singh Banga
So let me leave you with a few closing thoughts. We had a very good 2013. We delivered on our expectations. We saw
strong revenue and EPS growth. We've continued to invest back into our products, our technology and our people.
Overall, it seems like the economic environment is improving, especially in the U.S. and Europe. I understand that
emerging markets are going through a bumpy patch, which we will continue to watch. But remember they are starting
in a much better place than they were in previous crises. And so I believe that over a period of time, that should
stabilize. So looking ahead over the next couple of years, the world generally seems to be headed towards a better
economic cycle than what we have seen in the recent past, and I hope those are not famous last words. That's kind of
where my head is.
Our business continues to have strong momentum, as it shows in our GDV and our gross revenue numbers in the fourth
quarter. We are focused on driving the conversion from cash electronic payments and, at the same time, very, very
focused on creating solutions and working with governments and other partners to advance financial inclusion.
Investing in our core solutions remains important so we're making investments in new products as well, in new services
and new capabilities, all of which will help us expand our presence in the area around payments as well, not just the
payment but before, during and after. And for sure, we will continue our efforts to ensure that we make the best
possible impact on ensuring safety and security for everyone with physical payment space, while carrying those
competencies into the digital world as the two invariably converge over the next three years.
So thank you for your support, and thank you for joining us on today's call.
