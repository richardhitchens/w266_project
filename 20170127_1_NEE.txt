John W. Ketchum
Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners were very
successful in executing the initiatives we discussed for 2016 and ended the year with excellent results. NextEra Energy
extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $6.19, up 8.4%
from 2015 and the team made significant progress and opportunities to continue to drive growth.
NextEra Energy Partners grew distributions to $1.41 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable
quarterly distribution a year earlier which was the top end of the range we discussed going into 2016.
Let me now take a few moments to summarize additional highlights for 2016 before taking you through the detailed
results. At FPL, we were very pleased to reach a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case while continuing to
deliver on our customer value proposition. We were honored to be recognized by Edison Electric Institute for our
outstanding leadership in restoring power safely and quickly following Hurricanes Matthew and Hermine.
During the year, the Port Everglades' next-generation Clean Energy Center was completed on budget and two months
ahead of schedule, roughly 1,600 megawatts of peaking capacity was upgraded with more efficient advanced
combustion turbines, and FPL's solar capacity was roughly tripled with the addition of over 1 million new solar panels
that make up approximately 225 megawatts of universal solar.
FPL built upon key successes from 2015 delivering its best-ever service reliability performance and was again
recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. At the same time, FPL's typical customer bill has
remained well below both state and national averages. We remain committed to our longstanding focus at FPL on
operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. And looking ahead, the positives of 2016
position FPL to continue to execute its successful strategy.
At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments continue to drive growth and 2016 was a great year for our
development and construction programs. We commissioned roughly 2,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects in
the U.S. during the year, which was a record for Energy Resources and something we believe no other company has
ever achieved in the North American renewables industry. Origination performance was also very strong over last year
with the Energy Resources team adding a total of approximately 3,500 megawatts of new renewables projects and
repowering opportunities.
In addition to executing well on the project backlog and continuing to advance the development pipeline at Energy
Resources, we were pleased to receive additional IRS start of construction guidance on the wind PTC in December that
was largely consistent with our thinking.
We believe that our safe harbor purchases could qualify over 10 gigawatts of wind for 100% of the PTC subject to
completion by the end of 2020 and other applicable criteria and provide Energy Resources with excellent strategic
positioning to capitalize on both new wind and repowering opportunities.
A consistent focus on leveraging our development skills, together with our purchasing power, best-in-class construction
expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to capital, and cost of capital advantages allow us to continue
to advance an already strong and visible opportunity set and in turn are at the core of our expectations for outstanding
growth prospects at both Energy Resources and NEP.

NextEra Energy Partners also delivered continued solid execution on its growth objectives. NEP completed three
acquisitions from Energy Resources that added a total of over 700 megawatts to its portfolio in 2016 while also
demonstrating its flexible and opportunistic approach to financing with a combination of debt and equity. Yesterday,
the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3525 per common unit or $1.41 per common unit on an
annualized basis, up 15% from a year earlier.
During the year, we announced proposed transactions that would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor as
part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Court confirmation hearings are currently scheduled to begin on February 14. Separate from
the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we have filed a joint application with the Public Utility
Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition.
Intervenor testimony was filed two weeks ago, staff testimony was filed last week, and hearings are scheduled to
commence on February 21 of this year. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones, and subject to
required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. We made excellent progress on the
financing plan for Oncor. In addition to issuing equity units and completing an equity forward transaction last year, our
overall corporate financing activities have benefited from successful execution on our opportunities to recycle capital,
including the completed sales of FiberNet, Marcus Hook, and Forney and Lamar.
The balance of the proceeds for the Oncor transactions are expected to be raised predominantly through debt at Capital
Holdings later this year, and the vast majority of this expected debt issuance was hedged, several months ago, against
interest rate volatility. Our financing plan is consistent with maintaining our strong balance sheet and current credit
ratings, which we are unwilling to compromise. All in all, 2016 was a terrific year of execution at FPL, Energy
Resources, and NEP.
Now, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of
$371 million, or $0.79 per share unchanged from its fourth quarter 2015 EPS. For the full year 2016, FPL reported net
income of $1.7 billion or $3.71 per share, up $0.08 per share versus 2015.
At FPL, we continued investing in new and modernized generation, as well as a stronger and smarter grid to further
improve the already outstanding efficiency and reliability of our system. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately
$837 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year capital investments to a total of roughly $3.9 billion.
Regulatory capital employed grew approximately 8.3% year-over-year. In addition to bringing into service
approximately 225 megawatts of universal solar since the last call, FPL also announced the retirement of the Cedar Bay
Generating Plant at the end of the year.
Together with our similar plan to phase down another coal-fired power plant, the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, we
expect to successfully retire two of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state while also providing
customer savings. The FPSC approved the Indiantown transaction last fall, and we closed the acquisition during the
first week of January.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended December 2016 will be approximately 11.5%. We
ended the third quarter of 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $230 million, and we added $20 million in the
fourth quarter for a total year-end 2016 balance of $250 million.
As a reminder, the new four-year settlement agreement that was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in
November became effective this month and includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1 billion
of depreciation reserve surplus plus the reserve amount remaining under FPL's now-expired 2012 rate agreement that I
just mentioned of $250 million for a total of roughly $1.25 billion.
In 2017, we expect the flexibility provided by this reserve amount coupled with our weather-normalized sales growth
forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations to support our regulatory ROE towards the upper end of the
allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our new rate agreement. As always, our expectations assume, among other
things, normal weather and operating conditions.

The Florida economy continues to progress well with strong job growth and recent unemployment rates around their
lowest level since 2007. The latest data from the real estate sector continue to show new building permits at healthy
levels, and the Case-Shiller index for South Florida is up 6.4% from the prior year. Florida's consumer confidence
levels remain near post recession highs.
For the fourth quarter, we estimate that milder weather had a negative year-over-year impact on usage per customer of
approximately 5.1% and that Hurricane Matthew had a comparable negative impact of 0.8%. After taking these factors
into account, fourth quarter sales increased 0.4% on a weather normalized basis which reflects continued customer
growth partially offset by lower underlying usage per customer.
For 2016, we estimate that FPL retail sales reflect negative year-over-year impacts of 2.1% from weather and 0.2%
from Hurricane Matthew. FPL's 2016 retail sales growth on a weather normalized basis was 1.5%, which was primarily
driven by the impact of continued customer growth. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather normalized
usage per customer to average between 0% and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $360 million or $0.77 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $191 million or $0.41 per share. Energy Resources contribution to
fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was roughly flat from last year which primarily reflects strong new
investment contributions being offset by lower results from existing generation assets as well as higher G&A and
interest expense.
Similar to the third quarter, our fourth quarter results include a positive impact related to the contingent earn-out
liability that was recorded as part of the Texas Pipeline acquisition in 2015. As a reminder, the $200 million earn-out,
which we no longer expect to become payable, was required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET
pipeline were signed by December 31, 2016, and if those expansion projects met several precedent conditions. This
impact was roughly offset by lower contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities due to increased
depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates.
For the full year 2016, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.125 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted
earnings were $1.09 billion or $2.33 per share. Energy Resources' full year adjusted earnings per share contribution
increased $0.29, or approximately 14% from the prior year comparable period. Growth was driven by strong benefits
from continued new additions to our renewables portfolio, which added $0.47 per share. Contributions from new
natural gas pipeline investments added $0.16 per share. New investment growth was partially offset by a decline of
$0.12 per share and contributions from our existing generation assets, largely due to the ongoing impact of PTC
roll-off.
Overall, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average in 2016, up from 94% a year earlier. Contributions from our
upstream gas infrastructure activities declined by $0.16 per share. Consistent with the expectations we discussed last
call, this was primarily driven by the full year impact of increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion
rates.
This essentially offset the $0.17 per share positive impact from the elimination of the Texas Pipelines contingent earn
out liability that I mentioned earlier. All other effects had a negative impact to $0.23 per share, mostly driven by
year-over-year increase in interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business as well as the effects of share
dilution.
Finally, as we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares Energy
Resources adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2015. 2016 was an
excellent year for our development and construction programs in Energy Resources.
As a reminder, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program was approximately 4,000 megawatts. This
significantly exceeded the original expectations we had shared for this timeframe and made 2015 to 2016 the most
successful two-year period for renewables development in our history.

Since the last call, we signed additional contracts for roughly 640 megawatts of new projects, including roughly 540
megawatts of wind for 2017 and 2018 delivery, and 100 megawatts of solar for post 2018 delivery. We also continue to
aggressively pursue repowering opportunities on the balance of our portfolio to add to the 1,600 megawatts of
repowering that we previously announced and continue to see the total opportunity being between $2 billion to $2.5
billion through 2020. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development
program now stands. Our natural gas pipeline projects continue to progress through the development process and
remain on track. The Florida Pipeline commenced full construction activities in 2016, and we continue to expect an
in-service date in the middle of this year.
As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are
expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The
Mountain Valley Pipeline continues to progress through the FERC process. We expect the pipeline with approximately
2 bcf per day, a 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by yearend 2018. NextEra
Energy's expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth Quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $168 million
increased $33 million from a year earlier. Consistent with NEP's substantial portfolio growth over this time period,
strong contributions from new project additions drove results with a relatively modest offset from higher IDR fees.
Fourth quarter 2016 CAFD was approximately $68 million.
As a reminder, NEP's quarterly CAFD results are impacted by timing of debt service and PAYGO payment. Included
within the projects added over the last year, the Seiling I and II Golden Hills and Cedar Bluff U.S. wind projects, as
expected, do not receive PAYGO payments in the fourth quarter.
As a result, together with increased interest and corporate expenses, due to growth, fourth quarter CAFD declined
year-over-year. We ended the year with adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run rates consistent with the expectations we
have shared previously for December 31, 2016.
For the full year 2016, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $639 million and $222 million, respectively. Portfolio
growth drove higher year-over-year results while existing assets benefited from a favorable comparison of wind
resource.
Across the NEP portfolio, overall wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 93% in 2015. As a reminder,
these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $34 million
year-over-year.
As I mentioned earlier, NEP completed three acquisitions from Energy Resources in 2016, financed with a combination
of debt and equity. We have incremental holdco debt capacity of at least $575 million, which continues to provide NEP
with substantial flexibility to execute against its future growth prospects.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net income
attributable to NextEra Energy was $966 million or $2.06 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 fourth quarter adjusted
earnings and adjusted EPS were $566 million and $1.21 respectively.
For the full year 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.912 billion or $6.25 per share.
Adjusted earnings were $2.884 billion or $6.19 per share. From the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for
the full year increased $0.11 per share compared to 2015 primarily due to certain tax items and investment gains.
Turning now to our near-term financial expectations for NextEra Energy. We are introducing expectations for 2017 and
updating our range for 2018. We expect adjusted earnings per share for NextEra Energy to be in a range of $6.35 to
$6.85 for 2017, and are increasing our range for 2018 from $6.60 to $7.10 to $6.80 to $7.30. From a base of our 2016
adjusted EPS of $6.19, the midpoints of these ranges reflect a compound annual growth rate of roughly 7%. Jim will
discuss our expectations and longer-term outlook in just a moment.
We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of
dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to

normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NEP. At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the NEP Board declared a fourth quarter
distribution of $0.3525 per common unit, or $1.41 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing a 15%
increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. Jim will also discuss our long-term outlook for DPU growth at
NEP in just a moment.
Our December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230
million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the portfolio with which we
ended the year.
Our December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310
million to $340 million are also unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at
year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable
CAFD mid-point based on our December 31, 2016 run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal
caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense.
With that I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss the long-term outlook at NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy
Partners.
James L. Robo
Thanks John and good morning everyone. Our strong performance in 2016 reinforces the overall strength and diversity
of our growth prospects, and I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future. Before providing additional updates on
our outstanding long-term outlook at NextEra Energy, I'd like to take a moment to discuss an agreement reached
between NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners for a structural modification to NEP's IDR fees.
Since the time of its launch, NEP has diversified its portfolio by roughly tripling its renewables capacity and adding
seven natural gas pipeline assets with the acquisition of the Texas Pipelines in 2015. NEP has built a high quality
portfolio with high quality cash flows backed by assets with an average remaining contract life of 18 years and an
average counterparty credit rating of A3. NEP's most recently declared distribution at an annualized rate of $1.41 per
unit reflects cumulative growth of 88% since its 2014 IPO. This exceeds the expectations for growth that we discussed
initially in mid-2014 and reflects solid execution in a difficult capital markets environment.
NEE offers NEP and its investors high visibility into a large portfolio of attractive, long-term contracted assets operated
by a best-in-class sponsor and supported by the development capabilities of North America's largest and best
renewables developer. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its
sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives.
Conversely, NEP offers NEE the opportunity to highlight the value of Energy Resources' long-term contracted
portfolio of assets, while enabling NEE to recycle capital back into its development projects and optimize its tax
position by monetizing its deferred tax asset balance against tax gains generated from the sale of assets to NEP.
Notwithstanding all of these positives, we believe there is a disconnect right now between NEP's future growth
potential and its current valuation. There appear to be at least a couple of factors that are adversely affecting NEP's
performance.
First, capital markets are still recovering from a meaningful reduction in fund flows in the infrastructure space caused
by significant declines in commodity prices during the second half of 2015. While conditions are starting to slowly
improve, the constrained environment continues to put pressure on high quality drop-down stories that require equity to
achieve growth targets.
Second, because NEP has reached the high splits, some investors have expressed concern that NEP's IDRs will
consume an increasing share of the incremental cash flow that would otherwise be available to drive LP distribution
growth, which could result in the need to drop down more

assets and issue more equity at a time when capital markets are constrained.
In order to address these concerns, today we are announcing that the NEP Board has approved an agreement between
NEP and NextEra Energy to structurally modify NEP's IDRs. Here's how it will work: First, IDR fees based on NEP's
most recently declared distribution to current LP unitholders at an annualized rate of $1.41 per unit are roughly $56
million per year.
Second, NextEra Energy's ability to achieve incremental IDR fees above $56 million from this point forward is
predicated on NEP delivering LP distributions at an annualized rate above $1.41 to all unitholders. If LP distributions
exceed $1.41 per unit, the excess above $1.41 is split 75% to common unitholders and 25% to IDR fees.
Finally, IDR fees would fall below $56 million per year in the unlikely event that annualized LP distributions ever fall
below $1.41 per unit.
This structural modification to NEP's IDR fee is centered on value creation for both NEE shareholders and NEP
common unitholders. Let me take a minute to explain our logic. By reducing IDR fees on future growth, we expect
there to be significantly more cash available to LP unitholders and, as a result, we expect levered returns or ROEs for
NEP common unitholders to increase from the high single digits to the low double-digits on future asset drop-downs.
Also, if there is significantly more cash available to LP unitholders, NEP will need to acquire fewer assets to achieve
the same level of distribution growth.
If NEP acquires fewer assets, it will need to issue less equity. In fact, it is our expectation that with this structural IDR
modification, NEP can now achieve its distribution growth targets for 2017 and potentially 2018 without issuing
common equity. This, of course, is aside from any modest equity issuances that NEP may execute through its
At-The-Market program. Putting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of LP
distribution growth. By reducing NEP's equity needs and extending its distribution growth runway, we expect the
increased certainty around growth to translate into improvements in NEP's trading yield and valuation.
If NEP's value improves due to these benefits, so does the value of NEE's ownership position in NEP. In addition, NEE
should receive more cash distributions over time as NEP's distribution growth runway is extended. Finally, with these
changes, NEE should be able to recycle capital and optimize its tax position over a longer period of time. For these
reasons, the IDR modification is expected to be accretive to NextEra Energy versus the status quo.
I am very excited about the future prospects for NEP and the benefits that we expect for both NEE shareholders and
NEP common unitholders as a result of today's announcement. With these changes, we are extending our financial
expectations for NEP another two years, as we see 12% to 15% per year growth in per unit distributions as a reasonable
range of expectations through at least 2022. From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution at an annualized rate of
$1.41 per unit, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution to be in a range of $1.58 to $1.62
per common unit.
I want to conclude with some remarks regarding NextEra Energy and its long-term outlook. As John described, 2016
was a terrific year. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we had an
outstanding execution on our growth and regulatory initiatives all across the board. We were able to grow 2016
adjusted EPS by 8.4% and deliver total shareholder return of 18.4% that not only beat the S&P Utility Index, but also
beat the S&P 500. Amidst this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and
credit positions in the industry.
A key element of our value proposition at NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our
shareholders. Since 2005, we've delivered compounded annual growth in adjusted EPS of over 8%, the highest among

record going forward.
Since the November election, our stock performance has been adversely affected by investor concerns regarding the
outlook for renewable tax incentives, and its impact on new renewables development in particular, as well as potential
tax reform. We have underperformed since the election, with November 9 being the worst day for NEE stock
performance relative to the S&P 500 in eight years and, based on 2018 adjusted EPS consensus estimates, we now
trade at a slight discount to certain regulated peers.
Therefore, I wanted to take a few minutes to address these concerns head on, and put them into context in light of our
future growth opportunities and our overall financial expectations. Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would
not trade with anyone in our industry.
At FPL, I'm pleased with the outcome of our four year base rate case settlement agreement and what it means for our
customers and our shareholders. The outcome allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and
affordably for the benefit of Florida's customers.
The 2016 settlement agreement supports continued smart investments in reliability and clean energy, including storm
hardening, grid automation and modernization, continued fuel efficiency initiatives and the construction of the 1,748
megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2019.
Consistent with our focus on providing clean and cost-effective energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers,
the agreement also provides a solar base rate adjustment, upon commercial operations of up to an incremental 1,200
megawatts, cost-effective new solar generation approved over the four year term of 2017 through 2020.
FPL has been working for many years in order to be prepared to add substantial solar capacity affordably for its
customers, developing plans and securing sites for cost-effective installations across the state. I'm pleased to report that
we have already secured site control on more than 3,000 megawatts of potential solar capacity and we are working hard
to continue to advance this opportunity.
In short, we have outstanding growth opportunities at FPL and expect our average annual growth and regulatory capital
employed to be roughly 8% per year over the four-year term of 2017 through December 2020.
These new investments will benefit Florida customers, as FPL's typical 1,000-kilowatt hour residential customer bill is
projected to remain below 2006 levels through the year 2020. When you put it all together, low bills, best-in-class
reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are all what help FPL provide, what we
believe, is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation.
Turning now to Oncor, we see an opportunity to make two already great companies even stronger. Through the same
unyielding focus on our customers that has made us successful at FPL, we believe we have the ability to bring real
value to Oncor stakeholders and, in turn, find attractive investment opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.
The transactions provide Oncor the opportunity to transition from a highly-leveraged structure in which financial
investors own Oncor to ownership by a strategic investor with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.
Under our ownership, we are confident Oncor will be an even stronger company with greater scale and robust financial
profile, better positioned than ever to smartly invest capital to improve operations and generate value for its customers,
the State of Texas and our shareholders.
At Energy Resources, our outlook for new renewables development remains as strong as ever. We continue to build
North America's leading portfolio of wind and solar assets, and we have an excellent opportunity to leverage our
substantial development capabilities to capture even more opportunities going forward. As John discussed, our actions
to safe harbor over 10,000 megawatts of wind are reflections of that enthusiasm.
With regard to concerns over renewable tax incentives, I believe it's unlikely that either the PTC or the ITC, which
were each extended under a five-year phase down by Republican Congress at the end of 2015, will be retroactively
changed.

Along these lines, it is worth mentioning that during Senate Finance confirmation hearings held last week, the
Secretary of Treasury nominee said, in a question and answer exchange, that he was committed to supporting the
current phase down of the wind PTC. A major driver behind bipartisan support for the five-year phase-down is jobs,
with the tremendous growth in renewables responsible for rapid employment gains in the wind and solar industries.
Both wind and solar are largely made in America with more than 80% of the typical wind project and 65% of the
typical solar project made in the U.S.
Renewables also help stimulate economic growth in rural communities that would otherwise struggle to attract new
investment. Renewable energy is an important economic stimulus for these communities as it helps boost state and
local tax revenues, which provides funding for schools, hospitals and emergency response, and has direct and indirect
economic impacts that help support local small businesses.
For these same reasons, I also believe that it is unlikely the four year start of construction guidance for wind that was
released by the Treasury Department in the Spring of 2016 will be retroactively changed. Given how rare it is for our
government to retroactively change laws, particularly where parties have relied on them to make long-term investment
decisions, I believe our safe-harbored projects are well positioned to receive the 100% production tax credit through
2020. In addition, we continue to have robust access to tax equity financing and we already have tax equity financing
commitments to the repowering projects that we have announced.
State-level renewable portfolio standards are now in place in 29 states and discussions of increasing the renewable
requirements under these standards are continuing in certain of these states. At the same time, economic retirements of
generation due to low natural gas prices are also expected to continue to create opportunities for new renewables as
well as long-term natural gas pipelines, particularly as the regulatory environment for pipeline development and oil and
gas production continues to improve.
As the PTC and ITC phase-down, we believe that the economic impact on customer pricing can be absorbed by
continued technology and efficiency advancements. We continue to expect yet another major step-change in wind
turbine technology through a combination of even taller towers and wider rotor diameters, which would further
increase net capacity factors. Continued panel cost and efficiency trends are also expected for solar, as well as
opportunities to reduce balance of system costs. So even if I am wrong about continued Federal incentives for
renewables, as we near the end of this decade I would expect that in 2020 without PTCs wind would be a $0.02 to
$0.03 per kilowatt-hour product and solar without an ITC would be in the range of $0.03 to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour.
Finally, in addition to top line growth, we remain very focused on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and
opportunities to further leverage technology. Towards that end, we have launched a company-wide initiative to
reimagine absolutely everything we do, which we call Project Accelerate. This new initiative builds upon the success
from Project Momentum that was launched in 2013. Although we are only halfway through our review process, we are
pleased with our progress and expect to achieve several hundred million dollars in efficiencies over the next few years
from Project Accelerate.
Based on the strength and diversity of our growth prospects, today we are extending NextEra Energy's financial
expectations by two years, from 2018 to 2020. Putting it all together, and setting aside the potential accretion we see
with our proposed Oncor transactions, we expect NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS to be
in the range of 6% to 8% through 2020, off a 2016 base while maintaining our strong current credit ratings.
Let me now turn to tax reform. Although it's premature to draw any firm conclusions given that the tax reform
discussion is still in the very early stages, we have spent a lot of time over the last few months considering several what
if tax reform scenarios. We have modeled a scenario where there is a 15% corporate tax rate with current depreciation
rules and full interest deductibility, which we call the Administration's Plan scenario.
We have also modeled a scenario where there is a 20% corporate tax rate with immediate expensing and no interest
deductibility, which we call the House Blueprint scenario. Off of our 2020 baseline, we would expect the
Administration's Plan scenario to be approximately $0.30 to $0.40 per share accretive, and the House Blueprint
scenario to be approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share dilutive. The difference between the two scenarios is largely

driven by the lack of interest deductibility in the House Blueprint scenario. Taken together under most reasonable
scenarios, we would expect the impacts of tax reform to be manageable. Moreover, combining these same tax scenarios
with what we view as a very unlikely renewables downside case where our renewable build-out is 50% lower than our
current expectations, we would still expect to be able to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS growth range
through 2020.
As a result, while there certainly will be challenges that we will have to manage over the next four years, due to the
overall strength and diversity of our opportunity set, I will be disappointed if we are not able to continue to deliver
financial results at or near the top end of our range, again all the while maintaining our strong credit ratings.
In summary, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the
industry. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. NextEra Energy and NEP continue to make excellent
progress across the board against all our strategic and growth initiatives. Today's announcements of increasing our
expectations for both companies are reflections of that enthusiasm.
With that, we'll now open the lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS.
<A - James L. Robo>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning, everyone. Hey. So, well done. Very well done. Perhaps just a quick
clarification on everything you just said. On 2018 and long-term EPS growth, to what extent is that predicated on the
Oncor transaction following through, both in the 2018 but also beyond period? And if it's not reflected, can you just
preliminarily provide some sense as to how you would think about the increment?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. So what we have said is in extending the guidance through 2020 at 6% to 8%, we're
setting aside the accretion from Oncor. Jim just went through a number of sensitivities in terms of our view regarding
our expectations. Just to be clear, one of those sensitivities was around tax reform, and he outlined the administration's
plan and then the blueprint scenario.
And then the other was a renewable downside case where 50% of the expected renewable demand fell away. If you
combine those two things, we would still expect to be at the midpoint of our range through 2020. And then obviously,
as Jim ended the call, his expectation would be for us to finish near the top end of the range, and there are a number of
factors that could allow us to do that, Oncor being one of them.
<A - James L. Robo>: Julien, the only thing I would add is that, and I've said this publicly about the Oncor
transaction, obviously we remain as committed as ever to getting it done. I said earlier when we announced it that it
would help us grow at the top end of the range through 2018.
And I also said that we have a lot of growth levers, and I would be disappointed if we weren't able to grow at the top
end of the range even if we can't close Oncor. And I remain that.
And just to address a couple other questions that we've gotten on the Oncor transaction. We've been asked over the last
several weeks by investors what were our reactions to the testimony filed in the Oncor proceeding, and I just want to
address – take a chance to address that as well here.
Almost over the last nearly two decades, we have invested an awful lot in Texas, about $8 billion. And NextEra has one
of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and as I said before, we're unwilling to compromise our A-minus corporate
credit rating as a result of any transaction including the Oncor transactions.

We've structured that transaction to save Oncor customers hundreds of millions of dollars by removing the debt that
hangs over Oncor right now, and that is going to allow Oncor to operate at NextEra Energy's credit rating of A-minus
which, of course, is an upgrade for Oncor.
Unfortunately, for example, the requests and the testimony filed by outside consultants for certain of the intervenors
would result in NextEra being immediately downgraded once that debt is moved by either prohibiting NextEra from
appointing a majority of the Oncor board or placing restrictions on dividends and approval of capital and operating
budgets. And we need to address these issues in order to avoid being downgraded, so we can close the transaction. And
if we can't address those issues otherwise, unfortunately we wouldn't be able to close.
Texas has been a terrific state, promotes business and investment, and we're confident that the commission is going to
give our filing a full and fair review and that we can demonstrate that this transaction makes sense for Oncor, its
customers, and for Texas.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll move next to Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Not to beat a dead horse, guys, but I just want to be clear that your pro formas and the
guidance for this year and next year completely exclude any assumption that Oncor is integrated into the NextEra
family, correct?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. Again, our guidance through 2020 sets aside the accretion from Oncor.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Fair enough. In your house blueprint scenario with a 20% tax rate loss of interest
deductibility, that also includes 100% expensing, so you would include the headwind to rate base growth off of your
8% base case in that scenario?
<A - James L. Robo>: That's correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And then are you assuming interest deductibility is only loss on prospective issuance, or
that it impacts current balances?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Everything.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. So not just prospective, but prospective and on current balances.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: That's correct. We have not assumed to phase them.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thanks. Can you tell us whether or not there's been a significant change in the pace or
scale of your ongoing development opportunities in the wind or solar business post the election?
In other words, as you think about how your book-to-bill is growing over the course of – how that's grown over the
course of the last several months now, it's going to grow over the course of the next year, have you had to re-evaluate
the pace of growth given the tenor of negotiations, given the change in the White House?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah, I will turn that over to Armando. But I think just the results that we've shown today
with the 640 megawatts in this call, to 3,500 megawatts from last year, we're certainly not seeing a falloff in customer
demand. But I'll let Armando fill in with more detail.
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Hey, John. That's right. I mean, we haven't seen anything come off the table and it's
still a steady state of RFP and bilateral opportunities coming in, and it's my expectation. We're still having a lot of
discussions with customers, and they're not really focused on it, honestly. There's a little bit of talk about, hey, let's try
to get something done in the earlier years, but I fully expect 2017 and 2018 to be really good origination years for
renewables.

Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - James L. Robo>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Thank you for the thorough update and congratulations. Just thinking through the
interest deductibility, the guidance that you provided, it's very helpful. I've been trying to think through interest
deductibility for your renewables development business. Assuming that were to be eliminated, is this something that
essentially gets to worked into future PPAs? In other words, it wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on your
financing decisions, but it's just something that naturally gets worked into the overall economics of your projects?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. It naturally gets worked into the overall economics of the projects. And remember,
what we have to do is maintain our relative competitive advantages. And so, to the extent that's an impact on us, it's
also an impact on everybody else. And so, we feel very good about our ability to maintain the competitive advantages
that we've shared with investors over the past even if that will occur.
<A - James L. Robo>: Stephen, the other thing I would add is, remember, much of the renewable financing we do is
tax equity financing and isn't impacted at all by the loss of interest rate deductibility – of interest deductibility.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: All good points. Thank you. And then just thinking about the cost savings, it's fairly
impressive program that you're embarked on. When we think about achievability and factoring this into guidance, Jim,
it sounded like you're quite encouraged by what you're seeing. But could you just talk a little bit more in terms of how
achievable you see that, how much is factored into guidance, how much we should be thinking about that in terms of
ways to achieving your target?
<A - James L. Robo>: Yeah. I feel very good about our team's ability to execute against what we've seen so far, and I
think, just like Project Momentum, the achievability is going to be high, and it's one of the initiatives that we have
going on that makes me able to say that I'll be disappointed if we can't grow at the top end of the range through 2020.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning. Congratulations.
<A - James L. Robo>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I had just a detail question. At FPL in the fourth quarter, you had some pretty poor weather.
You had a hurricane, yet you still were able to reverse some reserve amortization and maintain the 11.5% trailing 12
months ROE. Kind of what happened there?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Well, we had a balance of $230 million in reserve amortization going into the year, and the
weather, against our expectations in terms of surplus, amortization was a bit better, which allowed us to add another
$20 million in the fourth quarter from $230 million to $250 million. And we had very good O&M management during
the quarter as well.

We'll go next to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great start to 2017. Two questions on the near side. First, can you
talk a little bit about how much or how significant the PTC roll off will be, and what's embedded in your 2017 and
2018 guidance? That's the first question.
Second, can you talk about the opportunity set, and I know this will be a little bit longer term, for incremental
midstream or pipeline development, outside of what you're already undertaking with Sabal Trail, Mountain Valley and
others?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: So I think – I'm going to get a better number here soon. But I think the PTC roll off
here for the next couple of years is in the $30 million to $40 million category. And, yes, that's a good number I'm
hearing.
On the midstream and pipeline development opportunities, Michael, I mean, there are still a bunch of opportunities out
there. We've talked about this before we're the – I don't know that – we're the new kid on the block, but we are the
newer kid on the block. We've been fairly successful including the MVP development which is going quite well, by the
way.
We've got a couple of others that we're working on right now. There's certainly not a shortage of opportunities. But
whether those opportunities make long-term sense for us remains to be seen, at least one of the opportunities I feel
pretty good about.
So we've said before that we would be disappointed if we did not have another significant investment opportunity to
announce in the pipeline space by 2020. That remains to be the case. We have certainly poured some significant G&A
into greenfield development there, and I expect that we'll get something that's beneficial for all of us.

approvals, MVP or other things?

night. And while FERC won't have a quorum, that won't prevent them from issuing orders with two commissioners. So
we don't see any impact from only having two commissioners right now. I would expect that to get addressed relatively
soon by the new administration as well.

And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza at Guggenheim Partners.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Good morning.
<A - James L. Robo>: Good morning.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Jim, can you comment on whether NextEra and some peers are seeking some sort of a
utility carve-out under a potential new tax regime?
<A - James L. Robo>: Yeah. I think – Shar, I think what I can say is obviously the industry understands the
importance of tax reform for both the U.S. economy as well as for our industry and it's important to get it right. And
we're working very hard to make sure that our voice is heard and that whatever happens with tax reform is both great
for the U.S. economy and also doesn't impact our customer bills and our industry.
So, I think that's all I can say about it. It's very early right now, as I said in the prepared remarks, and there's still a long
way to go on this. And we'll be updating – we'll continue to keep everyone informed. I know it's a very important issue
to investors. The impacts of tax reform is a very important issue for us, and I can also tell you that I'm very engaged on
it.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay. Got it. And it's helpful. And then just on the lower corporate taxes, whether it's the
Republican plan or the Trump plan, just from a mechanical standpoint of FPL, in your scenario analysis, are you
assuming that the higher deferred tax liabilities are sort of paid off to the life of the assets? Or is there a scenario where
you could sort of think that you can use short-term borrowings and sort of finance the liabilities under a quicker
scenario and pay them back sooner and obviously boost your rate base?
<A - James L. Robo>: I think a reasonable way to think about it right now, and the way we've been thinking about it is
that would be flowed back to customers over the remaining useful economic life of the assets.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay. So, no use of short-term borrowings to finance it under a quicker scenario.
<A - James L. Robo>: I don't think so.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay. Great. That was it. Thanks.

And we'll go next to Andrew Hughes at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Andrew Hughes>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. As you've worked through some of the implications
of tax reform, curious if you've considered some of the impacts to renewable project cash flows and if that, at all,
changes how you think about the dropdown schedule at NEP, either geographically or mix of wind or solar or gas,
particularly as you kind of look out on the distribution growth pathway?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: No. It really has not changed the way we think about NEP. We still believe that we'll be
able to secure tax equity financing. And in terms of tax equity financing, our view is that we'll continue to get first
allocation on it, and even if there were some impact from tax reform on the banks, their tax base will still be high.

They'll still need tax equity.
If anybody is impacted from the decline in the supply of tax equity, it's going to be the resi solar folks first, and then,
it's going to be the smaller wind developers second. So, in some ways, I could see it creating a bit of a competitive
advantage, but we have ways to manage around tax equity and don't really view it as being a big impact to our business
going forward.

any of those – do those still primarily for projects with hedges for offtake contracts? Have you been able to find
opportunities for PPA projects? And if not just maybe you can discuss some of the challenges there and your
expectations to overcome them going forward. Thanks.
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: So it's Armando. The 1.6 gigawatts that we've announced is really just hedged projects.
But in the last three months, we've made some, I'd say, pretty good development in engaging our PPA counterparties
and amending or trying to amend those PPAs. I feel pretty good about it. I mean, if we didn't feel pretty good about it,
we wouldn't have said that we would expect $2 billion to $2.5 billion from this program. To get up to that $2 billion to
$2.5 billion of investment, you're going to have to amend some of the current power purchase agreements that are out
there.
And I will tell you that all of the counterparties – we have not spoken to all the counterparties obviously at this point.
But all of the counterparties that we have spoken with are very interested in taking on repowered projects.
<Q - Andrew Hughes>: That's great, guys. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.

And we'll go next to Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer & Co.
<Q - Shivani Sood>: Hi. This is Shivani Sood on for Colin Rusch. Two questions for us. We're seeing a rapid
evolution of micro grid technology performance and cost. Can you just kind of talk about how you see the corporate
university, military and micro grid fitting into your development plans?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: So this is Eric. We don't see a lot of penetration right now or interest on micro grids. I mean,
obviously, there are still folks who are pursuing that in different parts of the country. In Florida, the value proposition
that we provide folks really has just focused on, if anything, I guess, sort of a little bit more towards energy efficiency,
but that's really driven more by building codes here.
So, on the micro grid side, I wouldn't say there's been a lot of movement on it. Obviously, technology is something
that's driven our business quite a bit. We've adopted a lot on the smart grid technology. That's helped us take costs out
of the business and improve reliability, and that's something that we passed on to customers through lower bills and
better performance.
<Q - Shivani Sood>: Great. And then just as you look at your solar development portfolio and the ongoing cost
declines in equipment prices, how much incremental profitability are you seeing in your solar development portfolio?
<A - James L. Robo>: Possibility in terms of cost reductions or development opportunities? Cost reductions?
<Q - Shivani Sood>: Yes.
<A - James L. Robo>: So cost reductions, I mean, we're still expecting on a dollar-per-KW basis for solar to get down
to probably pretty close to $1,000 a KW by the end of 2020. That's built into all of our expectations at Energy
Resources as to what could get done, and that's built into the expectations that Jim talked about during the prepared
remarks where he said, by the end of 2020 or early in the next decade, you've got PPA prices that are probably close to
$0.03 to $0.04.
