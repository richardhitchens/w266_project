MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America First Quarter Earnings Announcement Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note this call may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn
today's program over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir.
Lee McEntire
Thank you. Good morning. Thanks to everybody for joining us this morning for the first quarter 2017 results.
Hopefully, everybody's had a chance to review our earnings release documents that were available on our website.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For
further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
With that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments before
Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Take it away, Brian.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter results.
I'm going to begin on slide two, and first, this quarter is another solid example of driving responsible growth at Bank of
America. My teammates continue to deliver for customers around the world, and not many companies have the sources
we have to help our clients drive the global economy. But with that, we understand that responsibility comes with

doing this, and we do it in a responsible way. Responsible growth is driving more sustainable returns for you as
shareholders also.
This quarter, we produced strong revenue growth. We drove cost savings that offset higher revenue-related cost, and
we managed risk well, and we returned more capital to you, our shareholders, through dividends and increased
repurchase of shares than any period since the crisis.
Turning to slide three. Our company produced earnings of $4.9 billion after-tax in the first quarter of 2017. Those
earnings were up 40% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by 700 basis points of operating leverage.
Revenue rose 7%, and we managed to keep overall expenses flat.
Our earnings per share were $0.41 per share. On a diluted basis, that was up 46%. This is the fourth quarter in a row
we've exceeded $0.40 of EPS per share. We did that in quarter one despite $1.4 billion of annual retirement-eligible
incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax costs. And importantly, we have done this in a responsible manner, not
reaching for growth outside of our established risk and customer framework. And we achieved this in an economy
which continues to grow in the 1.5% to 2% range.
On a year-over-year basis, our average deposits were up over $58 billion. Average loans were up $21 billion, and sales
and traded revenues, excluding DVA, were up 23% with better client activity. We saw $29 billion in long-term assets
under management flows this quarter within our wealth management business.
Asset quality remained strong with provision expense of $835 million. Net charge-offs were down 13% from the first
quarter of 2016 but were modestly up from the fourth quarter 2016 as expected from the normal seasonality, especially
in consumer credit cards.
Regarding progress against long-term metrics, the first task the company had many years ago was to become stabilized,
then it was to reduce our legacy costs and simplify the place, and then we drove towards sustainably of results. Once
results became more sustainable, we pushed towards generating return on tangible common equity above our cost of
capital. We now have shown that we have a return on tangible common equity in the double digits for last 4 quarters.
And keep in mind that we have been doing this where our capital continues to build. The next step is to push that
towards our 12% target.
This quarter, our return on tangible common equity was 10% where return on assets was 88 basis points. These are
reported numbers. The efficiency ratio was 67%. These figures reflect solid progress in this quarter against our
long-term targets but are even closer if you were to allocate the seasonal aspects of the retirement-eligible
compensation cost and elevated payroll tax expenses across the years as just opposed to putting it all in the first quarter.
And even though quarter one is typically a good capital markets quarter for us, if you just spread those costs, you'll see
that across all the quarters, the metrics this quarter would have been reflected in efficiency ratio of near 62%, a return
on assets of nearly 100 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 12%. So simply put, we're getting there.
On slide four, as I mentioned, the key to profitability in this environment is to drive good core customer growth and
revenue while controlling our cost to drive operating leverage. We have established record for the past several years of
producing quarterly operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.
This quarter, you can see on the slide 4, that our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis across each of our business
segments. We're also able to hold the expenses overall in the company flat through the careful management of costs. As
you can see on this slide, there's 700 basis points of operate leverage for the total company.
Some of our businesses like our Consumer business have been driving operating leverage consistently for many years
in a row now. Some, like our Global Banking business, are using operating leverage to drive the company to the best
line of business efficiency ratio among our businesses.
Other businesses continue to have leverage opportunities are becoming more clear. This is the case in our wealth
management or our Global Markets businesses.

As we turn to slide five, you can see the line of business results. Each business improved their efficiency ratios. Each
line of business reported returns well above the firm's cost of capital. Consumer Banking continued its strong
performance and transformation, produced $1.9 billion in after-tax earnings this quarter, growing 7%. And on a pre-tax,
pre-provision basis, PPNR, which excludes the prior year's sizable reserve release, the PPNR was up 17%
year-over-year. The efficiency ratio in this business was down 500 basis points to 53%.
Global Wealth and Investment Management improved earnings 4%, earning $770 million after-tax, improving its profit
margin to 27%. This is a new record for the business.
Our Global Banking business produced a record revenue quarter led by strong investment banking results, and that
generated $1.7 billion in after-tax earnings. It remains our most efficient operating business at 44%.
Lastly, our Global Markets business earned $1.3 billion in after-tax earning, generating a 15% return on its allocated
capital. Improved performance in sales and trading revenue combined with strong expense discipline drove those
results. All Other categories shows a loss, driven mostly by the $1 billion in first quarter FAS 123 cost and related
personnel taxes, which gets allocated across the business segments throughout the year. But the reduction in losses
year-over-year was driven by improved operating costs in the company and lower litigation expense.
As you'll see from the slides Paul will walk you through later, our business have important leadership positions across
the board. We believe they have room to grow both market share by deepening relationships with existing customers
and by winning customers from the competition. Overall, I'm pleased with the results this quarter. We grew the top
line, we grew the bottom line, and we did it the right way, all while making significant investments in people,
technology, more capabilities for our customers. And all that will bode well for future growth.
While many of you might focus on rates and our leverage to rising rates, note that the $1.5 billion in year-over-year
revenue growth is split 40% for NII, which is driven by rates and by also the growth in loan and deposit balances. And
the other 60% was driven through non-interest revenue.
As you know, we remain focused on things we know we can control and drive. We maintain our discipline on both
expenses and pricing. Our rates paid has remained steady at nine basis points on deposits while, at the same time, we
have grown those deposits 5% year-over-year, $58 billion.
On lending activity there's been a lot of discussion regarding a slowdown. In our core middle market business,
representing a broad base of American companies, our business loans grew 7% year-over-year. In our smaller business
segments, business banking and small business, we're up 3%, and small business had the best production quarter in its
history.
We assisted our Markets clients with their financing needs, which also put capital in the system for economic growth.
All this growth occurred in a sub-2% GDP growth environment. Our clients stand ready, they're engaged, and they're
ready to grow faster as the economy continues to grow and improve.
Now let me turn it over to Paul to go through the other details about the quarter. Paul?
Paul M. Donofrio
Thanks, Brian.
I will start with the balance sheet on page six. Overall, end-of-period assets increased $60 billion from Q4. The growth
was fairly evenly split between two elements: first, we saw higher trading-related assets in Global Markets business
with incremental customer activity following a seasonal slowdown at the end of Q4; secondly, we had higher cash
levels driven by seasonal deposit growth, primarily from tax refunds. Deposits rose $55 billion or 5% from Q1 2016
and are up $11 billion from Q4. Q1 deposit growth was primarily driven by customer tax refunds in our Consumer
business.

Loans on end-of-period basis were steady with Q4 as solid Commercial growth was offset by seasonal declines in
credit card and runoff of legacy non-core loans. Lastly, common equity increased $1.3 billion compared to Q4 as $4.4
billion in net income available to common was reduced by $3 billion and capital returned to shareholders through
dividends and net share repurchases.
Global liquidity sources increased in the quarter, driven by higher deposit flows and bank funding. We remain well
compliant with fully phased-in U.S. LCR requirements. Book value per share rose 5% from Q1 2016 to $24.36.
Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended
the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, compared to Q4, the CET1 ratio improved 20 basis points to 11% and
remains well above our 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET1 capital increased $1.6 billion to $164 billion, driven by
earnings and the utilization of deferred tax assets offset by return of capital. The ratio also benefited from a $14 billion
decline in RWA, driven by lower exposure in our Global Markets business, lower card exposure and a legacy asset
runoff.
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach, which remains relevant for CCAR comparison
purposes. Here, our CET1 ratio is 10 basis points higher at 11.6%. Supplementing leverage ratios both for parent and
bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018.
Turning to slide seven and on an average basis total loans were up $21 billion or 2% from Q1 2016. Loan growth in our
business segments was primarily offset by continued runoff in non-core consumer real estate loans in All Other.
Year-over-year loans in All Other were down $23 billion. On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up
$44 billion or 6%.
Consumer Banking led with 8% growth. We continue to see good growth in residential mortgages although
originations slowed in Q1 2017, given the increase in mortgage rates in Q4 and Q1. We saw growth in credit card and
vehicle loans. Home equity pay-downs continue to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw a
year-over-year growth of 7%, driven by residential mortgages. Global Banking loans were up 4% year-over-year.
Loans in our Commercial business grew 6% year-over-year despite a slight reduction in commercial real estate. We
think these growth rates are responsible given the economy grew around 2% year-over-year. Middle market revolver
utilization rates have now climbed back to record levels. On the bottom of the chart, note the $58 billion, 5%
year-over-year growth in average deposits, which is driven by 10% growth in Consumer Banking.
Turning to asset quality on slide eight. The stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects many years now of
disciplined client selection and strong underwriting practices that are foundational to our responsible growth and
through-the-cycle performance. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-off of $934 million or 42 basis points
on average loans increased slightly from Q4 due to expected seasonality in our credit card products, but were down
13% from Q1 2016.
Provision expense of $835 million rose $61 million from Q4 but was down $162 million from Q1 2016. Net reserve
releases in the quarter of $99 million was fairly consistent with Q4 and the year-ago quarter. Note that Q1 2016
included a significant increase in reserves in Global Banking for energy exposures. That was mostly offset by releases
in consumer reserves in that quarter. Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance-to-loan ratio of 125 basis
points and a coverage level three times our annual charge-offs. NPLs and reservable criticized exposure both declined
notably.
On slide nine, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. On the Consumer
chart, you can see the impact of the seasonal increase in credit card losses. Note that delinquency trends remain low and
improved modestly from Q4. Commercial losses continue to be low.
Turning to slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.1 billion, $11.3 billion on an FTE basis.
NII improved $730 million from Q4, primarily due to higher rates. The net interest yield increased 16 basis points to
2.39% from Q4 as loan yields improved 17% while the rates we paid on deposits was flat at nine basis points. Q4 and
Q1 increases in long-end interest rates resulted in slower prepaids and less premium amortization on our securities

portfolio this quarter. Increases in the short end in terms of interest rates caused our variable rate assets to reprice
higher while we maintained good pricing discipline on deposits. We also benefited from normal seasonality in Q1 in
our leasing business. And in addition, we benefited from less unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness as compared to Q4.
But one can think of the reduction in the hedge ineffectiveness as roughly offset by two fewer days in the quarter.
Now as Brian mentioned, we remain disciplined around deposit pricing given the investment we have made in
customer relationships through Preferred Rewards and other deepening activities. So your natural next question is what
should shareholders expect for Q2 with respect to NII given the March rate hike by the Fed? Based on our models and
assumptions, we believe NII should continue to improve, but the improvement is expected to be much more modest
than Q4 to Q1 driven by a number of factors, most notably, the increase in long-term rates in Q1, in Q4 and Q1 drove a
significant portion of the Q1 improvement.
In terms of Q2, think about it this way. Given where we are today, with the Fed funds rate hike in March and the long
end down since the end of the first quarter, I would focus you on our asset sensitivity disclosures. As of 3/31, an
instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.3 billion over the subsequent
12 months, which is consistent with our position at year-end. Nearly three quarters or $2.5 billion of this modeling is
driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates. Given a one month LIBOR rise of about 25 basis points with the March
hike and the long end down, we should focus on the $2.5 billion short-end benefit. Dividing that by 4 gets you to a
quarterly run rate of roughly $600 million for a 100-basis point shock. Assuming it's only 25 basis points instead of 100
would get you to approximately $150 million benefit in the quarter. From there, we would expect continued modest
growth in NII in the second half of 2017 assuming modest growth in loans and deposits and rates at least above where
they are today.
Turning to slide 11. Non-interest expense was $14.8 billion. We were able to hold expense flat compared to Q1 2016
despite 9% growth in non-interest income and several other expense headwinds. The efficiency ratio improved 400
basis points year-over-year. And if you allocate Q1's $1.4 billion of incentive for retirement-eligible employees and the
seasonally elevated payroll tax across all four quarters, then the efficiency ratio would be 62%.
Our company-wide simplification efforts and the $110 million in lower litigation cost offset a number of higher
expenses year-over-year, including $150 million of higher incentives for annual retirement-eligible employees and
seasonally elevated payroll taxes; $190 million of higher incentives associated with revenue growth across wealth
management, Global Banking and Global Markets; and $160 million of higher expenses due to changes in our share
price with respect to accounting for employee stock-based awards. The year-over-year swing is caused by the share
price decline in Q1 2016 compared to an increase in Q1 2017. We also had $100 million in higher quarterly cost for
FDIC assessments. Finally, note that employees are down 2% from Q1 2016, and we continue to add client-facing
associates.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 12. Consumer Banking had another
solid quarter. This segment produced $1.9 billion in earnings, growing 7% year-over-year and returning 21% on
allocated capital. Note that that 21% return is on $37 billion of allocated capital, which is an increase of $3 billion this
quarter given growth in their loans and deposits.
On a pre-tax pre-provision basis, which adjusts for the sizable release of reserves in Q1 2016, earnings rose $559
million or 17%. Year-over-year, average loans grew 8%. Average deposits grew 10%, and Merrill Edge brokerage
assets grew 21%. That drove revenue growth of 5% led by a 9% increase in NII from Q1 2016. Note that the rate paid
on deposits in this business declined 1 basis point year-over-year to 3 basis points as a result of disciplined pricing.
Non-interest income included improvements in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than
offset by decline in mortgage banking income. The decline in mortgage banking income was due to both lower
volumes from less refinancings as well as our strategy of holding more of our production on our balance sheet versus
selling it to the agencies. Through continued efforts to drive down costs, the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis
points to 53%. Cost reductions also helped drive the cost of deposits down 10 basis points from Q1 2016.

Consumer Banking credit quality remained solid, with the net charge-off ratio declining 4 basis points to 121 basis
points.
Turning to slide 13 and looking at key trends. First, as usual, on the upper left, the statutory reminder of our strong
competitive position. Second, as we point out each quarter, while we report NII and non-interest income separately, our
strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage
through expense discipline.
So as you review the top boxes on this page, note that we drove 8% operating leverage this quarter. Also, note that our
relationship deepening is improving NII and balance growth, while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for
doing more business with us.
Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $57 billion or 10% year-over-year, outpacing the industry.
Importantly 50% of these deposits are checking accounts, and we estimate that 89% of these checking accounts are the
primary accounts of households. This means these are operational accounts used to pay mortgages and car payments
and other bills, so outflows chasing rates is less likely in our view. We also believe these deposit accounts offer clients
significant value in terms of transparency, convenience and safety, which also means they are less likely to move their
relationships.
With respect to card, spending levels and new issuances were solid. However, the industry's trend of increasing rewards
continues to mitigate our overall card revenue growth. Digitalization and other productivity improvements as well as
lower fraud costs continue to lead expenses lower. Expenses declined 3% from Q1 2016 despite increases in the FDIC
assessment rate and charges. Focusing on client balances on the bottom left, you can see the success we continue to
have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets.
Merrill Edge continues to attract customers who want a self-service investment option as accounts are up 11% from Q1
2016. We now have more than 1.7 million households that leverage our Financial Solution Advisors and self-directed
investment platform. This quarter also included the successful rollout of Merrill Edge Guided Investing for clients who
want some advice from our CAO office but don't desire a fully advise relationship.
With respect to loans, residential mortgages continue to lead our growth. As expected, the sudden rise in long-term
rates in late 2016 caused a noticeable decline in mortgage production from Q1. While mortgage originations was down,
we continue to hold more of our loans on the balance sheet. In Q1, we retained about 80% of first mortgage production
on the balance sheet. We believe retaining these mortgages will provide better economics over time, plus retention
deepens our relationship with these customers.
Consumer vehicle lending remained solid, up 12% year-over-year, and we continue to remain focused on prime and
super-prime borrowers. Our net charge-offs at 38 basis points remain not only low, but also lowest among peers. U.S.
consumer card average balances grew 3% year-over-year, and spending on our credit cards was up 8% compared to Q1
2016.
Turning to slide 14, we remain a leader in digital banking. And we continue to see momentum in digital banking
adoption. Given the rollout of Zelle this quarter, Bank of America customers can now use their online app to transfer
money, request money and split bills person to person with more ease than before.
While still in its infancy, customers sent $8 billion in payments through our person to person apps in Q1, which is up
25% year-over-year. Importantly, as digital banking adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and
self-service, we expect to see continued improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Mobile devices now account for one out of every five deposit transactions and represent the volume of nearly 1,000
financial centers. Sales on digital devices continue to grow and now represent 22% of total sales. Still, with all the
digital activity, we have not forgotten and remain focused on the 800,000 people walking into our financial centers
across the U.S. on a daily basis.
Many of these customers still use our branches to transact, but many others use our branches as financial destinations,
where they can learn more about products and services, work face to face with a specialized professional and generally

improve their financial lives. We want to encourage that, and that's why we have an extensive branch refurbishing
underway. By the way, that's also helping increase customer satisfaction.
We're also building new centers in markets where we have never had financial centers but where we have presence
across Global Banking, wealth management or both. These markets include MSAs like Denver, Minneapolis and
Indianapolis. In addition, we are testing smart centers, which utilize video-assisted ATMs and other video
[indiscernible] (27:49) conferencing capabilities in regions where it makes sense.
Turning to slide 15, let's review Global Wealth and Investment Management, which produced earnings of $770 million
and record pre-tax operating margin of 27% while returning 22% on allocated capital. These solid results were
produced in a period of change for the industry as firms and clients anticipate new fiduciary standards and other market
dynamics such as the shift between active and passive investing.
Net interest income rose 3%, driven by loan growth. Year-over-year, non-interest income also rose 3% as 8% higher
asset management fees were partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Year-over-year, while total revenue grew
3%, expenses grew 2%, creating an important but modest operating leverage. Also, note the $29 billion of long-term
AUM flows this quarter, reflecting strong client activity as well as the continuing shift from IRA brokerage to AUM.
Moving to slide 16. We continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances climbed to nearly $2.6 trillion,
driven by higher market values, solid long-term AUM flows and continued loan growth. Average deposits of $257
billion were flat compared to Q4, while ending deposits were down, primarily reflecting some movement to investment
assets. Average loans of $148 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Loan growth remains concentrated in consumer real
estate.
Turning to slide 17, Global Banking had record revenue this quarter, up 11% year-over-year led by investment banking
activity. Revenue growth coupled with expense management improved the efficiency ratio 500 basis points to 44%.
In addition, provision expense of $17 million in Q1 2017 was more closely aligned with charge-offs, while Q1 2016
included approximately $500 million in reserve increases for energy exposure. This resulted in a 58% year-over-year
improvement in earnings to $1.7 billion.
Global Banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, albeit at a slower pace. Total
investment banking fees for the company were $1.6 billion, which was up a 37% from Q1 2016. By comparison,
overall industry fee pools were up 19% year-over-year.
A number of items to note, given the strong performance. First, this was a record Q1 in terms of revenue from IB fees.
Client underwriting activity in the capital markets was quite strong. We also earned record M&A fees this quarter with
involvement in six of the top ten completed transactions.
Debt underwriting was up 38% year-over-year, led by strong performance in leveraged finance. Equity underwriting
was up 65% year-over-year. Expenses decreased from Q1 2016, despite higher revenue related incentives, higher FDIC
insurance costs and costs associated with adding 340 new relationship managers over the past couple of years. Return
on allocated capital increased to 18% despite adding $3 billion of allocated capital this quarter.
Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q1 last year. Average loans were up $14 billion or 4%. Growth was
driven by our commercial bank, where lending was up 6% despite subdued real estate lending. As Brian said, we feel
good about this growth rate given 2% GDP environment.
We stand ready to support clients who want to borrow directly from us or tap the capital markets. One of the benefits of
our universal banking model is our ability to deliver for clients across a complete product set and geographies. Average
deposits increased 2% from Q1 2016. As expected, we saw a seasonal decline in deposits from Q4. We remain mindful
of LCR rules as we grow deposits.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 19. The business had a strong quarter, which, once again, benefited from the
breadth of our product and geographic footprint with leadership positions in a number of areas. This quarter saw strong
issuer activity and tighter spreads across credit products, which played well to our strength in mortgage and corporate

credit. The business improved operating leverage with revenue, excluding DVA, growing 27% while expenses
increased modestly after adjusting for litigation recovery in Q1 2016.
Global Markets earned $1.3 billion and returned 15% on allocated capital. This includes a reduction of capital of $2
billion, given the great work the team has done optimizing the balance sheet and reducing RWA in the past year.
It is worth noting that we achieved these results with a lower VaR and 6% fewer people than last year. With respect to
expenses, Q1 2016 litigation included a sizable litigation recovery. Excluding litigation, year-over-year expenses were
up 2% while revenue grew 19%.
Moving to trends on slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading
revenue of $4 billion, excluding net DVA, was up 23% from Q1 2016. Excluding net DVA and versus Q1 2016, FICC
sales and trading of $2.9 billion increased 29%. Within FICC, the year-over-year improvement was driven by improved
client activity and corporate credit and mortgage products.
Equity sales and trading was up 7% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, despite weaker cash equity volumes. We saw
increased activity in Europe and Asia across all products. We also are beginning to see the benefits of deploying
additional balance sheet to meet the financing needs of clients.
On slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a net loss of $834 million. This was an improvement from Q1 2016,
driven by lower litigation and mortgage servicing costs. The only other thing worth pointing out here is a reminder that
this is where we book the annual retirement eligible incentive and elevated Q1 payroll tax before they get allocated out
to a line of business throughout the year.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% and included approximately $200 million of tax benefit from the
deductions on deliveries of share-based awards exceeding the related compensation costs. A recent change in
accounting rules requires booking this difference to the tax income expense instead of directly to equity. The effective
tax rate would have been 29.4% excluding this benefit, which is in line with our expectation of approximately 30% for
the rest of the year.
Okay. A few summary points as I wrap up. This quarter shows the value of our businesses as rates begin to rise and as
we experience increased capital markets activity. For years, we have stayed focus on growing responsibly, including
staying within our risk and client frameworks and making our growth more sustainable by simplifying the company
and improving efficiency.
In Q1, consistent with this strategy, we stuck to our strong underwriting standards while growing loans and trading
assets. Asset quality remains strong, and net charge-offs low. We grew deposits while managing deposit rate paid. We
grew AUM while helping clients adapt to a changing industry. When client activity picked up, we were ready with a
breadth of capabilities to raise capital and manage risk in major markets all around the world.
We continue to invest in new technology and capabilities while adding sales professionals in certain businesses. We
lowered non-personnel expenses, offsetting some seasonal and other expense headwinds this quarter. We created
operating leverage in each of our business segments, and we returned more capital to shareholders than in any quarter
since the financial crisis.
These results tell us that responsible growth is working, with more to come as the economy continues to improve.
Many of you have been waiting patiently for us to approach our long-term targets. I hope you noted that, if one
allocates annual retirement eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax throughout the year, we are basically
at our return targets this quarter. We know we have more work to do to be consistently achieving all our targets, but we
have more confidence than ever that responsible growth will get us there.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. First, a very quickie. Did you mention what NPLs you sold during the
quarter and if there was any P&L impact?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Small and small. Small sales, small impact.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No problem. I'm curious. I think we've all taken note of the responsible growth, what you've
done, heard your comments on it relative to the economy. I'm curious, as we watch the industry loan growth come
down for a bunch of different reasons, can BofA continue on this path? I don't want to say irregardless of what the
industry backdrop is, but can it buck the trend of the decline in loan growth that we're seeing in most other places?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Glenn, it's Brian. I think, at the end of the day, banks reflect the economy and help make
the economy happen. So we've been able to grow loans 5%, 6% in the core middle market segment, 7% actually
year-over-year. Credit cards been picking up a little bit, home equity strong, residential mortgage down. So if you look
at it overall, we've been able to outgrow the economy, but we're going to be dependent upon the economy keep
growing.
But what we've shown you across the last couple years, with the discipline we have for driving deeper penetration in
our customers, working hard on our relationships even with the repositioning portfolios that you can see in some of the
slides and/or making sure that we maintain great discipline, we'd be able to grow the mid-single digits as we've told you
against the backdrop of an economy growing at 1.5% to 2%. If that goes faster, we'll grow faster. If that stays in that
range, we should be able to continue to grow at that level.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Maybe on the credit front, as you've mentioned credit's awesome in most places, and I
saw criticized credit came down with energy improving. Are there any areas that are criticized credits increasing like
something like retail?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: No. Credit looks good across the board, and it's performing as we model and expect.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, last little one. Zelle, you mentioned the increase in Zelle activity. Do you make money on
that, or is that mostly a customer retention tool?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, Glenn, think about it this way, is the way people pay each other. So you don't – we
don't charge for it. It's just a service as part of a core DDA account just like checks or just like an ATM card would be
to withdraw. It's just a more efficient for the customer, more efficient for us too, ultimately, because the payback will
be taking cash out of the system.
And so year-to-date, we're up about – even before Zelle is announced for the first quarter P2P payments at Bank of
America up 25% first quarter of 2017 versus first quarter 2016. So this is growing fast and will continue to grow. What
we'll do a swap out other payment forms, which cost us more to execute, but it's free to the customer.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Great. Appreciate all the answers. Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from John McDonald from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning. Paul, just a clarification regarding the second quarter framework you
provided for net interest income. Does the $150 million potential bump based on the disclosures include the benefit of
loan growth or was that just the rate impact and could it be a little better if loan growth continues?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Well, the loan growth is embedded in our 100-basis-point shock. So, theoretically, it
includes it. But if loan growth's a little bit better than we think, it could be better. If it's a little lower, it would be less.

That's one of the variables that we have to think about when we think about NII growth.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, just one of the things to keep in mind there is, remember, we just capitalized or put
in a run rate, for lack of a better term, $600 million plus fourth quarter to first quarter. And this is on top of that too.
That first benefit as you think for the year, that benefit is now locked in and moves its way through the system.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. So it's incremental to the 1Q print. Okay. And then can you remind us what
kind of deposit repricing beta you assumed in the disclosures, Paul?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. So on a 100-basis-point rise on interest-bearing deposits – and remember, we have a
large amount of non-interest-bearing deposits. But on interest-bearing deposits, we're kind of low 50-ish for that full
100-basis-point rise.
As you can expect, the first 25, 50 of the 100 is going to be a little bit different than the second 25 or 50. And that's
about as much that I want to give you, given the competitiveness around this topic.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. A separate question on capital. With the CET1 at 11% now versus the 2019
requirement of 9.5%, what kind of buffers are you thinking of holding? And what level of CET1 feels right like the
right target for you longer term?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So with respect to buffers, I wouldn't want to give an exact number for all sorts of reasons.
We put a lot of thought into how we manage our capital and liability structure, including buffers. Having said that, we
have 150 basis points of cushion right now on fully phased-in minimums and a lot of time between now and 2019. So
maybe we'll talk more about it as we get a little closer. But right now, we feel good where we are.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Morning.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: So just wanted to kick things off with a question on the 2018 expense target of $53 billion that
you guys had outlined on previous calls. Can you just remind us what the revenue growth assumptions were
underlining that target? And just given some of the acceleration that we've seen in fee income growth and the higher
incentive comp, is that still an achievable target in your view?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The revenue growth assumptions were, like we said, long term we believe we can grow
faster than GDP growth, and that's embedded in those assumptions. I think the way for you, Steve, to think about is,
look at the Global Markets year-over-year and what you see there is with that substantial rise in revenue, the expense
growth absent last year, we had a credit in litigation, this year we had an expense, so you had a pretty good reversal
there.
Absent that, it was 2% growth. And as Paul said, had 6% less people. Comp expenses were up a bit, even though
revenue was up quite a bit. So we can manage against that with the inevitable thing that if revenue grows faster, we
might have a little bit more expense pressure. But I think we'll be very happy to see that happen.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, the only thing I would add for just for the record is when we gave that guidance
around this time last year, we specifically said it was based upon the economic environment at that time and that if
things got better, we'd have to adjust. If things got worse, we'd have to adjust.

Having said all that – that's just for the record – having said all that, we're still focused and confident we can get to the
$53 billion – approximately $53 billion for full year 2018. That's what we said.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Got it. And then just one question on the provision outlook. Just given the continued favorable
credit and delinquency trends, how should we be thinking about the trajectory in the near term? Is the run rate of
around $850 million plus or minus a reasonable target?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: The way I would think about it, in Q2 provisions should roughly match net charge-offs. But,
remember, we're bouncing around the bottom with respect to net charge-offs in Commercial. So a material credit can
move the needle one way or the other.
Absent that caution, we will build as we grow loan balances. But we should expect to see that offset, perhaps, by
further runoff of non-core consumer real estate and we have a high energy reserve.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Great. Thanks, Paul. And just one final question on capital return, just touching on John's last
question. How should we be thinking about the capital return trajectory, given the 150 basis points of excess?
I'm also wondering whether some of the recent rhetoric from the regulators suggesting a disinclination of sorts to have
a qualitative CCAR failures, whether that informs your approach at all in terms of future payouts.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think we have been building our capital ask year-over-year, and you should expect us to
continue to do that since we have both a strong cushion under CCAR. We'll see with this year's results, we don't know
yet obviously. But from last year, just extrapolating, and also our start point is higher, and our run rate of earnings is
now very consistent. So capital return's part of our story, we'll continue to pursue it.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We've made progress every year, you've seen that, and I would remind everybody that we
tapped the de minimis last year as well. So with the stability of our earnings, with the progress we're making on CCAR,
as Brian said, we hope to continue to make progress.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong quarter.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, morning. Just a first clarification, just coming back to the NII commentary, does the 150
also incorporate the extra day you get in the second quarter, because that's usually pretty meaningful for you guys?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah, I would think about the extra day as kind of being offset by the seasonality we have in
Q1 for leasing.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. So you're say you've got a benefit in the first, and that kind of washes through the second. So
really, your net is the 150?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah, approximately 150, and as you know, there's a lot of things that go into that modeling.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood. Okay, great. So, on the consumer fee side, I wanted to just ask, we saw kind of a little
bit of a positive turn in both card income and also in the brokerage line, which is first time in a while we've seen both
of those move the right way. Any better line of sight at this point on just the trends getting better underneath the
surface, whether it's the rewards competition or the fee capture pressures in brokerage kind of starting to get into the
run rate, and we can kind of expect to see growth from here?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, we've seen modest growth in card balances. We think that should continue. We're
adding new accounts. We added 1.2 million cards this quarter. Combined debit/credit spend was good year-over-year
and really good recently. But as you point out, the card income line remains – I think, in terms of growth, remains

muted by competition around customer rewards.
I guess, what I would point out and just remind everybody is that just focusing on the fee income line sort of ignores
some of the key benefits of our strategy, which is attract relatively higher quality card customers and reward them for
deepening their relationships with us.
This strategy, we think, is driving incremental deposit growth and making them stickier, and that helps NII. And by the
way, these customers have lower loss rates as well as reduced need to interact with call centers. So that helps us lower
costs. In terms of the service line or service charges, they've shown some modest growth driven by growth in new
accounts. And we expect that probably to continue here.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: And can you just touch on brokerage?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: You mean brokerage...
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Wealth and brokerage.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. Well, wealth and brokerage is being driven by the long-term trend that we've been
seeing with growth in AUM, as transactional brokerage continues to decline. We saw that again this quarter. This
quarter, we had significant growth in AUM, which offset that sort of continuing decline in brokerage. I think AUM fees
were up 8% this quarter.

And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: A couple of questions. One on the expense discussion earlier. On page four, you
highlighted very clearly the strong operating leverage that you've got year-over-year for the various industries, various
segments that you run. So the question I have is, where should we expect the next leg of improvement on expenses
could come from? Because one of the questions I've gotten from people today is, this is fantastic operating leverage,
but where are the levers to take it further?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, I think when we started a few years ago at $70 billion operating expenses to bring it
down to this level, it was more obvious. Betsy, now it's everywhere. It's everywhere, a little bit everywhere and a lot of
hard work. So the head count generally is drifting down, year-over-year term, 4,000, 5,000 people. That gets harder, but
what we're doing is taking out people and putting them into the frontline in the client-facing roles, and so we're seeing
that shift go on.
We're continuing to work our real estate portfolio down again through co-locations in cities. So you'll see us take three
buildings in an area and put them in one, and you've seen some announcement in that regard. In our data centers, we're
accelerating the process to consolidate data centers, and that helps continue to knock down the number of data centers.
It takes $0.5 billion investment or $0.25 billion investment to build one to bring it in. And so you'll see that go on. And
then it's everywhere return, every place we look just keep working at the pieces.
But at the end of the day, continue to watch the FTE head count numbers drift down and also how we move those
around from less managers to more client-facing people and less layers in the company, which we've been after. And so
it is just hard work across the board using our Simplify and Improve and what we call organizational health going on in
our company, and we're seeing the aspects of that.

That, by the way, I think, last, in 2016, to give you an example, I think, we invested about – we got about $400 million,
$500 million in savings from some ideas. But it took us an investment of a couple of hundred million dollars to get that.
And so...
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: ... even that investment rate is important to getting the sales out. And so we're not asking
you to exclude, but there's severance cost in here, there's real estate reposition costs, all of that, which actually comes
down as you get further and further towards the optimization level.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So that speaks to why you can continue the revenue growth but yet still bring
the expenses down. Got it. Two other quick ones. One, on fixed income, you mentioned that credit was a source of
strength this quarter. Others have highlighted credit as a weakness. So maybe you could speak to what you're seeing in
your client base that drove such a strong credit quarter in effect?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Well, first, I would say, look, we've been making a lot of investments in our Global Markets
business across equity, across macro. Credit has always been a traditional strength of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a
lot of very strong bankers combined with strong sales and trading effort.
Corporates raised money this quarter in the capital markets. We have a strong relationship. So we saw a lot of increased
activity on the primary side, which helps your sales and trading on the secondary side. That's one.
Two, with spreads tightening a little bit and with clients activity picking up, as they were repositioning, given the
change in markets, the change in spreads, again, we have a strong corporate credit trading desk. We have strong special
situations in credit. We have a strong mortgage, and they just saw a lot of client activity, given what happened in the
quarter.
So we've often said, when client activity picks up, you're going to see this business perform. And for us, client activity
was more this quarter, and it showed up in our results.
And again lastly, it's a breadth of products. It's significant presence in scale in every major market around the world. So
it's not just the U.S. We saw activity in emerging markets around the globe. And we were there for when our clients
needed us.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, you mentioned on the call during the prepared
remarks that you 'remain mindful' of the LCR rules as we grow deposits. Could you elaborate on your thoughts behind
that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure, particularly on the wholesale side, there are three types of deposits fundamentally,
25%, 40% and 100% runoff. And as we think about serving our customers and clients, we're mindful, very mindful of
their needs, but we're also focused on maintaining those. Having deposits of the highest quality in terms of being able
to use to lend out to customers, so that means you've got to focus on the 25% and 40% or the more – the deposits that
are much more operational in nature, deposits that we know our corporate and FI clients are using to run their
businesses.
We're focused on growing those deposits, and we're focused on helping them use those deposits to pay bills and to
move their money around, to do FX, all the things you might think an individual does, but just on the corporate side.
Those are the types of deposits we're focused on. We're respectful of clients who want to give us other types of
deposits, but we're having conversations about them about the value of those and therefore what they should expect in
terms of pricing.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Paul, thanks very much and Brian, thanks a lot.

And we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good morning, Brian, and good morning, Paul.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Gerard.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Hi.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Brian, when you look out longer term, and if you turn back the clock, when the industry
before the financial crisis typically earned 120 on assets or 130 basis points on assets in a more normal interest rate
environment, what do you see further along?
I know ROE is what you focus on, and we all do. But from an ROA standpoint, when everything's going right for Bank
of America, the expenses are where you want them to be, the margins are where you want them to be, what kind of
ROA do you think this company is capable of producing?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, I think, Gerard, just the focus we've talked to you about getting at above 100 basis
points and then with the adjustments of sort of smoothing out the first quarter a little bit from the one-time sort of
annual expenses that occur in the first quarter, you're getting close to that.
That is not an aspirational goal, which we'll stop at. I mean, I think, it'll improve, if the rate structure continues to move
up and the economy continues to grow, we'll get above that. But the first order of business is to get above – to get to
that so that we get the returns on tangible common equity and returns on equity where we want them to be.
As you're thinking about that just more broadly, remember that we have a balance sheet of $2.3 trillion or so and think
about $500 billion basically being completely liquid assets, that is a far different cry than we were – when our balance
sheet sort of at the high point was $2.7 trillion, and we probably had $200 billion or $100 billion to $200 billion of high
quality assets or whatever the moniker we've used back then was.
That's going to knock around your yields on your balance sheet. And so we do focus on ROA in our company because
it basically is the thing that ultimately drive ROE. That this equity builds, their ROE can be under pressure just from
increases in equity. But if you think about it, the real driver of the yield on the balance sheet has more to do with the
amount of assets you're carrying which are underleveraged for purposes of liquidity and safety and soundness.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Right. Okay, thanks. And speaking of the lever on the equity, can you remind us what the
risk-weighted assets are now for the operational risk for you guys?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. We have $500 billion in RWA for operational risk, which is if I can go on a little bit,
which is one-third approximately of the RWA of the company under the advanced approach and more RWA than we
have for our credit.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. And then coming back to the combined payout ratio that you guys are striving for,
within that, what should we envision for once you get your capital levels to the point where you're very comfortable
with? Is a dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40% a reasonable expectation down the road when things more normalize?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: A couple things. One is our capital is more than sufficient. We're very comfortable with it
with a tangible common equity ratio, Gerard, thinking about before the crisis of 7.9% and a CET1 of 11% with a
minimum of 9.5%. We have more capital than the company needs by the different measures, whether it's a traditional
market-based measure or a regulatory measure. So we're completely comfortable with that.
That leads us to return more capital. You should expect our dividend payout ratio will – for the bigger companies, I
think, there'll be more focus of keeping that to 30% level that's been talked about in the various rules and regulations.
And if you go back three or four, five years ago, I spoke to that at one of our industry conferences, I think if you look
across time, that level of – just if you think about that level of payout against the earnings stream, there's very low
probability that you'll have real danger in the dividend, continuing that dividend even in tough times. So our goal is
never to keep the dividend stable and then use the excess capital to buy the stock back at around book value we think
it's great trade.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: [indiscernible] (1:00:42) then, Paul, just circling back to your comments about the FICC – the
strength in FICC, the client activity was strong, can you give us some color on the clients? Was it primarily investment
clients or hedge or pension funds, hedge funds? What type of clients did you see that strengthened activity?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think it was – the only way to really classify that it really across the board. I think we have
strengths in all of those client sets. There's just a lot of good sales and trading activity driven by client interest in
repositioning their investments but also again driven by [ph] prime new issuants (1:01:16) of our clients. We just have a
very broad and diverse product set in FICC, both from a product perspective and a geographic perspective, and that
kind of footprint and that kind of diversity when clients want to make changes, we're a natural call.

easier for all of us today. Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi, good morning, and congratulations on the results and on the progress. Couple of questions,
first, can you comment on the sustainability broadly of your returns in your Markets and Banking businesses? 15%
return on allocated equity in Markets, 18% Banking, despite the fact that you increased your capital allocation there.
Obviously, if you can sustain those kinds of returns, it goes a long way towards helping you hit your 12% RTCE targets
on a sustainable basis. So just can you comment broadly on how confident you are to – in your ability to, say, hit sort of
mid-teen returns in those businesses?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We have been getting in Global Markets a double-digit return now for a number of quarters.
It's been in the 10%-ish, 11% range for a number of quarters. So I feel like in Global Markets we've made a tremendous
amount of progress in improving returns.
In Global Banking, and remember this quarter they did 15%. But this quarter I think we had a very strong quarter in
sales and trading. Our performance in Global Markets is going to be a direct result of client activity as we say every
quarter. So when client activity is lower, our results will be lower, but through a number of different quarters now with
varying amount of client activity, I think we've been able to get that 10% or more return on equity. So that's how I'll
answer it from that perspective.
In Global Banking, again, those returns are somewhat dependent on client activity in investment banking, but there I
think the Global Banking segment is less volatile with respect to returns tied to the Investment Banking fee pool in any
given quarter.
We've got a diverse product set across Treasury Service, Traditional Corporate Banking products and Investment
Banking products. And then from a client perspective, we're the full spectrum: small, medium-sized and large global
companies. So there, I would expect us to be able to maintain that return level.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay, that's helpful. Yeah.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The thing I'd add to that is, if you think about what we did, we took Global Banking
because we think that's an integrated business, whether it's Corporate Investment Banking with both the Corporate side
and the Investment Banking side or middle market banking, what we call Global Commercial Banking, again with
Investment Banking, Capital Markets behind it, obviously, less than GCIB yield.
We split that out to show you that that business many years ago we broke Global Banking away from Global Markets
to show the distinctness of the business at Global Banking was more of annuity stream driven by Treasury Services
revenue, lending revenue and net investment banking fees, which ebb and flow based on client activity and returns are

fairly consistent, et cetera.
The flip side was we also wanted to show, I think, doing this five, six years ago when we first did it, have been doing it
ever since, and we're one of the few companies that does it on the Global Markets side. You can see that there's actually
more stability in that business than a lot of people thought.
So if you look at the low end, we might make $600 million, $700 million after-tax; on the high end, we made $1.3
billion this quarter, but you'll see this range. And if you look across years of quarters and look at comparative quarters
year-over-year because there's some seasonality, you'll see it's relatively stable. And so, we sort of hit that double-digit
level in the worst of quarters during a year and then in the best of quarters, it'll kick above it.
That was again how Tom and the team – Tom Montag and team -- run the business. The stability we put in and then
most importantly, was bringing the expense structure down dramatically five or six years ago, Tom and the team did by
almost $1 billion in quarter in operating expenses just in this Markets business alone and then maintaining it there and
continuing to push it down where revenues have stabilized and come back up.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Yeah. No. Thank you. That's helpful. I mean, obviously one of the things that's been helpful for
returns in banking is very benign credit environment, and I think commercial charge-offs were 10 basis points this
quarter. It hasn't really moved much in recent quarters, but how should we think about more of a sustainable level? And
is there anything there that makes you think that you could start to see some sort of inflection or some sort of an uptick
in terms of credit costs?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Are you referring to more sustainable on the net charge-off side?
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Yeah, exactly. On Commercial.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I guess, how I would answer the question is we have been – we changed our underwriting
standards years ago. We've been focused on responsible growth now for a number of years. We've been sticking with
that improved client selection, heightened credit standards. So the answer is we can't compare to a previous period in
the company's history.
We're just going to have to see how this develops, but we're very confident. We don't see anything today as we look at
what's going on in the marketplace that would suggest that we're at an inflection point. Doesn't mean that I won't be
talking to you next quarter about having lived through an inflection point, but we're not seeing anything right now that
would tell us that we should expect net charge-offs to rise in the near term.
In the long term, there is some seasoning going on in the credit card portfolio that we expect and we've talked about
before, but outside of that, we feel good about where our credit [ph] card (1:07:37) quality is.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great. Thanks. Yeah, I just had a quick question. I remember you were saying that both the
business or the Commercial customers and Consumer customers were optimistic still. But did you see a change in that
optimism over the course of the quarter? I mean, did it end lower at the end of the quarter given what was going on
with D.C. and everything else or was it fairly consistent?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I could say consistent. And if you looked at spending, I think, it actually maintained its
pace through the quarter. As an indicator of their behavior, March was a stronger month than the first two months of
the quarter.
Now, you can get into day counts and movements around which weekends fall, but just we didn't see any fall off in
terms of their behavior in spending, which I think is a good indicator of how they feel.

And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the net interest income one more time. I mean, it feels like
the 2Q expectation is a little bit less certainly versus what I would have thought. And I guess what I'm trying to figure
out is just some conservatism on the deposit or pricing assumption.
You talk about 50%, but it's been really insignificant so far for the Fed hikes. I'm trying to gauge, is it conservatism on
that? Is it the fact that 10-year has obviously come in a fair amount or some combination of both maybe?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So I'm not going to take you through the math again because the math is fairly
self-explanatory. But there are a lot of assumptions or I should call them assumptions but there's lot of things that go
into the modeling of NII.
You hit upon one of them. Obviously, we could have deposit betas that are different than what we're expecting as we're
doing our modeling. The 50 basis points obviously is for a full 100% shock. We're talking about a 25% shock. So it's
reasonable to expect that we would be lower than 50% for that first 25. I think the question is, how low should we be,
and we're just going to have to wait and see. We're very focused on the competitive environment. We're focused on the
needs and wants of our clients, and we're focused – we're balancing all of that against what our shareholders would
want us to do. So we're going to just have to see how it develops, but there's a lot of things that go into the modeling of
expected NII.
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: Okay, understood. And then just the impact of long-term rates, I mean, obviously, the
comment you made on rate leverage is for higher rates and you're 75% levered on the short-end. But as we think about
the decline here in long rates if it holds, how frame kind of the drag on that and I think it breeds in over time,
obviously, not all at once.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. The sensitivity on the long-end is a function of being able to reinvest as assets mature
at higher or lower rates than the average we have now and what it does to the amortization of our premium on our
securities portfolio. The latter is a bigger driver in the short-term. The former is a bigger driver in the long-term. If you
think about the company right now, where long-term rates are, we've said this on our other calls we're kind of – we
used to be at equilibrium where an asset rolling off the balance sheet was being replaced by assets rolling on the
balance sheet at roughly the same yield.
I would say we're in a little bit more positive place right now, even where rates are having long-term rates have gone up
here over the last two quarters, we're sort of in a position where an asset rolling off the balance sheet on average is
being replaced by an asset coming on at slightly higher yield. So I don't know if that helps you?
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: Yeah, no, that's very clear and very helpful. So, thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks. Two technical issues on the kind of net interest margin NII. When you look at the big
benefit in net interest margin, it seems like you had several things like the hedge ineffectiveness and leasing that pushed
the margin up, and even though you can have NII growth, your margin may even kind of just flatten out. Is there kind
of a bias towards the margin just being little bit higher given some of those moving pieces this particular quarter?

<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, the bulk of the increase from Q4 to Q1, the $700 million, the bulk of it was due to
rates. We just highlight that there was meaningful improvement that was driven by the leasing seasonality. Think about
that as roughly the kind of improvement we get with an extra day in the quarter.
And then there was, I think, significant improvement driven by the lack of hedge ineffectiveness in the first quarter
relative to what we experienced in the first quarter. But the bulk of it was driven by rates. And if you think about the
rate impact, more than half of the rate impact was driven by the long end as opposed to the short end.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And I would just focus in on the margin in a sense just like it was just rounded up because the
things that are going to help next quarter are going to help NII, which may not help the margin. But then the second
question was when you look at your transfer pricing mechanism, was curious because it doesn't seem like a lot of banks
would have the benefit from [indiscernible] (1:13:35) showing up in corporate other. Is your mechanism where it's still
spread some of that – does that matter on operating leverage for the business segments, so are the segments going to
benefit as rates go up more than corporate? It does seem like it's spread out more than other banks.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think over the longer – any one quarter, it could be a little bit lumpy how the company
overall benefits versus the segments. But I think over time, over multiple quarters, the segments will benefit. It's just
basically a function of how residual flows back to our segments.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: It is. It just seems like you've got a good methodology to push it to the segments, which is
helping operating leverage in each of those segments as you're getting that benefit. Thanks.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi. Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Another NII question actually. I'm just trying to
understand the mechanics of how your guidance in 4Q for a $6-billion uplift in NII for 100-basis-point shock has come
down to about $3.3 billion there. If I understand correctly, the long-end has increased.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: So that reduces your guidance going forward. Is that the way to think about it?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. I think, if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that the 100-basis-point rate shock at
the end of the year was basically the same as it is right now. You're referring to what we reported at the end of Q3
being 4-point something. And that decline in benefit we experienced as rates rose, and that went into our run rate of NII
that as Brian mentioned earlier.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: What I've got a difficulty understanding is why the past movements in your long rates should
affect your future guidance going forward. So if I think about hypothetically let's say the yield curve did actually go up
by 100 basis point shock in the fourth quarter, then your guidance going forward would actually be zero, based on the
way you view that. Is that the way to think about it, or am I missing it?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: You have to go back. If you look – you can follow up with Lee afterwards, but if we think
about what we told you in the fourth quarter, from the third to the fourth quarter, I think you may be off a quarter. From
the third to the fourth quarter, what we said is you basically capitalized into the earnings run rate. That $2 billion
difference is now in the earnings run rate, and that's what you're actually seeing, and that's the benefit of the lift in rates,
especially on the short term side. And so that is relatively stable now, because that piece went through it. So Lee can
follow up with you and take you through sort of the calculation, but it's because the good news is it showed up in
earnings this quarter as we said it would.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Oh, yeah. No, no, absolutely. I can see that. Just trying to see how that moves depending on the
shift in the curve.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, because the future investment rate on the long-term rates as it comes down as the

billion plus a quarter. So I'll get Lee to call you afterwards and take you through that.

Well, thank you all of you for your time. Just to remind you this is a quarter where we showed a responsible growth
coming through. Revenue growth of 7%, flat expenses, 700 basis points of operating leverage, across our franchise
good client growth in each of the business, and our asset quality remains strong. So we look forward to talking to you
