important information, and we advise you to read them. These filings will be available free of charge from the SEC, or
Dow, or Olin as applicable.
The agenda for today's call is on slide four. I will now turn the call over to Howard Ungerleider.
Howard I. Ungerleider
Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide five, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be yet another
strong quarter for Dow. Our results clearly demonstrate the consistency with which our strategic agenda and our focus
on execution are driving higher and more predictable earnings. We remain firmly on our growth trajectory, a fact that
you can see across multiple fronts. This marks our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating EPS, EBITDA
and margin growth. The strength of our portfolio enabled Dow to deliver operating earnings of $0.84 a share.
Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Four out of our five operating segments delivered earnings growth in the quarter.
Dow Automotive Systems achieved an all time EBITDA record, and Dow Electronic Materials, our Energy & Water,
our Polyurethanes, and our Packaging and Specialty Plastics businesses each achieved first quarter EBITDA records.
EBITDA margins expanded to the highest level since 2005, up 284 basis points versus the year ago period.
Performance Plastics, Performance Materials & Chemicals, Infrastructure Solutions and Consumer Solutions all drove
margin expansion in the quarter.
Our results illustrate that we were focused and we executed. We delivered operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, a first
quarter record and up more than $660 million. We returned $977 million to shareholders and declared dividends and
repurchases, and we made further progress against our portfolio management targets, most notably, through the signing
of a definitive agreement to divest Dow Chlorine Products, bringing the total of our portfolio actions well above our
stated targets.
We're proud of the performance the company delivered in the face of a 49% year-over-year drop in oil price combined
with a 15% year-over-year euro headwind. It's clear that this is not the commodity driven Dow Chemical from a decade
ago. This business model successfully navigated the fast-moving market dynamics with catalysts that will further
propel our growth. I'll provide an update on these in a moment. But first, let's take a closer look at the operating results
in the quarter.
Turning to slide six, revenue was $12.4 billion with solid demand for Dow products across all geographic regions
excluding divestitures, with particular strength in our emerging geographies, most notably China, which was up 10%.
Volume increases were led by Performance Plastics up 6%, and Performance Materials & Chemicals and Consumer
Solutions both up 5%, despite 15% price declines at the company level, primarily due to significant oil and currency
headwinds.
Let's turn to the segment highlights on slide eight. Ag Sciences delivered sales of nearly $1.9 billion and EBITDA of
$409 million. These results, as expected, reflected more normalized weather conditions in the first quarter versus last

year. From a macro perspective, Crop Protection sales trended with the industry across most regions except for
Asia-Pacific where we drove double-digit volume gains reflecting in part sales of a new rice herbicide, although pricing
was down due to currency. We continue to gain traction from the launch of new products. In fact, demand for new Dow
Ag Sciences products was up 7%.
In addition, we received preliminary approval on the registration of our ENLIST soybeans and corn in Brazil with final
approval for commercialization pending. We also have secured approval for ENLIST E3 in Argentina. Additionally,
the EPA has approved ENLIST Duo in nine additional key corn and soybean-producing U.S. states and regulatory
approvals are pending for ENLIST cotton. We're in the process of a stewarded introduction into U.S. corn this year and
expect a full commercial launch following approvals in China. We remain focused on delivering this key technology
platform to serve the global farmer customer base, and we're working to bring it to market as soon as possible.
In the near term, Greater China demand continues to drive growth. North America is currently operating with high
levels of channel inventories. Latin America is facing some potential economic headwinds, and Western Europe growth
appears modestly positive with year-over-year weather comparisons normalizing in the second quarter. We remain
confident in our technology and expect our margins to improve. However, acreage and commodity prices continue to
be a challenge.
Turning to Consumer Solutions on slide nine, this segment delivered record EBITDA based on the strength of
differentiated products and Dow innovation. Double-digit sales gains were reported in North America with broad-based
volume growth across all three businesses. Dow Electronic Materials led the way with a double-digit volume increase
followed by Consumer Care and Dow Automotive. Sales gains were also reported in Latin America.
Let me briefly cover the businesses. Automotive Systems delivered record EBITDA performance. The business is
benefiting from auto industry trends towards light weighting as well as a preference for larger premium vehicles driven
in part by lower oil prices. These vehicles tend to feature both more and higher margin Dow materials. As a result, we
achieved margin expansion as key customers continued to increase adoption of our differentiated technologies such as
our BETAMATE structural adhesives.
In Dow Electronic Materials, EBITDA was also a new first quarter record with margin expansion driven by product
mix upgrades. The strength of our technology in the electronic sector was recognized by a number of key customer
wins across the business. We also reported strong top line performance in semiconductor in both our CMP and litho
markets. Notably, MSI, a key figure that we track for semiconductor growth is forecasted to be up nearly double GDP
in 2015.
In Consumer Care, food and pharma sales remained flat overall, but excluding currency, the business grew, particularly
in Dow Pharma & Food Solutions, which saw expansion through sales of unique and differentiated products. Operating
rates are running high in the segment, and we expect to continue to increase sales in the home and personal care sectors
due to rise in consumer demand and new customer applications. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect
margins in this operating segment will improve on an increased consumer demand.
Moving to Infrastructure Solutions on slide 10, where similar innovation-driven performance is delivering solid
EBITDA expansion. Sales were $1.8 billion and EBITDA grew 10% to $295 million. In Energy & Water Solutions we
expect continued growth at two times to three times the rate of GDP, with strength in our water business offsetting
weakness in North American energy markets. This can be seen in the double-digit demand growth in our reverse
osmosis business in the quarter.
Lower oil values, coupled with a decline in the energy exploration and fracking from 2014 levels have impacted Dow
Microbial Control. However, our expert consultancy model combined with our regulatory position in the oil and gas
sectors is enabling us to grow share.
In Dow Building & Construction, our differentiated products have contributed to global margin expansion as well as
growth outside the U.S. in new applications. North America continues to be the demand driver for this business. Dow
Coating Materials reported volume growth, driven by EMEA and Asia-Pacific versus the prior year. These volume
gains, along with value-based pricing actions and improved raw material margins drove EBITDA growth in the quarter.

Looking ahead, we expect that the North America will lead global coatings growth due to an improving housing
market.
Performance Monomers continues to experience trough-like conditions in the acrylics market, though we expect
improvement in this business towards the second half of the year, with more globally competitive U.S. propylene
market pricing. From an equity earnings perspective, results from Dow Corning were slightly up, overcoming currency
headwinds. For the Infrastructure Solutions segment, we expect margins to remain flat sequentially as the building
season ramps up, and our new applications and technologies offset continued headwinds from acrylics.
Turning to slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals reported sales of $3.2 billion and delivered EBITDA of $535
million, excluding divestitures, which is up 4% versus last year, and represents a fourth consecutive quarter of
year-over-year EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Polyurethanes delivered a record first quarter EBITDA, driven
by a combination of volume gains and margin expansion as the business continues to make progress focusing on their
defined markets, as well as developing customer-tailored solutions through our systems house capabilities in the
consumer comfort and energy efficiency sectors. Ongoing self-help productivity actions will also continue contributing
to margin expansion in the coming quarters.
Epoxy also continues to improve with double-digit volume growth, particularly in differentiated product lines as well
as a continued productivity focus. Industrial Solutions reported margin expansion with improving demand towards the
end of the quarter. EBITDA is up versus the same quarter last year in the core businesses, though it was offset by lower
equity earnings and the divestiture of both ANGUS and the Sodium Borohydride businesses. Overall, we expect prices
to stabilize in this operating segment and margins to reflect strengthening demand.
Turning now to slide 12, Performance Plastics reported sales of $4.3 billion, down 11% versus the prior year, excluding
Hydrocarbons & Energy. EBITDA was $985 million, up 2% and marking the 11th consecutive quarter of operating
EBITDA growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Packaging and Specialty Plastics posted record first quarter EBITDA
performance, driven by strong year-over-year volume growth across all geographies, as well as in the hygiene and
medical, and food packaging sectors. Operating rates are running high in every geography.
Elastomers delivered the highest EBITDA since 2012, a nearly 60% year-over-year increase. Results were particularly
strong in the transportation sector. Volume also improved due to our sell-up actions in new consumer durable products.
For example, INFUSE Olefin Block Copolymers set a volume record, in part, due to traction in the high-end footwear
sector. Electrical and Telecommunications had a major turn-around in the quarter which impacted volume comparisons.
Demand continues to be healthy, particularly in North America. Weakness was seen in EMEAI and Asia-Pacific due to
very aggressive competitive pricing actions. At a segment level, we expect prices to move up on strong demand for our
high value products.
Looking at slide 13, let me briefly cover our modeling guidance. Let's begin with the second quarter. We expect
year-over-year demand growth in most businesses, with pricing momentum building through the year. We expect raw
material costs to remain favorable year-over-year with stable natural gas, though oil-based costs may rise. Equity
earnings will continue to be down year-over-year due primarily to Sadara costs as we ramp the first product later in the
year. Costs will be $75 million to $100 million headwind year-over-year in the second quarter.
After buying back $500 million in Dow stock in Q1, our buyback program is now restricted until the close of the Olin
transaction, which is anticipated by year-end. So we expect second quarter share count to remain flat with the first
quarter. Turnaround costs are expected to be higher by $75 million to $100 million sequentially, and relatively flat
year-over-year. And for the full year 2015, we will continue to move forward on our productivity program, with a goal
of $300 million in savings expected, ramping through the year. Pension expense is still expected to increase slightly,
more than $100 million for the year. We expect a $400 million to $600 million impact on EBITDA due to currency.
CapEx will be approximately $3.9 billion for the year, and we still expect a tax rate in the 25% to 28% range.
Next, I'd like to review progress against our key commitments on slide 15. We've been transparent in sharing the
actions we've been proactively taking to further drive our enterprise into the premier chemical, materials, and
agriculture company that it is today. For example, late last year, we increased our divestiture target to $7 billion to $8.5

billion, and said we expected to achieve that target by mid-2016. With the actions announced this quarter, we have now
outperformed this target and expect considerations from divestiture actions to now exceed $11 billion. This quarter we
have completed both the ANGUS and the Sodium Borohydride transactions.
And of course, just a few weeks ago, we announced the most significant action in the series, a transaction with Olin to
divest a substantial portion of our chlorine value chain. This transaction, particularly with its tax efficient win-win
structure, will enable shareholders of both companies to benefit from the significant upside opportunity of the new
Olin. From a Dow perspective, the transaction will enable us to continue our drive to grow in our higher-value markets
as we continue to go narrower and deeper with our portfolio and will enable the new Olin to become a first-year
competitor across the chlorine envelope.
To follow up on previous announcements, we expect to receive final regulatory clearance to close on the Univation
transaction in early May. We anticipate the deal will close officially immediately following this final approval. Once
the Dow Chlorine Products transaction, along with our ongoing JV consolidation and deconsolidation activities,
including our Kuwait joint ventures, as well as a few other smaller portfolio moves are in place, we'll have completed
our select out actions.
Turning to slide 16, as a result of these actions, coupled with our targeted strategic growth investments, today Dow has
the portfolio to better withstand volatility under most macro conditions. Over the last 10 years, we've been executing a
significant portfolio shift, with clear focus on delivering innovation-driven growth, building in-region leadership in
targeted markets, and driving more consistent performance, resulting in lower volatility and more predictable earnings.
To further advance these efforts, we invested in a new ERP platform to more quickly and effectively respond to
customers as well as providing end-to-end capability on a single instance across the globe. We completed the last phase
of this implementation late last year. This powerful platform is also enabling us to remove costs that are made obsolete
by our upgraded end-to-end platform.
Recall at our investor day last fall, we committed to a new three-year $1 billion productivity drive. Our productivity
efforts continue to center on cost-out actions and doing more with the resources we have in place all to enable higher
earnings. We're making steady progress to deliver on this objective as we removed $57 million of costs in the quarter,
and will ramp to $300 million through the year. Our productivity focus also enabled us to produce the same volume
year-over-year in the quarter despite more than a billion pounds of incremental capacity offline due to planned
maintenance turnarounds versus Q1 of last year. We will make further announcements around the actions we're taking
in the coming quarters to deliver the $1 billion drive, so stay tuned.
Looking ahead on slide 17, our earnings performance coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and the growth
catalyst that we have discussed provide us with confidence in our future cash flow. In the near term we expect our
demand on cash to decrease as a result of three main factors. CapEx reverting to depreciation levels over the next three
years; reduction in pension expense associated with rising interest rates, as well as the conversion of our preferred
shares.
We also anticipate cash flow increases resulting from multiple drivers. The ramp up of our key catalyst, Sadara in the
U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which will have a collective $3 billion EBITDA run rate once fully operational; our
investments in innovations delivering 5,000 new products a year and driving higher margins; productivity; and of
course, our operating leverage where every percent improvement in our operating rate adds approximately $200 million
in annual EBITDA; and while we're not counting on it, we do see an ethylene cyclical upside in front of us in the next
few years.
And finally, turning to slide 18, with our earnings performance our strengthened balance sheet and the growth catalyst
we discussed, as well as our confidence in our future cash flow, I want to briefly recap our financial priorities; drive
further ongoing ROC improvement with a goal to return 3% above our cost of capital; continue to enhance our capital
structure and maintain our solid investment grade rating; reward shareholders with a goal to remain in the range of our
historical payout ratio of about 45% of our net income; and continuing to invest for growth in our key markets through
both the organic actions we have in motion as well as our ongoing JV consolidation and deconsolidation actions.

In closing, let me emphasize, the results we have been consistently delivering on the bottom line reflect the deliberate
actions we have taken and will continue to take. Our focus remains on execution to drive a continued focus on
productivity measures and to continue to position Dow for growth, as well as increase shareholder remuneration.
With that, Jack, let's turn to Q&A.
Jack Broodo
Thank you, Howard. Now, we will move on to your questions.
First, however, I would like to remind you that our comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A
procedure?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we'll hear it from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. First on Performance Plastics, a very strong Q1, but given the
turnaround costs in Q2, can you improve earnings in this segment sequentially in Q2, was that just too big of a hurdle
given the turnaround costs?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I'll start, David. Good morning. Now look, yeah, Performance Plastics saw a lot of
volatility in the quarter and clearly the moving on the inputs affected things. Turnaround is a factor. The load on
turnarounds is more evenly distributed this year. Q1 was actually higher than normal especially in Performance Plastics
and Performance Materials. We gave some guidance on that. But we believe that with inputs sort of stabilizing, we
should see good price momentum on Performance Plastics going into this quarter. We're seeing decent demand, saw a
good decent demand. Post-Chinese New Year, there's a lot of restocking going on in China that we saw through the end
of March going into April and May. So frankly, with that pick up, you saw our China numbers, by the way, were up
10% year-on-year. Latin America, we had decent volume numbers. In fact, we had a decent volume quarter in
Performance Plastics despite all their volatility based on our product mix. So look, I would say, there's a smaller
propane tailwind, but with price momentum the turnaround factor shouldn't be there as much as you're indicating in
your question.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, I would also say, Dave, just currency will be likely be a higher headwind for us
in the second quarter, year-over-year, and don't forget Sadara costs will also be ramping.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Understood. And just on Sadara, Andrew and Howard, what were the costs in Q1, and are
we still on track for the full year $250 million headwind for Sadara?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, the short answer is, we're still on track. That number is still valid, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you.
Operator
And next, we move on to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for the clarification you're expecting FX to be a
higher hurdle in Q2 than Q1. What was the hurdle in Q1 in terms of bottom line and top line?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Go ahead Howard.

<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah. It was about $600 million on the top line of price as currency and about a $160
million on the EBITDA line. So around $0.10 EPS headwind. Congratulations on the Mets' record, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you. Thank you so much. We don't want to talk about it too much in public in fear of
jinxing it.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I apologize.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: So one record announcement. Congrats on a Q1 record in Performance Plastics, as well. Hey,
and then just following up on currency. You seem to indicate that European demand seemed to be getting a little bit
better. Can you extend upon that, please?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: What was the adjective in front of demand, Frank?
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Seemed to be getting a little bit better, if I read the release correctly and listened to what you
were saying.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes, absolutely. Like I indicated on CNBC this morning, going around the world, we see
China demand, we see U.S. demand and both, I would say, good to strong for us in terms of our product mix,
remember, targeted growth. And then the beginnings of green shoots in Germany, the EU numbers weren't too bad.
Latin America is not great, but we got good volumes down there. It's a volume margin story. This whole quarter for us,
whether it's plastics or our mix, we're maximizing margin, minimizing the effect of the volatility on imports.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, Frank. We saw nice growth in Dow Automotive and Dow Coatings in Europe as
well, just to give you some more color.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you so much.
Operator
And next we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Hey. Good morning. It's Brian Maguire on for Bob. Andrew, two quarters ago, you said that
lower oil would be a benefit for Dow. I guess we're seeing some of the signs of that, with the good volumes and better
margins this quarter. But, with oil moving back up, do you expect some of that benefit to go away, or do you still see it
being a pretty big net benefit for the company?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, quite right in terms of what we said and also what we are seeing. At the end of the
day, we're not negatively impacted by low oil. Rising oil price, at the end of the day could be an indicator of global
demand, which is positive for Dow. Consumer spending, I think you've seen all the reports from all the consumer
companies. It's interesting to note that the U.S. consumer is actually pocketing most of the savings on gas and they're
not spending more in terms of going to spend on consumables, they are spending a little more on gasoline, but I would
tell you that's the wall in front of us, in terms of low oil price demand. It really is our mix, with all the records we hit in
the quarter, Dow Automotive an all-time record. If you look at Electronic Materials, a first quarter record, or our
Energy & Water business, a first quarter record; our Polyurethane business, a first quarter record; Performance Plastics,
a first quarter record. It's our mix. We have got the right products for this sort of growth and the demand environment
around the world.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Okay. Great. I have a follow up. Just a clarification. When we heard you last on the Olin
announcement for the Chlor-Alkali spin, I think you mentioned that it would be accretive to EPS by about a nickel. Just
clarifying, is that inclusive of the ethylene deal that you signed with them, and the, kind of, moratorium on share
buybacks for the rest of this year?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yes. Definitely. It's all in.

And next, we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Andrew, it seems like the speed with which oil prices declined was so rapid that chemical prices
haven't adjusted fully. So you and a couple other companies that have reported so far, saw a big benefit. I'm wondering
if you can quantify the raw material benefit, and if you think that could reverse in the second half.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, firstly, oil went down 49% versus same quarter last year. We already talked about
currency being a big headwind, as well as oil pricing effect. That accounted for most of our revenue decline. Holding
onto price, for us, was less of a effect, due to a differentiation. P.J., you should not see that Dow of old our results.
There's no way that Dow of old would have obtained these results, despite what you said about the lead lag factor. As I
said on CNBC morning, that did not play into our results. Our margin increases occurred in Consumer businesses, in
our Infrastructure businesses and had nothing to do with raw material inputs. So I'd like to squash that notion on the
call. This is all about sell-out. We ran very reliably. We produced the same amount of pounds as all the turnarounds out
there. We improved productivity, but we sold up. We sold up in all these differentiated businesses.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And then, secondly, you talked about realizing value in your Ag business in the next
round of consolidation. But, given all the headwind in the Ag, do you think those actions are likely to come a little later
than expected? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: We're investors in Ag; we're investors in the Ag pipeline. We have been investing now for
some years, actually about eight years. We're in the middle of our biggest product launches ever, not just ENLIST, the
ENLIST platform, but a whole range of Crop Protection products, a whole range of seeds pipeline is very, very robust.
We've always said, we want that result to appear in our numbers going forward. It's beginning to appear. Our Ag result,
despite the weather conditions in the first quarter, as Howard indicated, our new product launches were up 7%
year-on-year, in terms of revenue. So, look, we want to see the full effect of that pipeline in the valuation of that
business going forward. Right now we're investors.

<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, sure, Jeff. Good morning. Pension funding this year is going to be around an
$850 million headwind and it's about a similar expense for the year. We're about – our fully funded plans are about
80% funded today, but if you get a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate and one year of expected return on the
assets, we go to fully funded. So that would – that will take that $800 million number down over time pretty
dramatically. It will take a few years to ramp down to that level because of the smoothing effect, but it will go down.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. And then, secondly, your revenues were down about 15% in the quarter. But your
SG&A costs were down 3.5%. And there's an emphasis on Dow on cost reduction. Are you satisfied with that number
or could you have done better, or do you see SG&A as relatively high versus the sales decrease?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Well, as a CFO, I will say, I'm never happy with our costs. I mean, we always want to
continue to drive our costs further down, but I am pleased that we delivered what we expected we would deliver. I
mean, we took out over $35 million of R&D and SG&A. We also, If you look at our head count overall, we're doing
more with less. So there was another $22 million of lower cost through head count that don't flow through R&D and
SG&A. So it's not just in the R&D and SG&A line that we're looking at our productivity.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I mean, productivity is a never-ending journey, Jeff. We've announced our $1 billion
program over three years. We had movement in the quarter. Howard already spoke to them, so I won't speak to the
specifics on the quarter. But, you should expect us to keep ramping that productivity number up. Output is up on the
same asset base or smaller, and our lower cost footprint, especially post DCP carve-out. Once we fold DCP into Olin,
you should expect us to get rid of stranded costs. We'll have a lot more to say about that in the coming weeks and
months. But, look, you should be thinking about us as focusing precious resources on growth markets. And, therefore,
getting out of low-end, low-return businesses. ROC and EVA is our driver.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator
And moving on, we'll hear from John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Morning. Nice quarter.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: A lot of your capital spending is very long cycle. I think the 2017 cracker project was started
back in 2010. So you have to be thinking now about any projects that you want to start up really post-2018. Are we set
up for maybe three years of low start-up activity and high cash flow after these start-ups, or – I'm trying to reconcile
that the oil-gas ratio is still relatively high, and still would justify investment back into the shale gas play here in the
U.S.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: John, the tee-up to your question is the relevant one. I mean, we made the decision to move
forward on Texas 2009, as we call in there Cracker 2011-2012 timeframe. That, plus the big Saudi project, which was
done a little earlier in 2010-2011 timeframe were countercyclical investments, geared to start up, as we viewed them, at
about the right time in demand cycle. That's going to come to path, as we see, in particular, ethylene peaks in the
2016-2018 timeframe. And not to mention the diversified product mix of Sadara, is way beyond just plastics. It's got a
lot of performance materials and other downstream products in it. We believe the timing of that CapEx long cycle as it
is, is about right for the start-ups 2015 through 2017. You're quite right, then, in your tee-up. We expect high cash flow
years in these next several years. We have the growth platform we need to grow. We are maxing out on CapEx this
year, as Howard said. We'll be bringing that down to depreciation levels next several years. And we are beginning to
think in the out years, the 2020 timeframe and beyond, and we are doing strategic reviews with our board over the next
12 months to 18 months. But nothing announced, nothing suggested in any of that. Howard's modeling guidance is the
one to go with.

<Q - John E. Roberts>: The preference to keep the mix of specialty basics or, I don't know if you want to call it
basics, but to keep Performance Plastics, let's say, as a segment in a certain range of the portfolio.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Absolutely. And remembering and the way you again teed up your question is helpful.
When we're done with Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast investment, when you fold in Canada and Argentina and all
these other places, 70% of our ethylene footprint will be in top decile low cost jurisdictions. And so we'll be low cost
not just on ethane, but associated NGLs like propane, maximum propane flex, and of course liquids crackers to take the
balance in there especially in Europe. So we have always going view to envelope spending and making sure that the
low cost inputs are matched by the high value outputs. And I've said many times, specialties and the value-add, as you
saw in the quarter, plus low-cost inputs and key integration like ethane and propylene is how Dow makes money twice,
and we can make money under all sorts of conditions. So yes, emphasis on the envelopes as we call them at Dow, some
call it integration, some German companies call it baboon. We are not abandoning that. We are very, very committed to
staying low cost in the envelopes and doing value-add on the outputs.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And Peter Butler with Glenn Hill Investments has our next question.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Dow is, obviously, integrated from raw materials to finished products. This means you have
Dow people on the ground in each of the steps along the way. So this means that your management should know the –
your management knows the management that's your customers, and you sort of compare this to some of your
competitors who regard foreign sales as pretty much as dumping commodity products through distributors. So is this –
could you expand on this a little on the advantages that you have with having people on the ground in each one of the
steps from raw materials to finished products? And it seems like when you listen to Dow, you guys seem to be a lot
more confident in your forecasts than your competitors, and I presume that this is a function of you just having better
relationships with your customers.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Peter, the way we're thinking about at Dow and how I talked about this next level of
efficiency and productivity and how we go to market, channel efficiency based on our new IT platform, plus local
representation, that combination is driving us to be very connected to where growth is, because growth is no longer
uniform. You can't do a peanut butter approach to growth. You can't spread the peanut butter evenly. So like our China
numbers indicated, to your point, we only have, out of roughly 3,500 people, only a dozen experts in China. We are
local in China. Our 500 scientists are local scientists. We know working with Haier how to launch new products like
PURINZE. PURINZE is the brand new U.S. module that we're using for water purity in washing machines in China.
Water purity in China is everything. And so working with them and directly working with Haier we can actually grow
through our R&D presence in China, we can do value-add on what is in essence a reverse osmosis, our ultra filtration
membrane. We have that sort of capability across the world. We are leading that to the next level of activity right now
as we speak. We believe we can actually take advantage of that by being more decentralized. We're introducing
geographic profit and loss score cards around the company right now. And we are empowering our geographies to be
much more attached to the customer front. To be a market-led company with assets that we have around the world, you
got to optimize the supply chains by going to where value is. So that's how we do it, local, decentralized,
market-empowered people.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: A long time ago, Ben Branch, one of your legendary CEOs, sat me down and said, these
specialties are placings, he said, but put a couple of pennies on the price of polyethylene, and I'll show you some real
money. Through the years, has this changed today, and if so how does Dow get the extra pennies?

Page 11 of 16
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, we get the extra pennies, I mean, the polyethylene, Ben Branch comment is apropos
to Performance Plastics through the quarter. Because we have elastomers in the mix, because we have E&T resin,
because we have packaging resins, we get premiums on commodity polyethylene. So we can do the sell out, sell up
strategy. So it's not an either/or. There was a time when you could look at either/or, you could make money in one part
by some technology and another part by some low costs. In today's global competitive world, that is no longer an
option. Technology is ubiquitous. It gets licensed by everyone. State-owned enterprises enter the market, they basically
run for cash, they can commoditize any product line in a heartbeat. Innovation is now a fast cycle. So you're going to
keep innovating ahead of the commoditization trend by being local, your previous question, and then giving premiums
based on the technology and then reinventing and cannibalizing your technology before your competitor does. So Ben
Branch was right for the time. Today's chemistry company has to be as nimble as an IT company.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Okay. Well, thanks for the help today.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Thank you, Peter.
Operator
And we'll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks very much. Just a question on your Coatings business. Many of the end
market coating customers have reported and have been talking about, seeing costs – different levels of cost benefits
from the lower oil based raws over time. So just want to get a sense of how that's going to affect you given you
obviously have a different place in the value chain and in a different product sweep. Are you starting to see benefits
now? And where do you think you'll hold on to them and where might you have to pass them through, and how should
we just be thinking about the cadence over the balance of the year?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, it's Howard. When you look at Infrastructure Solutions and you look specifically
at Dow Coating Materials and Performance Monomers, I would say on the Performance Monomers side, acrylics, I
referenced in some of the prepared remarks that there is an acrylic monomer trough to where we are merchant seller of
monomer, and we have been on a steady march to reduce that percentage and continue to upgrade the value of that
monomer into emulsion, preferentially in coating but also in building and construction, and even in our packaging
adhesives platform we are seeing nice growth there. Specifically in Dow Coatings, it's really about broadening the
participation in new markets. It's continuing to work all parts of the pyramid from an overall value standpoint and
continue to gain traction on innovations. So I mean, our FORMASHIELD product is really starting to take off in China.
This is formaldehyde abatement in China in Dow Coatings. So I would say, we're seeing nice margin gains, nice
margin expansion in coatings, but on the monomer side, it will still be a tough go.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Okay. And just as a follow up, we noticed in the press release that you included I
think for the first time sort of what EPS would look like with the preferred shares converted. Is there a reason why you
had to do that? I mean, obviously, it doesn't impact the way we're talking about the quarter today, but what caused that,
if anything?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, it's a good problem to have, because the earnings are higher. And we actually
did it once before when we got the K-Dow award in 2013. But when we reported, because the earnings were higher
with the divestitures on a GAAP basis, we had to assume that the preferred shares were in the capital structure. So you
have to add about 97 million shares, but if you take that 97 million out, that's where you get our actual share count at
the time.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.

[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Good morning, Andrew and Howard.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning Hassan.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: You guys obviously touched in your presentation on the Sadara side of things, and
obviously, slowly it will ramp up through the course of this year into next. My question is, the Saudi market has been
really buoyant year-to-date, it's up over 15%, in anticipation of say it opening up to foreign investors come mid-June as
I understand it. So could you give us an update on the IPO of Sadara, because obviously, this would be a great time for
that IPO, and should in my mind at least provide some valuation support to the broader Dow?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, so we obviously with our partner will decide that, post start-up the entire operation,
Hassan. So the opening of the market is a good thing, but clearly won't affect us until we're past all the start-ups which
are post 2016. That's the arrangements we had with Aramco, and that's the one that we're going to keep. Look, it is a
great signal. The Saudis are definitely looking at foreign investment. Sadara will be a great investment because it's a
diversified investment away from oil and gas, which is their strategy, not just the plants we're building, but all the
values parked downstream. Just to remind you, for those who've been down there with us last year, we have a very big
value park with over 31 assets downstream, all little small assets that are due value add. So Sadara will be an
investment opportunity for the local market to really, frankly, reflect the Kingdom's diversification strategy. So but, it
won't be anytime soon, to answer your question.
Operator
And next, we'll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes, thank you. Andrew, on the last call, you indicated that supply tightness was in your
imminent future, and it appears, I guess, it was even more imminent than you thought. We've seen a real tightness in
operating rates. So just wondering about your near term view of the ethylene-polyethylene cycle. We've seen some – a
rebound in demand. Is this really just restocking driven by a surge in oil prices, or do you think that operating rates are
tighter than most people, other than Dow, had really expected?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. So we saw some restocking at the end of the quarter, Don, to some extent. Therefore
there is a bit of a head fake with respect to people anticipating oil prices going up. Now, look, depending on which
pundit you believe, that there is some up swell in oil price, not huge, but there is some. So somewhere at the back end
of this year until next year, people are imagining prices will go up with that. But, when you really drill down our
numbers, as you have, it's true demand. I mean, if you really look at around the world we're seeing true demand.
Therefore, it's foreshadowing with not a lot of supply, apart from a couple of plants coming back up, only one actually
restarted, not – hardly any restarts out there to speak of. And then the new supply being what it is, then we start to see
the whole industry up swelling in the 2016 timeframe, maybe late this year, but certainly the beginnings of a peak cycle
2016-2017.
Operator
And we'll move on to James Sheehan with SunTrust.
<Q - James Sheehan>: Thank you. Good follow on that question. Could you comment on your current operating

<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. Andrew, would you comment on the cost as well as the timing of
your U.S. Gulf Coast projects, and how each of those might be trending versus your original expectations, please?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Look, timing, no change. We're on schedule with all of our projects. Of course, I think the
earlier question on the big Texas cracker 2017, early 2017 start-up, no change to the budget. Everything is going
according to our financial plans that we've announced to all of you. And we showed you on our investor day some very
specific details on that. No change to that if you go back to that slide. PDH, we're quite excited. It is on track for our
mid-2015 start-up, and that will have a material effect on our run rate for EBITDA, on our propylene derivatives.
Construction there is over 85% complete, also within budget. And all of our other projects that we've announced, the
incremental ones, also are doing just fine, budget and timing-wise. I would tell you that the low oil price and the effect
on LNG plants and what might happen out there, you're starting to see that on the Gulf Coast. So that's a good thing. So
you're not seeing the huge up swell that many of you were asking about last year.

And we'll move on to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Aleksey Yefremov>: Everyone, I wanted to ask a question on Dow Electronics. You mentioned several new
products. Could you describe the sales opportunity in OLED and films? And also, where are you in the product cycle
across various product lines within Dow Electronics? Thank you.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, Aleksey. Good morning. This is Howard. We had some nice wins on the CMP
side, both on the pad and the slurry at some major Asian foundry customers. We also had a lithography win at a major
customer in Asia. And in Korea – I won't go into more specifics than that, but a nice OLED win for a flagship smart
phone, if I can share that with you. And then also, on the optical film side, we had a win at a major display customer for
their flagship model as well.

And next we move on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Arun S. Viswanathan>: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to understand your comments a little bit earlier on the
second quarter, with regards to plastics. I mean, you had a price increase in March that was announced in polyethylene.
You reiterated that increase in May. What gives you the confidence now that you could achieve that pricing going
forward? Thanks.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, so our plastics business through the quarter was, as you saw, struggling on the price
side. We believe prices have bottomed in North America and Europe. And the first quarter average we'll see an up
swell from that from the second quarter based on – at a very minimum, a small price increase. Inventories are low in
North America. It's heading into a peak demand season. And the previous question, I think that Don asked was on the
operating rates, we're seeing higher operating rates, 90%, especially here in North America, plus our premium pricing.
Howard, do you want to add?

<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Yes. Good morning, fellows.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Duffy.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Want to go back to some of the issues you're seeing in the acrylic acid chain. And with
the recent history of kind of the epichlorohydrin commoditizing and taking down what was the specialty epoxy
business for you. Where's the confidence level, or why do you think something akin to that doesn't happen in the
acrylic acid chain, and then kind of into some of its derivatives, if you could use that to kind of compare and contrast?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: A long history of knowing a lot about the acrylic business, I won't take you through all the
history. But, Dow [indiscernible] (50:42) was in the business back in the 1960s and 1970s. Very complicated chemistry
versus anything in the epoxy chain, whether it's the monomer itself, both glacial and crystal acrylic acid. And also, all
the various derivatives from our methacrylates in particular. You really have some Japanese houses that know how to
do it, and then you have a couple of European and then you have Dow and maybe one or two other smaller companies.
But, that means that, – and not much cross-licensing and very difficult [indiscernible] (51:15) large waste issues that
had to be managed. The barrier to entry is much, much different than you would expect on the epoxy chain.

And our final question today we'll hear from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Question on the Ag business, or maybe a couple of them just bundled together. As far as
what you're – can you give us a little bit of an update as to what you're seeing in terms of Latin America? You said that
you actually had a pretty positive outlook, but there were some economic headwinds you were concerned about. How
do you think that weighs on the Ag chem side? And then, in Western Europe, like with the weather issues, do you – are
you going to get the bulk of what you missed this quarter back in 2Q, or is some of that lost, and how should we think
about that? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Howard, will you?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah. Specifically on your Latin America question, I mean, recent good crop harvests,
we do have high level of distributor inventories and, I would say, generally positive outlook. But certainly concerns
from an economic standpoint and I would throw currency certainly in the mix as well. Specific to Dow, a reference in
the prepared remarks about the acquisition of Coodetec, so that happened in the quarter. And that's going to give us an
avenue, not only on ENLIST and soy, but also on Crop Protection products in with the cooperatives, which is an area
we have been weaker on, and we're looking to strengthen that capability. And I would say, overall, we expect seeds to
do volume gains in corn, and soy, and canola, and our forage portfolio as well.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, I mean, just to pile on, from a whole year point of view, I think we'll be flat,
excluding currency. We'll be down a little bit, including currency, single-digits. But, the big plus is margins continue to
go up on sales of new products. Dow AgroSciences is a new product story in Crop Protection as well as seeds. And I
think, people got to keep noting that we've become a Crop Protection R&D powerhouse with our new molecule
launches, and those new molecule launches are expanding margin for the company. Obviously, Ag is going to be a
bigger and bigger part of the company, and you're starting to see that effect on the Ag business in terms of its margin
increase.

And there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Broodo for any additional or closing
remark
Jack Broodo
Thank you, everyone, for your questions today. Andrew, would you like to make a few final comments?
Andrew N. Liveris
Yeah, Jack. Thank you. I would. Look, I've said many times, 2005 is a pivotal year for the company. We have the big
start-ups of Sadara later this year. Our PDH unit in Texas, as well as our launches of new products, not just in
Agricultural Sciences. We have over 5,000 new products launched last year, as we said in our press release. We have
one after 2015 is going to be a year of lot of product launches. And I mentioned some of them we talked about, for
example, that washing machine example I used, and that ultrafiltration membrane. You can expect us to continue to be
an innovation story and to deliver on our commitments.
We have delivered on our commitments on earnings, and now 10 straight quarters a year-on-year beat, six straight
quarters of earnings beat. We've delivered on our divestment commitment. We delivered on our shareholder
remuneration story, and we'll continue to do that. We delivered on the Dow Chlorine Products transaction, we'll close
later this year, a very compelling transaction for that business and a very big plus for Olin. You've heard us talk about
self-help. We've created a portfolio over many years that can handle all sorts of condition. We execute against the
targets that we've set over many years, and we execute quarter-after-quarter. There's just no way that commodity-driven
Dow Chemical of a year ago could have delivered this type of performance with a 49% drop in oil and an 18%
currency headwind. The 10-year ago number has now been matched in these conditions by the portfolio we've created.
Our margins are back to where they were in 2005.
This is a performance we've been after for a long time. We've done it the last few quarters, many quarters in a row.
There's no gap in the say and do ratio here at Dow. We're building a company that can grow under all macro
conditions.
Thank you for listening, and back to you, Jack.
