Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I'll
then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY 2017, and then I'll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for
their comments.
Clearly, we are thrilled with our results with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically overachieved again in
the cloud. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows,
the growth rates are continuing to increase.
In our SaaS/PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year 2015, and now 52% in
fiscal year 2016, and not to get ahead of myself, but we expect to see even higher SaaS/PaaS growth this year. We'll
continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call so we can have some measure of consistency across
quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This past quarter, the effects of currency movement were slightly less than expected with a 1% to 2% headwind in most
revenue categories including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share. Cloud SaaS and PaaS
revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year, and well above the 61% high end of my guidance and
up 17% sequentially.
Now as regards to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is
100% accurate and, if anything, slightly conservative. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our
Cloud business, in the SaaS and PaaS billings, and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly
$1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the
billings numbers up on our website for you to see the details.
And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we are now growing faster than both Salesforce and
Workday in every way: revenue growth, deferred revenue growth, and billings growth. As our SaaS PaaS business
continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and
PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4 and we expect to see further improvement in fiscal year 2017 and from there,
we'll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue of $169 million, which was
up 8%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion with software updates and product support revenue at $4.8
billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing install base of
customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%
reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud.
Total hardware including hardware support was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and
hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly
in constant currency from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, and the operating margin was 45%.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6%,
and GAAP EPS was $0.66 in USD. Had currencies not moved, by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been
$0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.
Now covering the full fiscal year, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant
currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 52%. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service was $646 million,
growing 11%. On-premise software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion, as continued growth in software
support offset cloud-related declines in new software license.
So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS/PaaS revenue will
exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. But more importantly, when you
look at our software business, we have an on-premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business
layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business. And then you can
understand why we start growing significantly this year.

For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion, and operating income was $15.8 billion. And assuming no more
wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP
operating margin for the full year was 43%, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP
EPS would have been $0.17 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180
million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $56 billion in cash
and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion. The short-term deferred
revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on
finding the right companies at the right valuations that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter, we
repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 272 million shares
for a total of $10.4 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And
the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I
highlighted last quarter, as we are working to position Oracle as our customers' strategic partner for the cloud.
The first phase, called the Accelerated Buying Experience, was rolled out in March. It was designed to make
purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own Configure, Price, Quote product's sales
and service cloud. We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use click-to-accept functionality for
our enterprise customers, and that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button.
The results for Q4 were fantastic, as nearly two-thirds of our cloud deals were processed using the Accelerated Buying
Experience, and we saw quote-to-book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing given we
introduced the program in Q4 and salespeople had very little time to get used to it. Our customers could then start using
our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition. And clearly, customers are embracing
the move with us.
We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with thousands of our customers around the
world already using these cloud services to help run their businesses. We are far enough along that our financial
statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time,
leading to very solid EPS growth. Our guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are a force to be
reckoned with in the cloud.
Now to my guidance, I'm going give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year
2017. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now with currency, if current exchange
rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud
revenue but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and
transformation, I'm definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad, and am going be a bit
conservative in my outlook.
Even with that said, for Q1 I'm raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow
75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the
organic business.
Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, new software license and software and support is
expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant
currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last Q1, depending on the mix of
revenues and of course the tax rate.
Over the full year for FY 2017, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 52% in
FY 2016.

SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY 2017 much higher than the 57% reported today, as we show steady
and continued improvement through the year. And as I mentioned earlier, but operating income is also expected to
grow in constant currency.
And with that, I will turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you very much, Safra.
In the fiscal year just started, FY 2017, Oracle has two specific points of focus. First, we'd like to accelerate our SaaS
and PaaS growth and make sure we're at least double – growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And
we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue. We're the second
largest SaaS company in the world now, and we think we can be the largest SaaS company pretty [indiscernible]
(15:11) by the time we hit $10 billion, we think we're going to be the first one there.
Why do I think that's possible? One is we're already growing at a very high rate, much faster than our competitors.
We've proven we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale? Safra pointed out something that's
kind of shocking but as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS
portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is.
We're a major player in ERP and HCM. We're almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We're the
number one player in marketing. We're very competitive. We're number one – tied for number one in service. And we
compete against Salesforce.com in sales automation. But in all of these areas, we compete.
Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company, is really focused on sales automation and some of the other
customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They're making acquisitions. They're growing their
business, but they're in the customer experience sales area. They don't compete in the largest category, which is ERP,
also not HCM, again, supply chain and manufacturing, again.
And we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider. And some of these mid-market companies can
simply get an all-Oracle footprint, run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That's something that Salesforce
can't offer. And we think that's going to serve us very well and allow to keep these very high growth rates while we go
for that to be first at $10 billion. Okay. That's one thing. So we want to be, one, the number one. We think we need to
be number one, and we think we will be number one in SaaS and PaaS.
Second major point of focus is that our generation two of our Infrastructure-as-a-Service data centers have been built
and stocked with computers. And now we're beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service is the third leg of Oracle's cloud strategy. Obviously, SaaS we talk about a lot and PaaS we
talk a lot about because those two businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle. What's going on in
Infrastructure-as-a-Service?
Well, we've had to move to – we've learned a lot about this business. There's a huge amount of demand, by the way, for
Infrastructure-as-a-Service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers, but even bigger amount of
demand for Infrastructure-as-a-Service from our database customers. Our database customers want to move their
application into our cloud, putting their database onto our platform-as-a-Service and then their applications, so a lot of
custom applications, onto our Infrastructure-as-a-Service. These two things go together.
And we've built, again, the second generation data center which we think is highly competitive with anything out there.
Lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors. And there's huge demand
for it and we're now starting to bring customers into that. We think that's another very important driver to Oracle's
overall growth.

We're growing fast in SaaS. We're growing fast in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
We've made the investments. We have the right technology with our second generation data centers, and we're very
excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and Infrastructure-as-a-Service for our huge
installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud.
I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks so much, Larry, just a few more numbers and we'll take your questions.
Cloud bookings over $600 million in USD, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year, we grew more than
200%. So this comparison or this number is against that comparison. In SaaS, roughly $350 million in USD bookings.
In PaaS, over $250 million.
Just one point of clarification. Our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So I've had some questions about do
we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings kept separate in our ARR
reporting. As it relates to renewals, in the quarter our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year over year.
SaaS/PaaS revenue, we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter on quarter. ERP/EPM was 58% growth quarter over quarter.
In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in three years. That's as our business has gotten bigger. In CX, all sales,
marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double digits. And data-as-a-Service, we nearly doubled year over
year.
Platform-as-a-Service had another breakout quarter. We nearly doubled quarter on quarter. Within doubling quarter on
quarter, our database-as-a-Service business more than doubled quarter on quarter. Our SaaS/PaaS billings grew 48% in
FY 2016. Our SaaS/PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra's point, and I want to say it again, grew much faster
than Salesforce.com and Workday.
Now I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting: our customer metrics. In the
quarter, we've closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly two-thirds were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer
expansions. That is an all-time high for us. Two hundred and seventy-three customers who bought SaaS also bought
PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connection point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as
time goes on. Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers.
In the quarter, we had almost 700 CX customers and 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year,
nearly two and a half times that what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want
to make sure I didn't misspeak. It's 808 new customers in the quarter. We've doubled the FY 2016 count in Q4. Almost
50% of those customers never had an Oracle app.
Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly two-and-a-half times the installed base from last year. We have
1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly 1,000 go-lives this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS
customers. Our install base is now nearly 9,000 customers. In closing, this was a big year for us not only in revenue,
but bookings as well where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR.
I'm going make just a couple predictions for the new year. We had a big year in bookings in FY 2016. We will have a
bigger year in FY 2017. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings and our revenue reported growth
rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year. Our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY 2017. And as Larry and Safra
both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster.
So with that, we'll take whatever questions that you might have.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein
Research.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on your cloud progress. I'd like
to drill in specifically into Platform-as-a-Service. Two parts to my question; the first is can you give us some more
color on your success in PaaS? And second, specifically, can you help us with understanding how you're expanding the
TAM via database, middleware, et cetera, and what are the drivers? Is it newer segments, higher revenue attach from
existing customers? Any help would be appreciated.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So, Mark, I'll start, and then I think Larry's going to chip in. No question about it that the total
available market expands because obviously when we win, you know, just like in SaaS, if we win in SaaS, we actually
get all of the middleware, all of the database, all of the hardware. We get really all of the service. That's why we get
this multiple of support that when we get an application, the whole stack comes with us. The same thing in effect
occurs when we get database-as-a-service as well. With it comes all of the other services that come with it as well.
n addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten to.
We get now to a whole set of mid-market customers that frankly, we just didn't have an opportunity to sell to before
because you had to have a data center, you had to have a computer, and you had to have a staff. And so now all of that
TAM has expanded as well, so with a broader market set we get to and a whole set of market share that comes with it.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: The other thing is the network effect between SaaS, PaaS and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
So if you have let's say your ERP application in – it's an Oracle ERP application, then you want to build a bunch of data
warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system. In a sense, you feel it's perfectly reasonable to have
the ERP system at Oracle and then I'll put the data warehousing situation at Microsoft Azure.
But if you actually look at the pricing, cloud pricing, the one part of cloud that's expensive is moving data out of data
centers. That's one thing they charge you a lot of money for. And that's just industry pricing, the way it works. So
moving data between data centers, back and forth, back and forth between data centers can be quite expensive.
So there is an advantage for our built-in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a
built-in advantage by offering our PaaS and our Infrastructure-as-a-Service as a set of tools to allow you to build your
data warehouses and your data marts using that ERP data. So I think that gives us a very significant advantage, the
interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
I'll go back to Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Why shouldn't I just move to Amazon? Amazon's been doing this for a while
and they've got Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Because we handle the Oracle database much better than Amazon does, we
can run very large Oracle databases. We've run it [indiscernible] (27:43). We just do a better job. This is not the place
for me to give you technical proof, though we do a better job than they do on Oracle. They run Oracle databases but we
do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliably, more securely.
If I've got the database, if I handle the database in an Oracle data center and in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me
to put the application on the computer right next to that. That's higher performance, much lower cost because I'm not
moving all this data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. Those things are
going to tend to be collocated. So we think we have some built-in advantages of being a strong player in SaaS and a
strong player in PaaS and making it very – a lot of customers will want to get their Infrastructure-as-a-Service or their
related Infrastructure-as-a-Service from the same cloud supplier and the same data center.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Excellent, I really appreciate it.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thanks.

And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Thank you very much. Safra, you mentioned growth in operating income in your prepared
remarks. I was wondering if you can help us think about how that translates into growth in operating margins.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: We expect operating margins to go up also as this continues. Obviously, cloud margins are
going through the roof. That's become obvious. And we expect operating margins to improve. So you've got revenue
increasing and operating margins also increasing over time and operating income increasing also over time.
So we're very – this is actually a very, very important time for Oracle financially because what you see is that we have
stopped having reductions really in any of the numbers. We've turned up in every way including EPS. I know for a
while I was telling you this is a transition and all that, but I think we feel like we are officially at the complete end of
the beginning, meaning we are now in the mode of increasing, improving, EPS up, operating income up, revenue up,
just everything. We've made the transition and we are moving up from here.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'd like to comment on something in terms of margins. Our generation two of our data center,
okay, what was wrong with generation one, no one asked? Generation one was more expensive than we liked it. One of
the great things about our gen-two data centers is we think we now have the best bang for the buck, the best cost
performance data centers in the world with our gen-two data centers. We think we – again, we deliver more
performance at the lowest cost of any cloud provider. We think that's another huge advantage for us. And we'll be
scaling our business on this new very, very cost effective – most modern of all the cloud networks. That's going help
our margins enormously.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hey, Oracle team, congratulations on the results as well. Mark, I guess, two separate questions
for you, I'll try to keep it brief. One is how would you explain the magnitude of outperformance on the SaaS and PaaS
revenue growth rate relative to the midpoint of guidance? I'm wondering if the milestone criteria are turning out to be
faster than you expected or maybe that's not the case.
And secondly, as you look at our SaaS and PaaS revenues, they're a large number. I'm curious and also get questions
from investors as to what exactly is the relative size or magnitude of growth rates of the different categories here
vis-à-vis HCM, ERP, and CRM digital marketing. Any color you can give us there, that would be fantastic. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure. First, there's no one reason why we beat the revenue. It's all of the reasons. It first starts
we booked more than we planned, point one. And we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought,
so it improved our linearity as we went. Our team has done a great job in cloud ops from a provisioning perspective,
provisioning meaning we then sell more, we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and
live and that has another effect on revenue linearity. In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points
over prior year. Not to say it was better than we expected but it was good. It was solid and that helped as well.
Then we also had more usage on our platform. So we've had this continued not linear but geometric increase in the
usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription but metered just use more. And so when you add up
all of those things, no one thing was 80% of it, Kash. It was really all of those things together that added up to the beat
that you referenced.
Your second question was the relative growth rates of the various businesses. I'd start with they're sort of all good
would be the way I would describe it and the question becomes the degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on
ERP in terms of growth rate and that number I think I gave it to you quarter on quarter in terms of growth rate. You
know what I'll do? As we get towards financial analyst day, I'll do more of a breakout pillar by pillar but they're just all
strong. Our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM. The HCM – I can't help myself here. On HCM, the

performance of our team on HCM was just superb. and I mean that's a global statement, Kash.
If we went back to the days of four or five years ago, it's just amazing. Totally what our product team has done, our
ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we've gotten. We did almost 1,000 new
HCM customer this year, two and a half times the guide we were talking about three or four years ago. It was just a
superb quarter for us by pillar and I think, to be honest with you, Kash, I think based on what I told you in my prepared

Your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. I have a question about the database. You announced R2 of 12c back at Oracle Open
World and I believe there was a webcast scheduled that was postponed Larry was supposed to do earlier this month on
the database. I realize you can't talk about the time of general availability of R2, but can you talk about, I don't know,
general anecdotes about early adopters for R2? And then also your expectations of how this will be consumed by
customers between license and cloud consumption because that'll help with us, regardless of how we think of it, how
we're going model it. Thanks.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: As you know R2, a lot of people don't migrate to the dot-one releases of our – the dot-zero
or the dot-one releases of our database. They wait for the dot-two release so that is completely stable. We have two key
features in version 12 of our database. One is in memory, the other is multitenancy. Both of those are in high demand. I
think it's made version 12 of our database one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years.
The question is, what will that adoption look like? I think you'll see early adoption in the cloud. I think cloud's going to
lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customers. A typical customer might have said, okay, I'd like to start
experimenting with release 12 and I'll going to put it on these five development computers over here. We're
encouraging our customers to look at an alternative. Why don't you just use the latest version in the cloud? And why
don't you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration and your upgrades in the cloud? It's
going to save you some money and allow you to get access even faster, and we think that's what's going happen.
We're also offering versions of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations, that because for statutory reasons on a
bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into the cloud. No problem. We'll take
our existing cloud hardware, the exact same configuration. We will move it behind your firewall and we'll let you run –
and we'll completely manage it for you behind your firewall. You'll buy it just like it's cloud. In other words, you won't
buy the hardware. There will be no upfront costs for the hardware. There's no upfront costs for the software. It will look
exactly like the Oracle Cloud; it's just the boxes will happen to be sitting on your data center floor behind your firewall.
So we're giving people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud. Because when our
customers go to the cloud, which is what we want them to do and we want them to go earlier, and another opportunity
to get them to move to the cloud is with accelerated adoption of 12.2 of our database. That's how we'd like them to
consume it. If they go to the cloud, they save money and it's easier for them, and we make more money and it's better
for us. So that's we'll – we'll be pushing our people. So again, we're incented and the customer's incented to get to the
cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4 and we're going
to keep pushing this fiscal year.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thanks, Larry. That's helpful. But just one clarification. When you talked about cloud hardware
configurations on-premise, are you alluding to Exadata? Is that what you're talking about? Especially for the database
because that's...

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Actually, it's very important. I'm glad you asked the question. Not just Exadata. So no, it
would be our Infrastructure-as-a-Service configuration and our Exadata configuration together which is PaaS. So
Exadata is really PaaS. It's just database-as-a-Service is what Exadata is when we install it as part of the cloud and we
manage it for you. But we have a separate box where you're running compute and block storage and all of our other
cloud services. We basically – it's like we'd open another cloud data center. Imagine we opened another cloud data
center at JPMorgan Chase. I'm not picking on my poor friend, Jamie Dimon, because best of my knowledge, we don't
have a deal do that at JPMorgan Chase.
But anyway, let's say they are uncomfortable – again, they've got certain statutes. Regulators want them to do this
behind their firewall. They're uncomfortable with them putting in a public cloud. We would actually create a little mini
version of our cloud data center on the JPMorgan Chase floor. We would manage it for them. They would not buy the
hardware. They would not buy the software.
They would just buy a cloud subscription, just like it's in our cloud. It just so happens we would locate that hardware,
which we would manage, we would locate that hardware on their floor behind their firewall for more security. But it
would just – again, it would be part – it would manage as part of the Oracle public cloud. The hardware's identical. The
software's identical to the Oracle public cloud. We're just allowing our customers that option. So we're trying to make it
easier for them and give them more options to get to the Oracle public cloud, even if you're a highly regulated bank.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.

The next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Hey, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter, particularly on the cloud and the
customer count number on the database as a- service side was quite impressive particularly. A question for Mark.
There's been a lot of discussion out there, rumors just in the market about changes to the comp plan of the sales force
focusing on cloud, not license and then others saying that you're dropping the cloud compensation structure. So I
wonder if you can just comment on if there are any changes to the comp program, the structure of the sales force or
kind of what they're focused on this fiscal year. That'd be great.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure. There really is no change to the "structure" when you throw that in. So we are actually
quite happy with our structure in that context. Now, we've actually cleaned up a few things. So I made some changes
three or four years ago to which group called on what and there were some things that we'd done that I would describe
them as de minimis in terms of changes, but who calls on what size of account, et cetera. So there's a little bit of that,
but frankly, not much else. We have made an investment, Phil, as I know you know in what we call Oracle Direct.
This is selling, really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplements it, and we continued to raise
the bar for those teams. It is a lower cost of sale, it is a much more modern way of selling and it is our primary vehicle
into what you would think of as SMB. And we've continued to expand their use, expand the amount of head count,
invest in tools. We talked last – I think last quarter that investment we made in Austin, the CapEx we spent to build out
that very modern center. So think more of that, Phil, more people, more support for that team, and they're actually
calling higher in terms of the size of accounts that they call, and very effective for us; more people. But when you look
at our spending, our spending actually doesn't go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of
those investments.
In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That's just pure nonsense. If anything, we believe
we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money. You sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than
anywhere else in the industry. And that's our model and that's what we've done.
In terms of on-prem comp in just applications, these are applications that are not our GBU applications, so think of
them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They

do receive some "comp" in the context as it relates to a license sale. But, Phil, to understand today, in horizontal apps
licenses, the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP
into our existing base, more users. And then within that, we've put a special team in place that actually focuses on
handling that within our user base. So I understand there's some noise about it, but I would describe this as a non-event.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Great, thanks for your clarification.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: By the way, I want to add because I just can't help myself. But as of today, all of our
salespeople have a territory. They have a comp plan. They have a boss. And virtually all of our salespeople since the
end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year have today been trained on all of our
numerous offerings. So I've had this goal, Larry and I have talked about this for years, that we would get to the point
that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever – by the way, most companies take a quarter, four
months, five months to get all this done.
Our objective has been that salespeople leave the fiscal year on May 31; that as soon as possible they get out of the
year, they have a quota. They have a comp plan. They have a boss. They have a territory, and they've been trained on
everything we've got. And I can tell you as we sit here today, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle
Corporation.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Awesome. Thanks, guys.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.

And our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I want to move up a little bit and talk about geographies
on two aspects. First of all, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the success you have in cloud in the different regions?
And then secondly, more bigger-picture, obviously worries about end demand, et cetera, in the different regions. And
maybe you can comment on what you're seeing out there in the field in general for the whole business. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'm sorry. I missed one word. Did you say end demand?
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Yes.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. By region, I think our performance in Asia-Pacific was superb. Now that's come from
where we've been over the past couple years, but I don't know that I would describe that as a market phenomenon. I'm
just going to make my comments in the context of Oracle. I think our team in Asia, which we've recruited over the past
18 months, did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong
growth really across every line. License performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb,
so very positive on Asia.
I feel the same way in Europe. There's a mixed economy over in Europe. We don't actually talk about it much around
here because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was
emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4. So I feel very good about it. I think that's the
way I would describe things outside the U.S.
LAD, we continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD, relative to the
market, I think our team performed fantastic. Our movement to the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we
have across our company.
And then you get to the U.S., and I think in applications, our move to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and it
shows up in the maturity of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. There's some just very exciting movements.
Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business. It is not a license business. It is a cloud business.

North America tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings, platform booking. And I would say – I'd also like to
throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate on our GBUs was
superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business, and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win at
Pfizer in the quarter. And they have really kicked their competitor, Medidata, pretty strong over the course of the year,
and I'd like to publicly give them the credit for that. They've done a great job. So maybe more data than you wanted,
but that's my view going across the globe.

Our next question will come from the line of Bradley Reback with Stifel.
<Q - Brad Reback>: Hey, thanks very much. Safra, could you maybe give us some sense of what the CapEx
requirements for the business should be here in 2017? Thanks.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So overall CapEx should be a little bit more than it is this year, very little bit more. And all of
that would be actually from the real estate – on our real estate side as we build out our campus in Texas. And also we
have a little bit more real estate around the country.
On the cloud CapEx, which is the one I think you guys have really been focusing on, as you know, in FY 2015, it was
quite high. It dropped really dramatically, like 30% this past year, and it will go up a little bit but not anywhere near
where it was in FY 2015. So I think generally, it's going be around where it is right now, and any increases are entirely
as a result of just some real estate things that will benefit us for decades, really, as we purchase pieces of property and
stuff like that.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: To Safra's point, our cost per seat for a sales rep is declining. So our cost of housing them, our
talent, we have to make these CapEx investments. But salary, bonus, everything is going to move with such into this
modern selling effort. We have more people, but our cost per seat is actually declining.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay.
<Q - Brad Reback>: Great, thanks very much.
Operator
And our final question for today will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks very much. Mark, just given the new customer count in cloud, it seems you're picking
up some momentum in the mid-market, especially around ERP. Can you just discuss what's driving that? Is it just more
focus from a sales standpoint? Is it having sort of a broader suite offering versus just sort of best-of-breed products?
Just any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, Kirk, I just think it's all of this stuff. I mean, I think the – listen, I mean, you can start
with the fact that we have good products. And we have good products; that's a really big advantage. So that's sort of
point one.
Point two, we've done a lot of training, and our salespeople are frankly better and they're coming with good products.
They now know a lot more about them, and we have references. When you have those sort of combinations, things go
well for you. I think we've done a good job putting our people – to Safra's point about the investments we're making,
we're putting people in these new modern capabilities that are giving them great tools now to go to market.

Now let me say all this against the backdrop of I think we're actually going to get better at this. So I think when you
look at our – you can't look at them, I can, but when I look at our pipelines, I remember two years ago I made the
statement that I thought our ARR would be good a couple of years ago, and a lot of people said, why? And it's because
our pipeline was up. And I can see it mature through the pipeline. This pipeline we have now is the strongest, best
pipeline we've had. And I believe our conversion rate, meaning the movement of that pipeline into actually booked
orders, will actually get better for the very reasons we're describing. And so I'm quite optimistic about it.
