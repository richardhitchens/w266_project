David M. Cote
Good morning, everyone.
As you've seen, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double digit earnings growth, capping off a strong first half to
the year and positioning us well as to achieve our full-year outlook as we head into the back half. Reported earnings per
share of $1.51 increased 10% normalized for tax coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Sales
of $9.8 billion were up 3% on a core organic basis. We saw organic growth accelerate in both the short and long cycle
businesses within aerospace, continued growth in our commercial and industrial businesses within ACS, and higher
volume across our Advanced Materials portfolio, particularly in fluorine products.
Each of our business segments achieved the sales estimates we provided in April, and we expect that the sales
acceleration we enjoyed this quarter will continue into the second half of the year. The absence of friction materials
strengthening of the U.S. dollar and raw materials pricings in resins and chemicals drove the difference between
reported and core organic sales growth.
Segment margin expanded 170 basis points to 18.4% in the second quarter, and similar to last quarter, a large portion of
the market expansion came from improving gross margins. Strong execution across the portfolio drove margin
expansion in each of our three segments at or above the targets we communicated in April. Our enablers and key
process initiatives continue to deliver growth and productivity benefits, and our previously funded restructuring actions
provide the runway we need to continue improving our operations and cost base.
We're keeping that pipeline full, which is critical to supporting our continued margin expansion into next year and
beyond. We proactively funded about $39 million of new restructuring in the quarter, building on a healthy pipeline of
new projects. While managing costs is critical, we are also seed planting. And that is investing in capacity expansion,
new products and technologies, and resources in high-growth regions to drive future growth. We also continue to
benefit from the strategic portfolio decisions we've made in the past, and we're well positioned and aligned to favorable
macro trends with significant runway to grow.
There continues to be a lot of exciting activity across the portfolio driving our strong results, so I can't help but
highlight a couple. In June, our Process Solutions business hosted their 40th annual Honeywell User Group, or HUG
Americas Symposium, a forum that provides users of our process control and industrial automation systems an
opportunity to exchange technical information and provide feedback on their equipment and service needs. The
sentiment was decidedly positive and the turnout of over 1,200 channel partners, end users, and Honeywell sponsors
from over 300 different companies was our largest ever. Customer interest in process solutions that drive increased
safety, reliability, and greater efficiency was noticeably higher than prior years.
In addition, Process Solutions announced a partnership with Intel Security to help bolster protection of critical
industrial infrastructure and data, combining the latest advances in cyber security technology with Honeywell's unique
industrial process domain knowledge, another example of our smart investments and commitment to growing our
software capabilities, which we see as a key differentiator.
In Aerospace, we announced last month an agreement to supply our advanced Primus Epic cockpit technologies to
Dassault's newly unveiled Falcon 5X. The new plane combines the latest features for safety and performance, including
SmartView Synthetic Vision, next-generation flight management system, IntuVue weather radar, and SmartTraffic
Collision Avoidance while achieving the lowest fuel consumption in its category. Our aerospace team and Dassault
developed the next-generation cockpit with the future in mind, giving pilots and operators advanced communication,
vision, and awareness features that simplify their jobs.
And in PMT, our fluorine products [inaudible] (5:50) an additional $600 million in orders with key OEMs for our
Solstice low global warming suite of products, bringing lifetime value of signed agreements to approximately $3.2
billion. We also have an additional $200 million in agreements currently under negotiation, which we anticipate
finalizing by the end of the year.

Our Solstice product has global warming potential less than CO2, making it a terrific choice for products and for
companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. EPA phase-out rules restricting the use of high global warming
hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs in a variety of applications, including refrigerants, aerosols, and foam insulation blowing
agents, coupled with approvals for the use of two additional Honeywell Solstice refrigerants as replacements for high
global warming HFCs continue to show that we are invested in the right place. The demand and adoption of Solstice
products continues to be a great story for Honeywell.
As we look ahead, we're not counting on a significant uptick in the current macro environment, but we are confident in
our ability to deliver continued sales growth and to leverage that growth to drive further margin expansion. As a result
of our strong first half performance, we are again raising the low end of our full-year 2015 earnings guidance range by
$0.05 to a new range of $6.05 to $6.15, up 9% to 11% versus last year. We have a fantastic portfolio and will continue
investing in high-growth regions, high ROI CapEx, and new products and technologies while maintaining our cost
discipline and ensuring we deliver the savings from restructuring projects funded over the past few years.
We're in the midst now of our strategic planning reviews of each of the three segments, and we're excited about each
business's innovation pipeline and growth opportunities. Over the next planning period, you can expect us to build on
our track record of outperformance through the consistent execution you have come to expect from Honeywell. We
continue to enhance our focus on each of the 74 HOS Gold Enterprises, which we believe will make us more
entrepreneurial and nimble versus our competitors by identifying breakthrough strategies and moves into smart new
areas and adjacencies. I look forward to sharing more with you of course as the year unfolds.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas A. Szlosek
Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on slide four, which shows the second quarter results.
Sales of $9.8 billion were up 3% on a core organic basis. Each of our segments met or exceeded the top line guidance
we provided in April, led by our Commercial Aero, the Commercial and Industrial businesses within HCS, and
Advanced Materials, and I'll talk about each of these more on the business slides. We're encouraged by the acceleration
from Q1, and the momentum we have exiting the second quarter bodes well for the second half. As Dave mentioned,
the Friction Materials divestiture, foreign currency, and the raw materials pricing in Resins and Chemicals all resulted
in the reported sales decline this quarter.
Segment margin expanded 170 basis points to 18.4%. That's 20 basis points above the high end of our guidance. Each
segment is contributing to the impressive profit growth and margin expansion this quarter, and good volume and strong
operations are playing a big part. On the volume side, our continued investments for growth in sales, marketing, and
new product development drove higher volumes in the quarter. On the operating side, we continue to drive
improvement in our gross margin rates and continued moderation of our G&A rates through HOS Gold deployment
and our focus on commercial excellence, new product development, functional transformation, and strong cost controls.
Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis, as we had anticipated. Higher pension income
was largely offset by additional restructuring. New restructuring projects funded this quarter were approximately $39
million, building on our over $300 million-plus pipeline as of the end of Q2, which positions us well for continued
margin expansion throughout our five-year plan.
We delivered at the high end of our EPS guidance range with earnings per share of $1.51, up 10% normalized to our
expected full-year tax rate of 26.5% in both periods, once again, achieving double-digit earnings growth this quarter.
Finally, free cash flow, $1.2 billion, 5% higher than 2014. Free cash flow conversion was 98%, and we expect to be in
a net cash position of between $1 billion and $2 billion by the end of the year if there's no significant M&A activity.
Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.

Let's turn to slide five. Our segment margin rate expansion was, again, very robust this quarter. As you can see, a
majority of the improvement is coming from our operating initiatives. The benefits of HOS Gold are paying off, and
we're seeing that in every segment's gross margin rate. We have attractive products with differentiated technologies and
a software focus. Our factories and supply chain are well run, and our back office continues to get more and more
efficient. In addition, new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions, particularly at ACS,
where we grew close to 10% in China and greater than 15% in India during the quarter, are also a big part of the story.
The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions enable us to continue to improve our overall
cost position. Also, our segment margin rate was positively impacted by the Friction Materials divestiture, our foreign
currency hedging approach, and the Resins and Chemicals pricing model, collectively to the tune approximately 60
basis points. We sold Friction Materials in July 2014, so we will lap this benefit in the second half of 2015, but this is a
permanent improvement to our margin rate from exiting a business that did not meet our great positions in good
industries criteria.
On foreign currency, our hedging strategy, as you know, is to protect our operating results even as sales do fluctuate
with changes in currency. Another solid quarter of margin improvement driven by our operating system and key
process initiatives.
Moving to slide six, in the Aerospace results, sales up in the second quarter, 3% on a core organic basis, above the high
end of our guidance range, driven by good volume growth and execution. Commercial OE was up 6% on a core organic
basis, driven by double-digit improvement in business and general aviation engine shipments. Engine demand
continues to be robust, and we expect to see continued Commercial OE growth in the second half, particularly in BGA.
Air Transport was flat, a reflection of the pluses and minuses in our customer build schedules for the quarter, while on
the regional side, we saw lower sales volume overall. Importantly, our installed base continues to grow in both ATR
and BGA, which is a good sign for our future aftermarket business.
And to that point, Commercial Aftermarket saw a nice improvement from the first quarter. Sales were up 3% on a core
organic basis, driven by continued strong growth in repair and overall activities and higher ATR spare sales, partially
offset by lower BGA RMUs, or retrofit, modifications and upgrades, in many cases, software-based. RMU sales growth
can be lumpy based on the timing of new product rollouts. And as you recall, 2014 was an extremely strong year for
RMU sales, and looking forward, we're excited about our new product pipeline in this area. Overall, we saw good
growth in the aftermarket and anticipate further improvement in the third quarter and through the second half of the
year.
Defense & Space, sales were up 1% on a core organic basis, driven by near double-digit growth in our international
defense business. Here we continue to see strong demand in the aftermarket and for our training propulsion engines and
missile navigation products in South Korea and other high-growth regions including Turkey. While in U.S., our sales
were slightly down.
Finally, Transportation System sales increased 5% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches, strong volume
growth in light vehicle gas applications globally, and growth in diesel applications, particularly in North America. This
was partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. On a reported basis, TS sales declined 25%, reflecting the
friction materials divestiture and foreign currency headwinds.
On segment margin, the favorable impacts of the Friction Materials divestiture and our foreign currency hedges were
drivers of the 140 basis points mentioned in Aerospace along with commercial excellence and productivity net of
inflation, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments. TS was a major contributor to the margin
enhancement in Aerospace this quarter, and not coincidentally, that's a business where we see the greatest
advancements in our HOS Silver certifications in our plants.
Let's turn to the ACS results from slide seven. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the second quarter,
continuing the positive core organic growth trends we saw in the first quarter. High-growth regions continued to stand
out in ACS, and we have good momentum heading into Q3 based on recent order trends. The margin expansion was
robust and we once again exceeded the high end of our margin guidance range.

ESS, the products business, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis in the second quarter, driven by strong
performance in our Scanning & Mobility, Fire Safety, and Security businesses. Scanning & Mobility achieved its third
straight quarter of double-digit core organic sales growth, driven by volume from recent wins, most notably the U.S.
Postal Service agreement, and new product introductions in China where we continue to build on our West to East II
pipeline to support future growth. We anticipate similar volume growth in the third quarter and will discuss in more
detail shortly. The rest of ESS also continued to benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in
high-growth regions. From a regional perspective, China was up high single-digit, while in India, sales were up over
15% with broad-based strength across the ESS portfolio.
Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the second quarter with continued
strength in the Americas Fire and Security Distribution business. We saw continued organic growth on our project
backlog and service bank this quarter, driven primarily by the Asia-Pacific region, which will help to support a modest
acceleration in the back half of the year. ACS margins expanded by 120 basis points to 16% in the quarter. This
business continues to benefit from good conversion on higher volumes and significant productivity improvements, net
of inflation.
But we also continued our investments for growth, particularly in new product development and in high-growth
regions. Our efforts to drive the more connected ACS, which Alex spoke about at our March Investor Day, provide a
runway for accelerating growth and continued margin expansion as we drive incremental synergies among our
businesses through supplier rationalization, footprint consolidation, and back office improvements. So in total, another
strong quarter of sales growth and margin expansion in ACS and continued outperformance in their key high-growth
regions.
I'm now on slide 8 to discuss PMT results. PMT sales in the quarter, $2.4 billion, down 1% on a core organic basis,
consistent with the guidance we presented last quarter. And we exceeded the high end of our segment margin guidance
by 70 basis points, driven by strong execution and productivity actions.
Starting with UOP, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis due to declines in our Gas Processing and Equipment
and Engineering businesses and the timing of catalyst shipments which we had previewed. Orders were down in the
second quarter throughout the business, which is adversely impacting backlogs. However, activity in our gas processing
business, both domestic and international, is encouraging and we expect orders in that business to accelerate in the third
quarter, which, along with the timing associated with the catalyst reloads, will offset some of the softness we are seeing
in UOP.
In process solutions, our portfolio is broader and more diverse than our competitors. We have a unique combination of
automation technology, field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings in the form of contracted and spot
service, software and consultative solutions that our competitors do not have. So while our short cycle field
instrumentation business faces headwinds like many others in the industry, we are seeing sales growth in our
high-margin software and service businesses. Customers are looking to our optimization solutions for productivity
enhancements to their current asset base. So overall, HPS core organic sales were down 4% and our orders were down
only 2% in the quarter. Our large projects business had strong orders in the quarter, particularly in the Middle East
where we see infrastructure investments continuing. The HPS backlog is solid and increased over 15% organically,
which gives us confidence in our growth projection.
Advanced Materials sales were up 8% on a core organic basis. The growth was broad-based across the entire portfolio.
Fluorine products grew double digits for the fourth straight quarter as demand for Solstice low global warming
products continues to escalate. As Dave mentioned, we presently have roughly $3.2 billion of signed agreements and
another $200 million under negotiation. To date, in 2015 alone, we've signed over $900 million in new orders. In
addition, sales in both resins and chemicals and specialty products grew on a core organic basis on higher volumes as
new product introductions here continue to drive results.
On segment margin, the PMT leadership team got out ahead of the market pressures to ensure we deliver the 2015
commitments. Q2 segment margins exceeded our guidance and were up 330 basis points to 21.3%. This was driven by
a significant productivity action net of inflation, commercial excellence and the impact of raw materials pricing in

resins and chemicals, partially offset by continued investments for growth. PMT continues to aggressively pursue
further cost-reduction opportunities, which should help sustain the strong margin expansion we've seen in the first half
of 2015.
I am now on slide nine with a preview of the third quarter. We're expecting total Honeywell sales of $9.7 billion to $9.9
billion, which would be up 3% to 4% on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up again,
approximately 120 to 140 basis points, and we expect our margin rate to benefit from operational excellence and good
execution similar to the first half margin expansion. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.56, which is up
6% to 9% normalized for tax at 26.5% in both years. Aerospace sales are expected to be up 3% to 4% on a core organic
basis. In commercial OE, we expect that core organic sales will be up mid-single digit, driven primarily by continued
healthy engine demand in the mid- to large cabin business aircraft. In commercial aftermarket, we expect core organic
sales to be up low to mid single digit with continued repair and overhaul and ATR spares growth partially offset by
modestly lower BGA spare sales.
Defense & Space sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued strength in
the international business, where we anticipate double-digit growth offset by a slight decline in the U.S. Transportation
system sales are expected to be up low to mid single-digit on a core organic basis driven by both light vehicle gas and
diesel turbo volumes. We expect Aerospace segment margins to increase 80 to 100 basis points in the quarter, driven
by commercial excellence, further productivity improvements and the favorable impacts of the Friction Materials
divestiture, which we'll realize through July.
ACS sales are expected to be up 4% to 5% on a core organic basis with mid-single digit core organic growth in ESS
and low single-digit core organic growth in BSD. We expect that growth in ESS will be driven by our Scanning &
Mobility, Fire Safety and Security businesses along with the benefits from new product introductions and high-growth
region penetration. ACS margins are expected to be up 50 to 70 basis points, driven primarily by good conversion on
higher volumes and continued productivity net of inflation. We will continue ramping up investments in new product
development and adding feet on the street in high-growth regions.
PMT sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. We're expecting UOP to be down mid to high
single digit on a core organic basis, primarily due to licensing and equipment declines and difficult year-over-year
comps in our catalyst business. But partially offset by modest growth in the gas processing business.
In HPS, we're expecting core organic sales to be slightly better than the second quarter as growth continues in our
higher-margin software and service businesses and we see a modest uptick in our process technology business driven
by a conversion of large projects in the backlog. HPS continues to be a strong contributor to the margin rate
improvement in PMT, driven by sales growth in our higher-margin software and service businesses and productivity
initiatives.
In Advanced Materials, we're expecting high single-digit core organic growth, principally driven by continued strength
in fluorine products as well as improving volumes in resins and chemicals and specialty products. Overall, PMT
segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 230 to 250 basis points, driven by strong productivity net of
inflation and the favorable margin rate impact of the market-based pricing model in resins and chemicals. While the
second half of the year will be challenging for PMT, the strong growth in our Advanced Materials portfolio and our
disciplined cost management and productivity initiatives give us confidence in our forecast.
Let's turn to slide 10 to address the trends we're seeing in our key end markets and discuss how they're impacting our
market. On balance, you can see an overall positive perspective. Beginning with the non-residential portion of ACS, we
expect acceleration in commercial construction spending and our positive outlook for the year, the full year, remains
intact. We saw strong growth in our short cycle businesses in Fire Safety and Security and expect that new wins,
commercial excellence, and initiatives in high-growth regions, as well as positive end-market trends will continue to
drive growth in these businesses. As for Building Solutions, the firm backlog in our projects business and growth in our
service bank support an improvement for the remainder of 2015.

On the industrial side, we continue to benefit from the demand for productivity solutions and increasing safety
standards across the globe, as activity picks up in both the U.S. and in our high-growth regions. So overall, good
momentum as we head into the third quarter after solid core organic growth in the second quarter.
In Aerospace, our outlook on the commercial aftermarket continues to improve. Flight hours for air transport and
regional are to grow at approximately 4.5% in 2015, slightly above 2014. And on the business jet side, we expect that
flight hours for large cabin aircraft will continue to grow in 2015, up mid-single digit, reflecting continued healthy
demand. We anticipate that the good growth we saw in R&O this quarter will continue in Q3 and Q4, while sales of
BGA spares will also improve, in part driven by the RMU portfolio. So overall, we expect a modest acceleration in the
second half of the year for aerospace – commercial aerospace that is.
In Defense & Space, we're seeing strong international demand as defense budgets continue to grow. This is supported
by the high single-digit core organic growth we experienced in our international business in the second quarter and our
strong backlog. Although still a modest headwind associated with lower government funding levels, we expect the U.S.
portion of the business to stabilize, consistent with U.S. DoD budgets. Overall, we remain on track for low single-digit
core organic growth for Defense & Space in 2015.
On oil and gas, we actually are seeing a very robust level of proposal activity in both UOP and HBS. And in some
pockets, orders are expected to accelerate, such as in the UOP gas processing business, where we expect a reasonably
strong third and fourth quarter from modular equipment offerings outside the U.S. But on balance, we're not expect a
broader recovery for UOP order rates in the near time.
In process solutions, we anticipate continued growth in orders in the second half in our solutions and software
businesses, and expect that a good portion of the large process technology orders booked in the first half will also
convert to sales. Activity in the Middle East should continue to be strong, while in other regions, including China and
Southeast Asia, we anticipate a continued slowdown in order activity for process solutions.
As for the rest of the Honeywell portfolio, commercial OE, transportation systems, the residential business and ACS,
and Advanced Materials, we're expecting continued good growth in the second half. Our installed base in commercial
OE continues to grow with good wins on the right platforms. Global penetration of turbo technology, particularly for
gas engines, will continue, and our track record of flawless launches in TS remains a key differentiator.
On the residential side, we expect growth to continue as we accelerate investments in the Connected Home space and
build on our strong position. And in advanced materials, customer demand for our low global warming suite of
products is increasing, and we are encouraged by the continued adoption of Solstice on a global basis.
I'm turning to our full-year guidance on page 11. As Dave mentioned, based on our strong first half performance, we're
raising the low end of the full-year EPS guidance range, with a new range of $6.05 to $6.15. Everything else is pretty
much intact as we head into the second half of 2015. We've demonstrated our ability to perform in a challenging
environment, and we're highly confident we can do the same again this year. Full-year sales expectations remain in the
range of $39 billion to $39.6 billion, up approximately 3% on a core organic basis. There are some puts and takes
among the businesses, but overall we remain on track to the full-year guidance we provided in April.
On the segment margin, we've increased our full-year guidance by 10 basis points on the low end, as our deployment of
HOS Gold continues to drive a better, more efficient operating system, both in our plants and in our back office. We
now expect segment margins of 18.4% to 18.6%. That's up 140 to 160 basis points versus last year, excluding the
impact of the fourth quarter $184 million aerospace OEM incentives. On EPS, the new guidance range results in a 9%
to 11% increase from 2014. Again, we're planning for a 26.5% tax rate in the third quarter, with the fourth quarter tax
rate a bit lower to get to our full-year planning assumption of 26.5%.
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, up 8% to 11% from 2014, even
with CapEx investments rising to roughly twice that of depreciation. Each of the businesses remains focused on driving
further working capital improvement in the second half. So overall, we're forecasting another very strong year, solid
organic sales growth and strong execution that yield excellent segment margin and free cash flow outcomes and
another year of double-digit EPS growth, which should mark our sixth consecutive year of having done so.

Let's turn to slide 12. And in summary, we had a solid first half and with second quarter performance, again, at the high
end of expectation, adding to our strong performance track record and creating momentum for the rest of the year. The
uncertainty in the macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We'll
continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on strong restructuring pipeline
we've already funded. Innovation and new product introductions remain a key priority as well as the investments we're
making to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity.
We're in the process, as Dave mentioned, of planning for the long term, including 2016 and beyond, and our
management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that with our balanced portfolio mix, alignment to
favorable macro trends and focused cost disciplines, we'll continue to outperform.
So with that, let's move to Q&A.

Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: Okay. Operator?

The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Scott Davis from
Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hey. I'm going to save the usual congratulatory language, Dave.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you. It's still nice to hear it, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I know it.
<A - David M. Cote>: I know it kills you, too.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: It does. It does. Anyway, Dave, help us. I was going ask about capital allocation, but I think
that would be a waste of a question at this point. What are you seeing in the world, Dave? And the reason why I ask
that question is, you know, last quarter you had to 2% core growth. I think it was this quarter, 3% core growth. Next
quarter, you're kind of guiding to 3% to 4%. So you've been sequentially improving or at least talking about sequential
improvement, but the world seems like it is almost going the other direction, that sequentially, it may be degrading. Are
you not seeing that? Or kind of help us understand how the macro lines up with the guidance.
<A - David M. Cote>: I wouldn't say we're seeing a boomlet, and that's not what we've tried to convey, but all in all, I
think starting off with what was generally a slow first quarter for everyone when it came to sales growth, things have,
in my view, improved a bit since that time, and I'd say a lot of this is coming more under what we're able to control and
what we are able to do, and we're seeing better performances in our businesses being able to take advantage of the
growth trends that do exist. I'd also say, Scott, we benefit some from this diversity of opportunity that you hear me talk
about so that, yeah, okay, we got some oil and gas exposure, but we're able to manage that, and that it doesn't have such
a deleterious effect on our performance that we can't manage above it. So I'd say it's more a combination of things and
saying that it's slightly better than it was, but it's still not a boomlet.

Tom, I don't know if there's anything you want to add there.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, I would agree with that. The only piece of color to maybe provide is that when you
look at the months, sequentially, April was definitely the lowest from a growth perspective, which is up slightly,
whereas the momentum picked up in May and June and got us to that 3%.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay, that's helpful. Guys, how you think about the interplay between growth and margin?
And what I mean is, I mean you've been crushing it on the margins. Core growth has really been pretty much in line
with the group now for most of the last couple of years, give or take a point. Are there conversations you have
internally around that going after margin might be hurting price in some – I'm sorry, might be hurting growth to some
extent or is that just not related at all?
<A - David M. Cote>: The two are interconnected but I look at it differently. And if you go back to the beginning of
my tenure here, I've always said growth and productivity go together. That as you grow, you become more productive
because you have more volume leverage, you're able to leverage your fixed cost better. By the same token, the more
productive you become, the more money that gives you to reinvest in the things you'd like to do. And as you know, I
have always been big on this concept of seed planting. And that was pretty costly in the early years because we pretty
much had an empty pipeline in everything, whether it was high-growth regions, new products, new strategies or
technologies. We really had to fill the pipeline, so margin expansion was a little more muted back then because we had
to fill the pipeline on everything. And that took us five or six years to do, which unfortunately took us right into the
recession when, yeah, we were getting benefiting from some of that, but it was just a hell of a lot less visible.
Now that we're able to get some of the sales growth that we do, we're much better able to get that sales leverage, as
minimal as it might seem in today's environment. We're still able to get leverage from that, and we're able to, I'd say,
finally start seeing the benefits of HOS and some of our other initiatives on the gross margin side. And that's where
we're seeing the real leverage here. The two go together, and I could promise you we're certainly not under investing,
whether you look at R&D or CapEx or new product programs, our commitment to HUE is certainly not a case of
underinvestment, because we want to make sure we make not just this quarter but this same quarter three years from
now and six years from now.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Makes sense. The track record is there. So, thanks, guys, and good luck and have a great rest
of summer.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, you too.
Operator
And we'll now take our next question from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs & Co.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Joe. Thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's nice to hear it stated with no reluctance at all, Joe. Thank you. Unlike Scott.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: We differ in that way.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Just that way.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: The first question I have is really around China. You guys seem to still be doing incredibly
well there, growing at double digits, and you've had some of your European peers come out and talk about credit issues
recently and fears are starting to intensify a little bit more around the region. I'm just wondering what you're seeing
specifically in the region and whether trends deteriorated at all during the quarter?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Joe, good – I'll take that one, Dave. China was a very good story for us in most of the
pockets. I mean, ACS, as we've said, was neared double-digit. Really, the changes that we've made to connect all of
those businesses in China and get to Tier 2, Tier 3 cities and make investments to help all the businesses in the
portfolio, running it as one portfolio, really having a huge impact and, in fact, we expect that to continue, we expect to
have very strong growth rates in Q3 and Q4. In fact, for China, some of our orders are actually – we use sales as a
surrogate for orders, but in some cases we actually do have the orders, and what we're seeing really gives us good
encouragement for the rest of year in ACS.
Aero was also strong. As you know, it's mostly spares and R&O business there in China for us right now, up mid-single
digits. And we do expect that to continue. TS is a little bit smaller. The commercial vehicles segment in TS was
challenged, so we were down in China for transportation systems, and then when you look at PMT, some challenges,
particularly with cyclicality in UOP. The CAS shipments are quite lumpy, can be lumpy from year-over-year. In Q2,
we had significant CAS sales. So tough quarter from that perspective, but we see that improving as we go forward into
Q3. So I think all of the businesses are expected to continue to grow and improve from Q2 to Q3. So we're encouraged
by what's going on.
<A - David M. Cote>: So if I can add to that, Joe, you'd have to say overall, clearly, the Chinese economy is straining
a bit more than it has in the past, but all that being said, it's still pretty good, and we see the oil and gas side, to Tom's
point, but on balance between the growth that does exist there plus our own strength, as we develop more China-based
products, I think puts us in a pretty good spot.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Now that's helpful, guys. I guess maybe following up on oil and gas and specifically the
margins this quarter, they were pretty phenomenal. And I'm just wondering if you can help parse out the 330 basis
points, because clearly you still expect oil and gas margins to continue to be good in 3Q despite a deteriorating
backdrop. And so just help us get a little bit more color into that.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, as you know – thanks for pointing that out, Joe. As you know, PMT margins were up
to 21.3%. They were 18% last year. So really nice, 330 basis points. We had great contributions from some volume in
Advanced Materials, as we talked about. Very good productivity, strong cost controls, lower indirect expenses, but also
at the same time, as Dave said, continuing the investments. So productivity was definitely a big driver. We're also
seeing good results in terms of pricing. That seems to be holding up well, and as I said, there are some things that have
driven that down a little bit. The catalyst comps year-over-year, a little bit of a tougher story, and then the overall
volume declines that we mentioned, UOP and HPS were dragged. So to summarize all that, I'd say good commercial
excellence, good performance on the commercial side, tough from a volume perspective but really nice work on
productivity.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: All right, great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: All right, Dave. A very enthusiastic, great quarter.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you. Much appreciated.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Could you feel that coming through?
<A - David M. Cote>: I like it.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. So obviously, the full year plan, pretty much intact here, a little bit higher at the low end on
the margin line. Just reading through the commentary, it feels like Commercial Aerospace is a little bit better than the
plan, perhaps PMT a little bit weaker. Is that a fair comment, perhaps, Tom?

<A - David M. Cote>: I don't know that – well, I guess, PMT might be a little weaker than what we thought because
oil and gas had a slightly bigger impact than we thought at the beginning of the year. But still pretty much within the
forecast, and I'm pretty sure – I think all three segments beat their sales numbers based on what we had committed,
anyway.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, for the quarter.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. So the mix is pretty much as you expected. Okay.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: That's great. And then just switching to the Solstice backlog, $3.2 billion, that's obviously a very
impressive number given the size of that business right now. Do you have any – can you give us any sense on how that
backlog is aging and how much of that backlog converts for the next couple of years?
<A - David M. Cote>: Most of it is all forward. We're not going to age the backlog, but I would say it's going to be a
good contributor to us over the next two or three years, especially as you think about that PMT inflection that we talk
about that's going to be driven by the UOP MTO stuff and the fluorines capacity, both of which we're investing in
today.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, and then just a final one. I think, Tom, you mentioned 3Q TS up low single digits, and I think
there's expectation that European volumes might pick up in 3Q. So I'm wondering, number one, did you see that
coming through in Europe? And then secondly, are we seeing a big offset from the commercial weakness there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I think in the second quarter, TS in Europe was – you're right, was pretty strong from an
organic basis. I mean, mid-single digits, as we said, in line with overall TS. And we see that continuing for the third
quarter. I mean, it's a mix of some platforms expiring and new platforms coming on, and there are some offsets that
also come into play. The commercial vehicles overall for – both in China and the U.S., as we've talked about, has been
kind of one of the challenges we're dealing with. But overall, Europe should be up mid-single digits or even higher for
us in the third quarter for Transportation Systems.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's great. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning, all.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Hi.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey, Dave. The only thing I can say is the share price is thanks enough. So I'll leave it
there, okay?
<A - David M. Cote>: We wanted to keep everybody comfortable, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: It's important, Dave. Need these results. So let me just ask quickly on the quarter for Q3
guidance, it looks like it's up, I guess, 5% year-on-year, which implies the fourth quarter's got to be up like 15%.
Maybe talk about the cadence there and, particularly, within Aerospace. I think you've got lower margin expansion on
higher core growth than you did before. And is that just a – even though that's a strong 80 to 100 basis point number, is
that just mix offsets, or what are the headwinds there?

<A - David M. Cote>: First of all, I don't think the beat percents are quite as dramatic as you indicated, but I'll turn it
over to Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: We will have a very strong fourth quarter. There are some nice inflections coming in PMT.
As an example, we have – and again, there's some lumpiness in that, in the CAS business, but we think that in PMT
we're going to see some nice growth coming through in those businesses in the fourth quarter. And overall, it is our
highest quarter from a volume perspective, so the basis is really driven by what we see, the visibility that we have to the
sales pipeline.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And the margins in Aero? Even though it's 80 to 100 basis points, again, the core growth is
looking strong and you did more before. What are the headwinds there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Say it again, Steve?
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Just the Aerospace, what are the headwinds to not putting up even higher Aerospace
margins in Q3?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: We get more comparability from an FX perspective, and of course, Friction Materials is in
the business as well, so the two of those temper the significance of the margin increase. So if you go back to that page,
I think it was page five in our slide, and you see the big impact from those three factors. Those tend to subside as we
get further into the year, particularly the FX on the Friction Materials.
<A - David M. Cote>: Because Friction was sold mid-July last year.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, but operationally, all the factors we've talked about from an operational perspective
still should hold in pretty firm.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And how's the cash flow progress in Aero? Is that improving? And as you see that
improving, Dave, you talked about a lot of opportunity there going forward.
<A - David M. Cote>: The cash flow is still good. They just need to do a significantly better job on inventory than they
have in the past.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay.
<A - David M. Cote>: Which would be an upside.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And maybe just lastly on gross margins, just a little bit bigger picture question. So this is
the highest Q2 gross margin we've obviously seen in a very, very, very long time. So as you see that crossing 30% now,
Dave, from a pricing and business model perspective, do you think it can continue at the same pace? Do you think it
can accelerate, decelerate? How are you thinking about that?
<A - David M. Cote>: I think is going to be an ongoing phenomenon for us. I'm not going to commit what it's going to
get to at some point, but certainly it's going to be an important factor as we continue to grow our overall operating
income percentage.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Right, okay. All right, thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: See you, Steve.

<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Dave, the 40th anniversary Honeywell User Group, did you guys print up some shirts, like
give me a hug or something like that you could send around?
<A - David M. Cote>: Only for you, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Okay, I'll be checking my mailbox. Hey, just a couple things actually. First, thinking about
business jet and particularly large cabin, there are some cracks showing up in what some of the OEs are saying,
pressure from wealthy developing countries and the like. It sounds like you're pretty constructive on the back half, but
do you see any reduction in the order books going forward there?
<A - David M. Cote>: Not for us. I would say, while they may be seeing some softness, which will get reflected for us
also, it's going to be more than offset by all the gains we've had.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Both on the equipment side and on R&O, strong R&O performance as well in BGA. And it
looks like that will hold up for the rest of the year.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Okay. And then on gas processing getting firmer, I guess you pointed to emerging markets.
Is there something really specific driving that? Are there some share gains or what's actually the driver behind that?
<A - David M. Cote>: If you go back to the premise of the Thomas Russell acquisition that we did then, it was
primarily a U.S.-based business. And we said at the time that our intent was to grow it more internationally, which
takes some time to make happen. But you're starting to see the benefit of a lot of that from all the seed planting that we
did over the last two or three years to make that happen. And that's mostly the effect you're getting.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And then finally, maybe for Tom, I was just wondering on hedges. Have you done anything
new there, rolled it forward? Or are we making the bet here this whole euro trade has played itself out and you're going
to let things roll off? What's the thought process there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: We're not betting, first of all. But what we told you at the end of the first quarter is pretty
much consistent with where we are right now. So you know the story on 2015, pretty much fully hedged for the rest of
the year. 2016, we've got the euro hedged probably about three quarters of the exposure, and selective hedging in some
of the other currencies. We keep our eye on it. We talk about it every week, and we're all closely interested in seeing
how that plays out.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: What's the exchange rate on the hedge for 2016?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: As we said for the euro, it's $1.10.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: $1.10. Okay, thank you very much.
<A - David M. Cote>: See you, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Thanks.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On PMT, the UOP business, Thomas Russell, how bad was it in the quarter? And do
you think that there's enough out there that you can confidently say that you may be able to fill this domestic hole and
actually hold the business flat next year?
<A - David M. Cote>: We're still in the process of planning everything for 2016. But overall, I think Tom alluded to
this earlier. We've got pretty good quote activity going in both oil and gas, UOP and process controls. So we'd like to
think – now quote activity is not synonymous with an order, but it's certainly a nice, hopefully, leading indicator of
where things could go. That being said, that's too early to declare victory.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Sequentially, we're seeing improvement from first quarter, second quarter, third quarter
expectations on orders in the gas business, and there's a reasonable degree of visibility to some of the revenues that we
expect to see in the second half. So as Dave said, we're watching it closely, but there are some positive signs for that
business.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Is there another part of PMT? Are there benefits from what's going on in downstream
margins globally? Or it seems like a lot of the stuff is much more UOP-specific, so a little bit tougher to call by looking
at just the macro. Is that the right way to think about it? And I guess, are you still in a growth mode again for UOP in
2016? I know you guys talked about that last quarter that you expected to grow in 2016.
<A - David M. Cote>: I guess a couple of things that I'd mention is – one of the things we've said in the past is that you
have to break out that oil cycle between the exploration side that's more price-driven and the refining petrochemical
side that's going to be more driven by economic activity. And you're seeing a bit of a drag on that second part because
of how people have reacted to the first part. But overall, their margins, as you know, looked pretty good. And we think
over time, that investment begins. When it comes to UOP, they still got the capacity expansion that's coming, and that
stuff, we've got to complete that plant on time because we need to ship and the projects are already being built. So I
certainly feel more than okay about it.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And you still feel pretty confident with the fluorine stuff coming on? That, that revenue,
incremental revenue chart, you guys put up in March with I think it was like $1 billion in incremental revenue in 2017,
even with the oil and gas macro headwinds out there, that you are – that there's kind of no changes to that view?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Even better.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Even better with the fluorine products dynamic. And then one last question. Any degree
of evolution at all on the balance sheet? I mean, you guys are clearly executing well, so you don't necessarily need –
there's really not a need for significant urgency around the balance sheet but any of these properties that you covet
loosening up at all with what's clearly a more – a tougher macroeconomic out there or no change?
<A - David M. Cote>: I have to say, the strategy hasn't changed. And like I've said with a retail store, you never know
when these things are going to hit. You never know when the customer is going to walk in. So we are armed and ready.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. But no big buyback, near term?
<A - David M. Cote>: Strategy is still the same.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

And we'll now take a question from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. You called – Tom, you called this out a little bit, but maybe you
could elaborate a bit. SG&A was down substantially. I think it fell from 13.4 to 12.7. Can you elaborate on some of the
causes? Some of it may be FX but a bunch of it is probably process changes.

us, the initiatives that we've got going on, the continued work that we're doing in functional transformation, the
continued work that we're doing in managing the indirect costs that those groups and functions spend, the e-auction
process that we're using, all the initiatives are really having a solid impact and are coming through. So there's not one
thing in there. It's just continued, sustained momentum that we've got.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: And then you've talked a lot about – one of the things that makes a difference at
Honeywell has been new products, and we can see it fluorines and we can see it in a few other places. Is there – have
you – do you have a metric that you look at in terms of new sales, new product sales, as a comparison to a year ago?
<A - David M. Cote>: Actually, Howard, I've always tried to stay away from that because if you want a metric that
can be easily gained internally and externally, that's it. So I go more by, are we growing faster than our competition?
And when I see things like the Dassault cockpit and what we're able to do with fluorines and what ACS has coming and
the HUE basis that everybody is using for it, that I know it's happening.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: I hear you. And then if I could just go back...
<A - David M. Cote>: In other words, if you said, geez, we want to see 50% of your sales coming from products
introduced in the last three years, my guess is every company can generate that metric for you, regardless of how
they're performing.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Fair point. And then the last thing, I think a number of people before me have asked the
same question in another way. It seems as if in PMT, the oil and gas expectations that had been laid out earlier have
shifted to the right. Have you gone back in and examined exactly why? Or even have you kind of added some belts and
suspenders to the process to make sure that, in fact, the second half that you're looking for is going to play out the way
you'd like?
<A - David M. Cote>: We're not counting on a huge second half on oil and gas. It's kind of static. May be a little bit
better, but we're not counting on anything big.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No. I think you'll see an uptick in orders, knock on wood, for gas, as we've said, as well as
for catalysts. But on balance, I don't think we're expecting a major material change right now.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: All right, thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah.

<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Hey, Dave. Hey, Tom. So you talked about the inflections at Aero...

<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Hello?
<A - David M. Cote>: A question for you first. How is the ankle?
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thanks. Slow, but better than ski season.
<A - David M. Cote>: the rumor we heard is that you drank a six-pack and tried to jump into a dingy. Is that true?
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: I think it was a 12-pack, but...
<A - David M. Cote>: Just so you know, we have feelers out there, too.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: I guess you do. No. That was a day with the kids. That was a clean day. So – like all of
them. So with ACS, you've talked about the inflections of PMT and aviation. So with ACS, if we look at a few more
years where the macro remains in this way, can and HUE and VPD actually drive some acceleration there? Or is 3% to
4% in this environment kind of the reflection of that?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say we're counting – a 3% to 4% as kind of like a nice, steady grower in an industry
that's going to be growing slightly. I do think, to your point, that kind of the HUE-based onslaught that they're going to
be showing over the next few years will make a difference, and there's a potential for it to be better than that. Tough to
predict at this point, but I'm encouraged by what I see out of the ACS guys.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay. And you used the word boomlet, I'll compliment you on that one. If you were to
see a boomlet, what are – is an area or two where that could be? I mean, do you have drivers in there for Commercial
Aftermarket, or you know, just as an example?
<A - David M. Cote>: I guess I've got to be careful that Steve doesn't put deleterious boomlet together, but at the end
of the day, it's the way I'd kind of still describe it. And on the commercial side, I think it's doing slightly better for us,
and you'll start to see an inflection as we go out into the future, because we're finally going to see the benefits of all the
wins, and that starts building our installed base, as Tom pointed out on the engine side, which all proves good for us.
Tom, anything you want to add there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay, thank you.

And, ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we will take our last question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital
Markets.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. Dave, I thought at some point, you
would have worked in a 'Free Brady' into your remarks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, and I was expecting you to talk about [inaudible] (1:02:30), Deane, so I guess we both
were disappointed.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Dave's spirit is still deflated on that one.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Understood.
<A - David M. Cote>: That's bad. It's very bad.
<Q - Deane Dray>: One of the bullish comments that you had was on non-res, so just maybe expand a bit on the
dynamics in the market, kind of the data points. Is this part of the boomlet that you'd expect to see in the second half?

<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say it continues to get better, as we've talked about in the past, and I don't think you're ever
going to see a boom in non-res construction, largely because there was never a real crash. It was kind of that slow in,
slow out kind of thing that we've talked about with the recession. I think that's what we're going to continue to see. On
the residential side, my guess is you're going to continue to see that do better, because rents have been going up, and
that will spur more activity, but I think for non-res, that's the right way to think about it. It's kind of slow and steady.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: That's where we've seen our best growth in ACS, particularly on the industrial side, the
industrial piece of the non-res. But commercial buildings, as well, the trends are very good. The products that we sell
into there in ECC, Fire and Safety or Security, all of them are doing well.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Great, thank you.
