MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in a
listen only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections,
you may disconnect at this time.
I would now turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin.
Chris Suh

forward-looking statements.
Before I hand the call over to Peter, I'd like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will
relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current
quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferrals and recognition related to Windows,
Office and Xbox video games and the expense related to the non-tax-deductible European Commission fines. Details of
the adjustments can be found in our financial summary slide deck and press release.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone.
Before I get into my comments about the quarter, let me say a few words about the CFO transition we announced
today. As we all do throughout our careers, at various times we assess our personal and professional goals and
priorities. Sometimes we change jobs, sometimes we change companies, and sometimes we step back to focus on
family and other personal goals.
As we approach the end of our fiscal year, for me personally, it's a good time to refocus my priorities and spend time
with family in a way I haven't previously had the chance. I feel great that the company is on a path to an exciting future
in devices and services and I couldn't be more proud of and confident in the finance organization.
I look forward to working with my successor on the transition, including getting out and meeting with many of you. I
have truly enjoyed working with all of you.
Now on to the quarter. I'm pleased to report we drove revenue and earnings per share growth of 8% even as we
navigate an evolving device market. Our results reflect our diversified portfolio as well as the investments we have
made in key strategic areas. During the quarter, we launched new Office, our enterprise cloud services continued to
gain traction, and we continued to take market share in the data platform.
Before I dive into more details on our progress in these areas, I want to address what's top of mind for many of you,
which is our Windows business. There is no doubt the device market is evolving. Consumers and businesses are
increasingly shifting their focus to touch and mobility and as a result, they want touch-enabled computing devices that
are ultra-thin, lightweight and have long battery life. While Windows revenue has been impacted by the transition from
the traditional PC to a new era of computing devices, the overall addressable markets are growing and we are excited
by the opportunities ahead of us.
We built Windows 8 with touch and mobility at the center of the experience, which positions us well in this new era.
However the transition is complicated given the size of our hardware and software ecosystems. We still have an
immense amount of work to do; yet we feel good about the foundation we have laid and are optimistic about the
long-term success of Windows.
I want to take some time now to be clear about where we are in this journey and what we are doing to help drive this
change. With Windows 8, we are setting a new accelerated pace for updates and innovation as we focus on making the
Windows experience richer and better. Since launch, we have delivered several important updates to improve our mail,
storage, search, music and video services.
During the quarter, we also added to the Surface family of devices with Surface Pro, which combines the performance
capabilities of a PC with a modern tablet design. Looking ahead, we will release the next version of Windows,
code-named Windows Blue, which further advances the vision of Windows 8 as well as responds to customer
feedback.
The assortment of touch-enabled devices that are built for Windows 8 by our OEM partners is also improving. Over the
last couple of months we started seeing devices that take full advantage of Windows 8 and we expect to see more

devices across more attractive price points over the coming months.
As part of this, we are also working closely with OEMs on a new suite of small touch devices powered by Windows.
These devices will have competitive price points partly enabled by our latest OEM offerings designed specifically for
these smaller devices, and will be available in the coming months.
In the upcoming back-to-school selling season, we expect to see devices that incorporate advances from throughout the
supply chain, including chipsets. As well, Intel's fourth-generation Core processor will help enable new devices that
combine performance benefits with power savings. Later in the year, we expect to see devices based on Intel's
upcoming Bay Trail Atom processor, which promises to deliver tablets and hybrid PCs with extended battery life at
competitive prices.
Today in the Windows store, there are six times as many apps since launch and we expect more to be added as we gain
traction with Windows 8 adoption. In June, we will host Build, our developer conference, where we will provide more
tools and information for developers to build great Windows 8 apps.
In Retail, we are working to improve the consumer purchasing experience. Our initiatives include focused efforts to
further educate and incentivize retail sales professionals and to have better in-store product differentiation.
In summary, Windows is transforming to the new era of computing. As I said on our last earnings call, growth in
Windows depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want at the price points they demand and
a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse needs. We are hard at work with our partners to meet these
goals and we're confident we are moving in the right direction.
Now, switching gears to productivity. This quarter, we launched the latest version of Office, which brings mobility,
social and cloud features to the world's most popular productivity app. Importantly, the new Office represents a
fundamental shift in our model. Now, both businesses and consumers can access Office through subscription. With this
shift, we expect to grow our customer base, increase customer satisfaction via continuous updates, and reduce piracy.
As our enterprise customers modernize their productivity infrastructures, we are confident they will continue to deploy
Office 365. We also expect our transactional customers to increasingly transition to the cloud with Office 365.
It's been a while now that we've been talking about our investments in the cloud, and I'm pleased to share that we are
starting to realize the benefits of those investments in a meaningful way. Office 365 lights up with this latest release, as
evidenced by our growing customer adoption. This quarter was our strongest ever, with net seat additions up five times
over the prior year. One in four of our enterprise customers now has Office 365 and the business is on a $1 billion
annual revenue run rate.
Our Server & Tools business continued its momentum with yet another solid quarter of revenue growth. Within the
data platform, we continue to take share with our strength in mission-critical and business intelligence workloads.
Enterprise has recognized the power of SQL Server to unlock business insights and as a result, we continue to
significantly outpace the market and are seeing new deployments and very healthy renewals.
In enterprise cloud, just in the last week, we launched our Windows Azure Active Directory and Infrastructure as a
Service offering on Windows Azure. This innovation across platform and infrastructure services uniquely positions
Microsoft as the only cloud provider who can offer customers a comprehensive hybrid cloud solution that integrates
existing IT infrastructure with all the benefits of the public cloud.
Xbox continues to be at the center of our living-room strategy, having evolved from gaming to an entertainment
platform. Whether they are playing games, being social or watching movies, consumers continue to be drawn to Xbox
Live. Xbox Live now has over 46 million members, up 18% from the prior year. Clearly, there's a lot of momentum,
and with E3 only a couple of months away, we look forward to sharing more shortly.
In summary, our diversified portfolio drove solid revenue and earnings-per-share growth. We are hard at work here at
Microsoft and with our partners to drive Windows 8 adoption forward. At the same time, we have strong momentum in
our enterprise businesses, including our cloud services. Combined with our unique consumer assets like Xbox Live and
Skype, we are well-positioned to deliver on our devices and services strategy.

And with that, I'll hand it over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results in more detail. I will then come back to discuss
our expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment.
Our diversified portfolio helped us deliver solid financial growth this quarter. Revenue was up 8% to $18.8 billion and
operating income increased 5% to $6.7 billion. Earnings per share grew 8% to $0.65.
Foreign exchange had a $180 million or 1 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $99 million or
2 percentage point negative impact to net income.
From a geographic perspective, we saw similar growth rates across both developed and emerging markets.
Multi-year licensing revenue continued to be strong, growing 16%. Additionally, unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.1
billion and our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion.
In the Windows Division, revenue was flat this quarter. Within that, OEM revenue performance was in line with the
underlying x86 PC market, which continues to be challenged as the PC market evolves beyond the traditional PC to
touch and mobile devices.
This quarter, inventory levels were drawn down as the channel awaits new Windows 8 devices. Non-OEM revenue
grew 40% this quarter, driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth involving licensing. Businesses
continue to value the Windows platform. Volume licensing of Windows is on track to deliver almost $4 billion in
revenue this year and nearly three-quarters of enterprise agreements that we signed this year include Windows.
Additionally, this quarter, we saw continued progress in the transition of Windows XP to Windows 7, and now
two-thirds of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7.
Next I'll move on to our Server & Tools business, where we continue to have good momentum. Revenue grew 11%,
highlighted by multiyear licensing revenue, which grew 20%. The strength in multiyear licensing reflects the
commitment and confidence that our customers have in our products and roadmap.
In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets Tier 1 application workloads, saw significant
revenue growth again this quarter. Companies such as Dominos Pizza and Xerox continue to look to Hyper-V and
System Center to deliver their critical business applications. Revenue for System Center grew 22% and Hyper-V, our
virtualization product, has gained four points of market share over the past year.
Our momentum in public cloud continues with more innovation, greater customer adoption and a comprehensive suite
of offerings. Enterprise customers like NBC Sports and 3M continue to choose Windows Azure for their cloud platform
needs. Recently, we launched Windows Azure Active Directory, which is an identity and access management solution
designed to support cloud-based line of business applications. Today, over 2.9 million businesses, government bodies
and schools are already enjoying the benefits of Windows Azure Active Directory, using it to manage access to Office
365, Dynamics CRM online, Windows Intune and Windows Azure.
In our Data Platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. Usage of SQL
Server for Tier 1 applications continues to grow based on functionality, reliability and value. In addition to our efforts
in big data, we are developing in-memory BI technologies built right into SQL Server that achieve breakthrough
improvements in transaction processing.
Now, I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 5%. Within that, business revenue grew
10%, driven by 16% growth in multiyear licensing. In January, we launched the new Office for consumers. The new
Office introduces touch, social and mobile scenarios as well as tight integration with SkyDrive, enabling access to
documents from any device.

The new Office is also available as a subscription, which benefits customers as they are always using the most modern
version of Office. As Peter stated, we expect this shift to grow our customer base and we saw strong adoption, strong
early adoption, of the subscription service. I would like to remind you that with subscription, the revenue is earned
ratably over the length of the subscription rather than at initial purchase. All up, consumer revenue was roughly in line
with the consumer PC market, influenced by this shift to subscription and strong attach gain.
In terms of our productivity server offering, we continue to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync, each
growing double digits. Specifically, Lync revenue grew over 30% again this quarter, with excitement around the
platform continuing to grow. Ninety of the Fortune 100 companies are now using Lync, and there are more than 5
million seats of Enterprise Voice deployed. At our Lync 2013 conference in February, we announced that Lync and
Skype connectivity for presence, instant messaging and voice will be available to all Lync users by the end of June.
Connecting these audiences was a key milestone as we deliver on the promise of truly unified communications.
Next I'll move on to the Online Service Division, where revenue grew 18%. Online advertising revenue was up 22%,
driven by another quarter of significant search rate improvements. Operating performance improved 45% this quarter
driven by revenue growth and continued expense management.
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue grew 33%. Xbox sold 1.3 million consoles and maintained its share
position in a soft console market. Xbox Live continues its strong momentum and we continuously look for ways to
further extend the value of Xbox Live for both our members and content partners. As evidence of the expanding
benefits, we saw transactional revenue grow roughly twice as fast as member growth this quarter.
Momentum with Windows Phone continues to build. The device is now available at a broad range of price points while
receiving great reviews and carrier support continues to grow. We now have over 10% share in several countries but
realize there is still a lot of work ahead to break through in some key markets. With growing awareness of Windows
Phone and sustained innovations from our hardware partners, we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum.
Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 21%, principally driven by Surface,
growth in cloud infrastructure and royalties on Xbox Live content and video games. Operating expenses grew 4%,
primarily related to product launch markets. This quarter, our effective tax rate was approximately 19% and finally, we
returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
Now I'll turn the call back to Peter for our outlook.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Chris. For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and share some
thoughts on fiscal year 2014.
Let me start with the fourth quarter. In the Windows Division, similar to this quarter, revenue will continue to reflect
sales of Surface and strong volume licensing while OEM revenue will be impacted by the declining traditional PC
market as we work to increase our share in tablets.
Within Server & Tools, product revenue, including transactional a multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division's
total revenue. Enterprise services is the remaining 20%. We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to
grow low double digits.
In the Microsoft Business Division, multiyear licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total,
should grow low double digits. Excluding the recognition of revenue from the Office upgrade offer, transactional
revenue, which is the remaining 40% of the division's total, should be in line with the x86 PC market. As a reminder,
when updating your Q4 models, we expect to recognize approximately $780 million of revenue related to the Office
upgrade offer.
In the Online Services Division, we expect revenue to grow low double digits, reflecting growth in search revenue
partially offset by lower display revenue.

Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division, we expect revenue to grow mid-teens. For the fourth quarter, we
expect COGS to grow mid-teens, including Surface.
Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging.
In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset. We are reducing our full fiscal
year guidance for operating expenses to $30.2 billion to $30.5 billion. This range excludes the impact of the European
Commission fine of $733 million.
For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding the expense related to the European Commission
fine to be 17% to 20% and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion. Excluding the impact of
the Office upgrade offer, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns.
Now turning to fiscal 2014. We expect fiscal 2014 operating expenses to be $31.6 billion to $32.2 billion, which
represents growth of 4% to 6% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2023 (sic) [2013] (21:05) guidance. We will
continue to prioritize our spending while investing in the significant opportunity that is ahead of us.
As we look towards the future, we have a solid foundation of products and services in market and our leadership team
is collectively focused on advancing every one of our businesses. You can expect to hear more about the specific
actions we are taking over the next few months.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris and we'll take some questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible so please just keep to one question. Operator,
please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford & Bernstein. Your line is open,
sir.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you, and thanks, guys, for the cloud data. We've been looking for a lot of this so it's
very helpful. Let me ask I guess two related parts to that. Can you give us a sense on the growth metrics in terms of
Office 365, which is what you're starting to give here in terms of revenue, users, customers, something that we can
think about there? And the second half of that, can you give us a sense in terms of the percentage of Office 365
customers that are net new to Exchange? I know you've given us little bits of data on SMB and new SMB customers,
but any sense there would be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, no. Thanks, Mark. On Office 365, the metric that we gave was net seat additions are up
five times over the prior year so that gives you some growth metric in addition to the revenue number.
To your point on Exchange or more broadly I would say about other workloads, we're seeing exactly that dynamic. So
not only are we addressing and reaching new customer segments like SMB, but many of them have never had a
productivity server workload before, not just Exchange but others as well. And even those that have had Exchange are
now using other workloads and so we're seeing most of our customers having more than one workload.
So across every dimension in terms of new revenue streams from the service, new customer segments and new
workloads, there's a lot of new and that's what's driving the growth and the opportunity that we've been looking for.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it and well, I'll be looking forward to hearing
what you're doing the rest of your life and good luck.

<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator
And our next question is from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys. You provided a little bit of color on Surface. Obviously, we're seeing an
expanding portfolio there. I just want to get a sense of how this is evolving, especially on the distribution side and how
the product's doing versus your expectations? And then when you start to think about, you know, going forward, how
would you also expect the product portfolio to evolve as well as distribution?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, no. Great question. As I said, we are expanding both the product set and distribution and
that is broadly all devices inclusive of Surface. We are expanding distribution of Surface. We're now in 22 countries,
70 retailers and we'll continue to look to expand that, not only just expanding but improving the experience. And that's
true not just for Surface but for, broadly, our Windows 8 devices, and so we'll be investing against that for both Surface
and a broader array of Windows 8 devices at multiple price points, including lower price points going forward.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great. Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Walter Pritchard with Citigroup, your line is open.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Thanks. Peter, Chris, I'm wondering if you can weigh in, there's been a bit of a debate this
quarter around sort of what the underlying PC market did and I think I've seen numbers ranging out there from a
mid-single-digit decline to a mid-teen decline? I'm just wondering first if you could weigh in on that? You've in the
past given some sort of range.
And then related to that is, if you look at the second half, I'm wondering how we should set our expectations around
this mid to high-end Haswell release from Intel in terms of impact it may have on the PC market versus the later in the
year, more holiday time, lower-end Atom release and how those two chip releases may have an impact on what you're
expecting from the device market and overall impact on Windows?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, thanks, Walter. On the PC market, I would look to some of the third parties, IDC and
Gartner. They're sort of in the 12%, 13%, 14% down range this quarter. And in terms of the chipset, we've always felt
that with Windows 8, there is a process of the ecosystem really innovating across the board and really starting to see
that on the chips. And we're very encouraged by both Haswell and some of the Atom processors to really improve the
overall user experience that Windows 8 delivers and over the coming selling season, I think that's very encouraging and
we're optimistic about that.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Great.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Walter. Next question, please.
Operator
Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. I was wondering, Peter, if you can help, I mean, we've heard Intel talk about Haswell
and they mentioned it on the call, I think was last night. You obviously mentioned it. I guess I'm just wondering what
can you guys do to specifically help grow your tablet share given you are reliant ex- the Surface products on OEM

partners to really hit a broad segment of the market? And I'm thinking, in general, given the OEM partners don't have
much wiggle room on the margin side, what can you do to help stimulate your market share in particular in the mobility
and in the tablet side? Thank you. And good luck in the future. We're going to miss you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks. I've enjoyed working with you. I think broadly in improving our position in tablets and
just generally in devices, there's five or six dimensions ranging from what we're doing with OEMs on the devices and
the range of devices and have our – so you can have a range of price points. What we're doing – what the chips can do
because I think that's part of it. Both first-party and third-party applications and we've seen improvements across the
board there. The user interface and how we're innovating across the user experience. And then distributions, [ph] if you
start (27:55) from the bottom up all the way to when you buy the product, we're working across all those dimensions.
And on the device side, we are working closely with the OEMs to help them take Windows 8 and show it off in all its
glory across different form factors. I talked about new, smaller form factors and how Windows 8 can innovate to
improve that experience. And so I think the biggest thing we're doing is helping them develop new and improved user
experiences across the board, across size, across price point, to deliver a really compelling Windows 8 experience. And
it's not just the devices. Like I said, it's the chips; it's the apps; it's the buying experience; it's the user interface. So we're
really focused on all five or six of those dimensions going forward.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Heather. Next question, please.
Operator
Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question and nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the
impact. You mentioned on the call that going to subscription revenues does have a near-term impact on revenues. I was
wondering if you could help us out and understand whether we're seeing that impact today and perhaps to what degree
with the strong uptick of some of the cloud services, particularly like Office 365?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, no, it's a good point. Yeah, we are seeing that particularly in our transactional business in
MBD as people move from what may have been a transactional or perpetual license where the revenue is recognized up
front to a subscription service where it's recognized ratably. So you're basically deferring the rest of the term of the
subscription. So in the short-term, you'll be deferring revenue that if it were bought not in the subscription, would have
been recognized immediately. And as the subscription business is growing, you'll see that impact growing but over time
what you'll get is what looks like an annuity revenue stream that's more predictable and has higher customer
satisfaction and probably higher retention rates going forward. But in the short-term that will impact mostly in the
transactional side of the MBD business.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent, thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks.

Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Peter, just on the gross margin, it's been under pressure for the last several years but this
quarter it did bounce back. Can you just give us a sense of how you think gross margins will trend? And do you expect
this is a stabilization and we should expect a slow improvement from here or expect more of the same in terms of
where they've been the last couple quarters?

<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, gross margins, as you know, are always going to be a function of mix and so depending
on where you are in the quarter, the biggest driver of what your gross margin is going to be is mix. So if you have a big
hardware quarter that has low gross margins, that'll impact it. The biggest things that are going to impact the mix are
going to be hardware, cloud services and enterprise services or people services.
It is a fact that we are starting to get scale in our cloud services and so the growth that we're seeing in Office 365 is
really coming at an improved margin as we scale that out. So within each, we make progress and then overall in a given
quarter for the company it's going to be a function of mix, so obviously in a holiday quarter where you sell a bunch of
hardware, that'll have an impact on gross margin but I think one of the main takeaways for me is in particularly some of
our cloud services we're really starting to get scale. Bing continues to improve their margins and Office 365 is really
starting to get to scale, so those things are really encouraging.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Congrats, Peter.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Brent. We'll take the next question please.

Ed Maguire with CLSA, your line is open.
<Q - Edward E. Maguire>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You just launched – or Azure Infrastructure as a
Service just went generally available this week and I'd love to get some color on how much that's figuring in the
long-term contracts, the growth in long-term contracts, and what your expectations might be for more traditional
infrastructure as a service uptake over the next several quarters? Thanks.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: No. Thanks, great question. It's clearly a key enabler of our all-out Cloud OS story and how
we're driving and what we're doing with enterprises in the data centers. With infrastructure as a service, we now have
the most complete end-to-end offerings through platform and software, identity and access. But having the
infrastructure is a key enabler, and I think a real accelerator, for the Windows Azure strategy and really, more broadly,
the Cloud OS strategy. We now have a complete end-to-end story through the data center, from private to hosted to
public, from infrastructure to platform. So I think it's, again, a key enabler of that all-out strategy and accelerator.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great. Thank you, Ed. We'll take the next question, please.

John DiFucci with JPMC. Your line is open.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. Peter, I'd just like to echo others' thoughts here. It truly has been a pleasure and
wish you the best going forward.
The question is for Chris, and Chris, just want to clarify something you said about inventories. I think you were talking
about PC inventory. But with the Windows business, can you give us your assessment of what Windows inventory is at
OEMs, especially given the disappointing PC shipment data this quarter?
<A - Chris Suh>: Yeah, I – thanks, John. Yeah, I did mention the fact that we believe inventories were drawn down.
We do think that they're at normal levels at this point, though.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks, John, appreciate it.

Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen, your line is open.
<Q - Gregg S. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. And, Peter, I'll echo my sentiments as everyone else
did as well.
So in recent periods, we've seen your MBD growth significantly outpace PC unit growth, although we now have a
dynamic where your Office subscriptions, is really resonating with customers. So the question is, just looking at this on
a directional basis, is MBD revenue out-performance relative to the PC units something that you think is sustainable
going forward?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, it'll – the answer is, it'll depend. There's certainly an offset between attach gains we're
making against the market, offset against some deferral, as revenue moves to a subscription. And so, it'll kind of
depend each quarter. Long-term, it's a great trend, because we're building up a banked book of business on the
subscription side, which will become less and less connected to the PC market.
<Q - Gregg S. Moskowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks, Gregg.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Gregg. Mary, I think we have time for two more calls. Two more questions, please.

Thank you. Raimo Lenschow with Barclays, your line is open.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, and, Peter, all the best.
A quick one. If you look at, kind of, IBM coming out earlier on today, having a relatively tough quarter given the
economy, can you just comment a little bit on what you're seeing out there, especially as the Server & Tools Division
obviously is doing relatively well, but the other guys are really struggling. So help us understand how you see the
economy. Thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, I think about the economy and then I think about the value proposition of our products. I
mean, clearly there are tough spots in the economy. I think enterprises and CIOs are looking for what they've always
been looking for, which is how do they get the best value for their dollar to move their businesses forward. And I think
we have a very good story in terms of the value that enterprises and small and medium businesses get from the
capabilities that they can get from us, particularly in the data center, with SQL, and as you compare SQL Server to
competing products, the performance that you get relative to the price is a really compelling value proposition. And
that's what's been enabling us to take share. Same on virtualization as well and so I think for us, it's a combination of
having the most complete roadmap for getting to the cloud, as well as the best collection of products that have price
performance characteristics that are attractive to CIOs that are allowing us to have growth in our enterprise business,
and particularly in Server & Tools.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Raimo, last question, please.

Okay. And our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open, sir.
<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Great. Thanks very much. Peter, as you look to the PC data over the course of the quarter,
could you give us any sense of how that trended? And following up on that, as you think about the business upgrade
cycle, which should be over by this time next year, do we risk a real falloff again in the PC business because the
upgrade cycle has aided what's been a difficult PC market the last couple of quarters? And best of luck by the way.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks, Brad. On your first question, there wasn't anything, sort of, abnormal in terms of the
trends during the quarter.
On your second question, I think the upgrade cycle, particularly for businesses, will be interesting over the next year. I
think over the longer term, what's more interesting is the long-term evolution we're seeing in the device market, which I
think is actually going to be more of a driver than any sort of temporal upgrade cycle. I think people are looking to
innovation as happening faster, people are getting new experiences and new form factors. I think that's what Windows
8 was designed to take advantage of. So I think about the opportunity more about the new capabilities and the new sets
and services and experiences people can get on their devices in different kinds of devices than it is about an upgrade
cycle that's driven by something else.
<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Great. Thanks very much.
Chris Suh
Okay. Thanks, Brad.
Okay. So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the
