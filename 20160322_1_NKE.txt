MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE's fiscal 2016 third quarter conference call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President,
Corporate Finance and Treasurer.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC
including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily
indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate
fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary
significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including
equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint
of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants
may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.
Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and
quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, investors.nike.com.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer.

Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2016 third quarter
results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find
the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website,
investors.nike.com.
Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, President
of the NIKE Brand. And finally, you'll hear from our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you
an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would
like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your
initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that aren't covered by others, please feel free to
re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your cooperation on this.
I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Before we get into today's results, I want to acknowledge the tragic events that
took place in Brussels. We're thankful that all local NIKE employees and those traveling to the area are accounted for
and safe. I know I speak for everyone on this end of the call, when I say our hearts go out to the victims and the
families of those impacted by today's attacks.
Getting back to the results. NIKE delivered another strong quarter in Q3 with balanced growth across our expansive,
powerful portfolio. By the numbers, here are the highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8% to $8 billion. On a
currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin was 45.9%, flat to prior year, and earnings per
share increased 22% to $0.55.
The foundation for NIKE's success and one of our greatest competitive advantages is our complete offense. It's what
gives us the power to use our size and scale to accelerate growth and the flexibility to stay nimble and fast. Through our
complete offense, we serve a wide range of athletes personally across 13 categories, six geographies, men's, women's,
and young athletes, up and down the price points, in wholesale, owned retail, and online.
Our complete offense also creates a culture of shared innovation within NIKE, where we turn insights from one sport
into breakthroughs for all athletes, as we're doing with footwear platforms like Flyknit, Lunarlon and Air, or apparel
with Dri-FIT and Tech Pack. And it allows us to create and curate a targeted mix of products, services and
environments into amazing retail experiences for consumers. We develop new concepts and collaborate with our
wholesale partners to bring them to life in completely new ways around the world. The complete offense is our proven
game plan to drive long-term profitable growth, but it's never been as powerful as it is today.
For example, we're seeing strong growth in China and Western Europe, as well as in our Global Women's business and
the Running category. We're creating deeper and more meaningful connections with our consumers through all of our
dimensions, from competition to Training, to Sportswear.
At the same time, the complete offense also allows us to manage through volatility and take important actions to sustain
the momentum in our business. It's how we ensure a healthy marketplace, so we can continue to deliver all of the
amazing products we have on the horizon to our consumers. Our relentless flow of innovation is one of the reasons I
remain so confident in NIKE's future. You know I'd like to talk about the innovation pipeline, and often all I can say is
stay tuned. Well, last week, we gave the world a view into just some of what we have in that pipeline for 2016 and
beyond.
Let me take you through some of the concepts that will redefine how NIKE serves the athletes. In Running, the Air
VaporMax gives runners an amazing lightweight, high-performance ride, with the most complete and visually stunning
NIKE Air Sole cushioning system ever. The LunarEpic creates a new fit and sensation with the mid-height stretch
Flyknit collar, laser-cut Lunarlon side walls and cushioning pods, creating a whole new look and feel for performance
running. Launched earlier this month, runners are giving us great feedback, and consumer response has been very

strong.
The Free RN Motion delivers our most natural ride yet, with the new outsole design that expands in multiple directions
when the foot strikes the ground. And in football, Anti-Clog Traction solves a major problem athletes have always
faced, and that's mud sticking to their cleats. It removes weight and provides premium traction, no matter the
conditions. The new Mercurial Superfly is the boot for the fastest players, with a new lightweight plate for better power
transfer and texture mapping across the forefoot for enhanced ball control.
And in basketball, the Air Zoom KD9 features the new Flyknit technology that combines lock-down fit with enhanced
natural movement. And the full-length Zoom Air is more responsive than ever for one of the game's most explosive
players, Kevin Durant. And we brought Flyknit to one of basketball's greatest icons with the Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit,
designed at half of the weight of the original with added cushioning for incredible comfort.
We unveiled auto adaptive lacing with the NIKE HyperAdapt 1.0, the first step into the future of adaptive performance.
It's a concept that embodies one of NIKE's most ambitious dreams and just a glimpse of what's to come with products
that sense and adapt with the body.
And finally, we kicked off the incredible sports moments ahead of us this summer by unveiling bold national Olympic
uniforms across track and field, basketball, and football. Each features our new AeroSwift technology and breaks new
ground in lightweight breathability, mobility, and comfort.
All told, the two-day event was NIKE's most powerful display of innovation yet. The greatest sports moments are when
we deliver our best for the athletes. We turn their insights into amazing breakthroughs and scale them across our
diverse portfolio of categories. It's how we turn the energy of sport into momentum for our business for years to come.
We also know finding new ways to serve the athlete is key to our future growth. Today, our consumers are more
connected than ever before. They're demanding and their needs change every day. Last week we introduced the
solution with the new Nike+ app, a personal service for athletes. The Nike+ app brings together on-demand coaching, a
personal store, and amazing experiences all through one mobile access point. Through Nike+, we offer training
programs that adapt to your changing schedule and performance, synching performance data directly from the Nike+
app and a range of partner devices. And we send reserved invitations guaranteeing our most coveted sneakers, and we
have Gear Up packs tailored just for you to get you started on a new goal or in a new sport. The new Nike+ app makes
it all easy and personal and puts it all at your fingertips. It's the key to building deep and rich relationships with the
athlete in this new era of personalized performance.
Not only does digital create connections with the athlete, it also accelerates our business end to end. For Q3, NIKE.com
delivered another impressive quarter with growth of 56%, fueled by growth in both traffic and conversion. NIKE.com
allows us to expand our brand and deepen our relationships in new markets. We continue to add new countries every
quarter to our NIKE.com platform, and it's driving growth around the world.
It's so energizing to see all we're delivering to make the athlete better. And last week was more than just one moment in
time. It's the blueprint for how NIKE will serve the athlete into the future. NIKE is built for growth for the long term.
We have a winning strategy that puts the consumer in the center of everything we do, an unmatched global footprint
that is fueling a growing movement of sports around the world, and the imagination and creative power that can deliver
real innovation at unprecedented scale.
NIKE has never been in a better position to deliver against our long-term goals. I'm inspired by the work that we're
doing. The management team and the people they lead are the best in the industry. And that's critical because the
changes we're seeing in the world are fast and massive, and so are the opportunities. And that's what makes me as
confident as ever in NIKE's future.
Thanks, and here's Trevor.

Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.
The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability, as our innovative products and
compelling consumer connections continue to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue
increased 15%, with double-digit growth across all geographies and nearly all key categories. NIKE Brand DTC
revenue grew 29%, driven by 56% growth in online sales, 10% comp store growth and new store growth. And finally,
global futures grew 17%.
These strong results are driven, as always, by our relentless focus on the consumer. Consumers worldwide expect and
demand cutting-edge products, engaging experiences, and powerful retail presentations. NIKE's ability to deliver on all
three strengthens our position as the brand of choice and builds our business around the world.
To view how all these three come to life, you have to look no further than basketball, where we run a two-category
offense across NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. Our long history of success in NIKE Basketball comes from
creating the most innovative and exciting products thanks to the insights and inspiration from our great athletes.
We saw tremendous sell-through of the Kyrie 2, which features a first of its kind contoured midsole and outsole
designed to enhance banking and cutting on the court. And the Kobe 11 was incredibly popular, offering high
performance and lightweight design in a progressive low-top that distills Kobe's signature legacy to its very essence.
Looking forward, I am very excited about what's to come in NIKE Basketball. As we gear up for Kobe's retirement, he
will continue to inspire innovative products for years to come. We have already started celebrating his career with a
monochromatic retro collection called the Black Mamba Pack.
I'm also incredibly excited about the signature basketball performance products that are coming, including the new
KD9 that we introduced last week. The KD9 is just one example of the new signature Basketball designs in our
pipeline that we are bringing to the market to continue to drive this important and vibrant category. And as always, we
will amplify the category with innovative new Sportswear styles like the reimagined Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.
All these products come to life in powerful retail experiences from our own DTC doors to key partner executions like
Foot Locker's House of Hoops. And these stores express a deep love of basketball, serving those who share and fuel
that passion for the game.
As the Jordan Brand expands as a standalone category, its global revenues remain incredibly strong, up double-digits
again this quarter. The Air Jordan XXX continues to fulfill its promise of offering the next frontier of flight and we're
seeing strong sell-through in the market. The shoe offers the apex of Jordan's evolution both as a player and a design
collaborator as the shoe features performance insights and design inspirations from Michael.
And impressively, the 72-10 colorway of the Air Jordan XI was the largest launch ever in the history of NIKE.com,
breaking sales and traffic records. With this launch, we doubled NIKE.com's previous largest launch ever.
This was also a quarter that proves yet again how powerful the energy is, when NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand
team team up. The NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto was a full of the kind of superior executions that only NIKE and
the Jordan Brand can do. That includes exclusive experiences for basketball fans, premium product launches and a
massive roster of the game's best players, highlighted that weekend by the awe-inspiring Dunk Contest featuring Zach
LaVine and Aaron Gordon, two of NIKE's young and exciting players.
Overall, through that weekend, as I walked through Toronto, I was blown away by the visible excitement for the game
as NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand helped ignite the culture of basketball around the world. As we continue to
experience the excitement of March Madness and await the NBA Playoffs and the Rio Olympics, that enthusiasm for
the game will just continue to build.
Next, NIKE Women's, which has seen its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as the business
continues to outpace our Men's business. We've seen consistent growth in our Women's business, because we know this
athlete is demanding more from brands across products, across services and across experiences. And we are there every
step of the way throughout that journey, serving her completely through her run, train and live lifestyle. But we also

know that these are no longer separate categories for athletes. More and more, women are blending running, fitness and
sports style in their lives, and this shift is fundamental to how this business operates, so expanding our focus on product
to include services and experiences.
With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and the technical innovation of our products.
For example, our Power Speed Running Tight and our Zoned Sculpt Training Tight provide compressive feel with
every move to support her key muscle groups. And in footwear, our popular Metcon 2 is designed for high-intensity
training, with just the right amount of stability and flexibility as she works out.
This quarter also saw the acceleration of our highly successful Better for It campaign, in which, we invite each athlete
to push herself out of her comfort zone by providing personal motivation and rich community to help her meet her
goals. And we released the Margot vs Lily web series, inviting women to challenge themselves and celebrate their
victories. The response has been extraordinary, with 18 million views to date. We've also seen a considerable increase
in downloads of the Nike+ Run Club and the Nike+ Training Club, with members becoming more active and buying
more, thanks in part to the links in each episode to the product worn by the characters. As Mark mentioned, these
services are still just the tip of the iceberg, given the incredible promise of the new Nike+ app and the expanded digital
services.
Let me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth in the quarter,
with revenues up 14%, driven by Sportswear, Jordan, Running and Men's Training. We are seeing positive consumer
responses to our executions with wholesale partners, such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. Our own DTC
business also had another strong quarter, up 25% led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com.
As we discussed last quarter, we have been working to efficiently clear excess inventory in North America and we've
made good progress in Q3. The flow of products through our newly-expanded North American distribution network is
normalizing. We've prioritized liquidation through our factory stores, and we are selectively utilizing third-party value
channels. And as always, we are actively managing the flow of product into the inline marketplace to ensure a healthy
full market as we end fiscal year 2016.
We remain focused on what is most important to our long-term strategy: serving the consumer. The NIKE Brand and
its deep connection to consumers remains incredibly strong, and we are confident that the actions we are taking will
ensure that we have the capacity to deliver new, innovative products into the marketplace, innovations like those Mark
talked about. We see tremendous long-term potential for North America, and we look forward to delivering even more
innovative products and services to best serve our consumers in this important geography.
Next, Western Europe, our second largest geography, which delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter. It's clear the
decisions we made to accelerate the category offense in Western Europe are paying off, as we continue to see
momentum driven by Sportswear, Jordan, as well as young athletes. This growth was led by footwear, where we're
seeing great sell-through in some of NIKE's iconic remastered styles, such as the Huarache Run Ultra and the evergreen
classics, like the Cortez. We're also seeing great momentum in apparel as we fuel sports style innovation to the newly
launched Tech Knit collection, and throughout our broader Tech Fleece product line.
We continue to see tremendous growth potential in Western Europe, and look forward to the excitement created this
summer with the 2016 European Championships.
Let's now take a look at the Emerging Markets, which delivered revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Strong growth
was led by double-digit growth in SOCO and growth in our key categories such as Sportswear, Running, Global
Football and Women's Training. In Brazil, the work we've done to reset the marketplace is paying dividends. We're
seeing strong results in retail concepts that we developed with our strategic wholesale partners and our own DTC
business continues to accelerate. Despite the macroeconomic trends in the territory, we are heading into the Rio
Olympics with plenty of brand momentum. Inventory levels are healthy. Our market share is increasing and we have
the pipeline of innovative products coming in this Olympics year.
Finally, Greater China, which continues to see strong marketplace momentum and very healthy growth, despite
macroeconomic uncertainty. China grew an incredible 27% this quarter, fueled in part by the continued strength of the

NIKE Brand. The success we're seeing in China today stems from decisions we've made to align our teams against the
biggest opportunities, driving growth in key categories of Sportswear, Running, Jordan, and NIKE Basketball.
We are seeing incredibly strong growth in DTC with NIKE.com leading the way. Demand during the Chinese New
Year surpassed anything we've ever seen before. And we operated with sharp precision to drive conversion to capitalize
on that demand across all of our DTC dimensions. And successes by our key partners such as Belle and Pousheng
continue to reflect the consumer demand with the re-profile doors outpacing the rest of the fleet.
Ultimately, Greater China demonstrates our ability to execute our strategies and operationalize them at world-class
levels. Looking forward, I am confident in what the NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're
making with them. I like where we are, and better yet, I like where we're headed.
Thanks. Now, here's Andy.
Andrew Campion
Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.
Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, first, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global
portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's long-term financial
model. As Mark said, running a complete offense is one of NIKE's many competitive advantages.
We continually push ourselves to sharpen our game and better serve consumers in every dimension of our business
around the world. That said, not every dimension of our portfolio will have the same level of momentum in each and
every period. But as we relentlessly strive to run a complete offense, we do sustain strong momentum in the vast
majority of our businesses, while also acting quickly to turn challenges into opportunities in other dimensions.
That portfolio dynamic is how NIKE, Inc. consistently delivers strong top line growth year-after-year. In the third
quarter, we again delivered strong growth with revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. All geographies grew
double digits with Greater China continuing to set the pace. On that note, I was just in China three weeks ago, and I can
sum up my visit in one word, amazing. Our brand and business in China have never been stronger and we continue to
build momentum. That's not by accident. Our focus in China has been on fueling greater sport participation and love for
sport, while also transforming the consumer experience along category lines, both in-store and online.
We are now seeing increasingly deeper passion for sport in China and that is translating into strong demand for our
products across multiple categories from NIKE Basketball to Jordan to Running to Men's and Women's Training. To
serve that fast growing demand, our team in China has already created some of the most compelling new NIKE retail
experiences in the world, both owned and partnered. We see tremendous opportunity ahead in China and we will
continue investing to sustain our strong momentum in this important geography.
That brings me to my second point, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's financial model.
Growth creates the capacity to invest, and as we prioritize our investments, innovation will always be at the top of
NIKE's list.
At last week's Innovation Summit, we showcased what we mean when we say NIKE will bring a relentless flow of
innovation to serve the athlete and consumer. As Mark detailed, we revealed a series of innovations that we expect to
fuel growth across our global portfolio over the long term, ranging from adaptive and other new footwear technologies
to new systems of performance in apparel to the new Nike+ application, which will deliver the best of NIKE
personalized at your fingertips.
While investing in innovation is our top priority, we also use our investment capacity to surgically edit and shift within
our portfolio to ensure that we remain on the offense with consumers. For example, as we noted last quarter, our
inventory levels in North America are somewhat elevated, primarily due to protracted challenges we have experienced
in our supply chain dating back to the West Coast port congestion and as we expanded distribution center capacity in
Memphis. So we are taking action to ensure appropriate capacity in our full-price inline channels for fresh new product,

including the innovation we shared last week.
The investments associated with those actions include: one, investing in our supply chain to ramp up capacity and
enhance the flow of product to consumers; and two, absorbing the negative mix impact on gross margin that comes
with expeditiously clearing excess inventory. In short, our consistently strong top line growth expands our capacity to
invest for the long term while also delivering appropriate financial performance in the short term. That is the virtuous
cycle that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model.
And with that, I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q3 financial results. Q3 revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% on a
currency-neutral basis. And after taking into account significant currency headwinds, revenue grew 8% on a reported
basis. On a currency-neutral basis, the NIKE Brand grew 15%, while Converse revenue declined 5%. Also on a
currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, reflecting continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand
around the world, driven by a 10% increase in units with increases in average selling prices contributing seven
percentage points of growth. Futures in all geographies grew at a double-digit rate. On a reported basis, futures grew
12%, taking into account the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q3 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.55, despite significant headwinds from FX. EPS growth was driven by strong top line
growth, a lower tax rate, and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding.
Gross margin was flat to prior year at 45.9%, as higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher
margin DTC business was offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher warehousing costs,
and the mix impact associated with inventory management in North America.
Q3 gross margin was somewhat better than we expected 90 days ago as a result of higher full price gross margin and
also slightly better than expected off-price gross margin, as our inventory management efforts in North America were
more weighted to our NIKE factory stores as compared to lower margin third-party channels in the quarter.
Q3 demand creation increased 10% for the quarter in support of key brand initiatives such as Super Bowl 50 and our
Women's Better for It and Margot vs Lily campaigns. Operating overhead leveraged for the quarter at 7%, driven by
strong operational and financial discipline, focusing our investments on our highest priorities while preserving capacity
to invest in the opportunities that lie ahead.
Our effective tax rate was 16.3% for Q3, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings,
which are generally subject to a lower tax rate, the accelerated recognition of foreign tax credits, adjustments to tax
expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year, and the retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the U.S.
R&D tax credit.
As of February 29, our inventories were up 8%, driven by a 4% increase in NIKE Brand wholesale units, growth in our
DTC business, and increases in average product cost per unit, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.
Now let's turn to a review of our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral
basis, with strong revenue growth across nearly all categories and continued strong growth in our DTC businesses, led
by NIKE.com. Futures also grew 10% in North America, reflecting strong consumer demand for the new innovative
products that we're bringing to market.
On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 13% and EBIT increased 9%, as revenue growth and operating
overhead leverage were partially offset by higher demand creation spending and a decline in gross margin, as the
impact of our inventory management actions offset full-price gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in all territories,
reflecting continued expansion of the category offense. Nearly all key categories grew, led by strong growth in
Sportswear and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 2%, and EBIT remained flat due to significant
foreign currency headwinds.

In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue grew 29% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in nearly
all territories. Most key categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running, and Global Football. Revenue
growth in the quarter also benefited from a comparison to the prior year when import delays in Turkey resulted in
product planned for sale in Q3 actually being sold in Q4. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 12%, reflecting
weaker foreign currencies. EBIT increased 33%, driven by double-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and
SG&A leverage.
In Greater China, again we continue to deliver extraordinary growth, with Q3 revenue up 27% on a currency-neutral
basis. Growth was strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Jordan, and NIKE Basketball.
On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 23% and EBIT grew 43% due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin
expansion and SG&A leverage.
Moving on to the Emerging Markets. Q3 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories
delivered growth in the quarter driven by SOCO and Pacific. Every key category grew in the quarter led by Sportswear,
Running, Global Football and Women's Training. On a reported basis, Emerging Markets revenue declined 8% and
EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies.
Looking forward, the Emerging Markets' strong currency neutrals futures growth reflects strong demand in nearly all
territories. And as Trevor noted, while macroeconomics in Brazil are challenging, our reset of that marketplace is on
track as we approach the Olympics in Rio.
At Converse, Q3 revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by comparisons to a prior year shift
in the timing of shipments out of Q4 and into Q3 fiscal year 2015 to ensure Converse's smooth transition to a new ERP
system. On a reported basis, Converse revenue decreased 9% and EBIT decreased 22% versus prior year, driven
primarily by the revenue shift, lower gross margin and weakness in the euro.
NIKE, Inc.'s powerful global portfolio of businesses has delivered strong results year-to-date and we expect momentum
to continue into Q4 and beyond. For the full year fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect financial performance in line
with the expectations that we shared with you 90 days ago. Specifically, for both Q4 and the full year, we continue to
expect reported revenue to grow at a mid-single digit rate, roughly in line with our year-to-date rate of growth.
For gross margin, we continue to expect expansion of about 50 basis points for the full year, with Q4 gross margin flat
to slightly expanding versus prior year. We also continue to expect fiscal year 2016 full year SG&A to grow at a
high-single digit rate with Q4 SG&A growing at a high-single to low-double digit rate. Other income will continue to
have a meaningful impact on our full year results, due to the impact of hedges captured in this line item. For Q4, we
expect other income of approximately $40 million. And finally, we now expect our full year fiscal year 2016 effective
tax rate will be approximately 19%.
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2017, our planning is not yet finalized. However, we have strong momentum in our
business around the world, and we expect that strong momentum to continue. Accordingly, we anticipate currency
neutral revenue to grow in the high-single to low-double digit range in fiscal year 2017, and we expect reported
revenue to grow at a high-single digit rate due to continued strength of the U.S. dollar. We currently expect EPS to
grow at a low-teens rate, reflecting continued strong operational performance, partially offset by unfavorable
FX-related impacts.
Further, we expect that our EPS growth will be more heavily weighted toward the back half of fiscal year 2017, as we
invest in significant brand initiatives early in the fiscal year, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football
Championships, and also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year.
The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, creating both headwinds and opportunities. Accordingly, we'll
provide an updated look at our fiscal year 2017 guidance during our Q4 earnings call. As we look ahead, we have
broad-based momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses, and we'll continue to leverage that
momentum to deliver appropriate financial performance in the short-term, while also investing and taking action to
sustain strong profitable growth over the long-term.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Kate McShane from Citi.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Kate McShane>: My question was on inventory. I know you addressed it a couple of times in the prepared
comments, but can you just drill down a little bit more to where we are in terms of inventory composition? Are you still
working through things in North America? And are there any other areas where there may be higher levels of
inventory, and in what categories?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Okay. I'll just give you this little recap on the inventory, as we discussed. Obviously, we're
working to efficiently clear all the excess inventory, and we actually made good progress in Q3, specifically on the
flow of products, is actually working through our North American distribution network is now normalizing. We also
prioritized liquidation through our factory stores and we effectively utilized third-party value channels. And we
continue to actively manage the flow of the product in the in-line marketplace to ensure that we can have the healthy
pull market by the end of fiscal year 2016.
At the same time, the inventory is relatively fresh. It's all very fresh product, and so we feel good about where we are
today in terms of making progress and we don't see any increasing areas. It's really isolated to North America and it's
not a global issue.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Okay, thank you. And if I can just follow up with an unrelated question with regards to futures
growth, in North America specifically, are store closures or announced store closures having any impact on that growth
in that futures window you announced today?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: No, they're not.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Don't forget about the futures.

<Q - Lindsay Drucker Mann>: Hello?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yes, we can hear you.
<Q - Lindsay Drucker Mann>: Yes. Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit
more on Andy's reference to the need to invest in order to drive this virtuous cycle of growth. As you think about your
big areas of investment over the next year or so, is there any shift in where you have your emphasis in terms of
investment? And perhaps you could update us a bit on how you're thinking about supply chain investments and the
opportunity to get – differentiate yourself better with those?
<A - Andrew Campion>: Thanks, Lindsay. In terms of investment, we've shared with you our strategic priorities over
time and some of the areas that we're most focused on. Those will remain largely consistent. Some of the investments I
referred to in the near-term, obviously, relates to some brand initiatives, phenomenal moments in sport around March
Madness, the NBA playoffs, the Olympics, European Football Championships, but as we look further out, as we look
more consistently to next year and beyond, we're going to continue to invest in consumer engagement, so that the
digital capabilities as well as digital services. We're going to invest in the operating infrastructure that's required to
support our growth.
I referenced some of the investments that we made in our supply chain. In fact, including in our supply chain in North
America, a lot of what transpired over the last year was us ramping up capacity and capability that's going to serve us
incredibly well long-term maintaining a pull market and flowing product to consumers. Those are the primary areas in
which you'll see investment. We'll also continue to invest in the consumer experience at retail.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I'm going to add the product area, product innovation. Innovation basically in product and in
manufacturing continues to be a priority and a major opportunity for the company.
<Q - Lindsay Drucker Mann>: Great, thanks. If I could just quickly follow up, you discussed – I think, Trevor, you
said in your prepared remarks, you referenced to re-platform stores in China versus the broader store network. Could
you just give us an update on how far along that initiative is?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: As it relates to China, obviously, we continue to be very excited about the continued
momentum that we're seeing in the Chinese business. The actual growth of 27% this quarter and then the futures –
obviously, the futures growth is just – what we thought was just amazing results. And the reason why we continue to
feel confident about those results is, the team there is really focused on driving the category offense and connecting
with our consumers. The brand remains incredibly strong and the work that we've been doing with our partners to
re-profile the doors is actually paying dividends. They still represent a relatively small part of the overall – of their
overall business, so we continue to believe that there is still a lot of runway for us to continue to accelerate that
business.
<A - Andrew Campion>: And, Lindsay, I'll just add in terms of dimensions of the marketplace, we're seeing very
strong comps in our owned doors. We're seeing incredible growth in NIKE.com and comps in the doors that we've
re-profiled in the wholesale marketplace with our partners continue to be strong. And actually, the – what we're
implementing in those doors to fuel growth is cascading into the rest of the market. But there's still a tremendous
opportunity in the broader market in China as well as in our NIKE.com and other DTC businesses.
<Q - Lindsay Drucker Mann>: Great, thanks.

<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thank you.
<Q - Omar Saad>: You're welcome. My first question, kind of, the P&L guidance that Andy gave. I'm trying to
understand – it looks like the gross margin trends you expect, similar – in fourth quarter, similar to what's been
happening, but it looks like you're implying a pretty significant deceleration on the constant-currency sales line and,
simultaneously, an acceleration – pretty significant acceleration on the SG&A line. I wanted to make sure, A, I'm
reading into that right, I'm interpreting your comments correctly, and maybe a little bit of color around those two line
items. And then, I have one follow-up.
<A - Andrew Campion>: Okay, sure. Let me hit – you asked about revenue and SG&A. Our guidance for the full year
remains consistent with 90 days ago, Omar, both our revenue guidance as well as our SG&A guidance. One thing that
has certainly transpired is we've moved forward a quarter. And so while we gave you full-year guidance 90 days ago,
you now have actuals, and we're giving more specific guidance with respect to Q4. And as you know, we don't manage
line item by line item, quarter by quarter, but more the long-term focus, and our trajectory continues on the same track.
So I think what you're seeing is you're just getting a little bit more detail quarter by quarter that, one, it's just the
passage of time. And two, the operating actions that we take in each quarter again are with more of a holistic focus than
just adhering strictly to a line item by line item plan.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks, that's very helpful. And then, I wanted to ask a question about all the innovation unveiled
in the last week. One thing we noticed was some of the innovations are tied to downloading apps. And there seems to
be maybe even some limited sequenced releases around some of these new innovations, which is maybe a strategy
we've seen more in the Basketball arena with some of the limited edition products. Are you changing the kind of
distribution and release strategy around innovation, and this whole tie in to apps and things like that? Maybe help us
understand what's going on there.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: First of all, what you saw last week, what we introduced last week in New York was some of
what is coming over the next year. So in the Olympic years, we always have more innovation coming out of the
pipeline than normally. It's pretty much the cycle that we've been on. It's a focus that we've had in delivering innovation
really since the past two or three decades. But I think what you saw last week was more at one time than we've ever
introduced. We've actually edited that. There's more innovation than what we showed in New York, both in product
and on the digital front.
That said, we're incredibly proud of the spectrum, the scope of innovation that we had in footwear, in apparel,
competitively, in Sportswear, really much across the spectrum, the complete offense that I had talked about. And then
in digital, obviously that continues to be incredibly important for us. I think you'll see a stream of innovation coming
from NIKE in that area. It continues to be a high priority for the company and obviously important to the consumer and
the athletes that we're here to serve.
So that will be the norm I think to see that kind of steady stream of innovation. And this is what fuels our growth in the
end is the scope and the power of the innovation we have, not just in terms of any one product, but the influence that
those products have on all the categories and in some cases the brands within the portfolio. So we're in a great position
to leverage that innovation across a wider portfolio.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks, that's helpful.

<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I guess the questions that I have, I think the first one is when you look at the gross margin
performance, can you give us an update on the Flextronics relationship, where we are on those initiatives, and if that is
impacting the business now, and when we can expect it to start to have [indiscernible] (51:24)?
<A - Andrew Campion>: Sure, I'll take that one, Bob. Actually, I mentioned I was in Asia three weeks ago. That was,
one, to visit the marketplace, but also to spend time with our team there, leading our manufacturing revolution
initiative, which, as you know, includes our partnership with Flextronics and is even broader.
In terms of the financial impact, we did see an impact in our gross margin, a favorable impact from some of those
initiatives. It's obviously starting to build. We're more optimistic about the impact of those initiatives long term. And I
can tell you from being there first-hand, it's certainly reinforced and probably built my optimism in that regard.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: As I said, this is a huge priority for the company and a massive opportunity for us, not just in
terms of being more productive and more efficient and improving our margin performance, but also in getting us closer
to the market, in advancing our sustainability goals, bringing customized solutions to consumers in the marketplace.
And this is where the Flex partnership is particularly valuable to us. We do a lot of work with Flex and we're seeing the
potential of scaling that work between NIKE and Flex across our broader supply chain, both in our manufacturing
partners around the world as well as even how we customize product here in the United States. So we're very, very
excited about where that's going and the potential.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. And I guess just on the business overall, on the revenue growth that we've experienced and
you've seen so far, ASPs have been a big portion of that. Do you think we'll be near a ceiling with ASP growth, or
should we expect more units to drive the business? Can you just talk about how you see that playing out over the next
several years?
<A - Andrew Campion>: Bob, I'll start on that one. Average gross selling price continues to favorably impact margin.
It did in the third quarter. And I think when you look at our futures, you see that it's having a significant impact on our
futures growth, seven percentage points. We continue to see strong demand for the innovative and new product that
we're bringing. Of course, in any given period, we edit and shift as appropriate. But that continues to be, in our view, an
element of gross margin expansion that we believe we can sustain.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: And I'll just add that, obviously, our pricing strategy always centers on ensuring that we're
giving the right price/value to our consumers. And right now and continue going forward, our brand is very strong. And
importantly, as Mark just touched on, we have an incredible amount of innovation. So we believe that our ability to
combine the brand strength along with bringing great innovation to the market, it allows us to continue to actually
deliver premium value to our consumers. And that's always the way that we look and drive our pricing strategy.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. If I just sneak in one more quick one, I guess I'm curious.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Bob, come on.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Okay, go ahead.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Sorry, go ahead.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Go ahead.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I guess my question is, who had Syracuse and Gonzaga? And who's going to win that game?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Oh God.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Now I know why you wanted to sneak one more.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I think the NIKE team will win.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Yes.

The next question is from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Hey, guys. Great quarter and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about
Sportswear. I think you guys called it out in every market. Can you give us a little more color on what's working so
well in Sportswear? Is it more apparel than footwear? Is it weighted towards the women's strengths that you've been
calling out? Is it different drivers in Sportswear by region globally even though it's working well in every region? And
also is there a – is it a higher selling business right now than, say, Jordan or some of your other businesses? Just maybe
some more color on why Sportswear has been so great.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: I'll tell you, in the beginning part of your question, I'll kind of give you a big yes, yes, yes
on all those dimensions in the sense that our Sportswear – as we always talk about, our Sportswear strategy is aligned
with our Amplify strategy, so we always drive a performance business and then amplify our Sportswear from that.
Right now, we have incredible great products that are coming through on Sportswear. That really hits on the multiple
dimensions of that business whether that's footwear, looking at the items like the Air Force 1 Flyknit Ultra or the
Huarache styles or the Roshe styles, all doing really well, the Air Max that we're launching right now, those are great
items in footwear.
On the apparel side, we just launched the new Tech Knit collection, which is doing phenomenally well in the
marketplace and so – which is a continuation of the Tech Pack, so we're seeing that. And we're also hitting that in really
multiple price zones, so whether it's the most premium to the most => premium value, going all the way through. So it's
hitting on every single dimension. But what is true also that you are all seeing strong growth in the Jordan Brand. So it
isn't one versus the other. We believe that the complete offense allows us to really drive and continue to drive all those
dimensions of those businesses both in performance to Sportswear from the NIKE Brand to the Jordan Brand and that
really represents the complete offense.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I want to add to that when we say complete offense we talk about that relative to NIKE in
general. But you can dive into any category. In this case, Sportswear, and there is a complete offense within
Sportswear. Today, we're actually clicking on about every cylinder in Sportswear, up and down the price points, around
the geos, current revenues, and the futures demand, bringing technology into the category, which is creating a great
deal of interest from a consumer standpoint. The ability for NIKE to leverage technology in Sportswear in compelling
ways is what creates distinction for NIKE in this segment. And that is going be the case moving forward. We're very
bullish on where we are with Sportswear now, but really even more on the potential of what lies ahead.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Good, that sounds great. Thanks so much, guys.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thanks, Robbie.
<A - Kelley Hall>: We have time for one more question.
Operator
The last question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Oh. Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks. Great quarter. Thanks for getting my question in here. I
think where we're – or I could use a little bit of help here is just on the spread between the revenue guidance in the
fourth quarter and the futures growth rate. I know Kelley and I talked about this intra-quarter. I think the past few
quarters, you were pointing to a very wide spread between futures and revenues due to a few shifts that I think should
have at least started to normalize or normalized by now. If I look at what that means in your direct to consumer
business contributing maybe 4 points of revenue growth every quarter and a guidance for mid-singles for the fourth
quarter. Can you help me reconcile between the 17% futures growth ex-currency and the mid-single digit revenue

growth? It's just a touch wider than we've seen in the past. I want to make sure we understand it. Thanks.
<A - Andrew Campion>: Sure, I'll touch on that one. As you know, just to level-set, we obviously report futures to
give you an indication of demand for the product we're bringing to market at full price and in the inline channels, and
we continue to see strong demand for what we're bringing to market going forward. We also gave you revenue
guidance, so that you get a sense for all of the items that sort of reconcile from gross futures to the total revenue for
NIKE, Inc.
There are several dimensions of that. I won't hit all of them. We do report them. But just to touch on a few of them, the
difference between seasons and quarterly reporting windows, seasons in our industry are about a month off of our
quarterly reporting windows, the waiting of futures by month. Both of those things, seasons and waiting by month, can
be impacted by a number of different factors ranging from shipping timing to consumers to events like the European
Football Championships, the Olympics, et cetera. So those are certainly impacts.
And then you touched on one of the two other dimensions. One is, the lag between the futures order date for our DTC
business and the timing of sell-through to DTC and consumers. And that is a dynamic as we have a fast growing DTC
business, particularly led by NIKE.com. The other dimension is that while futures represent the vast majority of our
revenue, there are some pretty significant items that aren't reflected in futures and can be growing at various rates. That
would be always available, NIKE factory store revenue, Converse, for example. So there are a lot of factors. What we
try to do for you, guys, is give you a sense for demand, again, for the NIKE Brand at full price. That's futures. And then
do that reconciliation for you and give you the revenue guidance.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Okay, then if I can just follow up with one. On the fiscal 2017 early thinking – thanks for some
of the help on that, And. I know the five-year plan from the October Analyst Day was 10% revenue growth. So when
you look at the high-end of the guide to the low end of the guide, high-singles to low-doubles, what kind of dynamics
would take you to the high-singles, which might be a touch below the 10% or what kind of dynamics are you thinking
about early on that can take you above that 10% mark?
<A - Andrew Campion>: It's a great question. And I think, as I noted, we're still finalizing our plan and one of the
reasons we're finalizing the plan is there are a number of dynamics, macroeconomic dynamics, that can be headwinds
to some extent. But there are also opportunities that are presenting themselves. And so our guidance is in line with what
we talked about at the Investor Day, high-single digit to low-double digit, currency neutral revenue growth. And we –
and I think what you see from time to time, obviously, mostly that are positive is that we're looking at opportunities to
connect even more deeply with consumers. And so we'll update you on our guidance as we move forward.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Thanks a lot, guys. Have a great evening.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thank you.
Kelley Hall
Thanks, everybody. Appreciate you joining us on the call this quarter, and we'll talk to you at year end.
