Thanks, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we shared with you a few weeks ago,
2016 was an outstanding year of strategic and operational progress for Celgene. We continued to strengthen the value
propositions of our medicines, we accelerated and advanced our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and we added new
technology platforms, capabilities and compounds to our Research and Development engine.
For more than two decades, Celgene has been committed to discovering, developing and commercializing
differentiated therapies that meaningfully improve and extend the lives of patients. In 2016, this commitment led to
more than 500,000 patients being treated with one or more of our approved commercial products. Our clinical research
teams and collaborators submitted approximately 400 scientific abstracts to global academic meetings and they are
currently conducting more than 180 clinical trials.
This research footprint ties directly to our strategic intent to capitalize on our global leadership in hematology, build
our oncology franchise beyond ABRAXANE and to rapidly expand our immunology and inflammation franchise to
include new therapies for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and other serious
inflammatory conditions.
Our ability to invest in these opportunities is driven by the consistently strong operational performance of our teams
around the world. And I'd like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding work last year.
Immediately following my remarks, Peter will review our excellent fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results.
And Michael and Scott will discuss how the achievements of our therapeutic franchises have us well positioned for
high growth in 2017 and beyond.
Our multi-year efforts to develop the full therapeutic value of our marketed products and to build a robust pipeline have
placed Celgene at a new inflection point, with the potential for accelerating growth. Over the next two years, we expect
data from 19 Phase III trials to become available. During the same time period, we currently expect to advance at least
nine novel agents to pivotal trials and gain increasing clarity into the profiles of 14 new products, each with the
potential for regulatory approval over the next five years.
Jackie will close our call today by providing her perspective on this exciting and important two-year window of
incredible opportunity for us and for the patients we seek to serve. Our distributed research model continues to expand
the depth and breadth of our early drug development programs. Together with our collaboration partners, we filed eight
INDs in 2016 for molecules that we believe have first-in-class or best-in-class potential.
I'd like to thank Rupert Vessey, George Golumbeski and our business development team for another year of
exceptional work adding to our high-potential pipeline. Some notable examples include: initiating our second
collaboration with Agios aimed at the growing convergence of cancer cell metabolism and immuno-oncology; our
acquisition of EngMab and EM901, a bispecific T cell-engaging antibody targeting BCMA in myeloma; our
collaboration with Evotec to identify disease-modifying therapeutics for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases;
and our recently announced collaboration with Anokion, where we hope to move beyond broad immunosuppression
and toward antigen-specific tolerance by utilizing the tolerogenic processes of the immune system.
And today we announced another important I&I transaction with our acquisition of Delinia and its lead program,
DEL106. DEL106 is a novel IL-2 mutein Fc fusion protein designed to preferentially upregulate regulatory T cells,
which, as you know, are critical to maintaining natural self-tolerance and immune system homeostasis. We are
confident that both the Anokion and Delinia transactions will add to our understanding of T cell biology and to our

efforts to develop improved treatments for immune and inflammatory diseases.
Thanks to the work of our colleagues around the world and across all functions, the state of Celgene is very strong. We
are energized and optimistic about our future and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2017.
Thanks again. And please join me in welcoming Peter to our call.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. 2016 was an outstanding year for Celgene, with strong growth across
our franchises and exceptional operating performance. In 2016, both OTEZLA and POMALYST hit blockbuster status,
with both drugs posting sales over $1 billion. Michael and Scott will share details on the performance of the
Hematology, Oncology and I&I franchises, respectively.
We continued to strengthen our portfolio in 2016 by adding new disruptive technologies to our distributed research
model, further enhancing our innovative pipeline. Our momentum leading into 2017 and key catalysts that Mark
mentioned expected in the 2017 and 2018 timeframe sets us up to continue to deliver high growth into the next decade.
Turning to our sales results. In the fourth quarter of 2016, total net product sales were $2.98 billion, a 17% increase
year over year. Consistent with past periods, our top-line growth was predominantly volume-driven, with 14% of the
growth coming from product volume. For the full year 2016, total net product sales were over $11 billion, a 22%
increase year over year. 18% of the growth came from product volume.
Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.61, a 36% year-over-year increase. Operating income drove the
increase. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $5.94, a 26% year-over-year increase, again driven by
operating income. Now, the benefit of a lower diluted share count was more than offset by a full year of interest
expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August of the prior year.
Our operating model continues to deliver strong P&L leverage while we also maintain industry-leading investment in
R&D. For the full year of 2016, our operating margin increased 300 basis points. We ended the year with
approximately $8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Throughout the year, we used our balance sheet and cash
flow to continue to invest in disruptive technologies while also repurchasing approximately $2 billion of Celgene
shares.
Now, at the JPMorgan Conference earlier this month, we updated our full-year 2017 financial guidance. As a reminder,
we expect total revenue to be between $13 billion to $13.4 billion, an increase of 18% year over year. We also expect
our four main products to have sales at or above $1 billion in 2017. We expect a 150 basis point improvement in our
operating margin, which will be primarily driven by leverage in SG&A.
2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.25, a 21% increase over 2016. As
we transition to 2017, I would like to remind you that in Q1 we will again see the customary P&L impact of our ACA
doughnut hole payments, primarily for Rev and Pom, and the softer seasonality impacts of ABRAXANE, as we've seen
in prior years and that you're all familiar with.
Additionally, Scott will update you shortly on some very positive news related to increased market access in the U.S.
via successful managed care contracting for OTEZLA. These agreements should increase the speed and efficiency of
patients' access, but will also increase our gross to net terms, so please consider these factors in your Q1 modeling.
We now expect our weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 815 million shares. Recall that this
includes the impact of a new accounting standard in 2017 that revises the share count methodology. This change drives
the majority of this guided increase in 2017 shares. We do fully expect to continue our share repurchase program in
2017.
I'd also like to add that our 2017 operating income is well hedged against major currencies. This provides very strong
coverage of our 2017 operating income at our planned exchange rates. Building on an exceptional 2016, we really look

forward to another strong year with continued operational and financial momentum.
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.
Michael Pehl
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for the
Hematology and Oncology franchise. Our team produced an excellent sales performance, and we also continue to make
significant progress with our development programs.
Our sales performance and growth was driven by strong underlying demand across brands and geographies.
REVLIMID demand increased globally, with further share and duration gains in newly diagnosed myeloma.
POMALYST/IMNOVID continued to grow at an impressive rate in both U.S. and ex-U.S., and the brand achieved
blockbuster status, surpassing $1 billion in net sales in 2016. Finally, ABRAXANE had steady growth outside the U.S.,
and the U.S. market continued to be relatively stable in spite of significant competitive market dynamics in lung cancer
and breast cancer.
Our 2017 key drivers are on track. We are awaiting the U.S. and EU approvals of REVLIMID in transplant-eligible
maintenance and U.S. POMALYST approval in combination with daratumumab. Triplet combinations in myeloma will
continue to drive share and duration around the globe. The new drug application for enasidenib was submitted to the
FDA at the end of December and we expect a U.S. regulatory decision by the second half of 2017. And we'll have
multiple Phase III data readouts by the end of 2017, with the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials for REVLIMID in
indolent lymphoma and the ABRAXANE APACT trial in adjuvant pancreatic cancer.
Our mid to late-stage pipeline is advancing and we are accelerating many programs. We have 11 pivotal programs with
existing and new assets enrolling and we hope to initiate more than 10 additional pivotal programs with our later-stage
pipeline assets by the end of 2017. I will share more of those details later in my remarks.
REVLIMID net sales grew 16% year-over-year and slightly declined by 4% quarter-over-quarter. As you will recall,
we had significant Russian tenders in both the fourth quarter 2015 and the third quarter 2016 which impacted
REVLIMID's annual and sequential growth rate. Without the impact of the Russian tenders, REVLIMID Q4 net sales
grew approximately 10% year-over-year outside of the U.S. and the REVLIMID Q4 year-over-year volume growth
outside of U.S. was 14%. We are very pleased with the performance in underlying growth drivers for REVLIMID
globally.
U.S. REVLIMID TRxs increased versus prior year and versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., we are equally
optimistic, as REVLIMID continues to have global share and duration gain, with very successful launches in newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma. We have 20 countries reimbursed for NDMM and we expect to have additional
reimbursement in France in Q1. We're still early in the international launch and expect significant market share growth
in Europe and Japan during 2017.
Finally, we are beginning to see the cumulative impact of NDMM and triplets on treatment duration in many markets
and duration is increasing rapidly. In addition to the ongoing launch in lung transplant eligible patients, we have many
additional drivers coming soon. We are expecting approval from maintenance and transplant eligible NDMM patients
in the U.S. in the first quarter and in the EU in the first half of the year. We believe this will be a significant driver for
REVLIMID globally, as it will give us the opportunity to highlight the unique value proposition of REVLIMID in this
patient population and to further educate on treating patients to disease progression.
We are also in discussion with health authorities regarding the submission of an NDA for RVD in first-line transplant
and lung transplant patients. This would create additional opportunities to expand the use of REVLIMID-based triplets.
2017 will also be an important year for our lymphoma program. The R-squared based RELEVANCE and AUGMENT
trials in indolent lymphoma will both read out by the end of 2017. We have strong clinical evidence from multiple
Phase II studies with R-squared in this indication and we are very optimistic about the benefit of R-squared versus

current standard of care.
In 2017 we also expect to complete enrollment of the ROBUST trial, our R-CHOP induction Phase III study in
first-line diffuse large B-cell patients with the ABC subtype. All of these lymphoma trials will generate significant
growth and opportunity for REVLIMID in the coming years and are complementary to our efforts to bring next
generation CELMoDs to NHL patients.
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered impressive growth in Q4, with 29% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue
growth. The brand is maintaining its leadership position in the third and fourth-line plus patient segment in major
markets, in spite of the increasing number of available new therapies and later lines of treatment. In fact,
POMALYST/IMNOVID has experienced accelerated growth in many markets, as duration continues to increase at a
fast pace driven by the increased worldwide views of POMALYST/IMNOVID in triplet combinations. In addition, we
are awaiting the FDA approval POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by
June of this year.
Finally, we are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the
use of multiple combinations. Our Phase III OPTIMISM trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later
treatment lines is expected to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017.
ABRAXANE continues to have quite stable demand. ABRAXANE net sales grew 14% quarter-over-quarter and
declined by 1% year-over-year. U.S. business had a significant increase in Q4 due to the impact of customer buying
patterns. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer and demand is relatively stable in
breast and lung cancer.
Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer.
We still see multiple growth drivers ahead for ABRAXANE. We expect the results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic
cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017 and the pivotal ABRAXANE/Tecentriq combination trials in non-small
cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer will read out in 2018.
In addition to our excellent financial performance, I'd like to provide you with an update on some of the exciting
progress we are making with our rich mid and late-stage pipeline in multiple myeloma, lymphoma, myeloid diseases
and solid tumors.
Starting with multiple myeloma, our BCMA collaboration with bluebird continues to progress nicely. Interim data from
the ongoing Phase I study of BB2121 were presented in December at the Triple symposium in Munich. These data
showed impressive efficacy and safety in the quadruple refractory myeloma population. We are moving forward with
plans to initiate a pivotal program for BB2121 in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma later this year.
We are now enrolling eight trials for the durvalumab FUSION program. These studies are enrolling in newly diagnosed
myeloma, relapsed/refractory myeloma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, CLL, MDS and AML. These trials are in
combination with key inline brands and novel agents. We expect pivotal study-enabling data in myeloma, MDS and
AML to be available throughout 2017.
Moving to lymphoma. In addition to the REVLIMID Phase III readouts at the end of the year, the CC-122 program
continues to enroll multiple proof-of-concept studies in lymphoma, CLL, myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, both
as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. We expect data from most of these indications this year and we
are planning to initiate the first pivotal program in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by year end, with
further pivotal opportunities as additional data reads out.
Our collaboration with Juno to develop JCAR017 continues to advance. Based on very encouraging NHL data shared at
ASH in December, the EMA granted JCAR017 access to the Priority Medicine, or PRIME, scheme for relapsed
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We hope to initiate a pivotal study in this indication later this year.
We are very excited about the number of opportunities we have to truly transform the myeloid space. We are pleased to
announce that we submitted a new drug application to the FDA for enasidenib, or AG-221, in relapsed refractory AML
at the end of last year. The NDA was based on data from the Phase I, II study of AG-221 in patients with relapsed

refractory AML. We expect a regulatory decision on enasidenib in the U.S. in this indication in the second half of 2017,
while we're pursuing first-line AML opportunities in combination with azacitidine and standard chemotherapy.
We've also made great progress with the collaboration with the luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron. Our two
Phase III trials in lower-risk MDS patients and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia will be fully recruited in 2017,
and we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the asset in additional patient segments
and indications. We plan to initiate a Phase II trial in myelofibrosis later this year and are evaluating additional pivotal
opportunities in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia.
Our two CC-486 Phase III studies, known as the QUAZAR studies, in higher-risk MDS and first-line AML
maintenance, continue to enroll well. Data presented at ASH in December highlighted the impressive results of CC-486
in patients who were relapsed or refractory to injectable hypomethylating agents, so-called HMA failures. These data
helped to further understand the differentiated profile of CC-486 and allow us to work on potential additional pivotal
opportunities in MDS and AML.
We continue to build our solid tumor franchise beyond ABRAXANE based on encouraging data in relapsed refractory
neuroblastoma as monotherapy and in combination with AVASTIN we exercised an option to acquire the rights to
marizomib during the fourth quarter. We are advancing marizomib in first-line neuroblastoma in combination with
Temodar radiotherapy, and we hope to initiate a respective pivotal program later this year.
Finally, through our collaboration with OncoMed, we are awaiting data from our ongoing demcizumab program. An
ongoing Phase II randomized trial is evaluating demcizumab plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine in patients with
first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, and we expect to see data from this study in the first half of 2017, allowing us to
decide on a potential pivotal path in this indication.
In summary, we had another excellent quarter and year for the Hematology and Oncology franchise. Our financial
performance was driven by strong underlying demand for both REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID. We have
many key growth drivers for 2017 in place, including upcoming regulatory decisions on REVLIMID, POMALYST and
enasidenib. There are multiple Phase III data readouts expected by year end for REVLIMID and ABRAXANE. We
have multiple pivotal programs underway, and we will be making many decisions to initiate additional pivotal
programs for our later-stage pipeline assets in 2017.
Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott A. Smith
Thank you, Michael, and good morning. 2016 was a great year for Celgene I&I. Importantly, OTEZLA became a
blockbuster product for the treatment of psoriatic disease. Additionally, we laid the groundwork to expand our global
footprint and prepare for launches in several major European countries as well as Japan. We moved the pipeline
forward by advancing all major molecules through a series of important milestones.
Looking specifically at OTEZLA, Q4 sales were $305 million dollars, with full-year sales exceeding $1 billion, which
represents a 116% year-on-year increase. This blockbuster milestone was achieved in only the second full year of
commercialization.
As you can see, the majority of this growth continues to be driven by the U.S. Specifically looking at the U.S., we see
continued growth in market share driven by DTC, gains in our prescriber base and increases in persistence and
compliance. 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA from something other than a biologic.
Importantly, we are entering 2017 with an expanded U.S. access footprint, as we have increased our contracting
activity and expect to see additional 70 million to 100 million commercial lives with biologic step-free access to
OTEZLA. Although in the past year most patients prescribed OTEZLA were ultimately able to gain access, these new
agreements will make it substantially easier for a large number of patients to initiate OTEZLA therapy.

All these factors taken together will allow us to effectively compete for share leadership in the large psoriasis market.
We are also focused on a number of new launches in 2017, driven by recent positive reimbursement decisions for
psoriasis and PSA in France and the UK, and PSA in Italy. We expect a pricing decision for both indications in Japan
by the end of Q1. In Japan, OTEZLA will be the first oral psoriasis product launched in over 25 years. There is a
tremendous opportunity for an oral product with a differentiated benefit risk profile in this sizeable market.
Beyond geographic expansion, we have a robust lifecycle plan including submission of a once-daily formation and
initiation of a Phase III program in scalp psoriasis. We have strong proof-of-concept in scalp psoriasis. And this trial, if
successful, will enable for us to communicate the value of OTEZLA for use in this difficult-to-treat and significant
subset of psoriasis patients.
Turning now to ozanimod. We are very excited to be getting pivotal data from both the 12-month SUNBEAM and
24-month RADIANT studies in the first half of 2017. These large Phase III active comparator trials have annualized
relapse rate, or ARR, as the primary endpoint and will form the core of an expected NDA submission by year end.
Clinical results to-date in Phase II show strong efficacy and a differentiated safety profile. The ARR at two years in the
Phase II program was 0.18.
When we look at the data relative to other therapies studied in RMS, oral ozanimod falls at the upper end of the
efficacy range. This efficacy, together with an expected differentiated safety profile resulting from the S1P1 specificity
and other characteristics of this model, should lead to an improved benefit risk profile for patients. We believe
ozanimod will become a cornerstone product for Celgene in the area of neuroscience.
As we move into 2017, we look to expand the OTEZLA opportunity for the treatment of psoriatic disease throughout
the world. We have built a very strong foundation for OTEZLA and we see many more growth opportunities to come,
in both the near and longer term. This year we expect to fully enroll critical studies in our IBD program, including the
large treat through pivotal trial for GED-301 in the treatment of Crohn's disease. We are very excited about the
transformational potential of this novel oral treatment approach in an area of very high unmet medical need.
2016 was a pivotal year for Celgene I&I and we've already begun 2017 with strong momentum and enthusiasm.
Thank you for your attention. And I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thanks, Scott, and good morning, all. We entered 2017 at Celgene looking forward to as exciting a year as we have
ever had. The commercial momentum our teams have built in both of our franchises is outstanding, and you see that
reflected in our annual guidance. Our key brands are extremely well-positioned to succeed in the markets in which we
compete, serving unmet medical needs through clear value propositions.
On top of that, we expect very important Phase III trial readouts this year. These include trials for new compounds,
such as ozanimod, and trials for label expansions for existing products. We will also move a number of key programs
into pivotal trials, and we will have proof-of-concept data from our early pipeline efforts. Many of these potential
products are not yet reflected in our financial models, and we look forward to updating those models when we have the
data to allow us to do so. We feel highly confident about achieving our 2020 targets and that we will have upside to
those, given the tremendous optionality we have in our portfolio.
Another exciting aspect about the period we are entering is that it represents the start of what will be several years of
catalyst events that will shape the Celgene portfolio of the future and our long-term growth trajectory. As we produce
data across our research and development pipeline from early to late-stage programs, I am confident you will start to
better appreciate the potential we have to grow at industry-leading rates well beyond 2020 and throughout the decade
2021 to 2030.
For 2017, you can focus on several major milestones as listed on the webcast slide. These will bring approvals that will
contribute to our ongoing product and indication diversification. These are but a selection out of a much longer list of

We have a history of delivering across short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and we will continue to deliver.
2017 and 2018 are shaping up to be transformative years supporting our ongoing success, and we look forward to
sharing our milestone results with you throughout the course of the year.
Thank you. And I will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, team. Thank you so much for taking my question and also thanks to the whole
Celgene organization for all the help you gave my team while I was out. I really appreciate it. My question is a fairly
simple one. I'm not sure who to direct it to, perhaps Jackie. But I think during the JPMorgan presentation, you
mentioned that you thought you could grow. And I think it was earnings from the time period of 2020 to 2030. And I
know that's a long way away. But I'd be curious to know if you can provide any other color on that? Do you think, for
example, Jackie, that you can grow earnings every year in that time period despite what will be the probable expiration
of REVLIMID exclusivity? Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thank you for the question. You said simple. I'm not so sure. But I think when you look at
the totality of our portfolio, both with respect to where we are right now and the tremendous momentum that we have,
not only in the existing business, but the momentum that the teams have generated across the pipeline and how our
business development activities continue to feed into that, we've got a ton of optionality in this portfolio. And no matter
how you go through it and do risk adjustments and things like that, I think we have a very, very strong chance of
growing annually each and every year throughout the decade beyond 2020.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Got you. [indiscernible] (30:36)
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: There are a number of compounds that are very specifically not in our financial models. I
think we highlighted some of those during the conference. They include the JCAR017, luspatercept NDS, durvalumab,
ABRAXANE IO, BB2121, marizomib, demcizumab, CC-122. I can go through like eight or 10 different products that
are not included in the models yet at all. And I think everybody will remember that we put a placeholder in the 2020
targets after the Receptos acquisition. But the potential value to Celgene of the ozanimod indications is not by any
stretch of the imagination yet modeled in our numbers. And we're going to start to have data from those trials to do that
soon. So it's very exciting. And I think we're going to grow for a long, long, long, long time.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So, Mark, it's Mark. Just to maybe wrap up the question because it's very, very important. I
appreciate you starting off with it. The other thing we talked about in JPMorgan in this context of optionality is that we
have 30 unique molecules in development with 50 programs supporting those molecules. We gave some color, I think,
and clarity around 14 of those molecules, 10 of which we think have blockbuster potential. And a few that we already
think have peak potential in the multibillion-dollar type range. So that kind of clarity going into the window that Jackie
just spoke to, you're asking about, gives us that increased confidence about growing beyond the loss of exclusivity,
particularly of lenalidomide, REVLIMID.
But I'll also make the point that the strength of the company now puts us in a position to continue to build off of that
very strong base. Our [indiscernible] (32:26), our research groups, are doing outstanding work advancing
next-generation designer CELMoDs across a number of diseases. We are just on the front end of understanding and
unlocking how to design through protein homeostasis new small molecules. On the BD front, as you heard, 2016 was
another great year for the company. And I highlighted a few of those transactions during the prepared remarks. We

want to follow the science. We want to keep building the company. So along with Jackie's comment, we did provide, I
think, some clarity about why we feel confident.
So thanks for the question. And, Patrick, we'll go to the next one.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question. I think it's much, much simpler than Mark's. For Michael on the
Q4 REVLIMID revenues. I think even if you correct for the Russian tender offer, as you did in your discussion I
believe, if my math is correct, that ex-U.S. REVLIMID and worldwide REVLIMID sales were down on a
quarter-on-quarter basis. Is there anything else going on? And do you still think this franchise is accelerating? Thank
you.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks, Eric, for the question. And I think to start with this question, it makes sense to really
look at the overall growth that we have throughout the year. When we're looking at U.S., we had a 3% sequential
growth and 24% annual growth. So all the growth drivers are intact.
What you see in Europe is really an impact of a large Russian tender that we had in Q3. We also had a large Russian
tender by the end of 2015, so that has impacted the annual growth rates and the sequential growth rates. If you take the
Russian tender out, I think what can you can see is very good growth in Europe both from a volume perspective and
from a sales perspective. So all of the growth drivers are intact. Shares are increasing. Duration is increasing, all of that
worldwide. What you see in Europe was really impacted by a large Russian tender.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question I guess for
Peter or Mark on the capital allocation front. Just wondering what your latest thoughts are with regard to potentially
start paying a dividend. Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Thanks, Cory. I'll start and maybe Mark can jump in. Look, we are always thinking about
capital allocation in a way that, number one, takes care of our strategic needs, but, number two, really supports our
shareholders and provides great returns to them. So we're always evaluating this.
Clearly, as we've described and Mark and Jackie just highlighted, we are right now in a period where we have a lot of
Phase III outcomes, cards turning over over the next two years. And as those come through, it'll really clarify just how
solidly we see the next decade of growth drivers and so forth. If that turns out very well, then I think really we do open
up the discussion about capital allocation and think very freely about new approaches and so forth. So I think that's
around the corner. That said, we do want to see that data come through a bit and really build that momentum. And then
I think, clearly, we're open to discussion.
I think I would say that we've asked the question a lot to our broad base of investors. And, in fact, what I just described
is something that has been the major feedback we've gotten. After our Analyst Day back in September, October, we
actually did a survey. And that was one of the major dynamics coming back from all of our investor base was really
build that next-generation pipeline, continue to drive the potential of your current assets. And then at a lower priority,
as you start to solidify your pipeline results and data, come back with a capital allocation process to think through what

the optimum approach is there.
And so we're listening to our investors, really trying to be as dynamic as we can. But it's certainly on our radar and our

<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thanks very much. And I just wanted to ask a couple questions about the myeloma
outlook. Michael, you mentioned the approval for maintenance post-transplant. I'm just wondering, first of all, how
routine is that already in clinical practice, meaning how much incremental penetration do you think that the approval
would get you?
And then a longer-term question on myeloma. The data just seems to be getting better and better for REVLIMID. And
wondering how feasible you think it is that next-generation CELMoDs, such as 122 or 220, could be advanced to the
front-line setting by early 2020s. Or is that just looking like it's too big a hill to climb? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Yeah, thanks, Geoffrey, for the question. Starting with your first one about usage and
maintenance post transplant patients ready. The picture is actually different in U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., around
about 50% of the eligible transplant patients are getting REVLIMID in maintenance onto the progression. The other
50% don't. They either don't get maintenance at all or they don't get REVLIMID or they get REVLIMID and
maintenance but not onto the progression. So we think there's a really nice opportunity in the U.S.
In Europe, we don't have any maintenance at the moment of time. The reason it is very simple. In order to get
reimbursed, you have to have approval. And we are very optimistic that we're going to be able to obtain that. So
combined the opportunity in the post-maintenance setting is probably as big as the opportunity that we have in the
non-transplant setting. So it's a very substantial opportunity for the company.
Talking about the myeloma market as such and the opportunity, there's a couple of points to make, starting with, yes,
the data with REVLIMID is really good. But there is segments of patients that are absolutely not doing well. Even with
the best combination at this moment of time, which we think is probably the combination of an IMiD, in that case,
REVLIMID, with daratumumab. A third of the patients is relapsing after six to 12 months. All of these patients are
going to die after three to four years. That's number one.
There are high-risk patients out there with adverse cytogenetics, del(17p), for example, which are going to die after
three to four years. There is elderly, frail patients out there where you cannot use triplets at this moment of time. And
then, unfortunately, you still have patients who are relapsing after all available treatment options.
So I think there's multiple options for us to develop, not just CELMoDs, but our whole portfolio that we're having with
CAR-T, with bispecific antibodies, with new CELMoDs, and we're going to be very, very thoughtful and going into the
right patient populations right from the get-go.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Great. Thanks very much.

administration? Any comments? Any discussions you've had with the Trump administration? Can you characterize the
level of interaction you've had with them and maybe what you've learned from those discussions? Thank you.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Just for the record, we've not as a company or me as
a person have not had direct interaction with the administration. I think the indirect has been quite intense and quite
measurable through our different trade associations, pharma, bio, et cetera. So I think the media interaction and the
awareness is quite high of what the industry is trying to advance, which is the value of what we do economically, how
we create jobs. I think the latest count is some four million jobs are generated by the industry. Of course, the economic
value of what our medicines do for people who can work and be productive in their lives is part of that equation.
So this information is being talked about. And personally, I'm extremely excited because I think there's a lot of
education going on through a lot of the back-and-forth, a lot of the different stakeholder groups talking about value
versus cost and price. The notion of comprehensive transparency is getting a lot of attention.
So we're very, very optimistic that the Trump administration is wanting to and will focus on preserving and enhancing
the competitive marketplace as a way to balance value and the economics of health care in general.
There's a lot of attention of course about repeal and replace. We have to see how that plays out. But there are a number
of things we're excited about. We think it's going to be a pro-innovation, a pro-industry policy environment. But we're
waiting, and of course, we'll engage appropriately whenever we would be invited to discuss these topics.
So thanks for the question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate the question. I had a question on ozanimod.
Scott, could you just talk a little bit about what your expectations are for the data from those two studies and how you
think it might compare in the marketplace? And then just remind us what your plans are for that agent. Are you still
considering launching that on your own, or should we think about you partnering that asset? Thanks.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you for the question. I think to answer the second part first, we would wait to understand
and see the fullness of the Phase III data, which we will in the first half of this year, to make any final decisions around
partnering. Certainly there's been a lot of interest in the asset.
We will in parallel tracks be prepared to launch and commercialize on our own. But also when we have the fullness of
the data, have discussions with appropriate companies to see if there's something which could be additive in terms of
value to the asset and to patients. So we would be prepared to do either, but wait until we had good Phase III data.
What our expectations are. When you take a look at the pre-clinical models and where you start to see differentiation is
because of the S1P1 and S1P5 specificity as opposed to S1P3, plus volume of distribution, titration, more rapid
recovery of lymphocyte levels, other things. All those things together, I think, will lead to a differentiated safety profile
which will have a different benefit risk.
And you saw that pre-clinically, you see that in the Phase II data. And we'll have to wait until we see the Phase III data.
But certainly our hypothesis is that you would have top-end efficacy with a better safety profile leading to
differentiated benefit risk in the long term.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Thanks very much.

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow up, Jackie, on the comments you made at
JPMorgan as well. So I think you had mentioned in 2020 guidance, you guys raised it for $1 billion to include the
Receptos acquisition.
And with data this year for ozanimod and maybe a launch in 2018 and maybe more data next year in EC, just trying to
understand where the confidence comes that that could be either conservative or at least achievable just because
[indiscernible] (44:35) itself was about $1 billion, a little bit over $1 billion after two years. And the MS market has
had some stress lately. So just maybe give us color on your thoughts on the MS market and how you're thinking about
how it's evolved the acquisition and the guidance? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Robyn. Thanks for the question. So let me start and then I'll also maybe pass it over to
Scott. So if you look at the totality of the potential for ozanimod, we, I think, are thinking about the ulcerative colitis
market as being very important as well.
So the placeholder that we have in the model covers the total product without a lot of fine tuning of certain assumptions
around the different indications. And with the profile that we're hoping that it will have, as Scott said, we think we are
going to have a highly differentiated molecule. So you're going to have the data from the two Phase III MS trials this
year. And then the team will submit that by the end of the year. Then we're going to have the data from the ulcerative
colitis trial next year and would be submitting. So you're potentially in the market with two indications and some time
to start to see some ramp-up there by 2020.
And as importantly, personally, I think beyond that period of time when you think about 2021 and beyond and even
past 2026, given the intellectual property on some of these new compounds, these are tremendous opportunities for us
to have significant revenue products. And we highlighted that in some of our JPMorgan materials in terms of the peak
sales potential and a more diversified product portfolio.
The other thing about 2020 is the existing business is doing better than we had expected at the time we gave the 2020
targets originally, so that base and the assumptions underlying, whether it's REVLIMID or POMALYST durations and
some other things, is outperforming.
Remember, at one time we thought REVLIMID would be a $7 billion drug in 2017. It was a $7 billion drug in 2016. So
there's very low risk associated with our ability to hit those targets. And the mix may even be a little bit different than
we thought, which gives you upside potential both in 2020 and beyond.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you, Jackie. So our current assumptions around ozanimod, as I said just a minute ago, are
a differentiated asset from what you see in Gilenya. And by the time we get to 2020, we will be in the second full year
of launch in MS and the first full year of launch in UC, so there will be contribution from both those programs. And we
think both the UC and MS programs are very, very viable and relatively equal size in terms of their opportunity. So
that's what gives us the confidence that we will be able to deliver on the numbers in 2020 and beyond.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Terence Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just for Mark or Peter, just wondering if you can
maybe provide some perspective on U.S. corporate tax reform? I know there are a couple different options out there, or
proposals. But as you think about your tax rate and the driver long term, anything you can help frame for us there?
Thank you.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Sure. Thank you. Obviously, we're tracking that very closely, and our team is very involved
with a number of the other large biotech and pharma companies in Washington. So we're very close to it. But, as you
indicated, it's not yet exactly clear how it's going to play out, so it would be hard for me to be totally definitive.

But I would say that, overall, we are guardedly optimistic, and I think growing optimism that what will come out will
be very pro-innovation of corporate tax reform. You know, the timing, of course, is pretty hard. And we think that
could be very exciting and provide significant long-term benefit to the U.S. economy as well as to our industry. And
obviously overall what we're excited about is the fact that this would really level the playing field vis-à-vis foreign
multinationals and, quite frankly, remove any tax incentive to locate activities and investments offshore, which is what
it's all about. This is really pro-U.S. multinational and building the business in the U.S. So we are very supportive of all
that.
You know, if we were to triangulate based on what we know now and, again, with the caveat that we don't know how
it'll play out, we are not sure that it would necessarily imply a significant change to our tax rate, which you know right
is now is kind of in the high teens. And if we were to build up a scenario of what might come through, we would see
some things helping us, some things maybe being slightly negative. But net-net, we think all of that would be easily
navigated.
What would be much more positive for us overall is the fact that we would have access to our worldwide cash flows
going forward, as well as the cash we have right now. And we think that would just allow us to accelerate all the
strategic initiatives we have and all the shareholder-friendly actions that we have.
So we think overall it's a great thing. We're very supportive. We're very engaged. And we're excited to see something
really positive come out for the industry, because we think we are, as Mark said earlier, an industry that provides great
jobs, is growing very rapidly and really provides tremendous value in the health care world. And we just would love to
keep that going with a better level playing field.
<Q - Terence Flynn>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Yee>: Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on ABRAXANE in two areas. One was the adjuvant Phase III
study in pancreatic will read out this year. I wanted to ask about your confidence there and how risky that was,
realizing it's an option.
And then secondly in lung, as we know in chemo combos, Merck has filed, although not using ABRAXANE. Just
wanted to understand your views on whether that would help. And then whether the other chemo combos in lung are
using ABRAXANE and how to think about that as well. Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Yeah, hi, Michael. Thanks for the question. So starting with the APACT study. So it's going to
read out by the end of the year. The time point at which it is exactly going to read out is going to be event-driven.
We've been showing recently at the ASCO GI Meeting data in an earlier patient population, so patients with local
advanced pancreatic cancer. And the results look really excellent. Many of these patients that were not operable before
became operable. Which tells us this that the combination of ABRAXANE and gemcitabine is really an excellent
choice in patients with earlier cancer, pancreatic cancer. So we are very confident in that regard. And there was really
not a lot of progress for those patients in the past year, so if the study's positive, and we assume it's going to be, there's
going to be a very fast uptake of the combination.
In terms of the chemo combos, we also followed the recent development with Merck. What basically it tells you I think
is a couple of things. A, monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is not the right thing to do with everybody. B, in
patients with low expression of PD-L1, the jury is still out who's going to qualify for I-O, I-O versus chemo I-O. And,
C, we really think that ABRAXANE has an advantage versus other chemotherapies in that patient population. Roche
has been publishing in abstract form the response rates that have been achieved in the non-small cell lung cancer
population with the combination of ABRAXANE and Tecentriq and it really looks excellent. We think those data are
definitely better than anything that has been published.

So we think we're going to have advantage in the chemo field. We think there is going to be a role for chemo I-O
combinations in patients who are low or low-expressive. And we also think that we're going to have an economic
advantage compared to I-O, I-O ABRAXANE I-O is just going to be very favorable for payers. So I hope that answers
your question.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja of SunTrust Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Yatin Suneja>: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Scott on OTEZLA. So the rest
of the world should be a major driver going forward. Could you maybe comment on the market dynamics there? What
sort of contribution should we anticipate from, let's say, Europe and Japan? Obviously we understand there is a pricing
difference. But how do you see that market relative to U.S.? Thank you.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you for the question. We're very excited in 2017 to really start to get going in Europe and
commercialization and in Japan. In Europe, in particular, reimbursement decisions, these are highly managed areas.
They can take a little while. But we ended up I think in a very, very good place with our reimbursement in France,
where we don't have to have a first hospital prescription like biologics do.
We've got a very favorable label and hopefully good pricing and reimbursement finalization in Japan in the next little
while. So I think there are some markets and the majority of markets in Europe and, again, Japan I would point out as
well where I think we have a tremendous opportunity to really drive growth.
There are generally lower prices. But with full reimbursement and indications to be used early in these countries, I
think the rest of the world will start to catch up to the contribution that we see for the U.S. And longer term at peak
sales sometime deep into the 2020 I would expect relatively equal contributions between the U.S. market and
everything outside of the U.S.
<A - Patrick E. Flanigan>: And, Nicole, I think we have time for two more callers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one for Scott. I wanted to get some color on
with all these psoriasis drugs coming to the market, how do you see if there's potential for further expansion for
OTEZLA in the United States? Thanks.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you. So it's a better time to be a psoriasis patient than it has been in many years, when
the only modalities from a targeted perspective were TNF inhibitors. And now you've got drugs like OTEZLA to be
used earlier in therapy and you've got IL-1223s, IL-23s, IL-17s, which are coming post-TNF. And the utilization is
generally there. So the market is starting to segment out.
But if you take a look at utilization rates in the U.S., still only about 20% of patients with moderate to severe disease
are being treated. So I think there's still tremendous potential to be moving this market forward.
As we talked about, Peter talked about and I talked about earlier on the call, some contracting leading to agreements to
have a number of commercial lives bio-step free going into 2017 I think will increase our access and ease of getting
patients onto drug, onto OTEZLA, and I think will be a significant driver for continued market share development and
growth in the United States.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have another ozanimod one. Scott, can you talk
about the level of commercial investments in MS that you have already made ahead of the Phase III data?
And then, Mark, when I look at the large number of deals you guys have done, they obviously have a HemOnc and I&I
bias. Would neurology become a major focus area? Does that depend on data? And is there capacity for another
category at Celgene? Thanks.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: So thank you for the question. Relative to ozanimod commercial spend, it depends on how you
define what commercial spend looks like. Certainly, there are commercial preparatory activities that you would do
before getting your Phase III data. But most of the activity would be in the medical affairs, scientific understanding,
moving forward the clinical development program and working from a medical perspective to help to create the – to
have good understanding of the data and to start to do some shaping around the molecule and where it might fit into the
marketplace.
You start to see increasing commercial investments in things as you turn over the data and know you have positive
Phase III data and then start building sales forces and other things. But at this point, the majority of our activity has
been in the clinical development, clinical operations and medical affairs side at this point.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And if I can just jump in, Scott and his team have a very successful track record with
respect to building the commercial infrastructure to support what our specialty physician-targeted markets and
categories and do that in a highly efficient way and then deliver on the revenue growth. So back when they did this,
when we did this as a company to support the launch of OTEZLA, we didn't miss a beat in terms of the ongoing
operating margin expansion while we made those investments.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: And just one more little bit of color here is that what you would do is you would really invest in
leadership and people that understand this marketplace, that were involved in the development of many other molecules
in this space. And we have got clinical leads, commercial leads, safety leads from other MS programs in the past who
have come here and are forming the core of the leadership of MS.
And I think we have people that have a tremendous understanding in this marketplace. And the bigger investments and
build out happens as we get later into the year, but we really do feel good about the type of people who are working on
the MS program and the leadership they bring.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So, Geoff, it's Mark. Just to close out the point. And it's such an important question, you're
getting the whole team to answer pieces of it. But what you hear are some principles at play that I really would harken
back to when Celgene became a hematology company. It's this idea of very, very high unmet medical need, disruptive
opportunity, specialty markets, as Jackie points out, and then this opportunity to basically take a molecule and then use
that as an anchor opportunity to build the capabilities and the presence in one or another market, as long as it is truly
disruptive, as long as it fits into our principles about how we think about the company's mission.
So we're trying to be bold. We want to change the outcomes for patients, but not incrementally. And in that context,
we're in a position now if the question specific to neurosciences, where the short-term window of some availability of
ozanimod data and what that means for Celgene and for the marketplace at large is an opportunity, a window, for us to
apply our principles and think about how we'll build the company into the future.
So thanks a lot, Geoff. We'll talk to you soon.
Peter N. Kellogg
So thank you for joining us on the call today. This is Peter just to wrap up. Obviously you can hear from this call and
discussions we've had already, we are very proud of the tremendous accomplishments of the Celgene organization

across a number of fronts in 2016. But even more so we are, quite frankly, very excited to be in 2017 and driving
forward with a lot of data flow and the chance to really continue the momentum and, in fact, enhance it going forward.
So I think 2017 is going to be a very exciting year. We feel great about our guidance, as Jackie and Mark have
highlighted, both for 2017 and 2020. There's a lot of momentum here, a lot of excitement in the organization. So thank
you for the call.
