The Union Pacific team delivered solid financial results across the board this quarter, achieving an all-time quarterly
earnings record of $1.85 per share. That's a 19% increase compared to 2010. We also set best-ever quarterly marks in
operating revenue, operating income, driving record year-to-date free cash flow. We're clearly delivering on the
benefits of our diverse franchise. Volumes increased in four of our six business groups. The downside was weak
international intermodal and lower export grains. Overall, we're pleased with these results in light of the fragile
economy and operational challenges related to the severe drought in Texas. Although we deal with weather every day,
the extent and duration of the drought did impact network operations during the quarter. Lance will provide more
details on this in a few minutes.
Despite these challenges, we remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that generates value for
our customers and translates into improved financial return for our shareholders.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Thanks, Jim, and good morning.
Well, let's lead off this morning with a look at customer satisfaction, which set a new third quarter record, coming in at
91. That's up 1 point from last year and reflects a continued strong value proposition, even as our operating team battles
lingering Midwest flooding and the effects of the severe drought in the South during the quarter.
Our volume increased 1% with the international intermodal peak season weighing heavily on our growth in the third
quarter. But interestingly enough, if you excluded intermodal, our other five businesses grew 6% during the quarter,
even with the softer export grain market. Our core price improved 4.5%, with each of the six groups posting gains.
Those price gains, combined with increased fuel surcharge revenue and some positive mix from the decline in
intermodal and growth in carload business, drove average revenue per car up 14%. The end result was a 16%
improvement in freight revenue to a best-ever $4.8 billion.
So let me walk you through each of the six groups in a little more detail. Our ag products revenue grew 9% as a 12%
increase in average revenue per car more than offset a 3% decline in volume. During third quarter last year, UP's grain
exports hit their third-highest volume ever. So against that tough comparison, and with increased wool production this
year, exports were down 31%, driving the group's overall decline in carloading. A 7% increase in domestic feed grain
shipments helped to offset at least some of the export softness, and we also saw strength in grain products, where
shipments climbed 5%, with solid gains in ethanol, biodiesel, and meal.
Despite shaky consumer confidence and weak economic indicators, the U.S. vehicle sales were up 6% versus last year
for the quarter, supporting a 10% increase in our automotive shipments. The growth in volume, combined with a 12%
improvement in average revenue per car, drove a 23% increase in revenue. Our finished vehicle shipments increased
5% despite the lingering impact of the Japanese tsunami, but the good news going forward is that by the quarter's end,
U.S. production had returned to normal for all manufacturers, setting the stage for a stronger fourth quarter. As
production increased in anticipation of improving sales, our parts shipments were up 18%.
Our chemicals volume grew 5%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car to produce a
14% increase in revenue. The petroleum products business led our chemicals growth, as shipments increased 35%.
Most of that growth came from crude oil originating primarily in the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale regions, although we
also saw solid growth in asphalt shipments.
Elsewhere, the solid performance that we've seen across the major chemical segments continued in the third quarter.
The one exception was fertilizer, where volumes slipped 5% because of reduced export demand.
Energy revenue grew 21% as a 13% improvement in average revenue per car combined with volume growth of 7%.
Weather again played a role, as the impact of the Midwest flooding continued in July. However, almost all of that
business was made up during the quarter, as was about 60% of the loads that we missed during the second quarter.

New business to the Wisconsin utilities, along with the new coal-fired plant coming online near Waco, Texas, produced
most of the 5% increase in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage, although volume actually was up to most of our
utilities year over year.
Colorado-Utah tonnage was up 9%, its first year-over-year quarterly growth since early 2008. Supporting that volume
growth was relatively strong international market demand and also the return to production of one of the mines that had
been relocating to new reserves.
Our industrial products volume grew 8%, which, combined with a 15% improvement in average revenue per car, drove
a 24% increase in revenue. Metallic mineral shipments doubled as our iron ore unit train business for export to China
continued to ramp up. Drilling demand in the energy market once again drove a 39% increase in nonmetallic minerals,
primarily frac sand, and a 13% increase in steel.
Our intermodal revenue grew 8%, as a 15% improvement in average revenue per unit more than offset a 6% decline in
volumes. The volume decrease resulted from a 12% reduction in our international intermodal shipments, primarily the
result of weak West Coast imports, but also impacted by the contract loss that we talked about in the second quarter,
which cost us about 12,000 units.
The news is a little brighter in our domestic intermodal business, where volume was up 2% and strengthening through
the quarter. We set a new seven-day volume record of 29,500 units during the last week of September, topping the old
record set last November by 8%.
You'll recall in the second quarter, we talked to you about MCP, our Mutual Commitment Program, that was boosting
margins but also was holding down our domestic volume. Well, in the third quarter, that commitment program was
paying big benefits for our customers, as we've had near perfect delivery on our box availability commitments. We're
proving that we can keep our commitments, effectively providing MCP customers with needed capacity and reliable
service, even as our domestic business tracks 6% to 7% ahead of last year's record volumes.
So as we look to the end of the year, I have to admit that I've been disappointed by the weakness in our international
intermodal peak season. But the good news is that the diversity of our franchise should continue to provide
opportunities to more than offset the challenges that we face in the fourth quarter.
First of all, in terms of challenges, the better world crop production and plentiful storage available for a
smaller-than-expected U.S. corn crop shows that whole grain export shipments are still going to be soft, in contrast to
last year's record volumes. We're also not expecting international intermodal to get any stronger.
But here's where we do expect to see the offset. September auto sales were at their highest seasonally adjusted level
since April, supporting the expectation that pent-up demand will sustain our autos momentum, despite the economic
headwinds. The new Wisconsin utility business, the new plant in Texas, should keep our coal volumes strong, together
with improved Colorado-Utah production and lower SPRB inventories, which right now still trail what would be
considered normal stockpiles by about seven days.
Energy-related drilling should continue to drive growth in nonmetallic minerals and steel in our industrial products
group. In steel, we should also benefit from the continued recovery in the auto industry. And our export iron ore should
also be a growth driver for industrial products. Petroleum products should again lead the way, and fertilizer will
rebound with seasonal demand, so we expect our chemicals business to stay strong. And the recent strength in domestic
intermodal should continue as well, because retailers will be pulling inventory from West Coast distribution centers
ahead of the holidays.
Now, I know many of you are already thinking beyond the fourth quarter, and we are, too. Barring any sort of unusual
or unexpected event like a Japanese tsunami or a total U.S. or global economic meltdown, we're thinking the slow
growth trajectory that we're seeing today continues on for the foreseeable future. And as we look at it, that spells real
opportunity for Union Pacific.
Energy demand should remain strong and be a solid growth driver in terms of frac sand, pipe, petroleum, ethanol, and
biodiesel. Strong world demand for metallic minerals and other U.S. natural resources like soda ash support a strong

growth outlook in those fast-growing markets for us. Our ag business will continue to pace with population growth,
which provides a solid base load and also allows us to take advantage of global export opportunities, should they
develop it.
So with that foundation and a recovering auto industry, we're delivering record results in a year where products like
lumber, cement, rock, and appliances are tracking anywhere from 30% to 60% below previous record volumes. So as
we think about the future, even the smallest improvement in consumer confidence and consumer spending really offers
Union Pacific additional upside opportunity.
So overall, our strong value proposition, underpinned by excellent service, positions us to take advantage of the
opportunities offered by our diverse franchise. The resulting volume growth, combined with expected pricing gains,
should continue to drive record revenue, not only in the fourth quarter but for the foreseeable future as well.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Jack, and good morning.
I'll start with our safety performance. In employee safety, we achieved a record third quarter reportable personal injury
rate and best-ever year-to-date results. The continued maturation of our Total Safety Culture, our risk identification and
mitigation, and training and education efforts drove the improvement. Our safety culture is especially important as we
hire to cover attrition and volume.
In terms of rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date FRA reportable rate increased 7%, driven largely
by low-cost yard and industry lead incidents. In the third quarter, human factor and track-related incidents increased
compared to the prior year. We continue to accelerate investments in our yards and our terminals to get our exposure
back on the right trend lines.
Most encouraging, despite increases in rail and highway traffic during the year, our crossing accident rate improved 6%
year to date versus 2010. We continue to help communities address risky driver behavior and to close grade crossings.
In fact, since 2001, we've closed over 4,000 at-grade crossings on the UP system, in addition to educating the public
about grade crossing safety. We remain committed to improving our safety performance on the way to operating an
incident-free network.
Before getting into our service performance, I want to spend a minute on how we have managed the weather challenges
you've heard us talk about. Operations improved substantially during the third quarter in the flood-impacted areas, and
we are getting closer to normal business operations in that region. Our team worked tirelessly and successfully to
protect our service product through the floods.
The South was a completely different challenge this quarter. Extreme drought in Central Texas created unstable soil
conditions and, when combined with record heat, generated a sharp increase in slow orders. These speed restrictions
reduced capacity and velocity, requiring additional resources like crews and locomotives. At the same time, our volume
in the area grew by about 10%, putting even more pressure on the strained network. We reacted by applying surge
resources and increasing track maintenance in Texas. Slow orders turned the corner in September and improved
another 17% so far in October. I anticipate continued improvement during the fourth quarter as we return to normal
operations in Texas.
Network performance for the third quarter remained relatively strong despite these challenges, demonstrating our
resiliency and recoverability. As carloads grew almost 5% from July to September, our network performance remained
solid. However, we did see about a 1 mile per hour impact on our quarterly velocity due to weather-related challenges.
We gained momentum in September and continue to see improvement in October. By applying the principles of the
Unified Plan and utilizing surge resources, we sustained the network's service reliability and demonstrated its
resiliency.

As Jack discussed, we continue to provide solid customer service at the local level. Our industry spot and pull measure
was 94% for the quarter, which nears the all-time quarterly record of 95% set in the second quarter of this year. This is
the first move and last move for a customer, and it's critical to overall customer satisfaction. This performance reflects
our continued focus on the fundamentals, improving network performance, service reliability, and operational
efficiency.
Slide 17 illustrates some of those efficiencies. Gross ton-miles per employee were essentially flat with 2010, despite the
addition of over 1,000 new hires in the training pipeline and an increase in employees working on capital projects and
positive train control. Surge resources added to combat the impact of slow orders and speed restrictions that I discussed
earlier also masked productivity gains during the quarter. Those productivity gains included our work to improve train
sizes. Train lengths for our manifest and intermodal traffic continue to increase. The growth in intermodal train size this
quarter is particularly noteworthy, considering intermodal volumes were down 6% in the quarter compared to 2010.
And we continue to balance manpower with demand, with an average of nearly 500 employees per load during the third
quarter. If you look at current levels, we have roughly 700 or more employees on furloughed status.
The end game is to realize the full potential of the UP franchise, translated into these deliverables: word-class safety
results on the way to an incident-free network; growing the value proposition for our customers by recovering to record
levels of service; continuing to generate network productivity for bottom-line results; and positioning for growth,
resulting from our solid service performance.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks, Lance, and good morning.
Let's start by summarizing our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 16% to a record $5.1 billion on the
strength of fuel surcharge recoveries, core pricing gains, and volume growth. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion,
increasing 17% or $516 million compared to the third quarter of 2010. Higher fuel prices accounted for over half of the
cost increase. Operating income totaled $1.6 billion, a 13% increase and an all-time record quarter. Other income
totaled $17 million in the third quarter, $8 million lower compared to last year. Quarterly interest expense declined 7%
versus the third quarter of 2010 to $142 million, driven by lower average debt levels. Third quarter income tax expense
increased to $549 million. Higher pre-tax earnings drove this increase. Net income totaled $904 million, increasing
16% compared to 2010. The outstanding share balance declined 2% versus last year, reflecting our share repurchase
activity. These results drove an all-time quarterly earnings record of $1.85 per share, increasing 19% versus last year.
Turning to our top line, we achieved 16% freight revenue growth to an all-time record of $4.8 billion. Slide 21 provides
a walk-across of the third quarter growth drivers. Car loadings were up 1%. We also saw a positive mix impact driven
by strong growth in higher average revenue per car moves. We achieved core pricing gains of 4.5% in the third quarter,
which includes RCAF fuel escalators. As you know, we calculate pricing gains as a percent of our total book of
business. And with the bulk of our 2011 legacy portfolio coming up for renewal in the fourth quarter, it is not a major
driver of our 2011 core pricing gains.
Fuel surcharge revenue added 7 points to the top line, driven by higher fuel prices in the third quarter versus 2010 and a
slight tailwind on the surcharge recovery lag. In addition to solid core pricing gains, we saw improvements in our
incremental margins this quarter. Of course, there are many moving parts impacting this number, including revenues
and costs associated with weather-related challenges. So adjusting only for higher fuel prices, our incremental margin
was 41% in the third quarter. As we said in July, our second quarter adjusted incremental margin of 36% would be the
low mark for the year. This still holds true, even with the lower volume growth that we've seen in the back half of the
year thus far.
Now let's turn to expenses. Slide 23 summarizes our year-over-year increase in operating expense by category. As I
mentioned, higher fuel prices contributed to over half of the $516 million increase in expense. Other year-over-year

increases include inflationary costs and volume-related expenses. We also saw additional labor increases, driven by
higher TE&Y training costs and drought-related expenses, as Lance just described.
With that, let's spend a minute and walk through each of these categories. Third quarter fuel expense totaled $916
million, increasing $308 million compared to 2010. The average diesel fuel price, which increased 42% year over year,
was the biggest driver of the quarterly change. The average barrel price of $90 rose 18% compared to last year. In
addition, conversion spreads, which cover the cost to convert crude oil to diesel fuel, tripled from 2010 levels to an
average of $37 per barrel in the third quarter. Although our improving fuel surcharge mechanisms enable us to recover
the majority of higher fuel prices, the resulting increase in expense and revenue created a negative impact of 1.7 points
on our third quarter operating ratio versus 2010. Fuel expense was also higher as a result of a 5% increase in gross
ton-miles and a 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate.
Slide 25 summarizes third quarter expenses for compensation and benefits. Comp and benefits expense is up 9%
compared to 2010. Over half of the increase in expense can be attributed to inflationary pressures that we have
discussed with you before, including health and welfare, unemployment taxes, wage increases, and pension costs.
Looking forward, our initial planning for 2012 would indicate that labor inflation should moderate somewhat from
2011 levels.
Training costs were up $17 million in the quarter as we continue to hire new employees to cover expected attrition and
volume growth. And additional crews needed to manage through the slow orders and speed restrictions in the South
drove expenses up $18 million in the quarter. Lastly, the unusually large mix shift and growth in manifest traffic this
quarter drove a higher volume impact on labor expenses. Carload growth of 1% and a gross ton-mile increase of 5%
resulted in a volume growth impact on expense of 2% to 2.5%. Productivity gains of about 1.5% mostly offset this
increase.
Slide 26 takes a closer look at the change in our workforce levels. Workforce levels increased 5% in the third quarter
compared to last year. We again had more employees in the training pipeline and more individuals working on capital
projects, including positive train control. Base workforce levels also increased, driven by volume growth and the
impact of additional crews needed to manage through the drought-related speed restrictions in the South. In July, we
indicated that our full-year workforce would be up roughly 1,500 employees, depending on second half volume levels.
Currently, we still are on track with those projections.
Now turning to other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% or $41 million to
$506 million. Higher contract service expense was the biggest year-over-year driver. Locomotive and freight car
maintenance costs were up also compared to 2010. In addition, crew lodging and transportation costs increased with the
growth in volume levels and weather-related challenges. Other expenses came in at $207 million, slightly better than
our guidance of $215 million to $225 million, primarily due to lower personal injury expense. Versus 2010, other
expenses were up $29 million. Higher property taxes and increased costs for damaged equipment and freight drove
expenses up in the quarter versus 2010. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect the other expense category to be
similar to the third quarter results, again assuming no unusual items.
Slide 28 summarizes third quarter expenses for the remaining two categories. Depreciation expense increased 10% or
$36 million to $408 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. Increased capital spending and higher
depreciation associated with hauling more gross ton-miles drove the increase. We should expect a similar rate of
increase in the fourth quarter as well. Third quarter equipment and other rents expense totaled $293 million, essentially
flat with last year. Higher container lease and short-term freight car rental expenses were offset by lower locomotive
lease expense.
Bringing revenue and expenses together, Union Pacific's operating ratio illustrates the substantial improvements in
profitability that we've achieved over the last several years. On a reported basis, our operating ratio was 69.1% for the
third quarter of 2011. Ongoing productivity efforts, core pricing gains, and volume growth all contributed to this mark.
Higher fuel prices continue to put pressure on our operating ratio, creating a 1.7 point headwind in the third quarter and
2 points of headwind year to date compared to 2010. However, if you adjust for fuel prices, we still expect to see real
improvement this year in our core operating ratio performance versus last year's all-time record.

Union Pacific's profitability in the third quarter of 2011 also drove record free cash flow after dividends. Growth in
cash from operations more than offset increased capital spending and higher dividend payment. Cash dividends paid in
the year-to-date period of 2011 were up 39% from 2010 levels. We continue to see the benefits of bonus depreciation,
which had a more positive impact on our cash flows in 2011 than in 2010.
Union Pacific's balance sheet remains in excellent shape, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At the end of
the third quarter, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 41.4%. This positions us well in a wide range of economic
scenarios. Our performance is generating strong cash flow, and we are returning that to our shareholders. During the
third quarter, we bought back 4.7 million shares totaling $428 million, up from the second quarter purchases. Year to
date, this takes our total repurchases to over $1 billion. Looking forward, we have nearly 32 million shares remaining
under our current authorization. When you combine our dividend payments and share repurchases this year, we've
returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders. Dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases continue to be key
components of our balanced approach to cash allocation for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
Looking ahead, we see continued opportunities to grow and improve our profitability. As Jack discussed, we're focused
on continued year-over-year volume growth in the fourth quarter. Of course, this assumes that the economy cooperates.
We remain committed to achieving real pricing gains, driven by the increased value of our service, market demand, and
added benefit of competing for and repricing our legacy business. We believe that continued revenue growth and our
ongoing productivity efforts should produce record earnings in 2011, allowing us to reward our shareholders with even
greater returns.
So with that, let me turn it back over to Jim.
James R. Young
Thanks, Rob.
Now, before we open up to questions, I wanted to provide a quick update on the national labor negotiations. As you
know, the United Transportation Union which is the industry's largest union, ratified a new contract earlier this year.
We think the agreement is fair and equitable to both parties. The remaining unions were released from mediation,
which led to the creation of the Presidential Emergency Board. The PEB is scheduled to submit their recommendations
by November 7. In the meantime, the industry remains committed to achieving a negotiated settlement that reflects the
patterns of the UTU agreement. Our employees are critical to the success of this company. We currently enjoy good
working relationships, and we expect that to continue as we move forward through the negotiation process there.
So with that, let's open it up to your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please state your
question.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Yeah, hi, good morning.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Hey, Jim, so if we're looking at this – if it weren't for fuel and the weather stuff, you had an
OR below 68%, and I realize the third quarter is typically your best. But I've got to think that this kind of performance
gives you a much greater conviction in your ability to hit the long-term goals, regardless of kind of how the macro
plays out. Is that sort of fair?

<A - James R. Young>: I think that's very fair.
<Q - William J. Greene>: So we've got a big legacy reprice next year. How does Union Pacific sort of think about
updating that long-term guidance then? Do you have to get there and then you'll address it? Or – we can sort of see
these trends. It's a big year next year.
<A - James R. Young>: Well, Bill, to me, the real wildcard is where do we think the economy is going. If you get
some upside in the economy, obviously we have a greater potential going forward here. We'll stick with our current
guidance. We said 65% to 67% OR, and see how things go. But we're feeling pretty good about the markets, the pricing
we're able to get for the value we're providing, and then efficiency.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Yeah. No, it makes sense. And then just on pricing, fourth quarter pricing, we've been flat
all year. Given that the legacies weigh at the end of the quarter, is that safe to say for 4.5%, that there shouldn't be a big
step-up, or we will actually see the legacy in the fourth quarter?
<A - James R. Young>: Not in fourth quarter. You'll see the impacted legacies in next year.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Okay. So the acceleration comes next year. All right, thank you for the time.
<A - James R. Young>: Thanks, Bill.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company. Please state your question.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Good morning, guys.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Coal volumes were unusually strong in the context of the other Class 1's for the quarter,
particularly Burlington. I was just curious if there's any thoughts on the outperformance. I mean, was it just kind of
where the relative flooding was geographically and you just kind of got the long straw? Or was it some kind of market
share gains, or anything else that sort of impacted the flows during the quarter?
<A - James R. Young>: You know, Peter, the prime difference there was flooding. Clearly BN got hit much harder
than we did. Look at their announcement they had on their capital. That gives you an indication what kind of hit they
had. There wasn't much in terms of share shift at all.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Okay, great. And then the follow-up, with the reprice coming up at the end of fourth quarter,
any perspective on how volume-dependent the potential for yields are as you negotiate that, or as that new contract
goes into effect? Thank you.
<A - James R. Young>: Well, again, the legacy deals that we have negotiated and are currently still negotiating will
carry over, and really you'll see the impact in 2012. I mean, the big spreads in some of these, obviously, are you look at
what happened with our fall-off in intermodal versus the other groups this year. But we've got very good opportunity
next year.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: So you don't feel disadvantaged at all going into that process? The fact that volumes are
much – I mean, the volume growth has really slowed here in the last three years or so.
<A - James R. Young>: No. These are long-term propositions when you look at them. You're making deals that are
many years out, so the assessment is one on what is a value proposition that the UP franchise can offer?
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group. Please state your question.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Just a couple of quick ones. First on the wage and benefit front, can you give us a feel for what
kind of inflation you're looking at over the term of the next contract?
<A - James R. Young>: Rob, go ahead. [indiscernible] (31:19)
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. We're not going to get into the specifics on the contract, Chris. But one thing just to
comment on the overall inflation on the comp and benefits line, again, we said it's about 5.5% this year. We expect that
to moderate as we head into 2012, somewhere more in, call it, the 4%-ish range rather than 5.5%.
<A - James R. Young>: I mean, the UTU deal, if you look at it, it's 17% over five and a half years. So you can kind of
get a feel there in terms of the math.
The real key is healthcare cost, which is – if you look at our contract, [ph] what was put in the tail of the contract
(31:54) there's very little in there in terms of work rules. Where we see the biggest opportunity long term is, again, as
most businesses in America are struggling with, is rising healthcare costs.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then just one on your automotive business. Can you give us an idea of how much
of your auto franchise is with the Japanese OEMs?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We have about 30% with the domestic Big Three and – about 70% with GM/Ford/Chrysler,
and then about 30% with everybody else.

<Q - Michael R. Weinz>: Hey, good morning, it's Michael Weinz in for Tom.
<A - James R. Young>: Hello, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Weinz>: Congratulations on a great quarter.
<A - James R. Young>: Thank you.
<Q - Michael R. Weinz>: I guess to start with, on coal, could you give us the actual stockpile levels? You said that it
was down seven days year-over-year and that you guys had made up 60% of what you had lost in the second quarter.
And is that expected to – is the remainder expected to be made up in fourth?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We'll probably make up the rest of that in the fourth quarter, I would expect. And the other
thing, Michael, I don't have the exact numbers in terms of 59 days versus 52 days, those kinds of deals. But there is a
seven-day differential. I would expect as you look at those numbers – that is the Powder River Basin stockpile situation
– I would expect those tend to probably be more reflective of what's happening with the BN customers, given that they
were more severely impacted. But we should still see fairly solid coal volumes here in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Michael R. Weinz>: Okay. Great. And for the second question, related to head count, you had said that you were
still expecting the 1,500 increase year over year. Is that an end-of-quarter, fourth quarter number? Or average fourth

quarter number?
<A - James R. Young>: End of quarter.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, end of quarter for fourth quarter projection.
<Q - Michael R. Weinz>: So that kind of implies a slight decline from third quarter. Is that related to Texas?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: It is a slight decline, but it's just based on our projection of where volumes – basically it's
what volumes have done here in the back half of the year.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, typically, we reduce head count late in the fourth quarter for seasonal purposes.
<A - James R. Young>: Some of your capital projects.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please state your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Rob, you mentioned the incremental margins and the ability to kind of get a little bit of an
acceleration potentially. Do you need to see the legacy contracts start to roll through? Or is this the type of progress that
you might be able to make in 4Q, assuming that you don't necessarily get hit with another type of weather interruption?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: It's kind of all of the above. But, again, reminder for the fourth quarter alone, we don't
expect to get much additional uptick yield from the legacy. That's mostly going to carry over into 2012. So as we look
in the fourth quarter, it's going to be volume, productivity, ongoing pricing initiatives that are under way. And just,
again, a reminder, for us to hit our long-term guidance of that 65% to 67% full-year operating ratio by 2015, that
implies on an annualized basis, as we look forward, that we'll be in that incremental margin neighborhood of about
50%.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: And [ph] that does (35:32) take into consideration the legacy repricing as we look forward.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Sure. No, that's helpful. And when you think about furloughs, you take a look at the average
number and then what you ended the quarter with. Obviously it picked up a little bit while volumes were starting to
accelerate. How do you think about that number for the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving
the furloughs. Is it just timing issues, or is there something else behind it?
<A - James R. Young>: Lance, you want to deal with furloughs?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, when you think about the fourth quarter and furloughs, what's going to happen is as peak
season starts bleeding off, typically on the TE&Y side, our furloughs will increase. And likewise, as we start getting
frozen out of some parts of the network from a maintenance of way and capital project perspective, we start
furloughing also on the maintenance of way side.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay.
<A - James R. Young>: And, Chris, the big driver here – I mean, the surprise to us – was one on international
intermodal. And if you look across our regions, North, South, and West, the biggest [ph] run to the (36:26) furloughs
was out West, simply because there was very – really a decrease in the international business this year.

the PEB recommendations in the beginning of November. What's the process after that? What do we think about the
timeline going forward after the recommendations come in?
<A - James R. Young>: Well, you've got really another 30-day cooling off. I mean, the key date is around December 7
in terms of when the potential would be there for some action in both parties. So as I said, November 7 is the date that
the PEB recommendations come out. And both parties have to take a look at those recommendation and negotiate from
there.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great. Good morning.
<A - James R. Young>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Lance, that was a great overview on the handling of the drought, and kind of goes back to the
middle of the 2000s when you kind of sat there going through El Paso and Phoenix when you had problems. But it's
great to see how smooth things bounced back now. But when you think about the equipment and status, you kind of
gave the employees furloughs. Can you talk about the equipment side? What have you done on the locomotives part
there? What do you need to do in terms of CapEx? It sounded like you added a bunch of locomotives. What do you
need to do now to get that back – reset to ongoing operations?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So on the locomotive side, as the South continues to come back to normal, you'll see us
being able to bleed off some of that locomotive count and put those back in storage. We're at about 600 units right now.
And as the South gets normal and as volumes from the peak season start dropping off, you'll see that storage number
grow. The reason why we're buying locomotives next year isn't just a volume story. We've got locomotives in the
capital budget next year for a number of reasons. We get a pretty decent return off of them, driven by fuel efficiency
and the fact they're DPU enabled. And that helps us on the train side, productivity side of the story.
And then I think we've talked to you before about Tier 4 requirements, another federal mandate that takes effect in
2015. And purchasing locomotives now is a little bit of a hedge against the fact that the manufacturers of locomotives
do not have, yet, a purchasable locomotive that meets those 2015 guidelines. So there's a little bit of a risk hedge in that
purchase as well.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: And also, can you talk about how the progress – I guess maybe, Rob, also on the progress of
the UMAX domestic network? What have you done in terms of containers? And how has that progressed with CSX
since you've rolled that out?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We're having great success with UMAX. We're feeling good about it. Like I said, our
domestic intermodal volumes right now, the last year, we actually got a record in terms of domestic intermodal during
kind of the second phase of peak season. So if you think about peak season in terms of international phase goes first
and then domestic, so now we're in the domestic side. We're 6% to 7% stronger than we were a year ago. And it looks
like that's going to probably continue on at least for the next several weeks. So we've made some great product
offerings with the CSX. We've been running really well in terms of our on-time delivery despite things like the floods
and some of those kinds of things. So we're well positioned.

<A - James R. Young>: Yeah. We've got good programs with both, NS and CSX. There are no domestic containers
stored today -
<A - John J. Koraleski>: That's right.
<A - James R. Young>: – on the UP side. I think the other thing you want to keep in mind on demand here, the sales
inventory ratios are still very, very tight. And as you see in the domestic trucking sector, capacity's pretty tight. So it'll
be interesting to see how the rest of this year plays out given tight inventories.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And we're pretty balanced in terms of the number of containers that we have in both
programs. So it's a nice opportunity for us.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: So, Jack, how should we read that, though? If you said that the domestic – obviously nothing
in storage – and we've moved into the second part of peak, and you're seeing that used, but yet the international remains
so weak because of the short and brief peak season. Is that just still all truck conversion that's still going on out West?
Or how do you read the differential?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, that's a really good question, because when you look at what's happening in
inventory levels, if you look at inventory-to-sales ratios, you're not really seeing any improvement. They are still
historically low. So you're seeing a lot of product that's moving distribution centers to stores, a lot of what I would
describe as more like spot purchases of retails. And we are seeing a lot of truck conversion in that process. So that's
been a very strong growth arm for us in terms of that highway conversion.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital. Please state your question.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning, Gary.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Wanted to see if I could ask a couple of Jack on the export side. First, I saw recently that
Russia was – and not a formal ban like last time – but limiting some of the exports. Wondered what your thoughts were
on that, if it was factored into your thought process about volume declines – continued volume declines in the grain
export business in the fourth quarter.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, Gary. We are looking – last year we had a record fourth quarter. We had all kinds of
good things happening. We had the Russian drought, we had the Ukraine banning the export of their grain. And other
problems around the world. The whole situation has turned around differently for us now. So Russia is very strong in
terms of their production capability. We have tough comps. So we're actually expecting that we're going to see
somewhere in the neighborhood of like a 5% to 6% decline in our export grain (sic) [agricultural product] movements
in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Okay. And then I wondered, too, if the iron ore exports that you were referring to were
higher-rated business than what you might see in the rest of the industrial book? Because pricing there looked solid,
and there are some who are wondering if maybe some of the exports to China and of iron ore will cool off a little bit
looking forward.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, our book of business for export iron ore is priced well. We're very comfortable
with our profitability and the reinvestability of that business. But that's also true of our other business in our industrial
products world.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: You got some pretty good visibility on those exports for the fourth quarter?

Page 13 of 21
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. We think it's going to continue to be strong – or we're going to continue to move. It's
always kind of one of those deals where you have to watch China very carefully because they consume, I think, about
half of the world trade in iron ore today. So should they decide to change course here relatively quickly, we've seen
how that can happen. But right now we're looking for a solid fourth quarter.
<A - James R. Young>: Gary, the other thing to keep in mind while we've got some of our international markets pretty
hot right now, as Jack mentioned, within the industrial products group, on the domestic side, we have markets there that
are still 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% below where they were in the peak. Anything related to construction is 40%, 50% below.
So while we've got some markets that are hot that could cool off a little bit, you've got others that are – barely alive, I
guess, is maybe the best description. So.
<Q - Gary Lee Chase>: Okay, guys. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan. Please state your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - James R. Young>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So with the upcoming legacy opportunities, I'm wondering how much of that business is
already locked in with new contracts. I guess I'm trying to understand if there's a rough percent of the business you feel
confident that you're going to keep.
<A - James R. Young>: Jack, you want to take that one?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We're making good progress on all of our legacy negotiations as it stands right now. And
we're very comfortable that we're working hard to retain all of that business.
<A - James R. Young>: Hey, Scott. We have lost some of our business. You look at repricing these legacy deals. I
mean, we're competing with the other guys, and in some cases, we've lost some of the business.
And the key is we're setting some minimum returns that we look at. And if we can't get it, I'm willing to walk.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So in the cases in the past where you've lost a legacy deal, obviously, there's a volume and a
revenue hit. But does there tend to be much of an operating income loss from losing a legacy deal?
<A - James R. Young>: Well, in the short term, any time you take out a pretty good chunk of revenue, we can't get
cost out fast enough, so you do take some pressure in your operating income.
On the other hand, though, we can redeploy some assets. You think about locomotives. Some of our track capacities.
Pretty generic when you look at the way products move. We also are able to take advantage – we have a continuing
attrition on the workforce side. We're going to lose about 4,000 employees a year for the foreseeable future. So you can
fairly quickly adjust your workforce.
But I've got to tell you, the first quarter you lose that revenue, it usually has a negative impact on the bottom line.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Right. I guess I was just thinking that these are probably lower margin, if any margin, business.
<A - James R. Young>: Well, they're clearly – on some of these, we are losing money on every carload we handle,
from a long-term variable cost perspective. So I mean, that's why the sense of urgency and why it's so important that
we've got to get these margins up in this business.
So you're right. In that context, longer term, it isn't quite as big of a hit. But it's still a little bit of a hit.

<Q - Scott H. Group>: Great. That's all fine. Just second question. As you prepare for continued slow growth, if that's
what happens, what should that mean for head count next year? I'm wondering when you expect the head count growth
and the volume growth to come more in line. Is that an early 2012 event, or not till late 2012?
<A - James R. Young>: Well, long term, what we would expect to see is – again, let's assume you've got positive
growth year over year. You will see head count increase, but not at the same rates.
We got ourselves caught a little bit this year that we have a lot of people in hiring. The international intermodal came in
negative. So we got caught a little bit with surplus resources.
But again, long term, you won't see the same kind of growth in volume and head count.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And Jim, I mean, the other thing that's going to normalize is the delta – just the pure delta and
the training pipeline, which we've talked about several quarters. And the pure delta and capital head count there.
<A - James R. Young>: Now, keep in mind, we're also hiring for PTC right now. That doesn't have anything to do
with volume. So you've got to separate out a little bit.
Now at the end of the day, we've got to recover that cost in the business. There's no excuses. But where you look at
kind of the pure volume-related numbers, we should continue to see productivity every year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: When do you think we normalize?
<A - James R. Young>: You know, I think you're going to see that probably fourth quarter or first quarter next year.
Get a little bit better comps on our labor and our force levels.

<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: There's been a lot of talk about natural gas substitution at power plants in the East, and also the
impact of the new EPA regulations that are going into effect next year. Is there any risk to your coal business next year
or the year after from these two sources?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, John. There's always some risk to that because of the grid and how it plays.
Most of our utilities – our utilities are fairly modern and productive. So in the overall distribution of things, we don't
have that many that we see as potentially shutting down. But any time that any new utility is being constructed or
things like that, certainly with natural gas hanging in there in the $3 to $4 range, it's a pretty attractive alternative to
building a coal plant. But I think we're going to be okay next year in our coal business.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you. And then just on the NIT League's proposed reciprocal switching idea that is now
sitting before the STB, do you think that gets any traction at all, even as a test case?
<A - James R. Young>: You know, we'll have to see. I mean, we're – obviously have made our comments in terms of
– I mean it's access. You can call it whatever you want to. And I think we've been consistent in our message that any
time you introduce some kind of artificial competition, which it is, there can be a consequence in our growth and
capital. So we'll see what happens in terms of ultimately what comes out of the STB.

<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Was curious, just an update, given the [ph] backdrop of – backtracking (50:26) volume
growth that we've seen here, where do you feel you are right now with the network capacity? And given the operating
leverage you guys are able to generate in the quarter, even with low volumes, curious what a nice uptick in volumes
would look like and how you'd be able to handle that.
<A - James R. Young>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. We feel very good about the amount of capacity we've gotten in fixed infrastructure.
Once again, our peak carloading month was north of 200,000 seven-day carloads. Now, as we've continued to invest in
the right areas in the network, we've substantially improved the service product that we have in comparison to what we
delivered during that 200,000-plus month.
But as we look forward, with the capital program that we've got in place or planned for, and the way that the network is
operating, we feel very good about the amount of capacity that we've got in fixed assets right now.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Are we talking 10 to 15, 15 to 20? In terms of being able to handle additional room?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Justin, it's very dependent on where that growth occurs and how quickly it comes on. But in
terms of any reasonable estimate of what we think is going to be happening as we look forward, we are very well
situated to be able to continue to provide excellent service and handle the growth.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Great. And just a follow-up question. Was curious, you called out on the chemical side
the great growth that you guys are seeing off a small base, in terms of crude opportunity in the Bakken and Eagle

Can you give us a sense of what kind of indications you're getting? This is, I'm assuming, unit train business. Pretty
profitable stuff. Where's the growth there for that business? And how long of a ramp do we have in front of us for that?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, overall, Justin, I think the growth potential for the business is excellent. I mean,
the primary play we're seeing right now is Bakken, but Eagle Ford is just starting to come in on our railroad. And so
you're right. It's positioned well from a profitability point of view.
Rail actually provides some great flexibility for those customers that basically doesn't tie them into a single destination
on a pipeline. So even as pipelines get built and developed, we continue to think that for the foreseeable future, rail's
going to have a play in this marketplace, and it's going to be a solid growth opportunity for Union Pacific.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: How does the profitability of that business compare to coal unit trains?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Depends on contract to contract. But it's solid, profitable. It meets our reinvestable criteria,
and we're very happy with it.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
<A - James R. Young>: Okay, Justin.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Newcrest. Please state your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: As we sit here with sort of an uncertain economic outlook, wondered if you could just
talk about the cost levers that you could pull in the event that volumes came in slower than expected? And just
comment on the extent to which it's more difficult to adjust to a small volume decline versus the kind of big declines
we saw during the financial crisis.
<A - James R. Young>: Well, Cherilyn, if you look back at the – I think a good model to look at what happened when
we had the – in 2008, early 2009 when you had a fall-off in business. Now, that was pretty substantial. You recall. I
think second quarter of '09, we were down 20%, 25% in volume.
We have the opportunity, as I'd said earlier, that we're losing about 4,000 employees a year through attrition. What
happens – and even in a small fall-off in volume – we'll try to take advantage, where we can, of that attrition. If that
means we slow down hiring, which is what we have done here on the Western part of our region, we can try to respond
as quickly as possible.
When it gets into locomotives and capacity, things like that, obviously, in the short term, you're not going to be able to
do much, other than put some in storage. But again, it – a short-term blip either down or up, you're not going to get as
much response. The question is, if you see this thing turning down here and you start looking two, three, four, five
quarters, you'll see us being able to take more advantage of taking costs out.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: And what indicators are you guys relying on to assess the business at this stage?
<A - James R. Young>: Well, we start with our customers' perspectives. We're very close to our customers, trying to
understand where they're making investments, where they're putting capacity in. There's long lead times on that. And so
far, it's still very strong. When we look at – in several of these groups here.
At the end of the day, though, we look every morning at what were loadings yesterday. And a pretty intense run
through the business daily. And if we see things turn off sharply, we will respond.
You try to be as proactive as you can, but nobody has perfect vision to the future here.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thank you. That's all my questions.
<A - James R. Young>: Okay, Cherilyn.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please state your question.
<Q - David Vernon>: Hi, could we maybe talk a little bit about the domestic intermodal yield management efforts?
What kind of business is actually leaving the network, and how that pricing discussion is going, and what's kind of the
runway that you look at on that intermodal repricing?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Any business that you see right now leaving the network is being replaced on a fairly strong
basis by truck conversions.
So for instance, if you just think about our little Streamline subsidiary did 80,000 moves last year. It's growing 20%.
84% of that business in the third quarter is coming off the highway. So highway conversion is more than making up for

anything that we lose for us in terms of our yield diversions.
And we're particularly seeing that now in the third quarter. Originally, in the early part of the year, we were having a
little bit of a start-up issue with our MCP program, just because it was something new and different. And the idea of
making a commitment was something that some customers weren't all that excited about.
But I think what they're seeing right now is we're doing such a great job of that. And they're already starting to talk
about signing up for next year and giving us some strong indications that, with our service performance and the way we
are meeting our commitments, it'll be a solid path forward for us. So we're actually feeling quite good about that.
<Q - David Vernon>: Does that mean that the full 6% year-over-year decline was international import-export then?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, actually -
<Q - David Vernon>: Or it was actually a little worse, and there was a domestic offset then?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: When you see our third quarter results, if you looked into our third quarter results, our
international business was down 12%. Our domestic business was up 2%. But that 2% is a weak start to the quarter that
built to a relatively strong end to the quarter. So the 2% isn't really – like I said, right now we're running 6%, 7%, 8%
better than a year ago.
<Q - David Vernon>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC. Please state your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.
<A - James R. Young>: Good morning, Walter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So my first question here is just – just for Lance, perhaps – on your train sizes trending very
nicely here. Ticking up each year.
Can you talk to us a bit about what you see average train lengths being ultimately, once you re-equip your fleet with
your current targets? Both on manifest, I guess, and to put into context intermodal train lengths as well?
And touch a little bit on DP, and what percentage of your fleet is currently equipped DP, compared to where your
current targets are for percentage of your fleet equipped with distributive power.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Okay. First on train sizes, the short answer is we've got plenty of opportunity to keep growing.
I think that intermodal number this quarter was something like 170-plus. Depending on the intermodal lane, that can
easily reach 200, 250, and we've probably got some lanes where it could go north of 250.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Wow.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So we've got plenty of upside there.
On the manifest side of the world, we've got upside from the high 80s number that we are recording right now.
And when it comes to DPU strategy, every incremental road unit that we're purchasing at this point forward is
DPU-equipped. And all of our current DPU locomotives are fully utilized. I want to say somewhere in the 60%
ballpark of our traffic right now is DPU'd. And that's just going to grow as we look forward.
And in terms of the total percentage of road fleet that's DPU'd, I can't answer that off the top of my head, but it's a fair
portion. It's a pretty substantial portion.

<A - James R. Young>: Hey, Walter. Keep something in mind here, though. We could significantly drive train size up,
if we sacrifice service. I mean, the challenge that the operating team has is to run as efficient train size as they can, but
meet aggressive service targets. And so that's the balance you have to wrestle with here.
I'm telling you, service pays off big time. We're seeing that in the market when we're redoing these deals and the value
that's there.
So we've got to always keep both of those in mind. Train size and the service commitment.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And that is an interesting point, in terms of that being the bottleneck. Your infrastructure is
not the bottleneck. Your sidings are long enough now to handle 200- to 250-car length trains? Is that a fair statement?
<A - James R. Young>: No, we still have opportunities on capital. Particularly, you look down in the South that we're
struggling with today, that we can improve the productivity and efficiency there.
Lance, you want to add more on that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure, yeah. It's just very dependent, again, on the corridor and the specific route you're talking
about. Although again, our current capital plan, long term and near term, takes that into account, where we anticipate
growth is going to be happening. And we've got a solid capital plan to enable continued productivity and service
improvements.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. That's great. Second question here is just sort of a minor one, Jack. Would you be able
to quantify for us the percentage of your book that is currently legacy, how much you think of that is going to get
repriced in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the estimated lift? You've talked about a 100 basis point opportunity in
average core pricing lift. Is that still the case?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I'm trying to look at my chart here.
<A - James R. Young>: Walter, you've stumped us here. We're – go ahead, Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Walter, I would refer you back to the slide that you've seen us present in the past – we didn't
have it in our deck today – that shows -
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: – the breakout of legacy by year. In 2012, as a reminder, we said it was about $300 million
worth of business up for renegotiation in our legacy book in 2012. And we break it out in multiple years beyond that.
But we haven't provided specific guidance in terms of what the uplift will be, other than if you look backwards, we've
said we've gotten about 2 points of yield annually from the benefit of repricing legacy. We haven't given guidance as to
what that uplift's going to be going forward.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And if I remember correctly, I think 2011 was the bulk – was the biggest year out of
the next three or four years.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. 2011 was about $750 million, which was the back-end loaded comment that we've
made.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Right. Okay. That's all my questions. Thanks, very much, guys.

<Q - Matt Troy>: Thanks. I'm sorry; someone just sent me something. The export coal story has primarily been one
dominated by the Eastern rails. We've recently seen some concerns about cooling export demand, which I think any
sane person would expect off this year's peak. But we continue to think it's a multi-secular, multi-year secular run.
You've got a couple terminals that have been announced or proposed on the West Coast. I'm just wondering – Gateway
Pacific, Millennium Bulk Port of Morrow, St. Helen's, Grays Harbor, Coos Bay – which projects have you been
approached about or are you in discussions with? And when do you see them potentially coming to fruition so you guys
can move some export coal off the West Coast?
<A - James R. Young>: Jack?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Matt, we're interested particularly in the ones up in the Longview, Washington,
area, the one – I think it's called Elambra Energy (sic) [Ambre Energy] (1:03:17), the Australian company.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yeah.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: That one has some real opportunity for us. And virtually any of the ones that we can access.
We're also looking at some Gulf Coast opportunities and even some possibilities moving down to Mexico. So I think
the big question for us, particularly on the West Coast and the domestic U.S. marketplace, is whether or not those
construction projects will actually take place and whether the EPA and the environmentalists and things – I mean, they
have put a lot of roadblocks up in terms of getting those projects approved and under construction. So that's the thing
we're watching most right at the moment.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Got it. Second question, and last question, would be just on the exports again. Obviously, imports
were disappointing this peak season. Was thinking more on the export side.
You've seen some fairly robust numbers out of the Port of L.A., I think, in the last three months, up north of 20% in
terms of full-box exports out of L.A. Are you seeing any of that business? And could you just maybe clarify if you are?
What is it that you're moving to port that's going the other way?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, we're moving the iron ore business. We're moving a lot of export soda ash,
export fertilizers. And then in the boxes themselves, we're seeing everything from [ph] DDGs (1:04:37) to grain.
There's been some proposals – well, scrap paper is also a big item. There's been some proposals for commodities, even
like iron ores, as a potential to go back, just about anything that'll fit in a box and that's reasonably possible are things
that a lot of the companies are looking at to take advantage of that excess capacity.
<Q - Matt Troy>: So fair to say that it's a lot of different businesses and a lot of active discussions at present?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Absolutely.
<Q - Matt Troy>: All right. Thanks for the time.
<A - James R. Young>: Thanks, Matt.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose. Please state your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions. In terms of maybe not legacy business left to be
repriced, but what percent of your book of business was repriced, say, from December 2008 through maybe the first
quarter of 2009?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Jason, when you look at it, there's 60% or 70% of our business – no. There's about 60% of
our business that either moves under tariff or moves in one-year letter quotes. So all of that gets repriced every year.
And then on an ongoing basis, when you look at our multi-year contracts, this year is a little bit of a larger group than
what we've seen, but the number just right off the top of my head is something – in the past 12 months is going to be
somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion.

<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: $2.6 billion. Okay, thanks, that's good color.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: That would include both the legacy and the non-legacy.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. Fantastic. When I'm looking at, obviously, your domestic utility business, the question
was asked if any of the regulations actually could actually hurt you. I'm going to ask it the other way. Can any of them
actually help you? Because, obviously, the CASPR regulations – they've changed a little bit over time. But we've been
hearing that some of the [ph] Eastern (1:06:30) utility buyers might have being – held off a little bit of buying some
thermal. Do you think they could actually start changing the bases they purchase from going forward?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, it could. It could be a positive for us. It just depends on how quickly the
evolution takes place and what it's playing. One of the things we're seeing right now is actually kind of the side benefit
of some of those regulations, is the potential for moving either limestone or trona as a scrubbing agent to help meet
some of those. So when faced with kind of a long-term decision, the quickest and most immediate thing might be to
just put in a quick scrubbing solution that doesn't cost quite as much like the trona manufacturers offer to the utilities.
And that turns out to be a nice piece of business for us.

<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: Hi, it's actually Kanchana Pinnapureddy in for Jeff. Just had a question – if you
could talk about some of the changes that you're seeing at the ports of call on the West Coast and if you're seeing a net
benefit from increased containers being dropped off in Oakland versus Los Angeles and Long Beach?
<A - James R. Young>: [ph] Jack? (1:07:44)
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, we're not really seeing any major shifts or changes, actually. And probably this
isn't a good time for us to really see a lot of those, because there's plenty of capacity everywhere. Volume levels are
below what they were a year ago in the third quarter. So we're not seeing any dramatic shift taking place.
<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: And then one more question. Of the 7% increase in derailments per train miles, how
much of that was related to weather and the heat and the drought?
<A - James R. Young>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, some was related to the heat and the drought in Texas, clearly. A lot of very low-value
train derailments, track caused, in yards and terminals. And so there was a little bit of an impact there as well.
