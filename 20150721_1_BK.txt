Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Valerie. And welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Our results reflect the successful
execution of our strategic priorities to achieve the three-year targets we shared on investor day. We are growing our
earnings, investing in next generation operating platforms and risk management controls, attracting new clients, and
improving the long-term value of our firm for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.
Turning to earnings, earnings per share were $0.73 or $0.77 per share after adjusting for the previously announced
litigation expense and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year.
Now, focusing on our year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis. Total revenue was up 3% as we saw strength in
Asset Servicing, Global Collateral Services and Clearing, and improvement in our market sensitive businesses. Our
Markets Group, in particular, had another excellent quarter, helping to drive growth in Investment Services and the
improvement in our return on tangible common equity.
Net interest revenue was also a strong contributor to results this quarter. Total expenses were down 1%. And we
delivered more than 460 basis points of positive operating leverage, and improved our pre-tax operating margin to 33%
by executing on our revenue growth initiatives and through continued expense control. Our return on tangible common
equity in the quarter increased to 22%. And we continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders by returning
more than $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.
Now, looking at our progress against our strategic priorities. Our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We
are laser focused on leveraging our firm's capabilities to strengthen and expand our existing client relationships and
selectively building new ones. Investment Services revenues benefited from the areas where we've been investing, that
is Asset Servicing, Global Collateral Services and Clearing. Now, the investments we are making in strategic
technologies, platforms and applications are clearly paying off, and our solutions are resonating with clients. We won a
significant middle office contract to service $770 billion in assets for a prominent investment manager. That win was
part of a strong new business quarter for Investment Services. Now, while our costs will increase in the short run as we
prepare to onboard this new business, our platforms are designed to be leveraged by a broader client base and to take
advantage of our economies of scale.
Foreign exchange revenue was also up strongly year-over-year as we continue to benefit from both higher volatility and
volumes captured to the expansion of our services.
Now, we also strive to deliver a great client experience, which is critical to driving revenues. Third party recognition of
our capabilities continued. We took the top spot in this year's Global Investor/ISF Global Custody Survey in EMEA in
single-custody weighted categories. We also topped the weighted rankings for clients with assets under management
greater than $3 billion in the global, EMEA and Asia Pacific categories. We were named the Best ETF Service
Provider in the Americas for the ninth year in a row by exchangetradedfunds.com. And we were named Custodian of
the Year for Latin America in the Custody Risk Americas Award, which recognized the growth and quality of the
custody service we launched in Brazil less than three years ago.
Now, turning to Investment Management, we continue to make progress on several key initiatives. We're already
seeing positive results from expanding our reach to the U.S. retail investors as our investment strategies are becoming
more visible on third-party platforms. In addition, we are connecting with our Pershing financial advisory clients. And
in fact, the private banking growth we've seen in Wealth Management with Pershing clients is a powerful example of
our ability to leverage the synergy between Investment Services and Investment Management for the benefit of our
clients. And our initiative to grow our Wealth Management presence in attractive new locations is beginning to add to
our revenue growth there as well.

Now, switching to asset management, our LDI strategies continue to see strong inflows as do inflows into alternative
assets, continuing the trend of the last few quarters. Both are areas where we are working to expand our presence. Now,
while we've made significant progress on those fronts, it was not enough to offset the industry-wide impact of active
institutional equity outflows. In fact, while we had a total net long-term outflows of $15 billion, two non-U.S.
institutional clients drove $20 billion of the outflows as they liquidated holdings to address cash needs and changes in
their investment strategies.
On the investment performance front, during the quarter, the strength of our capabilities was recognized through a
number of awards. Insight Investment was named LDI Manager of the Year and Fixed Income Manager of the Year;
and Newton, the SRI provider of the year by the European Pensions Awards. Insight was also named LDI Manager of
the Year for the third consecutive year by the CIO European Innovation Awards. And ARX was named top Brazilian
manager by the Standard & Poor's for the fifth consecutive year.
Now, our second broad priority is executing on our business improvement process. Our success on this front is
reflected in lower expenses in nearly all categories. We are making continued headway on reducing structural costs and
risk, while improving the productivity and quality, and it's clearly showing up in our results. From a structural
standpoint, we continue to optimize our business mix. We shut down our Central Securities Depository and began to
reposition our UK transfer agency business because they simply did not meet our return criteria. We made progress in
streamlining our Investment Management operations in APEC, and also made the tough decision to shut down our
separately managed account offering for now. It's a solution that we were really excited about, and we're not ruling out
the possibility of reestablishing it down the road. But when we didn't gain the traction in the market that we expected,
we held to our discipline.
Now, during the quarter, we renegotiated certain vendor contracts and made progress in reducing data storage costs and
our real estate footprint as we continued to improve the profitability of our business.
Now, our third priority centers on being a strong, safe and trusted counterparty. We reduced and simplified our
counterparty exposure by exiting the derivatives business. We practically eliminated the intraday credit risk within the
U.S. tri-party repo market, and we submitted our fourth annual global resolution plan to the FDIC and the Fed.
Now, we are one of the few banks that proposed a tried and proven resolution strategy involving the use of a bridge
bank run by the FDIC, something we can do because of our inherently smaller and more liquid balance sheet versus
other G-SIBs. Now, to be able to deliver on this plan, we have made commitments to fund more than 30 initiatives over
the next two years. It's expensive, but it will make us even more resilient company in the future.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We are focused on ensuring our
capital ratios are compliant with evolving regulatory requirements.
Now, during the quarter, we successfully issued $1 billion in preferred stock, which further strengthened our capital
position and enabled us to repurchase more than 800 million in shares and distribute almost 200 million in dividends.
And our fifth priority is to attract and retain and develop top talents. During the quarter, we added talent in Corporate
Trust to position us to capitalize on the increased debt issuance market and regain some momentum there.
We added staff to support our strategic growth initiatives, and we also continue to insource the people who power our
technology, productivity, cost and speed to market initiatives.
So as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our three-year investor day goals and to deliver even
more value to our clients.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, my commentary will follow the financial highlights
document. So if we start with page 7, that details our non-GAAP or what we call our operating results for the quarter.

As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.77, up 24% from the year ago quarter. Revenue in the second quarter was approximately
3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, and that reflected growth across most of our business, with particular strength
in Asset Servicing, especially Global Collateral Services, as well as in Clearing Services, foreign exchange, and our
financing-related activities.
Expenses were down 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as our business improvement process and the stronger
U.S. dollar are driving lower expenses in almost every category. Our ability to grow revenue and control expenses
resulted in more than 460 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year.
As you can see on page 6 of the earnings release, the pound was down 9%, and that's on a year-over-year basis versus
the dollar, and the euro was down 19%. We've estimated that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced both our revenue and
expenses by approximately 300 basis points, and had a slightly negative impact on net income.
Now, the business that was most impacted was Investment Management, while currency had less of an impact on
Investment Services. We expect the strength of the U.S. dollar to continue to impact Investment Management more
than Investment Services since about 43% of Investment Management revenue comes from outside the U.S. and is
non-dollar, while the impact to the overall company is expected to be nominal.
Income before income taxes was up 14% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax
margin increased approximately 300 basis points to 33%, and that's from 30% in the second quarter of last year. Return
on tangible common equity was over 22%.
Now, page 8 shows consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset Servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2%
sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth, especially in Global Collateral Services,
and net new business partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects organic
growth and seasonally higher securities lending revenue. Clearing services fees were up 6% year-over-year and 1%
sequentially. The increase from the second quarter of 2014 was driven by higher mutual fund and asset-based fees,
clearance revenue and custody fees.
Issuer service fees were up 1% year-over-year and also 1% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher depository
receipts results, partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees. As we have noted previously, the Corporate Trust
revenue decline has stabilized and we actually are encouraged by the current pipeline.
Treasury service fees were up 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher
payment volumes, while the sequential increase reflects the fact that there were three additional business days in the
quarter.
Second quarter Investment Management and performance fees were down 1% year-over-year, but on a constant
currency basis, they were up 5%, and that was reflecting higher equity market values, the impact of the first quarter
Cutwater acquisition, which was partially offset by lower performance fees. We had performance fees of $20 million
compared to a very strong $29 million last year.
FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 44% year-over-year and down 18% sequentially. FX
revenue of $181 million is up 40% year-over-year, 17% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects the higher
volatility, higher volumes, and higher DR-related activity. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the benefits of
unusually high market volatility in the first quarter of this year.
Financing-related fees were $58 million compared to $44 million in the year ago quarter, and $40 million in Q1. Both
increases reflect higher fees related to secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo
activity. Now these fees probably won't grow beyond Q3, as we expect clients to moderate their usage or possibly find
alternative sources for this financing.
Investment and other income of $104 million was $38 million lower year-over-year and $44 million higher
sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other revenue, equity investment revenue and
asset-related gains, and that was partially offset by higher leasing gains. The sequential increase reflects the higher

lease residual gains, offset by lower seed capital.
Looking ahead to future quarters, given the sale of Wing Hang and some other actions that we've taken, we expect
investment and other income on average to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. However, we would expect
there to be some volatility in this particular line item.
Page 9 shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that will help explain our underlying performance.
You can see the 5% year-over-year AUM increase and the $15 billion of long-term outflows during the quarter. And as
Gerald noted, while we in the industry have been experiencing outflows of equities over the last few quarters, we have
seen a few very large non-U.S. institutional clients both rebalancing and liquidating parts of their portfolio, which has
magnified the impact this quarter. Partially offsetting the activity – the active equity outflows were flows into higher
fee alternative assets and LDI, a trend we've seen for the last few quarters, and it's a been a continued focus for our
business, and will be for our business going forward. At this time, the higher proportion of active equity outflows
versus the alternative in LDI inflows has resulted in a lower fee mix.
Our Wealth Management business continues to grow, benefiting from our expansion initiative. We have now
completed the investment phase of this initiative and are beginning to see revenue growth, as well as an associated
increase in loans and deposits.
Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page 10. You can see that assets under custody and administration at
quarter end were $28.6 trillion, that's up $100 billion year-over-year, and that's reflecting higher market values, organic
growth, and it was partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar.
On a linked quarter, AUC/A was in line with last quarter. Adjusted for currency, year-over-year growth would have
been roughly 3%. We had estimated total new assets under custody in our administration business wins in the second
quarter of $1 trillion. Now, that does not include a recently announced expansion of services to an existing client that
has about $140 billion in assets, a deal which closed after the quarter end. We are pleased to see that our investments in
our services to clients have been paying off and it's being recognized in the marketplace.
The market value of securities on loans at period end was up slightly year-over-year. Average loans and deposits were
both up significantly. Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 8%. All of our clearing
metrics recorded nice gains, DARTS volumes in particular, and the net decline in sponsored DR program reflects our
focus on exiting low activity programs.
If you turn to net interest revenue on page 11, you will see that NIR in a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 8%
versus the year ago quarter and 7% from Q1. We benefited year-over-year from a shift out of cash and into loans and
securities, and an increase in deposits. Nice to see a lower interest expense incurred on those deposits, and also, the
positive impact of interest rate hedging activities.
The yield on interest earning assets decreased 2 basis points year-over-year, while the yield on interest bearing deposits
decreased 4 basis points. The decline in the deposit yield was driven by our efforts to charge clients on
euro-denominated deposits primarily.
The net interest margin for the quarter was 100 basis points, 2 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 3 basis
points higher than the prior quarter, driven by the reduction of rates paid on interest bearing deposits.
On page 12, you will see the noninterest expense on an adjusted basis decreased by 1% year-over-year and 1%
sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories except business development. The
lower expense primarily reflects a favorable impact of the strong dollar and the benefit of our business improvement
process.
Total staff expense was essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the dollar, lower head count, and the
impact of curtailing our U.S. defined benefit plan, partially offset by higher performance driven incentives. The
year-over-year decline in head count reflects the progress of our business improvement process. The sequential increase
of 200 employees reflects insourcing and revenue initiatives, as well as new hires to support new business in Asset
Servicing and Corporate Trust, and strategic platform investments in asset manager, alternative asset manager and

global wealth programs.
Our occupancy costs have not risen as we expected. Excuse me, the additional costs, such as paying double rent for our
move out of One Wall Street, have been offset by a number of factors, including the strength of the dollar, lower utility
costs, we sublet more vacant space, and the reduction of maintenance cost. We are on target to vacate One Wall Street
before the end of the third quarter and expect an improvement in the occupancy line beginning in the first quarter of
2016.
Now, turning to capital on page 13. With respect to our capital ratios, as we highlighted in our last earnings call, we
adopted the new consolidations accounting standard during the second quarter, which required a retrospective adoption
to January 1, thus requiring us to revise our Q1 reported numbers. The adoption resulted in a benefit to Q1 of about 75
basis points, increasing it to 9.9%. The Q2 2015 ratio is flat at 9.9.
A few notes about the quarter, as you'll see in our release, our effective tax rate was 23.7%, 1.4% lower due to the
income statement presentation of Investment Management funds. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate was 25%.
Also in the earnings release on page 11 are some investment securities portfolio highlights. You will see that – I'm
sorry, I'm losing my voice here. You'll see net unrealized pre-tax gain on portfolio was $752 million, ended up with a
hit to capital of about $300 million.
Now, I would like to factor in a few points about the second half of the year. Third quarter earnings are generally
impacted by seasonal – I'll turn it to you.
Gerald L. Hassell
How about I turn it over to Izzy.
Izzy Dawood
Thanks, Todd. Just following on, on third quarter earnings. As you're aware, third quarter earnings are generally
impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market-related revenues, particularly foreign exchange,
Global Collateral Services and securities lending, offset by seasonally higher activities in DRs. We see expenses
coming in flat to slightly down to 2014 for the full year, which would entail an increase in the run rate in remaining
quarters, reflecting investment in our strategic platforms, increased regulatory compliance cost and the annual merit
increase that was effective July 1.
[indiscernible] (23:44) revenue is expected to be slightly down to Q2, assuming no change in monetary policy. The full
year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. We anticipate proceeding with our capital plan, enabling
us to return up to $3.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to market conditions
and other factors.
In summary, we are executing against our strategic priorities, we're continuing to improve our bottom line and generate
significant positive operating leverage, and we remain confident in our ability to hit our three-year investor day targets.
With that, on behalf of Todd, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Great. Thanks. Thanks, Izzy, for finishing up. Todd is alive and well, trust me. So, with that – well, he's certainly alive.
With that, why don't we open it up to questions?

At this time we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions.)
One moment, please, speakers, as we wait for the questions. The first question is coming from the line of Luke
Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: So broadly, I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the sustainability of the progress
you've made on expenses and operating margin. I think clearly, some of that's driven by FX translation, but you've now
exceeded the high end of the range of your 30% to 32% longer term operating margin target, and that was in a
normalized environment. I'd say the same for your 20% to 22% [indiscernible] (25:24) target, and we have yet to see
your rates increase. So, at this point, would you feel comfortable revising these targets a bit higher? Have you
considered that at all?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, let me start with that. We do feel good about the progress we're making on our
business improvement process and pulling it through into the income statement, to the bottom line. We are onboarding
some new clients, and there are some upfront costs associated with that. We do have increased regulatory costs that
we're facing in the second half of this year. I think we're going to stick with our guidance of having expenses
essentially flat versus last year. And we're going to work to continue to improve upon that, but we do have some
opportunities to bring on some clients that have some upfront costs associated with it. So we feel good about hitting the
targets that we laid out for investor day. We're within the ranges, and we're going to keep driving forward on meeting
those targets.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Thanks. And then...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Hey, Luke, I would add one thing. We had the benefit of a good revenue mix here, too. So
the higher margin businesses grew faster than we anticipated at investor day.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Right. Okay. And then maybe if you could give us a rough indication of the additional
expenses for the T. Rowe outsourcing mandate you won? And then when do you expect that business to convert and be
reflected in revenue? If you could also maybe talk about whether that deal reflects any change in the trends in the
marketplace for fund accounting, or was that more of a one-off opportunistic deal?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: A couple of questions in there. We will start to – we've already started to incur some of the
expenses associated with T. Rowe as we speak. We're taking on board some of their staff, which we're delighted to do,
so you're seeing some of the upfront costs associated with the onboarding of that business now and you'll see it through
the course of this year. And then you will start to see the revenues kick in towards the end of this year or first part of
next year as we convert over, the assets. We do actually see it as a long-term trend where investment managers, in
general, are really trying to focus on their Investment Management process and less focused on providing – doing mid
office and back office services internally. So we do see it as a long-term trend. We want to be very thoughtful about
which clients we take on, and make sure we're leveraging our platforms and driving profitable revenue growth for
ourselves rather than just taking on anyone at any time. T. Rowe is a fantastic client, it's a great partnership. We worked
on this together for well over a year, and we think we have a good rapport with them and a very similar culture. So we
feel good about this one.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi, thank you. I'm just curious if you can give some sort of summary comment on what
happened to asset sensitivity during the quarter. It's great to see all the growth on balance sheet, both deposits and
loans. I think you were in the process, over the last two quarters, of extending duration a little bit, but if you could just
tie that all together, that would be super.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. Glenn, I'll try to take it, it's Todd. The NIR sensitivity is going to be about flat from
where we were in the first quarter. So we had put a fair amount of securities on late in the first quarter, we got the
benefit of the NIR mostly in the second quarter. And actually, securities at the end of the period were down slightly. So
I think you'll see the asset sensitivity to be basically unchanged where we were in the first quarter.
There's a lot of things that went on with NIR. Actually, the duration of our available for sale account declined slightly,
and we've used the health and maturity account, where the – that's where most of the duration of the assets now is.
About half the risk is in each, so that we can protect the capital account. But we saw a lot of things go on in the quarter.
We saw higher balances; we did see the loan growth that you talked about. We saw a sharp drop in the interest that we
paid on deposits. We also had the benefit that accretion on the non-agency security did not decline as the performance
of those securities increased, so we would have expected that, and we had some hedging gains. So we don't anticipate
that NIR is bumped up to this level. And we don't expect – in fact, we expect it to contract a little bit, unless interest
rates change.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then, curious on, even after the restatements, capital
ratios, let's call it, a full 10%. Your buffer is now officially 100 basis points. Even with a very wide 200 basis point
AOCI buffer on buffer that brings you to right about where you're at now, do you still feel the 11% to 12% is the right
range or could we see that work down over time?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, the binding constraint for us, Glenn, is not the risk-weighted assets, it is the SLR.
So as we build the SLR, we would expect CET1 to grow. So we'll stick with previous guidance.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.

Thank you, speakers. The next question come is coming from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line
is open. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Hey, great. Hello, everyone. I'll try to keep this quick, Todd, to save your voice. So a
couple of follow-ups on NII. A, could you just define the hedging gains to kind of get us a cleaner run rate for NII for
the quarter to think for the third quarter? And then, just kind of bigger picture question, when you continue to see
growth in your deposits, maybe a couple of comments on where do you guys think it's coming from, and again, do you
still think that there's not a ton of room to reinvest them into securities alone, so this kind of a positive mix shift in the
balance sheet that we've seen from you guys over the last couple of quarters, is probably [ph] fully in the (31:46) run
rate. Is that a fair way to summarize the NII picture?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think the answer to your last question is, yes, I think that's a fair way to summarize
it. In terms of the hedging gains, accretion had been contracting at about $3 million to $5 million a quarter, so it didn't.
So the combination of accretion and hedging gains is probably in the $10 million ballpark. And we'd expect the balance
sheet to be about flat.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got you. And then just my follow-up on expenses. When – just taking a step back again
when you guys talked about expenses being flat on a year-over-year basis, given the amount of new business you
picked up this quarter and the timing of the onboarding, is it still fair to think that 2015 expenses are going to be kind of
in that $11 billion run rate?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Alex, the guidance we've given, I would say it's going to be flat to slightly down from our
operating expenses in 2014. That does mean the run rate will pick up in the second half for all the items that we

discussed, whether it's the merit increase, the onboarding, we're taking on a couple hundred people soon, to the
regulatory cost that we've been talking about. All in all, we would still, for the full year, expect to be flat. Previously,
guidance was maybe flat to slightly up. We're a little more optimistic, it might be flat to slightly down.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Good morning. First question, just on Investment Management. I appreciate all the color you
gave on the positive traction of your various growth initiatives, but I wanted to get a sense of where you are versus your
plan as far as investment curve goes. And then how should we be thinking about the payoff to the plan laid out at
investor day?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Ashley, it's Curtis Arledge. Could I just ask you what you mean by investment curve? I
want to make sure I understand the question.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: That would be the investment of the margins that you outlined.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah, okay. So, we've – at investor day, we described the investment in our Wealth
Management business, in our U.S. intermediary distribution platforms and some other initiatives. And as Gerald
mentioned, those are actually going quite well. Our Wealth Management expansion is now complete. We've added
about a 50% increase in our sales force, and we've seen revenues that have actually come in above our original plans.
On the U.S. retail side, we've made a number of investments and changes, and our sales there are actually pretty
attractive. We've seen boosts of north of 50% in gross sales in our U.S. retail intermediary platforms, which includes
the real exciting part about being connected to Pershing, because Pershing, obviously, their relationships with financial
advisors is important to that effort as well. And the private banking piece of our initiative, as Gerald also mentioned, is
really starting to work. So we feel pretty good about getting the revenues that came with the investments that we were
making, that we talked about at investor day.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then during the quarter, JPMorgan exited its
third-party broker-dealer clearing business. I just wanted to get your sense on how are you thinking about the business?
Should we expect Pershing to pick up share? And then in a similar vein, how are you thinking about your stake in
ConvergEx?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Brian, why don't you take the JPMorgan, Pershing question.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Okay, sure. So, you can see from Pershing's metrics overall that we have pretty good
momentum in revenue, and in terms of new business pipeline, we're certainly benefiting from JPMorgan's decision to
exit and we're attracting quite a number of those clients to our platform, some of which will be converting – quite a few
of which will be converting to our platform in the third quarter. So – and if you look at the overall metrics, the
fundamental asset gathering statistics, mutual fund positions, total client assets in custody, prime brokerage lending and
margin balances, [ph] RI (36:06) custody, all the way through, we have solid growth in the Pershing business unit. So
we feel good about that business.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And regarding ConvergEx, we just have a small equity piece in that firm. And it's something
we've had for a long period of time and we just continue to track it.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Okay, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead,
sir.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hi, good morning. Todd, I was wondering on the capital front, now that SLR's pushed
out of CCAR for another year and given the potential for rates to go up, I was wondering, can you talk to us about how
much excess deposits you had on hand, and then your tradeoff of considering more preferreds issuance in the capital
structure?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we are – we would estimate, Ken, that there's probably about $50 billion to $70
billion of excess deposits. But what ultimately will happen with those deposits is going to depend on the course of
monetary policy. So we are poring through our balance sheet to kind of prioritize where we're most efficient with it and
actions that we might take against the balance sheet.
If those deposits – if rates were to rise and those deposits were not to lead, we think we would be a heavier issuer of
preferred and would get a pretty reasonable return on that preferred. So we may be in the preferred market as we were
this past quarter, where we issued $1 billion. We have a fair amount of space to do more. It really will depend on how
things play out. It just means that for 2016, the CCAR will not have to consider the SLR, but we still have to prove to
ourselves, a path to compliance, because we're still 40 basis points below the 5% target. We'd need a cushion above
that.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: And so where's the fine line between go/no go on that? Is it a rate of Fed funds, is it
like so the earnings capacity on that excess deposit if they stay around? Like where is your kind of breakeven decision
tree on that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, it's a fairly low yield. Fed funds go to 60 basis points or 70 basis points and you've
got that kind of a margin on it, it's a pretty – it's a very attractive return on your equity.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. Got it. And then just second follow-up, Issuer Services, you mentioned just the
stability that you've started to see. Can you just give us some just underlying trends inside those businesses? And I
know we do see the typical seasonality, but the last few years have been anything but typical. So just help us
understand what kind of lift we should expect to see in the back half.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yes, this is Brian Shea. The Issuer Services business includes both Corporate Trust and
DR. As Todd mentioned, and we've been signaling for some time, that we felt we'd see a moderation in the runoff of
high value securitizations in Corporate Trust, and that the revenue decline that we experienced over the past few years
would start to moderate and flatten out, and that's exactly what we're seeing happen at this point. And on the DR side,
that business is obviously a capital markets driven business and has volatility associated with it, but it's had good
year-to-date performance and we expect similar seasonality, possibly in third quarter this year. So, so far, so good.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: All right. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Maybe just to start on the T. Rowe deal. So in looking at that, I guess more strategically, as
you think about the longer term operating margins on either that deal or that business in general, as you're obviously
starting to bring in revenues by year end, when do you expect that particular investment to be – or that deal to be
operating margin positive? And then how do you think about – is that deal and/or that business, from an operating
margin perspective, longer-term versus your overall Asset Servicing business?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, this is Brian Shea. The transition of the T. Rowe Price team, about 225 people, to
BNY Mellon, we expect to take place in August, so starting next month. That will be followed by a fund accounting
conversion, 9 months to 12 months out, and then a middle office platform conversion sort of roughly a year after that.
So, it's a long-term arrangement and it's the largest middle office client – asset manager client that's committed to us.
But you should know that we're driving a shared economies of scale model and a much more standardized leverageable
platform. We have about 40 middle office clients today. This is the single biggest one we have, and we think it's a real
validation of our strategy and the platform that we're putting in place to serve more.
Fundamentally, we feel that there's a way to create shared economies of scale in this model that haven't historically
been created by custodians, and we're executing a strategy, a different technology strategy, to create that leverage. But
there's a fundamental trend where asset managers, just like other financial institutions; high regulatory change, lower
growth environment, are getting back to basics and fundamentally focusing on the investment process as their value
proposition, and relying more on firms like us to verbalize their middle office costs and actually, their front office
technology costs.
So we're going to be driving the strategies to drive more end-to-end solutions for investment managers and alternative
investment managers, and I think it'll be a positive driver of our long-term results, and we have a really significant
pipeline of middle office clients, and we're being careful and selective about which assignments we take on.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The other thing I would add, Brian, is that we're not relying on foreign exchange, securities
lending, other "high margin business" to make this transaction profitable. We have priced it and we're building the
operating platforms such that it is profitable on its own.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Great. That's really helpful color. I appreciate that. And then maybe on the – just to verify the
expense outlook again, making sure I have the base right. It is $11 billion for the guidance for 2015 for flat expenses?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, what we've guided is that our operating expenses last year were about $10.7 billion
– $10.65 billion. And, Brian, what we've guided is that we'd be relatively flat to that number.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: To that number. Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: A couple of questions. One on the Investment Management Metrics page, you've got
your AUM outflows, as well as inflows listed on the page and net currency market and acquisition impact. I noticed
liability driven investments have continued to be positive, but maybe a little bit slower pace. Can you just speak to
what's going on there? And then your market impact was actually better than what I've seen at other shops, and maybe
you could help us understand how much of that acquisitions versus market.

<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: So, Betsy, it's Curtis. I would say our LDI business still has a very healthy pipeline.
Quarter to quarter, there are dynamics around the funded ratio for our clients. So if interest rates rise and equity markets
remain stable, then the funding ratio improves and clients are generally compelled to move forward with launching a
derisking of their plan and vice versa. And so there is some dynamics of how markets are moving in a quarter.
We do have clients occasionally who add to their existing strategies. They derisk some portion of their portfolio and
they add, and it makes some quarters stronger than others, and when that doesn't happen, it's a bit weaker. And then
clients – we've also had clients who have unhedged portions of their portfolio in the past as well. So quarter-to-quarter,
fluctuations are somewhat related to what's happening in the marketplace. But I can tell you that the pipeline is still
very healthy, whereas funding ratios improve, there is continued interest in removing that volatility or that risk from
pension plans' overall exposure. So, generally, the business is very healthy. In terms of market, I mean, I think one of
the things that is important to appreciate is that various assets that we have across different markets, and LDI is actually
a really good one, it's a very long duration asset. And it's linked not only to interest rates, but also to inflation rates. So
as inflation rates and interest rates fall, the value of the liability, and therefore, the value of the assets we manage rises.
And so that's contributing to some of what you're seeing.
We have a very diversified portfolio of assets that we manage. When we look at it versus many peers, our U.S. and
non-U.S. mix is very diversified. And if you look at equity markets, you also need to appreciate that we have assets –
we're showing AUM on a spot basis. And because of what happens in some currency markets, our spot rates move right
at the end of the quarter based on currency movements, and we saw a little bit of that in the year-over-year dynamics.
So I would say it's both currency and the duration of some of the assets we manage.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it. Okay, that's helpful color. Thank you very much. Just, Todd, just an overall
question for you on the FX impact on revenues and expenses, and I'm sorry if I missed it. I noticed throughout the
presentation, you talked about the impact there, but do you have an FX adjusted revenue and expense overall for total
BK or how it impacted the growth rates in revenue and expenses?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I'd indicated that it's about 3% negative on revenues. And it's about 3% positive on
expenses, meaning lower expenses. Net-net, it was very slightly negative to us. So there's some rounding in those
calculations. And that's about what we would expect going forward, Betsy. There could be – we're pretty well hedged
in euro and sterling, so there could be – we are short one or two other currencies, so if the movements changed, it could
be a little bit different. But we would expect, if the dollar were to get stronger or weaker from here, it shouldn't have a
meaningful impact to our pre-tax. It just might change the geography a bit.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. The currency you're not hedged to that's the biggest is yen, is that right or...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, it's going to be rupee.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The Indian rupee.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay, got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.

exceeded expectations and you're in your target ranges, but it doesn't seem like you're changing your guidance for the

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, generally, Mike, we put out three-year – the targets during investor day. We're sticking
to those and we're executing against them. The first half of the year, we've done some level of outperformance. We
want to continue that and not let the targets restrain us, but we certainly want to keep performing well.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, the targets weren't meant to be annual targets. They were compounded growth rates
over the three-year period, Mike. And so we've certainly gotten off to a good start. We've gotten much more market
benefit than we would have anticipated at that point in time. But that's not to say that's going to continue.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Perhaps as a follow-up to that, Gerald, you mentioned your three-year targets and your
five priorities, and I think you guys had a board meeting in June where you talked about strategy and topics like that.
Now, can you highlight what was talked about at that board meeting or any perhaps nuanced changes that you have in
the strategy, or other areas for additional emphasis that came out from that meeting?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, Mike, we have a board meeting every other month. So, that's just part of the standard
fare. We share with our board, obviously, not only what we share publicly, but the ups and downs, and the positives
and negatives throughout all our businesses. So we're sticking by our strategy, we're sticking by our business model,
and we're sticking by the investor day targets we laid out there. And I'm pleased to say we're executing against them,
and we'll continue to drive value for shareholders and clients.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Last follow-up. We've had a few months since investor day. Now that you've had this period
and you have gone back a little bit more aggressively, which areas would you say you're more confident about or
perhaps less confident about?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, go ahead.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: From a financial perspective, I think there are a couple of positives, as you've seen. We've
seen probably a little stronger revenue growth, especially when you take into consideration, currency. I think our
business improvement process continues to work well. I think the balance sheet growth and the need to retain
additional capital may be higher than we had anticipated. And net-net, I think we're still comfortable with the ranges
that we had established. The course to get there will never be the direction that we initially anticipated, but I think we're
still pretty comfortable with the direction we're going.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thanks.

Thank you. The next question comes is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open, sir. Please go

<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Hi, good morning. So one follow-up on the onboarding expense for the back half
of the year. How much of that should we consider ongoing? And how much of that would be sort of one-time charges?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: It's Brian. We signaled at investor day that we've had year-over-year growth in expense as
we build out these strategic platforms for asset managers, alternative managers, and the global wealth platform. And we
– that is going to be the case, as we suggested, obviously. And then over time, the revenue comes on as the clients start
to leverage the platform. And so, ultimately, we think these are really strategic, good strategic investments that are
going to create long-term client shareholder value, but there's obviously a drag year-over-year on expense this year and
then it moderates next year, and in 2018, these investments are significantly positive for the shareholder.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. And I would add, it's in our running rate expenses today, those investments.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. And so I guess what you're saying is that they're ongoing, but we see the
revenue pick-up, which enhances the returns. Is that a fair way to paraphrase?

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, that is correct. That's the right way to think about it.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Great. Thank you. And then a quick one on the excess deposits. So can you help
us maybe understand why you would – if we get higher rates and we don't see the behavior you're anticipating, why
you wouldn't explore pricing changes as opposed to raising preferred in order to just, what – provide motivation for
those $50 billion to $70 billion to move off the balance sheet?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. First of all, it's not one or the other. As you can see, in this particular quarter, the
second quarter we just finished, we actually did manage our deposit rates down. So you can see that we are, in fact,
charging for deposits, particularly in Europe – or in Europe, I should say. And so the cost of our deposits is actually
declining. So we are proactively managing the cost of our deposit base.
But as Todd said earlier, if the return on those deposits in a rising interest rate environment are such, with little or no
risk associated with them, then we should think about whether additional capital is warranted, and making sure we get a
good return on that capital.
And there's also, as you know, as our businesses grow, we tend to get more deposits, frictional deposits, associated with
our businesses. It's going to be interesting to see when rates rise, what happens to those excess deposits, not only here,
but in the industry at large.

Thank you. The next question comes is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open, sir.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. As a follow-up on the deposit commentary that you guys have made, what
percentage of your European depositors now are paying you interest for you to hold those deposits? And the second,
how many have decided to leave or take some of the deposits out because they didn't want to pay the fee?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Most of them where we can pass through the fees are paying them. We did see some
behavior when we initially started charging for deposits where there were some outflows, and those have come back.
So we're about flat through the beginning to where we are now in the actual volume of European deposits.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Would you say the experience has been a pleasant one for what you had to do to convince
folks to pay for you to hold their deposits?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I look around at my relationship people and I'm not sure they feel exactly that way.
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Yeah, I would say that clients – this is Karen Peetz. I would say clients understood it, that we
weren't going to pay them to keep the money with us, but it was a series of difficult conversations. Many of our peers
followed suit so we weren't alone.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good. And then a technical question. On the buyback, you guys were quite successful this
quarter in buying back just over 19 million shares, and I see the average share count dropped only about, I think, 4
million shares, from 1.126 billion to 1.22 billion. Could you give us some color, why it didn't fall further?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, average share count is – so you'd start the period, and the end of the period. So it's
just on – it'd be the timing of it, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Just a timing issue then?

if you back out the T. Rowe, it still was $254 billion in the quarter. So if you can kind of just give us some color on the
geography or service that's driving that, I mean, that compares to $131 billion last quarter.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I would say that's an Asset Servicing metric. And again, we're getting a solid
pipeline and some solid new business commitments, and I think it's indicative of the secular trend of asset managers
refocusing on the investment process and their core value proposition, and leveraging us for more of those core back
office, middle office, and eventually, front office services.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. As we've said in the past, quarter-to-quarter, you can have a couple of sizable new
pieces of business. And so it could be $150 billion, $200 billion one quarter, $250 billion another quarter. But the
pipeline is good and this was a good quarter for new business wins.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: And then just a second question on the Wealth Management business. You said that the
Wealth Management growth was improving, but if you look at the revenues year-over-year, they're only up 3%. So can
you give a little more color, maybe on AUM or some other metric that shows the improvement, and also when you kind
of expect those revenues to inflect in the future?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, so Wealth Management also uses some of our mutual funds, and when we look at
our Wealth Management business, it also includes our private banking activities. So the line that's Wealth Management
fees doesn't describe the entirety of our Wealth Management business. If you look at our loans and deposit growth at
the – on the Investment Management page, you can see that we're additionally having real success growing our balance
sheet. So the NIR here is up 18%, and it's really helping the overall [audio gap] (58:21). Wealth Management is – we're
growing not just within our current footprint but we've opened new offices, and so being able to go into those offices
with both investment offerings and private banking offerings is really where our revenue growth is coming from.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Good. Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the last question on queue is coming from Adam Beatty from Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Good morning. A question on Asset Servicing, specifically collateral management, which you
mentioned a couple of times. I was wondering if you could maybe size either the contribution to growth or the growth
rate of that service line, and also let us know how far along you are in terms of penetrating your existing client base.
What inning are you at with that opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Brian, you want to take it?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. So on the Asset Servicing line, probably quarter-over-quarter growth, we probably
approached 50% of the collateral services, benefiting that Asset Servicing line. As far as where we're in, we're probably
in still the early innings, and I mean by the early innings is that the buy side really hasn't yet benefited fully from
shifting some of their business to enjoy collateral as a means to either help finance some of what they're trying to take

and leverage, or fully embrace or fully put in place, the collateralization of margin, especially in Europe. So we think
we're in early innings still when it comes to the collateral business, and as far as the growth opportunities that exist
around it. And so – and our product set really fits well with those needs that those buy side clients have as collateral
continues to be needed at – to pledge against obligations.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Excellent. So it sounds like more to come. Thank you. And then on Investment Management,
you mentioned some perhaps more acute funding needs from some international clients driving some of the outflows.
How much risk do you see of – as maybe some additional drawdown across your client base? Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We've seen through the course of the past several months, some clients rebalancing their
portfolios. Equity markets over the past several years, obviously, did quite well, especially in the U.S. I think
understanding the U.S. and non-U.S. equity performance is important to this, when you think about what people are
doing with rebalancing. So we've seen huge growth in our AUM and LDI as clients have reduced their exposure to
equities. And I'm drawing an inference that sometimes, we actually see clients sell equities and move into fixed income
or derisk their pension plans. So I think an overall drawdown in assets is not what we're seeing at the moment. We're
seeing a rebalancing from equities to fixed income.
Again, there's a lot being talked about of the repositioning of investor portfolios towards more risk, and – but what I
would say, we see really instead is really focusing on getting returns, while being thoughtful about risk, and that's why
our alternatives growth. We've had eight straight quarters of growth in alternatives, and those have been strategies
where clients are either getting uncorrelated exposures or they are getting absolute return or asset allocation strategies
that give them better growth like portfolio exposures. So I don't think it's an overall drawdown, it's more of a mix shift
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Okay. So it sounds like you're not seeing anything material in terms of funding needs that
may be sovereigns or what have you driving those outflows.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We've seen – I mean, I think to Gerald's opening comment, we've absolutely seen – I think
that our client base is very significantly global institutions, who, from time to time, do manage their liquidity needs
across their portfolio and, again, quarter-to-quarter, we do see that happening.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate you taking my call.
Gerald L. Hassell
