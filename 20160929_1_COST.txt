MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon. My name is Amanda, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome
everyone to the Q4 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the
speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Amanda, and good afternoon to everyone.

Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 16-week and 52-week
periods ended this past August 28. For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year's
fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share.
In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results, couple of items of note in looking at the comparison.
FX, as compared to a year ago, during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and the areas where we
operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Mexico, Canada, UK and Korea. This resulting in our

foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after-tax or $0.03 a share,
had been exchange rates been flat year-over-year.
Gasoline profitability, our profits from gasoline during the quarter, as compared to last year's fourth quarter, were lower
by about $27 million pre-tax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the fourth
quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well.
IT monetization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I'm not going to go for the detail on that, but that was
about $16 million pre-tax or 4 basis points primarily to the SG&A line. Income taxes, both this year and last year's
fourth quarter results had several net positive tax benefits that, in the aggregate, benefited each of the fourth quarter's
earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year's underlying Q4 tax rate was about
0.6% higher than last year's. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of
those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items.
LIFO, this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pre-tax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the
fourth quarter of $14 million. So both deflationary, although, we've all talked about the increased levels deflation of
recent time. So, year-over-year delta of $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to higher deflation and LIFO credit
in the quarter, higher by that amount.
In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures
were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation that was a little over 200
basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The latter about 1
percentage point of impact to sales.
Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported
Canadian comp figure of plus 2% would have been plus 5%, ex gas and FX. And reported minus 2% other international
comp figure, ex these two factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported at zero for the quarter. And
again, excluding gas and FX would have been plus 3%. And of course, that plus 3% adjusted figure is still being
impacted by a bit of increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline.
Openings in Q4, we opened 10 new locations and also completed one relo. And for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net
new locations on top of that of four relocations. I believe two of them which were relocated and the old units converted
into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S., two were in Canada, two were in Japan and one
each were in UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
This afternoon, I'll also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margin
and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note including an update on our recent switchover to the
new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20, after six weeks into the fourth quarter.
So, on to the fourth quarter results. Quickly, sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year's
fourth quarter sales of $35 billion. Again, a flat comp on a reported basis, plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The
flat comp sales results on a reported basis that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding
gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency
increase of right around 2.5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States
showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain
and the UK.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative
year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within that though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big
negative, of course, as we talked about that that was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that
category. If I look at the food and sundries category that, again, on a comp basis was slightly negative year-over-year
for the quarter, ex the tobacco department was plus 3%. And you continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early
spring.

Hardlines, overall, up mid single-digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting
goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was in the low single-digits, apparel, small
electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the four
departments. Of course, meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation.
In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. I mentioned earlier, we recently
seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid single-digit range. In several
fresh food categories notably meat [ph] and pork (7:25) and things like that, in 5% to 10% range in some cases.
Overall, that we're seeing a net increase in deflation but not at those levels. And in some non-food levels as well,
non-food categories as well.
Moving to the line items on the income statement. Membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported
were $832 million, up 9 basis points, and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year's fourth quarter. The $47
million would have been up $50 million if you'd adjusted for FX.
In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide.
Continuing increasing penetration of executive memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter
and year-end, at year-end we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of
the third quarter. Primary business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million,
for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million. And
including add-on cards in terms of people walking around with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million
at year-end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier.
In terms of executive members, of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of
370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that's a combination, of course, of
new members signing up as an executive member as well as members converting to it. Executive members now
account for a little over a third of our base and a little more than two-thirds of our sales where executive members are
offered.
In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That's ticked down from
90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%. Worldwide, 87.6% which was the same at Q3 end ticking down
from 87.7% in the previous quarter, at the end of the second quarter. As I've talked about in the last few quarters, in
Canada we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions in renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we
converted a year-and-a-half or so ago to a new co-brand card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American
Express wasn't purchased, so this really had to start all over and you don't have as many auto renewals to start with. But
that's quickly changed and beginning in Q4 we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there.
A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new signups for the last nine months
prior to June 20 as we were switching over in June 20. So, overall, pretty much the same and we'll see where that goes
from here.
Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased annual membership fees by about 10%
in the three Asia locations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan; as well as in Mexico and the UK. On an annual basis, as you
know, fee increases at the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For
example, the first month people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably
in September and this is when they renew. People that didn't sign up or aren't renewing until next March, it'll be in
March and for 12 months hence. So that's hence the 23 months overall. That'll be about $50 million pre-tax to the
membership income line. I'm sure there'll be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and
everything.
Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from
American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned, this took place on June 20, the beginning
of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all of
U.S. and Puerto Rico Costco's and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards including of course the new Citi

Visa Anywhere card.
There was a lot of effort. And as you know, there were a few operation glitches during the first few weeks after the
cutover. We're now past that, and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased
cash back rewards, we estimate it's about a 40% to 50% improvement in the reward program, which was already
previously a very good reward program to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it's also great for us in
terms of driving member value and sales over the next years, and, of course, lowering our effective cost of accepting
credit and debit cards.
In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant
and travel and 1% everywhere else including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new Citi Visa
Anywhere card, 3% on gas now is 4%, 2% on restaurant and travel is now a 3%. And probably the most significant
rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket year is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled
from the previous 1% cash back rewards now to 2%. We think this is big, and it's even bigger for executive members
who also earn a 2% reward from us on most Costco purchases.
So combined, an executive member using a new card with just a few exceptions, will earn 4% back at Costco. We think
it's exciting, and we think it'll be good for our business over the next several years. Lastly, for all other purchases
outside of Costco on the card, it'll remain at 1% cash back reward.
A few basic stats on the new card. Approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards representing about
just under 7.5 million accounts were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards that we
considered active that is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the
accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 in just the past many weeks, 1.1
million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over
million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It's still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far we're beating
our initial expectations in terms of the conversion usage and new signups to the card.
In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points
up from 11.14% a year ago to 11.42%. I'll let you jot down the normal numbers that I ask you to jot down. We'll have
four columns, reported and without gas deflation, Q3 2016 and Q3 2016 would be the first two columns. The third and
fourth columns would both be Q4 2016, but then also reported and without gas depreciation (sic) [deflation].
The core merchandise in Q3, on a reported basis, was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points, but without gas
deflation down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this 16 basis points. And again
ex-gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 basis points and plus 4 basis points, reported and
without deflation. And in Q4 2016, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 basis points and minus 9 basis points without
gas deflation.
2% reward, a zero and a plus 2% in Q3, and a minus 2% and a zero in Q4. LIFO, plus 2% and plus 2%. And in Q4
2016, plus 5% and plus 4%. Other, in Q3 2016, both columns had a plus 7%. And Q4 no issue, 0 and 0. So, all told, in
reported on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of 2016 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and
up 13 basis points on a ex-gas deflation basis.
This year in the fourth quarter, of course, you saw the 28-basis-point up. That would have been plus 4 basis points
ex-gas deflation. I might add that a plus 7 basis points in Q3, that was simply a one-time legal settlement that benefited
margin.
As you can see overall, again, our margin was higher by 28 basis points, but without gas plus 4 basis points. The core
merchandise component that you see that I just mentioned, the plus 29 basis points or the plus 9 basis points ex-gas
deflation. That's the thing I'll focus on to start with. Our core gross margins, which is food and sundries, hardlines,
softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points.
With food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat
year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margins
were down 4 basis points, ex-gas deflation down 9 basis points. All a function of lower year-over-year gas profits.

And as discussed earlier in the call, but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses gross margins as a
percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So, margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added
4 basis points to the equation.
In terms of SG&A expenses for the quarter, year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at $10.34 million
versus a $10.00 million a year ago. And again that 34 basis points; I'll have you jot down a couple of numbers. That 34
basis points, ex-gas deflation is a minus 13 basis points or higher by 13 basis points, not higher by 34 basis points.
Again, the same four columns, Q3 2016 for reported and Q3 2016 for without gas and the same two column headings
for Q4 2016 and Q4 2016.
Core operations, minus 24 basis points. And a minus means higher, higher by 24 basis points in Q3 2016 on a reported
basis, higher by 8 basis points ex gas deflation; in the fourth quarter, higher by 24 basis points and higher by 6 basis
points. Central, higher by 6 basis points and higher by 4 basis points in Q3; and then, Q4, higher by 9 basis points and
higher by 7 basis points ex gas deflation.
Stock compensation, higher by 3 basis points and higher by 2 basis points in the third quarter; and higher by
1-basis-point and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, we reported in Q3 2016 compared to Q3 2015. On a reported
basis, SG&A was higher by 33 basis points, but really higher by 14 basis points, ex-gas deflation. And the higher by 34
basis points this time was higher by 13 basis points. So not that different, looking at it that way.
The operations component, the minus six basis points core operations, ex gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll
and benefits, partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation, particularly in fresh that impacts that number,
somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees
as a result of the AmEx/Citi Visa switch during the quarter.
Central expense was higher year-over-year by nine basis points, seven basis points ex gas. Increased IT spending
related to modernization, that was four basis points of those seven basis points; and a couple of other basis points
higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue
year-over-year.
Next on the income statement, pre-opening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27
million of pre-opening expense. This year, $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13
openings. This year in the quarter we had 11 openings, which includes that relo; pretty much in line, again, with what
we've expected – would expect.
All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1.191 billion, which is $35 million higher or 3% higher
year-over-year than last year's $1.156 billion.
Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year, versus $40
million last year; essentially flat year-over-year. Essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest
rates.
Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million, versus $40
million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year about – I'm sorry, was a little lower
year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was [ph] $15 million (20:23); primarily various FX
transactions.
This year, in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking-to-market items and FX from foreign
exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pre-tax. A year ago, it was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That
generally fluctuates. Usually, it's plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes a little more or less.
Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1.181 billion. In terms of income taxes,
I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year, each benefited by about $0.05 a share from
various positive items. And excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about [ph] 0.6% (21:06)
from a year earlier. And again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter. It was up 2% from a year

ago.
A quick rundown of some other topics. In this afternoon's release, we provided you balance sheet information. One
thing that is not on the balance sheet that I'm always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth
quarter that came in at $408 million; and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1.255 billion.
One thing that looked perhaps a little out on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That
has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over. This has been a two-plus-year effort. It
was installed. And it's really the platform that a lot of the legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop
them over the next couple of years.
Not only it was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the
beginning since this [indiscernible] (22:08) system went in on day one, anything that was set up in the system, any
merchandise or other payables that were set up in [ph] our (22:14) system are do paid during week one of the new fiscal
year, we prepaid a week early, up to a week early, the prior Friday I believe. And so, we paid about $1.7 billion extra in
week 52 of this past fiscal year. And that's why you'll see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated
with that.
So, again, one of the statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year fourth
quarter end, on a reported basis, it was 101%. What you'll see now, it's 85%. But again taking out that $1.7 billion, it's
104%; actually, a slight improvement in our payables ratio.
And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year it was 89%, again on,
what I'll call, a normalized basis. Assuming we hadn't prepaid the $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been
up a couple of percentage points to 91%. So we seem to be managing that okay.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year at fourth quarter end it stood at exactly $13 million per
warehouse. This year, it came in at just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower, or 3% lower. Really lower
per warehouse inventory is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the
– in the food and fresh departments, as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just
coming down a little bit on inventory levels.
In terms of CapEx, in Q4 we spent approximately $850 million. And for all of fiscal 2016, we came in right at $2.6
billion. That $2.6 billion, by the way, compares to $2.4 billion for the prior fiscal year in 2015. Our estimate for fiscal
2017 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. So about the same level as compared to last year; perhaps a
little higher, it depends on timing.
Next, Costco Online. We're currently in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, and more recently launched in Korea
and Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter,
13% ex FX. And for all of 2016, 15% reported and plus 17% ex FX. On a comp basis, for the quarter, we were up 10%
reported and 11% excluding FX. And for the year, 14% and 17%.
Next discussion in terms of expansion. As I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29. That's up
from 23 openings in all of 2015. This current year, we've got in our budget 31 net openings [ph] as before (24:55), but
three of them are relos. And so, something certainly in the high-20s. But I think, again, something – our current best
guess is the 31.
If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in 2015, that represented about a 3.5% square footage
growth. In fiscal 2016, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we've also expanded a few units, it's
about 4.5% square footage growth. And in 2017, assuming we got to 31, that would be in the low- to mid-4%s as well
in terms of the percentage of square footage growth.
Our planned fiscal 2017 locations, assuming the 31 number, would be 17 in the U.S., seven in Canada and one each in
Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, France – our first in France – and also a unit in Iceland. And both France and
Iceland are currently targeted for mid to late spring in calendar 2017. And as we know, sometimes these may slip, but
that's our best guess at this point. Note again that these are first locations in France and Iceland, and we look forward to

seeing some of you over there.
As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases
for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a
share. For all of fiscal 2016, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333
million in 2014.
In terms of dividend, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring, a few
months ago. That was a 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So this year at $0.45 a quarter, this
yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million.
Next Wednesday, October 5, at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, we will announce our September sales results for the five-week
period ending Sunday, October 2 – this coming Sunday. This five-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S.
and Canada, recognizing the close of year business and the observance of Labor Day in those two countries.
Lastly, our fiscal 2017 first quarter results for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we've done this time.
We'll report shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7, with the earnings call that afternoon at 2
o'clock.
With that, Amanda, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
My pleasure. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Heinbockel.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Richard, so let me start with expansion. I think you said seven in Canada. Was that right?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So kind of – which I don't – not in recent years have you opened that many in Canada. So
what sort of drove that, some unique real estate opportunities? Does cannibalization pick up over the next year in
Canada? And then, sort of tying that back to the U.S., when you think about where you sit today, have you really done
any deeper thinking about what the saturation level in the U.S. could be beyond where we sit today?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it's a couple reasons. If you think back five or so years
ago, or even eight years or 10 years ago when we had probably 65 units, 70 units, we thought the market might be 90
units today. And today, we have 90 units or 91 units and we think it'll certainly be over 100 units, and we keep adding a
few to that concept. I think the fact that we're opening so many right now has to do as much with very strong sales over
the last few years. We've been enjoying 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each of the last few years up there. And
so, it keeps getting stronger.
And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that while there'll be some cannibalization, the net
business that's added when we open a unit, even though it's cannibalizing, net of cannibalization, we'll find that existing
members will then be shopping more frequently because they're closer. And so, I think it's a combination of those
things. And I don't know what the new five-year or 10-year guesstimate is in Canada. I don't think we're going to open
seven a year. But once we decided to go – to look and see where we're going and how strong we've been, this is the
result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there.
In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true if you had asked us five or so years ago, by now how many would
be in the U.S. versus outside of the U.S. And we would've said, probably we'd be down from 75% or 80% in the U.S. to
50% and heading south of there as we saturate. We found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets.
And I think in a couple of months we're getting ready to open up our 17th or so unit in the Puget Sound, having opened
our 16th or so unit just less than a year ago.

And the other thing, of course, in the U.S. that we have perhaps upped our expectation is markets that five or so years
ago we didn't think we'd have any near-term interest in considering medium size markets were our direct competition –
or the direct competition was there. And what we have found is, is we've done pretty well when we go to these markets.
Now, some of these markets are smaller and it takes a little longer, but there's clearly an opportunity for us there. And
as we've gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and Toledo, these are markets that, again,
weren't high on the radar seven years or eight years ago, and what we've seen is that our deal works.
The last thing, of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years, we only had six or eight or
so business centers. We opened four last year to be at 11, and we're planning to open four this year to be at 15,
including our first business center in Canada. And so, again, that just adds a few in both the Canada question and the
U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis.
An aside on that is, as I mentioned, I think two of the four relos this year were – two of the four business center
openings this year were relos. One in back in many of your neck of the woods there when we took an older, smaller
parking lot, no gas station, Hackensack Costco, and relocated it to Teterboro nearby with a big size unit, lots of great
parking, great ingress and egress and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into business center. So just a
small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we move some of those to bigger locations. So all that's, I
think, been part of it.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: All right. And then just lastly, have you sort of finalized or thought about the percentage of
the AmEx to Visa benefit that you're going to get? How much you keep versus providing that back to members? When
you think about putting it back to members, when you think about price, labor and/or service and then maybe product
development, where's the most lucrative place to reinvest? I don't know if it'd be price, but is it something like product
development and pushing the envelope more on Kirkland?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, some of those things that you threw out is possible ways to use that parts of this
bucket of money. We do all those anyway. I think probably the best, simplest answer is that just like when we buy a
physical product better, lower – that we can buy, whether it's lower freight, greater purchasing power or greater
production efficiencies or whatever we figure out with our supplier, we generally want to take 80% or 90% of that, the
vast majority of it and give it back to the customer in terms of lower price because that's what drives us and drives our
business. And if we do it more next year, we'll give 80% or 90% of that back. And it's not an exact number, but it's well
closer to 80% or 90% than not.
That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate to
what I call this bucket of money, there's lots of ways one can use it, most importantly, by improving the reward on the
card to the member that's going utilize it. That will drive value to that member and loyalty to us and also more business
to us.
And secondly, what's left over. And when we originally did it, we did it such that we're going to keep a small amount
of it. Now to the extent – and we're not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see that there's
more money in the bucket. So that will additionally accrue to us, but it's not changing what we're doing with it. We're
going to still do those other things.
So again I think over time we'll look at it and you can rest assure that in a few years if the success of the card and the
economics of the card to us – we're not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of it extra, but we start with a small
amount of a big bucket is good. And if it's a little better because the card's working in directions that we – or even
better than we expected, that's good. And we're still going to do those other things anyway.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks, guys. Simeon Gutman. Richard, thinking about the top line, we're on the verge of
cycling some of the worst of food deflation. I know you mentioned it's picking up a little and then some of the traffic
that the business got on the gas side. And I think the tobacco headwinds, you mentioned there's still a little more to go.
First, is that fair that we're on the verge of cycling that? And then, if we are, should we expect to pick up in the business
from the top line or are you expecting the pick up? Just curious how you think about that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: What was the last part of the question, Simeon?
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: I mean, should we see the business inflect from the top line as some of these I guess
deflation/top line headwinds abate?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think there's another – first of all, when I ask different buyers,
different merchandise categories, their view is it's going be three to six more months; recognizing these are also
guesses. I mean, they're perhaps educated. Unless you know that something specifically is happening, like you're
anniversarying the bird flu or you're anniversarying really high feed prices on the commodity side, sometimes there's a
little more predictability on that side. But beyond that, I would say probably best guess is five months or six months of
continued deflation at these newer levels in some cases. Gas, who the heck knows?
<A>: Barring the change in [inaudible] (36:42).
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: What?
<A>: Barring the changes today, it should improve.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah. [ph] Bob (36:47) is here. Barring any major changes out there, you'd see a reflection
point probably in the...
<A>: More neutralist.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: More neutralist.
<A>: Late fall.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Late fall? So it's a few months.
<A>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That sounds like a definite maybe.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: I guess, if you take the deflation in the food categories, if you take some of the deflation
maybe in electronics, or do this analysis of looking at the units versus the sales, I guess what is that delta if you put it
all together? Your best guess at that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd have to get back to you on that and I'd give you some sound points, if you will. Some of
it, I mean, there's some examples, particularly like in meat. We see them every month at the budget meeting where
we'll have literally a 10 percentage point or so drop in the price per pound and a 3% or 4% or 5% increase in labor
productivity per pound and less efficiency because of the fact that the price per pound went down much more than that.
And so, that's the kind of stuff that hits your profitability, of course, too. If I looked at – there's some interesting things
going on with some commodities.
I was just looking at a chart. Coffee, these are average sell, but it's consistent with average cost, down 16%. A lot of
things in the – certain cheeses are down 10% to 20%. I believe eggs are way down right now. And so, those things are
all impacting you. Now, it impacts you on selling eggs. It helps you a little bit in selling muffins because we're not
essentially changing 16-pack of muffins from – I'm making the numbers up, but I don't know what we sell them for, but
$5.99 down to $5.89. And so, I'd say the net of those two is still a detriment to us.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And my follow up – yeah.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And by the way, when I mentioned earlier about late fall, that had to do specifically with
gas. We'll see the inflection point. It looks like we're going to see an inflection point with gas all things equal out there
in the next couple months.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow up is related to the credit card. I guess, looking back, you've
only had a couple months, but are there signs that there was some deferred spending on either big ticket items? And
then if you have the data, is the same member who is either buying on AmEx or not on the co-branded card, is their
spending up individually year-over-year, meaning they're incented by the card and they're actually spending more with
you?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: As it relates to the first question, absolutely. We probably saw it biggest in something that
the Millennials don't buy hearing aids. We saw a big decline for a few weeks leading up to it and big increase right
afterwards. Also on big ticket, but generally speaking, jokes aside on Millennials, across the board we saw bigger ticket
purchases, which again that makes sense, people are waiting. Now, there's all types of movement in both directions.
You had existing – a member with existing Visa cards in his or her wallet and maybe they're using that one, not ours.
That's fine. We still have a negotiated good rate on certain things.
You have people that were using debit their whole lives because they perhaps did not want an American Express card
or they applied for one and did not get one. And so, for 16 years they use cash, check and debit. Now for the first time,
they can use a credit card and I'm sure that's where we saw many of these new signups as well or part of them. But in
terms of are they big more with us? Anecdotally, we're hearing that from our warehouse managers who talk with their
biggest wholesale customers, but it's purely anecdotal at this juncture. And I think we'll see more of it. I haven't
actually looked at any statistics on that.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks, Richard.
Operator
And your next question comes from Matthew Fassler.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Good afternoon, Richard. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. A couple of questions. First
of all, you spoke in fairly general terms about how you plan to make use of the better economics of the credit card,
where you hope to direct it. If you think about the impact on the P&L this quarter along with launch, I don't know if
there were special provisions in place for the cost of launching the card. I'm not sure if there are elements of the change
in arrangement that started to impact it, but would you say that there was any offset to SG&A or meaningful offset to
gross margin that resulted from the transition this quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Certainly, certain costs were subsidized in the transition from our partners, but at the end
of the day, yes. I mentioned I think when I was going through the SG&A, payroll and benefits for our company were
up year-over-year in the quarter in SG&A. And that was somewhat offset by – and I said in particular rounded out to
everything would be related to this credit card transition. So, yes, there's improvement related to that.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And then second question, if you think about other international, you obviously
didn't call out Asia and any Asian countries as strong countries. You've spoken over the course of the month the
releases about comping some of the big openings that you had in recent years and the other international comp number
ex FX is a bit lower than we have typically seen. Anything to think about the franchise in those markets or the macro or
how you're resonating in that part of the world?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. It has more, I think, to do with a little bit of cannibalization in a couple those countries
where you've got 10 or 12 locations in Korea and Taiwan, or I think we had a cannibalization in Australia as well. But
one location, you'll take a $200 million or $300 million building down $70 million, $80 million. And that's what's in
your comp, not the new building. So that has as much to do with it as anything. You could really think about our
markets are [indiscernible] (43:09).

And as we said, the one market that has been – we start, which we remind ourselves that there was a time when we
were willing to close Korea and Taiwan. And they're our most and almost our most profitable and productive countries
and locations. And we've talked about our first unit in Seville got off to a slow start. It's growing nicely now. Madrid
got off to a much better start and it's growing nicely. And so, again, we're patient. But in terms of that other
international comp number, I would guess and I don't have the detail in front of me, but what I've seen before in recent
times is that it's cannibalization more than anything.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And that's good to hear on Spain, by the way. If you think about the cadence of openings
and year-ago openings and where the new stores are going to open in some of those markets, is this an issue, the
cannibalization issue that should stay with you for a little while, or is it set to abate at some point over the course in the
new fiscal year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Which one?
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: The cannibalization primarily in Asia, presumably.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I hope it doesn't abate. That means, we're working hard to get more openings there. These
are generally no-brainer locations in terms of very predictable, successful locations for us. We feel we've developed a
great franchise over there with great loyalty and great success, and we would like to do it a little more if we can. We're
working hard to get more locations in both Korea and Taiwan, as an example. And it just takes a long time in Taiwan
and longer than a long time in Korea because of zoning and other restrictions. And it rains on everybody. And other big
boxes in those areas have the same impact.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator
And your next question comes from Michael Lasser.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, are you seeing any
evidence that you're attracting new members to your club as a result of the more lucrative credit card offer?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. Again, this is very early. We have seen in the tens of thousands of signups, or people
that weren't members that signed up because of activities in Citi branches and bank branches. And we've seen from the
blogs. Of course the first few weeks of the blogs all we saw was is about the 30-minute waiting times or longer and
other hassles like that. But the reality is, I would say it's still a small percentage. When I mentioned, there was 730,000
new accounts. I would guess, well less than 100,000, but call it 50,000 to 100,000, I'm guessing, would be that. A lot of
it has do with existing members that are seeing the value of that card when they walk in.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And do you have any plans to try and accelerate the signup of new members by raising
awareness of the card through marketing efforts?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We're doing that already. But maybe we're not doing a good enough job – there's nothing
else that we're doing right now. And when I say us, us and our partners as well, because they're doing some things as
well. But we're getting the word out in a big way in the warehouse with handouts, with signage. The word is getting
out. And, again as I mentioned earlier, we're beating our own expectations of what we had planned for these initial 14
weeks, if you will. And so we feel pretty good about it.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And my follow-up question is, so you're beating your expectations on the credit card
overall. You mentioned that spending for maybe some of your larger customers on the card has been a little bit better. It
may have picked up as a result of it. Yet your overall comps have been a little bit more sluggish in the last couple of
months.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right.

<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Does that suggest that you're seeing either that marginal customer, that marginal
member go away or some other behavioral change that's driving this sort of...?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, it's really hard to tell. I mean, arguably, there's probably 50 different factors that
impact sales every day and every week and every month. And we try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good
about what we're doing in merchandising wise. We feel very good about what we've seen with the crossover to this.
Our view has been, we don't think that many people left Costco because they can't use their American Express card.
American Express is a great brand and it was a great relationship for many years. But at the end of the day, they're
coming to Costco because of our quality and our value.
And when we look around – and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time, well, are we impacted
by the Internet? Losing some? The Internet is taking from everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And,
interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple few months, the
categories that have bucked that trend have been discretionary non-food categories like apparel and housewares and
electronics. So, now, when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe it's delivery services. We do
absolutely believe it's a deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It's a little
piece that we would rather have ourselves or not lose.
But again, we feel good about what initiatives we've got going on. And again, when I talk about the new card being a
reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that's big. When I talk
about [ph] growing (49:23) from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that's big. And it's not big
overnight where they just changed their habits completely. And you'll see it first in business members, and that's where
we have seen it. Mind you, there was some – during the transition, there was probably a little loss of sales from some of
those business members in some cases.
I'm sure American Express didn't sit around not doing anything. They're good at what they do. And they were able to
figure out how to get people, they're marketing elsewhere. But we think that our members at Costco, primarily for us, I
think, again, it's a lot of different things, different factors. And, again, having gone to our budget meeting forever, but
having gone every four weeks just in, even in the last few, some of the initiatives I see going on merchandising wise, I
think we've got a lot of good things going on. Not that we're trying to solve a problem from yesterday, it's what we do
every day.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Thanks so much.
Operator
And your next question comes from Dan Binder.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thanks. Just following on to your comment about the web taking a
little bit from everybody. Does that change the way you think about your own web strategy and the type of items you're
willing to put on and delivery times, et cetera, just to create greater convenience? Because price doesn't really ever
show up on our screen as the major factor.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, I don't see us – yes, we're doing some things anyway. And are we doing
more things? Absolutely. But we're not freaking out about it. We recognize that we're not going to be the provider. We
may be the provider to somebody that wants to deliver, like an Instacart or a Google Express, but we're not going to be
dropping off small items at our prices at your doorstep. That being said, we have and we continue to add things. On the
merchandise initiative side, we've added various sundries items and health and beauty aids items. And on the apparel,
trying to get to a more treasure hunt. I think you're going to see big differences, and then literally in the next several
weeks of the types of hot items that you see on there on the non-food side in that treasure hunt. I think that's probably
the biggest single thing.
Operationally, there's a few things. We are by no means [ph] mere (52:03) one click. We recognize our site has had
some challenges. You're going to see in the next few months a big improvement in the number of clicks. You're going

to see in the next six months or eight months some big improvement on search. You're going to see a much streamlined
returns process. We've never been big on convenience. Our success has been based on price and value, quality and
quantity at the lowest possible price. We do appreciate that value also is convenience. We're going to greatly improve
what we do, but it doesn't mean we're going to get something to you in two hours.
And I think, again, though, when I look at some of the things that we're doing internally, I'm not trying to be cute here
but there are certain things I can't talk about yet. You will see some differences and most of these differences are from
an offensive standpoint not a defensive standpoint. But we look at our core business of getting you into the store still is
a paramount to what we want to do.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: And then if I heard the numbers correctly, it sounded like the growth rate slowed a
little bit this quarter on dot-com. Any particular callouts in terms of merchandise that was offered this year, not last
year or any particular categories that are slower?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I wasn't going to bring that up only because I didn't want to sound defensive, but there
were two things last year in electronics that were big that didn't – the iPhone 6 launch last year was huge and the
iPhone 7 launch was not as huge. And the other thing is, last year was the introduction of the Windows 10. And there
are two things; prior to a year ago comparison, a few months prior to that, people were waiting for the Windows 10
launch. And so you had a lot of pent-up demand and the launch itself and compared to a year later. So those two things
alone were part of that.
That's, frankly, I think, one of the bigger things. But, again, I think as I've said jokingly and half seriously and half
jokingly in the past, some of the things that we haven't done historically gives us a great opportunity to do these. And
there's some still some blocking and tackling like couple of things that I just mentioned. We have greatly improved our
delivery, but it was from bad to better. It still takes too long. And again, we're not going to get something to you in two
hours, but you're going to see logistically some things. And on handling returns, particularly big ticket returns, we
haven't done a good job of that and that's already in process. So you'll see some changes that'll help.
The biggest thing, though, is going to be the merchandise initiatives. And again, I think you're going to see we have
added items and we are adding some items, but we're not trying to figure out what 20,000 additional items because
that's not what we're going to do. But there will be velocity items or repetitive items in the sundries area as well. And
you're right, when you look on your radar screen, price is not way up there. But I challenge anybody on the call to
compare the exact branded items and a big basket of them not just an occasional loss leader or some retailer or dot-com
they have out there. You're going to see – yes, it's a lot savings here but you'll be shocked how much savings. And
again, we recognize also we've got to move a little direction and we're doing that.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Karen Short.
<Q - Karen Short>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess it's hard to butcher my name in general. But I was just
curious, on the gas impact, you gave the $0.02 impact, but I was wondering if you could give some color on how much
of that was gas margin versus maybe weaker gallon comps in light of fuel prices being down. And then I'm wondering
as price per gallon increases, I'm thinking it should obviously help traffic. Is that fair or is there anything else to
consider in terms of the state of the consumer or the competitive landscape? And then I have a follow up.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, yeah, the gas was $0.04. So, last year, we had very strong gas prices.
<Q - Karen Short>: Oh, sorry. $0.04, yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No worries. The year earlier, in Q4, we had very strong gas profits. So that's why a year
ago, we didn't really talk about a lot. This year, we actually beat our own internal budget by a little, a little from the
beginning of the year. But, again, it was $0.04 a share lower than it was in Q4 a year ago. Generally when prices go

down while it impacts some of these basis-point-percentage calculations, we make more money. When it goes up, we
make a little less money. Although I would say for the last couple of years, there's been a new normal where when
prices went down, our view is as retail gas overall they'd lower their prices, but not as much as they could have and we
lowered it more than that and we're still able to benefit a little from it. So that was a positive. I think – yeah, it's a value
proposition more than anything that gets people in our parking lot.
And we're helped by the GasBuddy.coms out there that two years in a row that they've done it. And then the 4% rebate.
There's a lot of different promotional things at the majors out there whether it's $0.10 a gallon off, 4% is big. As the
price per gallon goes up, 4% gets bigger. And so I think that'll be a positive for us as well. But if you've been to our gas
stations when you've got, in some cases, 20 pumps now pumping at the same time and the lines move fast, but there'll
be six people or eight people in each line. That not only drives the success of the gas business, but 51 or so of those
people for every 100 come in, and even if one of them is incremental that's good for us.
<Q - Karen Short>: And so, can you give some color on what gallon comps were doing this quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know if we do that, but I know it continues to be higher than the U.S. average. And
my guess, I'll get back to that answer in a minute. Somebody's looking it up for me.
<Q - Karen Short>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I believe it's in the mid singles. It's in the mid singles unless I say otherwise.
<Q - Karen Short>: Okay. And then just to clarify on your comments on deflation. I know you were talking about
deflation in food. And then there was also deflation, I guess, in fuel. So, you had said that fuel prices should start to
rebound in late fall, but deflation in food, are you, just to clarify, five or six more months in deflation in food? Is that
what you're trying to say...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That's our best guess.
<Q - Karen Short>: ...when you're talking to buyers?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Talking to the buyers, that's our best guess.
<Q - Karen Short>: Can you call out any categories in particular?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, the biggest ones would be protein. And then you've got some other things. I was
looking at my sheets here. Hold on a second. And this is just a year-over-year this past month. Walnuts are down 47%.
That's our sell price. No, I'm sorry. That's our cost. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they're
kind of back where they were. Almonds down 38%. Whole eggs down 54%. Large eggs down 53%. I was just looking
down at the sheet of the top 50 items. So, those things – particularly things like eggs really add up.
On the inflation page, just for fun. Well, I mean, there's some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in
the last four weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8% and was over $3.5 million of credit, if
you will, to LIFO. We don't book it every month like that, but that would have been $3 million. So the biggest items on
the deflation sheet add to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. The biggest items on
the inflationary sheet add $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. Again, it gives you a sense of where it's going.
Again, another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO. That's an U.S. accounting concept. I looked at the industries
where you start off for costs on exact items at the beginning of fiscal 2016 at 100.00 and where does it go to, food was
down 2.25% with half of that, about a half a percent being in just the last couple months. Sundries was about down at
less than half a percent and not terribly changed in the last three months. Apparel, almost right at the same 100.00 a
year ago, almost right there. Computers we expect down a little under 2%. So it's all over the board.
Again, so, you have extreme categories like meat, which is high volume. But meat is also – we turn it so much faster. It
has a higher turn. It turns, I would think, more than 52 times a year, where if you have – that's a deflationary item. If
you have an inflationary item that is turning eight times in non-foods, it's going be a different story with how impactful
it is.

And your next question comes from Paul Trussell.
<Q - Paul Trussell>: Hey. Good afternoon, Richard. First just wanted to ask, is there anything you've seen from Sam's
Club or BJ's or other competition, whether it's on price or membership that you felt like you needed to react to? And
then second, I know it's been, I don't know, six years or seven years since you've given guidance, but we're moving into
a new fiscal year. And just big picture wanted to know if there's anything you can highlight that we should keep an eye
on as we model out whether it's traffic, comps, thoughts on LIFO, IT spend, payroll, any help would be nice.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, as it relates to competitive reaction, the answer is really no. I mean, we do
that for living daily and weekly, and they do it literally to the weekly comp shops in every market with direct
warehouse club competition. And certainly in the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items
at supermarkets, particularly on holiday weekends and things like that and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if
anything, our view is the mote has continued to get bigger. In other words, our competitive position pricing-wise is
stronger than it's ever been, but we are not resting on that. We're constantly trying to figure out how to wind it that's
what we do.
As it relates to guidance, we don't give guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds and anniversary of headwinds
and tailwinds, things that we've talked about in the past, we're hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for two
plus years now the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So it was more than a one-year anniversary. There was an
inflection point of late, although nobody knows what tomorrow brings on that. But it looks like it won't be as impactful
to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be a net positive. But I think it'll be a net
positive over the next few years and probably not easily calculable. But we'll figure that, and we try to figure that out.
We know that we'll improve our SG&A component of what I'll call merchant and bank fees; in other words, things
related to the new card offering. And again, we'll be more quantitative as we get through the next couple quarters and
it's more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it's good, and we look forward to doing that.
I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And again that'll improve over nearly
two-year period by about $50 million pre-tax in the membership fee line. I imagine you'll see some of that offset on
some of the margin line, although not from a competitive – to be more competitive, but not reacting to competition. I'm
trying to think of the other things.
Gas, again, I think there's a new rule in gas. There are going to be swings from time-to-time, but I don't think we are
planning anything big. I think the other issue is we have and some of you've heard this before, we have lots of little
things that are positive for us that continue to drive value, whether it's pharmacy, optical, hearing aid, whether it's
Costco travel, these are all our ticketing program in the warehouse; a new program which is brand new, we're just
testing it in Southern California with Ticketmaster. You can go to costcotickets.com and check it out. But again, some
real savings on high-end stuff. And so there's a lot of things we're doing.
We seem to have gotten some breakthroughs on the cosmetics side with SK-II. We hope that brings on others. But
clearly, given some of the challenges that brick-and-mortar in that area are impacted by, we can sell the heck out of that
stuff and provide great value to our members. And it's the kind of member that we believe that these manufacturers

want. Now talking to myself, I've talked myself into it; we've got to talk them into it.
In terms of gas stations, and here – we continue to add gas stations and hearing aids not just to new locations but to
existing locations. I would say all those things help a little bit.
Hello?
<Q - Paul Trussell>: And then just lastly on IT monetization spending for this [indiscernible] (1:07:15).
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah. Look, we'll still have an impact hit to SG&A this year and probably into next year. I
keep pushing it out a year. I guess the amount I push it out keeps getting shorter. It used to be a couple of years I push it
out, and then a year, and hopefully it'll be six months, but we are seeing deliverables. We are seeing lights at the end of
the tunnel. Our single biggest most expensive piece, which is the platform on which all the legacy buying systems and
transportation systems is there in the process of being rewritten and improved, I think you'll get some real savings from
some of those things. I know you will.
And the first order business is getting this in place. And so, these are big chunks, but I can't tell you when that
inflection point was going to be. Couple of years ago, let's say, at the end of 2014 we guessed that sometime in late
2016, early 2017. Today, I would say, sometime in 2018 probably, and if it is a little longer it's because we got more
things that we're doing, not because anything's screwed up. We've already gotten past a lot of the screw up. We know
we're spending money on and we're seeing some deliverables. And there's more to do.
<Q - Paul Trussell>: Thanks for the color, Richard.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sean Naughton.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Yeah. Just continuing on the merchandise trends where you were going over some of these
things, didn't mention organic food. Just curious kind of how that's still performing for you. I know it's been a good
growth driver. I think it's a margin enhancer. Are you seeing any tightness in supply? Are we experiencing the same
sort of deflation in that category as you saw in the rest of the food across the store? Any commentary there on where
that's going?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Thank you for reminding me. No, I didn't call you to remind me. Now, we expect organics
to be up 20% this year. Now, some of that will be some cannibalizing of some traditional conventional. But no, it's the
perfect items for us because it's our member. It helps us with Millennials on top of that. We get that. It creates a bigger
competitive pricing mote because we have as good, if not better, quality at much better pricing. In terms of supply, I
think the supply is starting to catch up with the demand out there. And I think that some of the – you've heard me talk
in the past about many of our global sourcing initiatives. I think that's going to continue to help us and make it more
competitively advantageous to us.
We have long-term relationships that we have had for a while now and have continued to build. And so there's going be
pockets of supply issues on different items sometimes. But overall, we're doing a lot in that regard ourselves whether
it's produce, with farmers, seafood, poultry, you name it.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Great. And then just another question just, I think this is on a lot of people's minds,
just on the membership fee increase potential here in the U.S. or Canada. I think we're close to the five-year
anniversary mark. I think this is something that – I know there's no schedule, but typically done every five years to six
years. Can you just update us just on your thought process there with respect to MFI in the U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It will be U.S. and Canada. We'd say we can't say anything or give any direction on it other
than you're right, every five years or six years we've done something. I think the exact fifth anniversary last time would
be this January. And the sixth anniversary would be the following January – or the next November would be the sixth
anniversary. Early this year, we've simply just said as we're going to get through the credit card conversion first, which

we've now down. And the only other comments I've made in the past is that when we look into our member loyalty, the
impact at previous increases had on renewal rates and anything like that, it's really a non-issue. And when we do it, we
of course use it to be more competitive. So it becomes a few year benefit not a onetime benefit. But that all being said,
we'll let you know when we know. We haven't made any decisions yet and really haven't talked about it a lot internally.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. That's right. One quick...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We're actually quick when we do things.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Yeah. Real quick. Just the $50 million pre-tax on the international price side that you did in
a number of markets that's over the 23 months or 24 months, that's correct, right?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That would also be over 23 months starting in September now.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure.
Operator
And your next question comes from Greg Melich.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I have a couple questions. One is, I just wanted to make sure I understood the
dynamic of the new people signup for the card. So, it was 730,000 new signups in just couple months?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: New accounts. Right.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Of the new accounts.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg Melich>: And so, now that you're getting the payments for signing those people up, in terms of the SG&A,
core ops may have de-levered 6 basis points, but that's where the benefit of those signups would have showed so that
the payroll may have deleveraged 10 basis points or 12 basis points and that gave you some net? Am I thinking about
that the right way?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. Although, I believe some – and again, there's different pieces. I look it all pretty just
straightforward and simple. What is our effective merchant fee? Unfortunately, it doesn't all go in the SG&A line,
there're certain items that benefit sales. I believe bounty is one of them. So, bounty goes to sales which improves your
margin a little bit. So that might be a couple basis points there, I haven't calculated it out. But yes, some of the offset –
again, we're talking a small piece of a big bucket is still decent to us, but we're only in it for a few months.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it. And the headwinds from payroll, how much of that was related to some of the...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: March. Yeah. We do increases at top of scale every year. Every three years, we announce
what's going to be to our employees for the next three Marches. This past March, we also, in the U.S. and Canada,
raised the bottom of the scale by $1.50. So, $11 went to $12.50 – or no, $11.50 went to $13 and $12 went to $13.50.
Just that piece, the $1.50 at the bottom of the scale was, I believe, $39 million a year, call it $40 million a year. That
would be March to March. So through the early weeks of Q3 – through the first month of Q3.
<Q - Greg Melich>: That's great. That's helpful. And then I guess lastly, and sort of thinking about how the card is
being used, I know you said it's better than your expectations. I guess, could you give us a little more color there,
especially with the people that are new to the card, right, new to Costco with it, as to how much the card is being used
outside of the club now that people have it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'll be able to give more color on that the next quarter. What I can tell you is, one of the
assumptions going into this, we want this card, just like we wanted our previous co-branded card to be our members'

top-of-wallet card. They're not only using it here, they're using it everywhere. The fact that historically I could not use
my other card at my local – in my case, my local dry cleaner or the local restaurant, if it is your top-of-wallet, there are
more places you can use it. That grows that small merchant, whoever card is being used at that small merchant, they
pay a higher merchant fee. There is this whole equation of co-branding and revenue share helps us. And so, I believe
we're already above what we were on the old card in terms of outside to inside spend.
<A>: It's higher than it was...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's higher than it was after growing, increasing it over a period of time, but we would have
expected that. We would have certainly hoped it, but we would have expected it. I don't think we necessarily knew
what to expect to start with and we probably are a little pleasantly surprised that it's already over that amount. And I
think it'll continue to grow.
<A>: We can't jump to conclusions.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I mean, [ph] Bob (1:16:15) is whispering in my ear. We cannot jump to conclusions
on this. It's all of 14 weeks old. And as it relates to new people that signed up, again, it's in the tens of thousands out of
that 730,000. It's not 100,000, it's not 200,000. And I actually haven't even looked at the data on that.
<A>: [ph] But unfortunately, (1:16:33) we don't have that much history on it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Another good comment [ph] Bob (1:16:36) is making late in the day here. It's been 14
weeks; some of them signed up last week or two weeks ago, I guess.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Yeah. And one last housekeeping. You said membership fee income was up 6% in U.S. dollar
terms.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Melich>: And what was it up in local currency?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I believe it was the same. It was $47 million versus $50 million.
<A>: It's the same.

how many people used to have just a Costco card. And then how many people had just an Amazon account, Amazon
Prime. And of course, over time, Amazon has picked up a lot and there's not as many unique ones. We would have
expected that. My family has an Amazon card, or not a card, but an account. And although I don't let them buy a lot.
No, just kidding. At the end of the day, we would expect that.
The Internet, in general, is going to take its percentage of different categories. It's going to impact different categories
and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that
we and maybe one or two other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon-proof or Internet-proof. We don't buy
that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and we do expect we're going to be impacted less. We also don't
believe we have to go crazy on the other side, but we want both. But our value proposition is best served for us when
it's in-store getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have. And so we think
that we can win on both parts. Have we lost a sale of something to an Internet provider out there, whether it's Amazon
or someone else? I'm sure we have. Have we gained more often than that? Absolutely.
As the whole media business: videos, CDs, and books. Many years later, books for us is a new normal and it's still quite
strong. Maybe it's 70% or 80% of what it used to be, but it's strong and growing. The other two have changed for a lot
of reasons including streaming. That being said, an area that a lot of traditional retailers are getting [ph] filled (80:08) in
out there is apparel. We are now in our third year averaging, compounding over the nearly 3.5 year period in the low to
mid-teens, probably in the mid-teens. I don't have the numbers in front of me and growing.
And then I think on the fresh food side, we're glad that fresh is difficult. And we don't believe that everybody is going
to just have everything delivered, but we're going to work hard to make sure they want to come and see us. As it relates
to – what was the last part of your question you were asking?
<Q - Oliver Chen>: I'm just curious about demographics and as you think about younger versus older in your core and
where your age profile is shifting. Just the reality of new customers as is this seamless shopping experience. And what
you talked about earlier, Richard, in terms of the access of convenience being a factor in terms of that. And what you're
thinking as you modernize and continue to stay fresh with younger customers as well.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, again, we have our limits by the way on some of those realities. I think for a long
time, again, convenience wasn't a word we had thought about. There're certain things we're not prepared to do. Again,
sell smaller sizes at our pricing and have everything in the world available to you. Part of our strength is what we do. I
think going forward, even with Millennials, when our success in organic didn't start by seven years or 10 years ago us
sitting around the table and saying, how are we going to go after this new generation that want this stuff.
We have great merchants and great operators in eight different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere. And they're out there
trying things. And every month is, it got better and in this case the Bay Area region. Their compatriots [ph] saw it and
(82:01) tried some things in other regions. We turn around and nobody can benefit as much and do it as well as we do.
And so, I don't think we sat around strategically saying, how do we go after them? It evolved into that.
Now that we're there, though, what else can we do for them? And whether it's food items or other things. Look, our
membership marketing people had done a study recently, a presentation recently, and it showed whatever the previous
generation was before, it was a gen whatevers. And I know I'm one of those baby boomers which is not a baby
anymore. Our average age versus the U.S. population just in three years or four years has come down two years from a
four-year gap to a two-year gap. Our goal is not necessarily to get it to a zero gap. Our goal is to drive more business.
When we look at the age group of Millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was that age,
they're buying a little less but not a lot less.
When we look at what we did and these are again data points or sound bites but when we look at what we did 2.5 years
ago on LivingSocial. And now we have a full year of renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would've
expected more of those people to be Millennials that signed up on that LivingSocial 10-day or 12-day initiative that we
did, and that was correct. What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently, bought a
little less each time but the aggregate of those two they bought more over that year, a little more, I mean, in the
low-single-digits but it was more. It didn't have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate.

Now then the walk-in people that same month that had come in on their own to sign up, just walk in the counter. And
the people that have walked in were, on average, a little older about a 10 percentage point to 15 percentage point fewer
penetration of Millennials. And so that was encouraging to us. So, while there are certainly extreme examples in New
York and the Bay Area and tech, there's a lot of people that's still aren't embarrassed to tell you that they shop in store.
And we got to have a lot of reasons to get you there. I'm also excited of what we see we're going to be doing on
dot-com, but I'm not suggesting it's going to be trying to get your dinner there delivered to your doorstep if you order
by noon. That's not going to be us.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay. Thanks, Richard. That's super helpful. Last question is like, we're really enthusiastic and
encouraged by how well you've done with your store traffic, your core store traffic trends. I mean, is your expectation
for this kind of steady low-single-digit positive momentum to continue? Do you foresee that being somewhat volatile
just given the reality of traffic trends? And as we do our models, is there anything we should know as the Jet.com deal
closes as well? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, with regard to the latter, if they're doing a little business with us, they'll probably
stop doing a little business with us. There were a few items on there I think that they bought from us, but not a lot.
What was the first question? I got off on the tangent there.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: About store traffic. Just the store traffic trends [ph] and stuff (85:29).
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. Look, we look at all these things. We block and tackle every day. I'm very excited
about our merchandising initiatives in store as well. I'm excited about some of the global sourcing stuff we're doing.
We come back from our every four-week budget meeting. We got some neat stuff coming out. I'm excited it's small but
being able to sell directly SK-II and selling a heck of a lot of it in terms of the total market of that product and people
are talking about it. And again, over 90% of our members coming into a Costco buy a fresh food item. So they're
coming there, those are kind of things – how do we get you in store? Because we get you in store, you're going buy a
lot more than you – and we've seen that even with Google Express.
That customer will shop a few less times in store, shop several more times online as well. Do both. They'll buy a little
more over the course of the year but they're buying a lot more each time when they go in store because they see all that
stuff. And so that's what we got to keep doing. I think the value thing I would encourage to look at some – do your own
pricing study of exact like items, maybe you got to adjust for quantity because you got to buy 128 or something, 124 or
something instead of 24 or something. But at the end of the day, you'll be shocked the difference in pricing not just
here. And so, we think we got a lot of things going on for us. We have no illusion, though, that the Internet is going
away or that we should do more of it online ourself as well. But clearly, we feel good about what we're doing in store
and what we're going to continue to do to drive that business.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thanks. The SK-II is going to be great. Baby boomers and luxury shoppers are going to love it so
congrats on that as well.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Thank you.

And your final question comes from Brian Nagel.
<Q - Dan Farrell>: Hi. This is Dan Farrell on for Brian Nagel. I was just wondering – thanks for sneaking us into. In
terms of the membership benefits and some of the sales benefits you guys have been seeing after the new credit card
signups, I was just wondering if you had any expectation on kind of how long those would persist throughout the year.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, your big hit's going be in the first three months or four months. And really my guess
is through Christmas, because there's going be a lot of people are buying more items, more bigger ticket items during
that period of time. There will be additional initiatives like there were for 16 years, whether it's tabling activities or
other marketing pieces that we'll continue to do.

I made a comment probably six months ago on one of these calls. In its own way, we think that this could be in a way a
gift that keeps on giving. The value proposition of what we sell is great. Some of the new things that we've done
merchandising wise, whether it's our ticket – not on meaning the Costco tickets for events done in Southern California
as a test, I'm talking about the ticketing programs that we have in store, the ever-increasing quality of our fresh foods,
what we've done in apparel, there's a lot of things going on that I think will help us.
And again, I think the credit card, the new value proposition will be one of them. When you think about the fact that
effectively on virtually everything you can get 4% off at Costco if you're an executive member and use the co-branded
Costco Citi Visa Anywhere card. For a company that marks its goods up 10% or 12%, and I would think that we're
considered we can buy pretty well and put all our purchasing power in 3,700 items and then give you back up to 4% of
that, that's a pretty good value. And we've seen that anecdotally in a big way already from businesses, and I think we'll
continue to see it.
<Q - Dan Farrell>: Okay. Great. And then just a follow up regarding the transition. Did you guys see any, I guess,
inflection in sales of things like big ticket items that people may have been holding off on early when the card was
being transitioned and then once the transition cards were activated, did you see any inflection in those items?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We did. Again, it's more dinner party discussion. The biggest area we saw was hearing aids
of all of things, and of course that's not Millennials. And the other thing would be big ticket electronics and the like.
And my guess is in the case of the hearing aids, I wouldn't be surprised since there is a direct Costco employee member
conversation eye-to-eye. I wouldn't be surprised if there're some people out there that over their several weeks leading
up to it. They said, if you wait and use this card, you'll get another 2% off on a $2,000 item. So, my guess is that that
impacted that a little bit too.

And there are no further questions.
Richard A. Galanti
