Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. Turning to slide 4, we want to start with a short review of our
2014 financial performance. On the left, we summarize our 2014 revenue composition by segment. We have a
diversified portfolio of leading businesses. These include Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, which
comprises our fixed income and equity businesses, as well as Investment Management and Investing & Lending. With
respect to diversification, last year no single operating segment contributed more than 25% of total net revenues.
Turning to our recent performance, we have seen a steady improvement in our financial results over the past three
years. Amid what has been an uneven economic environment, our annual net revenues have shown stability, averaging
approximately $34.3 billion since 2012. This is particularly notable, given that we have sold businesses and
investments over the past few years that contributed approximately $2.3 billion of revenues in 2012. It's obvious, but
again worth underscoring. This means that revenues were only flat across the past three years because we were able to
deliver [ph] underlying (3:06) growth.
For example, between 2012 and 2014, Investment Banking and Investment Management generated $2.4 billion of
incremental revenues. Over the past three years, we generated $23 billion of capital through net earnings to common.
Net earnings are up 13% in this timeframe, which we show on the right-hand side of the slide. This solid earnings
growth has been helped by our continued focus on expenses. Since 2012, we reduced our total operating expenses by
3%, including a 110 basis point reduction in our compensation ratio.
I'll now turn it over to Liz, who will provide an update on our balance sheet, funding, liquidity, and capital. Liz?
Liz Beshel Robinson
Thanks, Harvey. On slide 5, as you may be aware, we made several key changes to our balance sheet over the last 12
months. Since last year-end, our total balance sheet declined by $55 billion, or 6%. Specifically, CCAR and the SLR
requirements made the balance sheet more expensive. In response, we undertook a firm-wide initiative to reduce
activities with lower returns. Ultimately, we've brought down our matchbook and other Secured Client Financing assets
by more than $50 billion since the end of 2013. Our Institutional Client Services assets also declined by 6% over the
last 12 months.
Even after these changes, approximately two-thirds of our balance sheet comprises Institutional Client Services assets
and Secured Client Financing assets, which are dedicated to serving our client franchise. Offsetting some of this decline
was growth in our Investing & Lending assets, which rose by $18 billion and primarily reflected an increase in our
lending to corporate and private wealth clients. Despite continued strong growth in lending, our Investing & Lending
assets remain relatively small, representing less than 10% of our total assets. Our balance sheet also continues to have
significant excess liquidity, which I will discuss in more detail later. As you can see in the graph on the right side of the
page, over 20% of our balance sheet remains in excess liquidity and cash.
On slide 7, let's quickly run through an update of our primary sources of funding. Here we show the contribution of
funding from our equity and liabilities, excluding customer payables and trading liabilities. As we have discussed in the
past, we take a very conservative approach to funding the balance sheet. We emphasize counterparty diversity and
ensure that the term of our funding is significantly in excess of what our highly liquid balance sheet requires. With
nearly 40% of the balance sheet funded by shareholders' equity, long-term debt, and deposits, we feel very good about
the strength of our funding profile.
The size and mix of our funding book starts with an assessment of our balance sheet. Our assets are primarily driven by
our client franchise and activity levels, coupled with our dynamic capital allocation process. We use an active,
centralized process to monitor and manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. To structure the mix of our
liabilities, we carefully design our funding plan to align with our assets. The appropriate funding source for each asset
is informed by asset liquidity in normal and stressed environments, business strategy, and expected holding periods.
We also look independently at the liability side of our balance sheet to ensure that we conservatively manage our

funding book and avoid significant maturity concentrations.
Turning now to slide 8, you can see a snapshot of our long-term unsecured funding activity. We were an active and
opportunistic issuer in 2014, with roughly $29 billion of long-term issuances. This included approximately $27 billion
of vanilla unsecured debt, raised across a broad range of tenors, currencies, and channels, as well as a $2 billion
perpetual preferred offer last April. Our funding strategy continues to focus on diversification, with non-U.S. dollar
currency representing 38% of our issuances last year. We have also continued our focus on staggering our maturities.
Because we tend to issue at the beginning of the year, we have been purposely executing deals with non-round tenors,
including our 5.25-year U.S. dollar and 7.5-year euro issuances this year. The result is prudently spaced maturities with
approximately $20 billion of vanilla debt coming due annually through 2017, as seen at the bottom of the slide.
We also remain very focused on maintaining a conservative long-term funding profile. Our 2014 issuance had a
weighted average maturity of 8.6 years, compared to a roughly eight-year weighted average maturity of our overall
unsecured long-term debt portfolio. As you can see, over the last several years, we have roughly matched our maturities
with new issuance, though last year we exceeded our maturities. Our best estimate is that issuance this year will be
similar to our maturities, but we do have some flexibility given last year's positive net issuance. On preferreds, future
insurance will depend on a variety of factors, including regulatory capital constraints and the ability to deploy marginal
balance sheet at opportunistic returns. Going forward, we will continue to be opportunistic, seeking to execute
high-quality funding with significant term and counterparty diversity.
Let's move on to slide 9. On the top left of the slide, we show some notable changes in our secured funding over the
past several years. Our secured funding liabilities are down by more than 40% since 2012. Over the same period, our
balance sheet has decreased by about 9%. This reduction reflects many of the balance sheet changes mentioned earlier,
particularly our matched book assets, which drove a corresponding reduction in client-related secured funding
liabilities. Despite this reduction, our conservative funding strategy has not changed.
As it relates to our secured funding philosophy, our program is designed to ensure the following five important core
principles: significant term, counterparty diversification, excess capacity, pre-funded excess liquidity, and conservative
stress testing. At the bottom of this slide, we show a number of key metrics of our core secured funding book excluding
the funding for GCE-eligible collateral.
First, we focus on maturities, as long, contractual maturities provide the greatest stability to the book. Asset liquidity
drives the tenor for each of the different collateral types, with much greater term for assets that are less liquid. The
all-in weighted average maturity of our book exceeds 120 days. Over 75% of our book is comprised of funding for
equities and funding with collateral flexibility, where we have contractual rights to post collateral ranging from
treasuries to non-investment-grade debt. The weighted average maturity for both of those categories is significantly
greater than 120 days.
We also diversify counterparties in order to reduce our dependence on any individual counterparty or type of
counterparty. As of the fourth quarter, we sourced secured funding for more than 80 counterparties for
non-GCE-eligible collateral. In order to achieve this diversification, we have sourced capacity away from the
traditional repo product and have increased our sourcing efforts in the form of secured notes and secured loans. We
have also focused on reducing our reliance on traditional U.S. money market lenders and increased our focus on global
corporates.
Moving to slide 10, as you can see on the bottom right, our $83 billion of deposits have grown to become a meaningful
contributor, representing 11% of our total liabilities. Deposit balances are up by 18% since 2012 and up threefold since
the end of 2008. A key driver of our growth has been the expansion of deposits from our private banking clients. These
deposits totaled $34 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. In addition, deposits include $26 billion of brokered CDs
with a weighted average maturity of greater than three years.
Another key source of our deposit base comes from deposit sweep accounts. These deposits come from third-party
firms and have important characteristics that help make them more durable. One, we have long-term contractual
relationships providing for access to the deposits. And, two, our contracts have terms providing seniority for Goldman

Sachs in the event of a deposit withdrawal from the third-party firm. We are also currently focused on growing our
international deposits, which reached close to $14 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Let's turn to our capital base. On slide 11, on the left, you can see that total shareholders' equity has continued to grow.
At $82.8 billion, it has increased 9% since 2012. In conjunction with balance sheet reductions, our gross leverage
excluding cash, cash and securities segregated, and collateralized agreements, declined to 5.5 times. This marks a
record low for the firm. Taking a longer-term perspective on capital, the growth is even more substantial, with our
common equity base up by 85% and our leverage down by 61% since the fourth quarter of 2007.
Let's spend a moment going over our regulatory capital ratios on slide 12. On the top left, we show our current Basel III
common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.2%. This puts us ahead of the preliminary expectation for the proposed requirements.
In addition, let's focus on the supplementary leverage ratio shown, on the lower-left side of the slide. We improved the
ratio by approximately 80 basis points over the last three quarters of 2014 through a variety of management actions,
including growth in regulatory capital and a reduction in leverage exposure, both on and off balance sheet. As of the
fourth quarter of 2014, we estimate our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.0%, compliant with the 2018 minimum. If
you further incorporate the capital impacts of reducing our fund investments to comply with the Volcker Rule, we
estimate it would add approximately 40 basis points to our ratio.
In addition to record capital levels, we also continue to maintain near-record levels of excess liquidities, which we
detail on slide 13. We held $180 billion on average in 2014, up approximately 5% over the past two years, despite our
overall balance sheet reductions over that time. Our excess liquidity pool continues to remain high quality, with
approximately 75% made up of U.S. government bonds, overnight cash deposits primarily held at the Federal Reserve,
and U.S. federal agency obligations. The remaining 25% represents a narrowly defined set of high-quality securities
primarily German, French, Japanese, and United Kingdom government bonds. Additionally, based on our best estimate,
we continue to remain in compliance with the fully phased-in liquidity coverage ratio minimum. So we feel very good
about our liquidity.
Now that we've completed a review of our credit profile, we would like to take a few minutes to discuss what we
believe are some of the differentiating credit characteristics relative to our peers. We'll start on slide 15. While we
continue to strive to achieve leadership positions in each of our businesses, we have never sought to be the largest firm.
As a result, we are considerably smaller and more straightforward than many of our closest competitors, with total
assets that are less than half the size of our U.S. peers on average. And, given this focused approach, we are capable of
managing our most important operations across a smaller number of key entities.
Additionally, our firm remains committed to our mark-to-market philosophy, which is a key tenet of our risk
management process. Greater than 95% of our assets approximate fair value. Marking our assets to market provides a
number of benefits. One, it helps provide a clearer understanding of risk. Two, it provides a more accurate view of our
equity base, given it reflects current market values. These are benefits that should accrue to our creditors.
Our balance sheet is also supported by significant levels of capital and long-term debt issued by our holding company.
A great example is our positioning for the upcoming total loss-absorbing capital rule, where our historical funding
strategy aligns with the proposed regulations. While we await a proposal from the U.S. regulators and a number of
issues need to be clarified, we believe that we are conservatively positioned. Based on our preliminary calculations, we
estimate our TLAC ratio is greater than 30%.
So, with that, let me offer some closing comments on slide 16. Goldman Sachs has a diversified and straightforward set
of businesses. Relative to many of our competitors, we have a more targeted focus within our businesses, resulting in a
more defined global footprint. Ultimately, we have fewer business lines, fewer employees, and a smaller balance sheet.
We have a high-quality, liquid balance sheet. Our inventory, which serves the needs of our client franchise, is high
velocity and largely marked to market on a daily basis. We have built significant capital buffers and retain very high
levels of liquidity. These improvements have been transformative and have coincided with significant regulatory
change. The implementation of new regulations will have an ongoing, positive effect on Goldman Sachs' credit profile.
This is an important point. Compliance with new regulation means Goldman Sachs will continue to be better
capitalized and have more excess liquidity.

Lastly, we have been pleased that we have been able to achieve our primary objective of delivering industry-leading
returns. This is also an important credit strength, particularly during the more difficult economic conditions over the
past few years. Over the last 10 years, our average return on common equity was approximately 16%, more than 2.5
times the peer average. We've also achieved these results with significantly less volatility, as the variability of our
earnings from 2005 to 2014 has been a fraction of the peer average. And, going forward, we continue to strive to
improve returns while maintaining a conservative balance sheet, funding, capital, and liquidity profile.
With that, Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question is from the line of Pri de Silva with Credit Suisse (sic) [CreditSights]. Pease go ahead.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Good afternoon and I have two questions. First one is out of your -
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You're a little difficult to hear. Can you speak up a little bit or maybe get a little closer to
the phone?
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Sure. Sorry about that. How's this?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry. Good afternoon.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Yep. So out of the long-term debt of $167.6 billion, how much of that is structured notes?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: I think I heard the question. How much of our outstanding long-term debt is structured
notes?
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Yes, Liz.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Okay. Thanks for that question. So we have not yet disclosed the breakdown of our
long-term unsecured debt between structured notes and plain vanilla debt. I'd say that structured notes have been an
important product for us to issue, because it is useful from a client-franchise perspective. It provides good and diverse
funding, but it is not a material part of our overall funding book.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Okay. And the second question – it's a little bit more conceptual in nature. Given that the U.S.
GCE capital buffer is calculated and incorporates an element for short-term funding, how do you look at your secured
funding, given the higher GCE requirements coming down the pike?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Sure. So secured funding has been an important part of our overall funding base for a
long time and continues to be. We feel very good about secured funding as a source of funding. The term of that book
is quite appropriate for the asset liquidity of the assets it finance. It has good durability that's enhanced, I think, by the
quality of the underlying collateral, and it adds diversity to our overall liability book. We focus a lot, as I said earlier,
on quality of that and risk mitigating that book. But we do take everything into account. We understand the regulatory
changes that are going on there. We are ultimately a very dynamic business manager. We will watch as the world
evolves, so if either regulatory incentives or counterparty behaviors change, we'll adjust the incentives, and we'll adjust
that book accordingly.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Great. So I guess the way I read it is it's too early to look at the impact of the increasing capital
costs until we know what the rules are and how things play out.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I think it's a good point you're raising. It actually is sort of fundamental about how
we think about regulatory change across the entire rule set. There's obviously been a whole host of rules that have

already had an impact on the way one has to think about secured funding or liquidity coverage ratio, other rules,
standardized ratio, et cetera. And so – but I think fundamentally, our philosophy on all these things has been to work
with the regulators on the development of a thoughtful rule set, and then when we get the final rule, to the extent that
we need to make adjustments, whether it's balance sheet size or some of the things you've seen us do, we'll wait to see
the final rule. I think one of the most important underlying things that the regulators have done is obviously – is they've
given firms the opportunity with enough of a glide path to make adjustments. So all firms can be thoughtful about the
changes they may or may not need to make.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.

Your next question is from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi. Good afternoon, Liz, Harvey, and thanks for doing this call.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Just a couple of questions. Not to beat a dead horse on the energy issue, but could you talk a
little bit about where you're stressing your clients down to? Are you starting to look at them differently as they
recalculate their borrowing base? And as you go a little bit further out, you see an industry that's going to need
restructuring, are you going to not only provide them with capital solutions, but are you going to also provide them
with credit? And do you run up against any Fed guidelines for leverage as a result of that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a great question. Obviously we have significant client relationships built across
our commodity franchise and our investment banking business in terms of the sector you're talking about. I think the
important thing is of course, the energy price decline, while it's picked up significant momentum and attention
obviously in the fourth quarter and currently, it's been in view really since the third quarter, when the oil price really
started to slide. And so these things have been in view for a while.
I'll answer your question – I'll try and do it quickly; it's a big question. First, in terms of the commodity franchise itself
– and that's where we, as you know, provide hedging solutions to both producers and consumers of energy products. I
think the best way to think about that business is that it's essentially – it's an interesting term, but right way in terms of
its business structure. And by that I mean, for producers that have hedged with us, obviously if the price goes down, we
have an obligation to them and those contracts are valuable. For consumers, those contracts are obviously out of the
money, but those are hedges to their underlying cost structure. And so, again, these are all hedges, and so, as I say, we
think of those as right way.
In terms of our lending exposure, probably the – maybe the best way to encapsulate for you is just if you take a look at
our funded exposure to the non-investment-grade sector of the business, it's less than $2 billion at the end of the year.
So we obviously pay very close attention to it, but in the context of the firm's capital, it's not material. In terms of the
industry as we work through this, we think we're very well positioned to provide our clients with lots of value. It may
come in any number of forms. It could come in the form of capital; it could come in the form of hedging guidance; it
could come in the form of restructurings and mergers. This has all happened quite quickly, again, over the last two
quarters, but obviously, as you point out, if we have a sustained low energy price, there'll be a lot of activity in the
sector, and we just think we're well positioned to work with our clients in it.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: And in terms of – the Fed has been very vigilant on leveraged lending guidelines. Several of
these companies that you may look to restructure will be close or in breach of those kind of guidelines. Is that any type
of problem for you doing business in this sector?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So obviously with respect to any of the regulatory guidelines regardless of what they are,
we obviously look to comply. I think one of the important things here is if you're talking – for example, let's say you're
talking about a rescue financing.

<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think that's a fundamental activity that we want Goldman Sachs to be able to provide. I
can't point to a specific case where rescue financing would be prohibited by the leveraged lending guidelines, but
obviously we would work with the regulators because we want to do what's best for the client and the industry and
obviously also operate in complete compliance with any regulatory rules.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. And just one quick one for Liz, if I could. I know that you've done more funding in
euros lately. You're not doing it in a vacuum, though. And I think that we've seen a lot of U.S. banks coming in euros,
and are you starting to get pushback from that market that they're already getting a little saturated with U.S. names?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: No. Look, our funding plan is executed very opportunistically. We watch across the range
of markets and look at where there might be useful opportunities to, again, improve our diversification and term in that
book. We have been more active in euros than we had been for a number of years, but that has been in response to
demand and interest that we've seen there.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Monteleone with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Hey, thank you. A question on slide 12, around the SIFI buffer and your early expectation
on the Fed's NPR. The 100 basis points – is that purely from the second scale that the Fed provided, or is that at all
driven by short-term wholesale financing?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Look – Brian, it's a good question. So I guess the first thing I'd say is we still only have
an NPR; we don't have a final rule out yet. That hundred basis points is just a preliminary expectation. And that would
take into account the totality of the rule that the Fed has provided – again, in very preliminary form.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay. And then one of your peers mentioned the move in the euro versus the dollar. They
thought would be, to most U.S. banks, end up being higher. Did you guys consider that at all in this?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, again, to echo what Liz said, we've incorporated everything we can in terms of our
evaluation. But, again, I'd remind you, as Liz said, it's preliminary in terms of our assessment, and it's an ongoing rule. I
think – so we've incorporated the FX assessment. I think the important take-away here is the regulators have done an
enormous amount of high-quality work over the last several years. I think some of these nuances would be somewhat
impossible to anticipate and to really understand the implications in aggregate. And so I think this would be an
interesting thing for the industry and regulators to take a look at.
I think we would probably all agree, sitting around a table, that if you took a hypothetical framework where you had,
let's just say, a quickly declining currency base, and let's just assume for the moment that that's accompanied by slower
economic growth, versus a appreciating currency which, let's just say, was accompanied by improving economic
growth. I think we'd probably all sit around that table and say, geez, this seems like a slightly strange outcome that
financial institutions in this lower-growth part of the world would end up with lower capital and those in the
faster-growing part of the world would end up with more capital.
Again, we'll work with the regulators, and all these things, I think, are – as I said, there are interesting implications to
think through. We haven't spent a lot of time thinking about solutions on this, but for example maybe it should be a
longer-dated rolling average. Maybe they should look at caps. There's, I think, probably a lot of ways where this issue
could be thoughtfully addressed. But, again, I'm just giving you the big picture.

<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Yes, no, thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more, on the issuance side. And
maybe I'll take the other side of the way Robert asked it. You guys said 62% of issuance in dollars, 38% in non-dollar
currencies last year. Could that non-dollar tick up even further this year?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Sure. I think probably the same answer, I guess, is that we do continue to be
opportunistic. I think our goal would be to have as diverse a funding book as we can possibly have, but ultimately
investor demand drives that, along with, again, the opportunity to do really high-quality long-dated funding and have
that trade well in the aftermarket, so we can have that long-term relationship with the buyers of our paper that we want.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] John Landsberg with Wells Fargo. (33:16) Please go ahead.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Hey, guys. It's actually James Strecker [Wells Fargo]. Thanks for doing the call.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good afternoon.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: I'm probably going to come under a little bit of wrath here, but I'm going to do one more
question on the whole foreign currency issuance. Just a little bit more about – I know your [ph] open to drive (33:34)
has kind of diversified the funding base by currency, and also it's largely demand driven, but in terms of like the
swinging economics with the move in local rates and obviously FX swings, I mean, is there a sense that that percentage
could go high, like above 50%, for example? Or do you think that would be a little bit too much?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: No, we don't really target it at the beginning of the year to have a certain percentage. So,
again, it really depends on how markets evolve over the course of the year, what our funding needs are, where there are
attractive opportunities – again, whether it's pricing or ability to do an interesting maturity bucket that helps with our
forward maturities moving. So really we want to just get the right long-term balance across the various markets that we
issue in and, again, find good opportunities from our perspective and our investors' perspective.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. Thanks, Liz. And maybe just like a different variation on the funding question.
Obviously last year was above what you've done for the last several years, above what you have in terms of maturities
going forward. How much of that was to take advantage of the receptive market, low spreads, low all-in cost, versus
potentially this shifting funding mix away from less regulatory funding stuff, if you think structured notes, maybe even
like firm-driven repo or FHLB balances in terms of like SLR and LCR and even TLAC, I guess?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: That's a good question. So, look, I'd encourage you to look maybe over a longer-term
horizon, right? So over the last few years, we've essentially replaced the maturing long-term debt with new issuance,
although that never perfectly matched year to year. And so last year was one of the years that we were opportunistic
and saw some great opportunities, great demand for our name. I think the strength of our credit profile is reflected in
that. And ultimately we issued a bit more than we had maturing. So it does give us some extra flexibility this year. But,
again, over time I think – assuming everything remains equal – you would expect to see our issuance and our maturities
roughly offset each other – again, over time. But, of course, if things change, if our balance sheet mix or size changes,
if the regulatory environment changes, if our client activity levels change, we'll adjust our issuance plans accordingly.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. And then maybe I'll switch to Harvey for one question. Obviously Q4 had its
challenges in FICC, for not only you but the industry. And we all maybe were introduced to the term of bad volatility.
But at what point does that morph into good volatility? Now that the shocks seem to be over, whether you think about
the mini Treasury flash crash or obviously what happened to crude and energy, and even in terms of rates, shouldn't
this be beneficial for the business longer term, provided there aren't any more really dire near-term shocks or short-term
shocks?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. Look, it's a great question. In the beginning of the third quarter – and I think these
things need to be looked at over very long periods of time, but I'll pick a short period of time in just the second half of

the year – we talked about in the third quarter, July and August were very quiet. September saw a lot of activity, then
we came into the fourth quarter, and you saw a weakening in credit, somewhat driven by the energy sector. We also
had now the Treasury flash crash. And I think the way we've been thinking about it is volatility with liquidity and
confidence is always a good thing; volatility with limited liquidity, where you have more gapping crisis, that's the kind
of thing that leaves clients less confident, and they tend to pull back a bit. I think as time progresses and you see more
stable economic growth and you see issues get resolved, I think the long-term trend feels good. But we may be in this
back-and-forth environment with respect to clients for a while.
Look, to the extent to which expectations change around clients' ability to have continuous liquidity or more continuous
liquid function, then you could see a change in the underlying. So we'll have to see what the environment holds.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. And then, based on your comments – maybe if I could just slide in one more real
quick – do you think there's a growing awareness within D.C. or within the regulators specifically, about the volatility
absent liquidity and the potential impacts? I mean, we heard some chatter that they were kind of spooked by the flash
crash in the Treasury market. Do you have any thoughts there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, I don't have any special insights that you wouldn't have. I will say that in general in
our engagement with the regulators and their outreach to us across a broad spectrum, I think it's something that they
obviously take quite seriously in terms of under the umbrella of well-functioning markets, regardless of what that
market is. And I think it's fair to say we all have an obligation to focus on it.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Jiang>: Hey, guys. Liz, can you confirm that you guys are already at the – or almost at the 1.5% bucket for
preferreds, according to my calculations from the last issuance? And why would you want to go over that potential
1.5% bucket?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Hey, David. Sure. Look, you are correct. We're at about 150 basis points today on
standardized risk-weighted assets. In terms of your other question, why that might not be necessarily where we want to
be, say in our capital planning process, we think about all the relevant factors we can think of, which would include our
amount of capital, our mix of capital, what our binding capital constraints might be today or going forward, whether we
have opportunities to deploy our balance sheet at attractive returns relative to the cost of capital. So we think about all
of those things. And in some situations it might actually make sense to be above 150 basis points of preferreds in our
capital structure.
<Q - David Jiang>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of James Campbell with CalPERS. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Campbell>: Great. Thank you. Thank you, Harvey and Liz, for hosting this call. This is very helpful. I
wanted to go to your bank OpCo for a moment and just ask if the debt issuance out of that bank OpCo was something
that is on the table, given the advantages that basically structure or seniority might give you in terms of funding? Or is
that really something that is just not on the table at the moment?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Hey, James. So, look, we – as I've probably said already, we take every opportunity into
account when we think about how and where we do our funding. We have to date issued virtually all of our senior

unsecured debt out of our holding company. As we look at the emerging TLAC rules, that seems to be a pretty good
strategy that's very consistent with what they're looking for. That said, we will consider all other opportunities. We
have not yet issued debt out of our bank entity. You're right, given it has a slightly higher rating, it might come in at a
slightly lower cost. That said, cost has never been the biggest driver when we think about our funding and liquidity risk
mitigation, and so it's something we'll consider. It's probably not top of my list right now.
<Q - James Campbell>: Okay. And is that really just because of the business strategy for how that unit is being run
and what assets are going in? Is that largely what leaves you kind of with the current mix?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: No, I'd say to date, look, we've been able to raise deposit financing that we think is both
appropriate and attractive to finance the assets that we've had in our bank. And so, for now, that's been a successful
strategy. And, again, as we evolve the terms of the asset side of the balance sheet, we'll also look carefully at the
liability side of the balance sheet.
<Q - James Campbell>: Okay. Fantastic. And my last question actually just goes to the call report. I noticed for that
bank sub that there was about $2 billion in sub-debt that was listed in the third quarter call report, and I was wondering
what that was specifically.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: So that is intercompany subordinated debt we push down from the HoldCo to the bank
that meets -
<Q - James Campbell>: Right.

Your next question is from the line of [ph] Ryan Mutkus with Citigroup. (42:06) Please go ahead.
<Q>: Afternoon. Thank you again for hosting this call. Just two quick questions -
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Hey, [ph] Ryan (42:13).
<Q>: – on disclosures. The first being, your Basel III ratios and also the SLR ratios – have you given any
consideration, perhaps, to disclosing those in the actual quarterly earnings statement, rather than waiting for the call?
And then lastly, regarding the Investing & Lending segment of business, has there been any thoughts about increasing
some of the disclosures around the portfolios within perhaps the 10-K this year or maybe in future quarterly
statements?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, on the ratios, we haven't gotten any incoming from investors that having them in the
earnings release would be of any benefit. We're happy to look at it. I think we do put in the Basel III transitional, but
we don't give every ratio, and we like to cover it on the call, which you know follows. But we'll take it all under
advisement. And I would say that broadly across the other question as well. We haven't gotten a ton of feedback on it,
but if we think things are helpful we obviously would look to provide them.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of quick ones I guess. Hi, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Interested in knowing what you think the market may be continuing to misunderstand with
respect to your fundamentals? It seems somewhat stubbornly keep your benchmark debt spreads wider than a number
of your G-SIFI peers, some of which may have slightly lower ratings than Goldman does. And, secondly, just wanted
to get your big-sky picture view of what worries you the most out there as you and Liz look out at 2015?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So – well, maybe I'll answer that one. In terms of the spread dynamic, Mike, we agree
with you. We think we should trade higher. And so I don't know if there's a simpler answer than that. Liz specifically
went through a whole host of things in terms of metrics, the quality of our financing, the size of the balance sheet. So
we would generally agree with you. Now, having said that, we spend our time focused on running the business, and the
market from time to time will value different propositions differently. And so we really spend our time focused on our
clients and our business strategy. What was the second part of the question?
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Just curious -
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Oh, what are we worried about.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Yeah, what's your chief worry out there.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Liz just reminded me, what we're worried about. I don't know. You know us pretty well,
Mike. It's generally in our nature to be worried and paranoid all the time, even when things feel good. And sometimes
when things feel good, we tend to overemphasize the worry muscles as much as we possibly can, which is part of the
day job. And so all the things that are in your view, we continue to focus on. Someone asked earlier about the energy
sector. There's other spots in the world and just geopolitical, but I don't think there's anything that I would mention to
you that wouldn't be sort of front and center in terms of your frame also. Ultimately this direction of economic growth
is something that we're monitoring very closely globally.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Okay. Does the Greece situation and that volatile part of the world right now, does that – are
you relatively well positioned not to see any impact to your balance sheet or income statement?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So from the perspective of direct exposure to Greece, immaterial in terms of the firm's
risk exposures. Obviously Greece has been in view for a very, very long period of time. That's something obviously all
market participants will watch, because we'll have to see whether or not there are knock-on effects and how it gets
navigated. Ultimately it may just be one of these situations, and at least for right now we're very focused on our clients
and working with our clients in terms of all related issues. But immaterial exposure from a firm perspective.

<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Thanks, [ph] Larry. (47:02). Good to hear from you. I guess I'd say we spend a lot of time
and have tried for a very long period of time to balance the funding, the capital, the liquidity that we have appropriately
across the full range of our entities, our parent company and all of our various subsidiaries. So that has been a
long-standing policy for us. Obviously as the world has become more heavily regulated, it has become increasingly
challenging to make sure we understand and meet all of the local regulations at our subsidiaries, as well as the global or
consolidated ones that we experience across the holding company. GSI is no different than the rest of that. We are
carefully monitoring our capital and our funding and our liquidity requirements relative to the local regulatory
minimums. And we are currently at or in excess of the requirement there today.
<Q>: Okay. All right. That's very straightforward. Thanks very much.
