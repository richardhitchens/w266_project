for all you have done in helping us advance our mission to continually provide a high level of service to the investment
community.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In 2014, we built upon the momentum we created in 2013,
celebrating key milestones and addressing challenges. We continued building our financial track record, achieving our
adjusted earnings guidance range and increasing our important dividend payment to shareholders.
We announced several growth initiatives that will position the company for the future, and completed our strategic
review of the international business. In August, we entered into a sale agreement with Dynegy for our commercial
Midwest generation portfolio. We also advanced our coal ash management practices and as I will discuss in a moment,
we are close to an agreement with the government to resolve the ongoing grand jury investigation into our coal ash
basin management.
Today, we initiated our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75, and also extended our long-term adjusted
earnings per share growth objective of 4% to 6% through 2017. This guidance reflects strong growth in our Regulated
Utilities, offset by near-term headwinds from foreign exchange rates and oil prices in our international business. Steve
will provide further details about our financial plan in a few minutes.
Let me review a few operational highlights outlined on slide four, including our progress on ash basin closure strategies
and Edwardsport. Our fleet and grid performed well during 2014, especially during the demands of the polar vortex last
winter. Our regulated nuclear fleet set a new net generation record and achieved an annual capacity factor of 93%, the
16th consecutive year above 90%.
We continue to deliver significant benefits from the 2012 merger, and we are on track to achieve the $687 million of
savings for our Carolinas customers over the first five years of the merger. In fact, 2.5 years into the merger, we have
generated over 60% of the guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings.
We also learned from the challenges of the Dan River coal ash spill. We used this event as a catalyst to strengthen our
ash management practices and to accelerate our base enclosure strategies, positioning us well for compliance with both
the North Carolina and federal CCR requirements.
We are currently in settlement discussions with the U.S. government related to the ongoing federal grand jury
investigation of the February 2014 Dan River coal ash spill and ash basin operations at other North Carolina coal
plants. We expect a proposed agreement could be reached and filed in the next several days for consideration by the
court.
If approved, any proposed agreement would resolve the ongoing grand jury investigation of the company's coal ash
basin management. Based upon our assessment of probable financial exposure related to any agreement, we've
recognized a charge of approximately $100 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. This charge has
been recognized as a special item and, therefore, excluded from our adjusted earnings per share. As the investigation
and our discussions are ongoing, I will not be able to comment further on this matter. We will keep you updated as we
have further information to share.
In last year's session, North Carolina enacted legislation which requires the company to close all ash basins in the state
beginning with four high-priority sites; Dan River, Asheville, Riverbend, and Sutton. We have also submitted plans
with South Carolina regulators to excavate ash from basins at our retired W.S. Lee Steam Station.
Our five-year financial plan through 2019 includes $1.3 billion of estimated costs to excavate and close these five sites.
As our planning progresses, our capital plans will be updated. We expect to provide cost estimates to close the
remaining basins once site-specific closure plans and time frames are approved by the Coal Ash Commission by early

2016.
Under the EPA's new federal coal combustion residuals rule, science continues to support nonhazardous designation of
coal ash as a waste. Due to our actions over the past year, we have already performed a lot of the initial work and
assessments needed to begin establishing closure plans under the new federal rules.
As the federal rule is currently written, there are some inconsistencies with the requirements under the new law in
North Carolina, primarily with ash base enclosure time frames. Ultimately, we will adjust our existing ash management
plans as necessary to comply with all state and federal regulations.
As one of the cleanest generating stations in the world, our Edwardsport plant in Indiana is an example of how we're
reducing emissions across our system. Edwardsport continued on its path of improved operations during 2014,
achieving gasifier availability factors of between 70% and 75% in the second and third quarters. An extended planned
outage in the fourth quarter impacted results. The impact or the plant, which began commercial operation in June of
2013, also achieved substantial completion under the contract with General Electric in December.
On the regulatory front, the Indiana Commission held hearings on the IGCC-12 and IGCC-13 semiannual riders earlier
this month. Interveners have challenged the in-service determination in the plant's early months of performance. Orders
are expected mid-year for these proceedings. Edwardsport is well positioned to be a valuable resource for our Indiana
customers for decades to come.
I'll also highlight the performance of our commercial renewables portfolio in 2014. This business exceeded its financial
target of $50 million in net income for the year and invested over $500 million in new wind and solar projects. Since its
inception in 2007, we have invested over $4 billion in this business and will have over 2000 megawatts of wind and
solar generation in service by the end of this year.
With our acquisition of a majority interest in REC Solar earlier this month, our commercial renewables business is
expanding beyond its past focus on utility scale renewable projects to a broader array of products and services. This
business will focus on development of distributed solar generation and energy solutions for the commercial sector.
REC Solar has more than 140 megawatts of solar generation already on customers' rooftops or under construction, and
we expect growth in this business as we roll out solutions to commercial customers nationwide.
2014 was also an active and successful year in advancing our growth strategy. During the year, we announced new
growth initiatives representing a total investment of approximately $8 billion. These initiatives, including new
generation and new gas and electric infrastructure, are summarized on slide five.
Since our last call in November, a number of these initiatives achieved important milestones. First in Indiana, our plan
to invest $1.9 billion in T&D infrastructure over seven years was filed under state legislation. Hearings were held last
month and a decision is expected in mid-2015.
Next, our new generation investment in the Carolinas; in December, we received FERC approval to purchase the North
Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency's minority ownership in some of our existing nuclear and coal generation
for $1.2 billion. We have also filed for approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to transfer the nuclear
licenses. The parties will work diligently to close the transaction as quickly as possible, with a target to close in late
2015 or early 2016.
We also continue to advance our regulated renewable strategy. In North Carolina, we have seen strong growth in solar,
supported by compliance with state renewable portfolio standards and state tax incentives. In fact, North Carolina
currently ranks fourth in the nation measured by total installed solar capacity.
By the end of this year, we expect to own over 100 megawatts of solar generation in addition to a significant amount of
PPAs where we purchase the output from other solar-generating units in the state. This growth will help us continue to
comply with the state's growing solar requirements.

In South Carolina, we are laying the groundwork to develop solar generation for our customers that want that option.
Just last week, we proposed several programs that will expand renewable options for South Carolina customers under
recent legislation. The programs are expected to add up to 110 megawatts of solar energy by 2021, including more than
50 megawatts of utility scale solar.
Next, I'll provide an update on our new generation investments in Florida. Last month, we filed a petition with the
Florida Commission to approve our $166 million acquisition of Calpine's 599 megawatt Osprey combined cycle plant.
As part of the filing, we are also seeking approval for construction of the Suwannee peakers in the event that the
acquisition of Osprey is not approved timely.
Finally, an update on infrastructure projects in our commercial business. On the gas infrastructure front, there's good
progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline joint venture, with Dominion, Piedmont, and AGL Resources. The utilities
commissions in both North and South Carolina have approved our regulated subsidiaries entering into 20-year gas
transportation agreements with the pipeline.
The project also requires FERC approval, which the joint venture will seek to secure by mid-2016. These important
growth initiatives support our ability to continue providing our customers affordable, reliable energy from an
increasingly diverse generation portfolio. These investments also provide a solid foundation for our long-term adjusted
earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2017.
As you will recall, last February we initiated a strategic review of our international operations, which today comprises
about 10% of our overall business mix. We conducted a comprehensive review process that examined various options
including exiting the business, growing the business on our own, and achieving scale and efficiencies through various
partnerships and joint venture structures.
As a result of our review, at this time we believe it is in our shareholders' best interest for us to own, operate, and create
value with the business. We are taking steps to access $2.7 billion of offshore cash associated with the historic earnings
of the international business. We will also continue to optimize the value and efficiency of this business.
This valuable international cash helps support the robust growth investment portfolio in our domestic businesses, as
well as the dividend. We will be disciplined with incremental international investments that meet our investment
criteria and provide long-term value and growth.
Before turning the call over to Steve, let me update you on the sale of our non-regulated Midwest generation business
as outlined on slide seven.
In August, we entered into an agreement to sell this business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion in cash. We had expected to
close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2015. However, in January FERC requested additional
information, in particular further analysis of market power concentration. Parties to the transaction responded to FERC
on February 6, and FERC has established a shortened comment period through February 23 on the updated application.
Separately, Dynegy entered into a settlement with the Independent Market Monitor, such that the IMM will not oppose
the updated application. FERC approval is the final regulatory approval required to close. We expect to close the
transaction by the end of the second quarter. We expect to deploy the $2.8 billion of cash proceeds to recapitalize our
business in a balanced manner. A combination of an accelerated stock repurchase and debt reduction through the
avoidance of holding company debt issuances. We will maintain flexibility with this plan based on the circumstances at
the time of closing.
We are committed to maximizing shareholder value and this transaction with Dynegy is expected to be accretive to our
adjusted EPS in the first 12 months after closing. In thinking back on 2014 and looking forward to the year ahead of us,
I am proud of the team at Duke. We are advancing our strategic growth initiative, maintaining our sharp focus on
financial discipline and pursuing excellence in operations and customer service.
We are focused on growing and adapting, as we position the company for a changing future and to continue meeting
our 24/7 obligations to our customers, communities and investors. I look forward to reporting our progress during 2015.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide a financial update.
Steven K. Young
Thanks, Lynn. Today, I'll review our full-year 2014 results and discuss the economic conditions within our service
territories, including customer volume trends. I'll conclude with our financial plan for 2015 and our longer-term
adjusted earnings growth expectations.
Let's with 2014 results, as outlined on slide eight. My comments are focused on the year-to-date results versus our
original plan for the year. For more detailed information on variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting
materials of the company's today's press release. We achieved 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.55 within
our revised guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65.
On a reported basis, 2014 earnings per share were $2.66 compared to $3.76 last year. The difference between reported
and adjusted earnings per share for 2014 is primarily driven by three items: approximately $930 million of pre-tax
impairments taken on the Midwest generation fleet; a $373 million tax charge recognized this quarter associated with
our plans to return cash from international; and an approximate $100 million charge related to potential financial
exposure to resolve the ongoing federal grand jury investigation.
Overall, I'm pleased with our ability to achieve our revised guidance range for 2014, despite facing some challenges
throughout the year. Our regulated businesses exceeded their 2014 plan by about $40 million, due to favorable weather
partially offset by emerging costs, the winter storm restoration and coal ash related activities.
Absent these cost, O&M Regulated Utilities, would have been slightly lower than 2013. The Commercial Power
segment fell slightly short of plan for the year, largely due to higher purchased power cost to our competitive retail
business, during the first quarter's polar vortex and outages at the Midwest generation fleet. This decline was partially
offset by the renewables business, which delivered around $60 million of net income, above our expectations for the
year. International's results were in line with our expectations. Higher earnings in Chile, resulting from a one-time tax
benefit, were substantially offset by unfavorable hydrology in Brazil.
Before moving on, I'll touch on our strategic decision at international. As Lynn mentioned, our international strategic
review resulted in a plan to allow us to efficiently use our offshore cash. Historically, out intent has been to
permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings from our foreign operations in offshore investment opportunities. As a
result of this intent, we have not previously recognized U.S. income taxes on these amounts. We only recognized
foreign taxes.
In the fourth quarter, we declared a taxable dividend of $2.7 billion, in the form of notes payable, related to historical
undistributed earnings. This gives us the ability to use this cash, in the U.S. As a result, we've recognized a $373
million U.S. income tax charge this quarter; we expect to remit between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, in 2015. With the
remaining amount remitted by 2022. We currently have $1.7 billion of offshore cash.
Considering both the impact of this transaction and the one year extension of bonus depreciation, recently enacted by
Congress, we do not expect to be a significant cash tax payer, until the 2018 timeframe, respectively cash generated
from the international operations will mostly be used to pay-off the notes of its parent, Duke Energy. The remainder
will be reinvested in the international business.
As a result of these future uses of cash, we will not accrue any U.S. income taxes on future earnings. Duke Energy's
overall tax position presented us with the unique opportunity to implement this structure and use foreign tax credits,
making it more tax efficient than it otherwise would have been.
Moving on to slide nine; I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. For the full-year, overall weather
normalized retail load growth, was 0.6%, in line with our expectations for 2014. Excluding the impact of two large
industrial customers, that closed during the year, in Eastern North Carolina, our weather-normal retail load growth,
would have been 0.8%. Industrial and commercial growth had been stable over the past several years, as these classes

have led the economic recovery. Both classes grew at 1% in 2014, led by the automotive, metals, chemicals, healthcare
and education subsectors.
Our economic development team played a key role in recruiting 85 new industrial and commercial projects to our
service territories during the year. These projects represent $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 11,000 new jobs
in our six-state service area. Notable companies included GE, Walmart, and Amazon.
Turning to the residential sector, over the last several years we have seen consistent acceleration in the growth of the
number of customers in our service territories. This growth is now around 1%, with particular strength in the Carolinas
and Florida.
However, offsetting this growth has been declining usage per customer trends. We believe this decline is due to several
factors, including more energy-efficiency measures within residences and an increase in the number of apartments and
condominiums as opposed to single-family homes. However, looking forward, there are positive signs in the residential
sector.
Full-time employment in our states continues to improve. In 2014, 20% of the new jobs added in the U.S. were in states
served by Duke Energy. Additionally, the fourth quarter saw gains in median household income, as well as growth in
housing starts in our service areas. Based on this data, in 2015, we are anticipating retail customer load growth between
0.5% and 1%.
As the economy continues to recover and consumers gain more confidence, we believe longer-term load growth trends
should improve to about 1% annually.
Moving on to slide 10 and our adjusted earnings guidance range for 2015, which is between $4.55 and $4.75 per share.
I will briefly touch on our primary assumptions for 2015, based upon achieving the midpoint of our guidance range for
the year.
Let's start with the key drivers at Regulated Utilities, which is expected to deliver around $0.07 of additional earnings
per share in 2015 over 2014. Significant drivers include retail load growth of between 0.5% and 1%, additional
wholesale earnings as a result of new contracts, earnings through riders or AFUDC on our regulated investments; and
finally, our continued focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure.
Our Commercial Power segment is expected to contribute increased earnings per share of approximately $0.11 in 2015.
First, our renewables business continues to grow with around 375 megawatts of new wind and solar generation set to
come online in 2015.
We expect renewables to contribute around $100 million in net income during 2015. And our adjusted earnings will
continue to include the Midwest generation fleet, until the Dynegy sale closes, which we assume will be by the end of
the second quarter.
The use of proceeds from the sale of the Midwest generation fleet is expected to provide a $0.05 earnings uplift in
2015. These growth drivers are being partially offset by weakness at international, as we expect segment earnings per
share to decrease by approximately $0.12 during the year. The decline is largely due to three factors.
One, declining earnings contributions from our interest in National Methanol, which sells products that are correlated to
crude oil prices. Our plan assumes a $65 per barrel Brent crude oil price for the year. Two, the impacts of foreign
exchange rates as we expect the U.S. dollar to continue strengthening against the Brazilian real. And three, the
prior-year Chilean tax benefit, which will not recur.
Our 2015 assumptions for international assume normal hydrology in Brazil. Even though the rainy season has started
slow, it's too early to speculate on the likelihood of rationing this year. If hydrology is unfavorable, or worse, rationing
is implemented in Brazil, it would have an unfavorable impact on our financial results for the year.
The midpoint of our 2015 guidance range falls slightly below the bottom of our 4% to 6% long-term adjusted diluted
EPS objective, primarily due to the weakness I just discussed at international. In particular, National Methanol and

foreign exchange rates are driving an approximate $0.12 year-over-year decline.
Additionally, the recent decision to extend bonus depreciation through 2014 causes our net operating loss position for
tax purposes to extend into 2015. This NOL precludes us from taking the full manufacturer's deduction in 2015,
resulting in an unfavorable $0.03 impact to our earnings projection for 2015.
We also have a wider guidance range than normal, $0.20 versus $0.15. This range covers additional uncertainty due to
the volatility in crude oil prices, foreign exchange rates, and the timing of closing the Midwest generation sale to
Dynegy.
As I will discuss in a moment, the post-2015 growth profile is very promising, and we continue to project the
longer-term adjusted diluted EPS growth objective of 4% to 6% through 2017.
Slide 11 shows our high-level 2015 cash flows and financing plan. In addition to cash flows from our normal
operations, our decision to repatriate cash from international and the anticipated sale of our Midwest generation
business is expected to provide significant cash flows this year. We expect to quickly put this cash to work in support
of our financial objectives through a balanced recapitalization.
Our planning assumption is a split of 50% debt retirements at the holding company and 50% for the accelerated share
repurchase. Our plans could change based upon circumstances at closing. The financing plan supports our dividend,
strong balance sheet, and credit quality. We do not foresee the need for equity issuances through 2017.
Let's shift now to slide 12 and our longer-term adjusted earnings-per-share growth objective of 4% to 6%, which we are
extending through 2017. This long-term growth objective is anchored to the midpoint of our 2013 adjusted earnings
guidance range, or $4.32 per share. We experienced 5% growth from this base in 2014, which was driven in part by
implementation of revised customer rates in the Carolinas and Midwest.
Let me explain the primary drivers of our 4% to 6% growth over the next three years. I'll start with Regulated Utilities.
We do not anticipate any base rate cases through 2017. Our growth is expected to be supported by retail and wholesale
load growth and significant investments.
First, retail load growth provides additional earnings out of the existing investment base, in particular in between rate
cases. As a rule of thumb, 0.5% to 1% of annual load growth provides roughly 1% to 2% earnings growth.
Second, our regulated wholesale business will grow significantly in 2015, as we enter new contracts and our existing
contracts grow. We expect $0.10 of growth in 2015, on top of the $0.06 we gained in 2014.
Third, we expect to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion annually in growth projects in the regulated business.
Although, we do not project a need for rate cases, many of these investments will be recovered through riders such as
transmission and distribution expenditures in Indiana and Ohio, as well as the Crystal River 3 rider in Florida and
energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas.
We will accrue AFUDC during construction period for large investments that do not get incorporated into rates or
riders before 2018, such as the Lee project in the Carolinas, Citrus County project in Florida, Fukushima-related
nuclear investments, and environmental projects. Additionally, the acquisition of assets from NCEMPA and the related
wholesale power contract will add earnings starting in 2016.
In our commercial renewables business, we expect to continue growing our portfolio of wind and solar generation,
deploying around $1 billion to $2 billion over the next three years. Additionally, investments in the Atlantic Coast
Pipeline will add about $1 billion of capital through 2017. The balance recapitalization plan using Midwest generation's
sale proceeds is also expected to be accretive to our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth.
Finally, our international business; we expect the strengthening U.S. dollar to be a headwind through 2017. Our
forecast assumed Brazilian reservoir levels will return to normal by 2017. It is also important to remember that we are
projecting annual demand growth in Brazil of slightly above 2%. In National Methanol, we do not expect the current
level of depressed oil prices will persist into 2017.

Our ownership percentage of NMC is expected to decline from 25% to 17.5% in mid-2016. The core National
Methanol business remains strong, as it is one of the most efficient methanol production facilities in the world.
Next, let me briefly highlight the risk to our growth plan, both near and long-term as I see them. We will continually
monitor variability in retail load growth trends, in particular, the residential class. Solid load growth is important to
meeting our earnings targets. Additionally, we will keep our eye on some of the variables at international, such as
hydrology in Brazil, foreign exchange rates, and crude oil prices.
Finally, it will be important that we continue to manage our cost and realize efficiencies in the business. Even though
our 4% to 6% earnings-per-share growth objective is through 2017, I want to give you a feel for some of the growth
drivers we expect as we look into 2018 and 2019.
First, the new generation projects in Florida and the Carolinas are expected to be completed and move into rate either
through riders or base rate adjustments. Additionally, we expect to continue investing around $4 billion in 2018 and
2019, in growth projects for new generation, T&D infrastructure and environmental compliance.
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is expected online in late 2018, and discretionary growth projects in our commercial
renewables business will provide additional support to our growth. Due to our size and scope, we will have different
growth drivers at different times. Taken together, these drivers provide a solid foundation with continued growth over
time.
Slide 13 outlines our financial objectives for 2015 and beyond. We have an established track record of achieving those
objectives and have a strong plan in place to continue delivering attractive returns for our investors.
We have met or exceeded our earnings guidance range for five consecutive years. We have delivered on our overall
long-term 4% to 6% adjusted diluted earnings-per-share growth objective since 2009. Today, we announced our 2015
adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share, and we extended our long-term adjusted earnings growth
objective of 4% to 6% through 2017.
We will continue to focus on the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. We have reliably paid a
quarterly dividend to our shareholders for 89 years, and have grown the dividend for seven consecutive years. We
currently pay $2.2 billion annually in dividends to our shareholders, within our targeted payout ratio between 65% and
70%.
With that, let's open the line for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Dan.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Now that you've gotten through the review on the international assets and you've reiterated the
4% to 6% EPS growth target, how do we think about the balance of growth? Because I assume you guys are embedding
little or no growth international, which means the domestic businesses are actually going to grow faster than 4% to 6%.
Is that fair?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, we continue to look for ways to invest capital. So, you'll find some growth capital in our
expectations in international. But given the fact that it's roughly 10% of the business, you can expect greater growth,
the lion's share of the growth coming from regulated.

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And then I guess just, sorry...
<A - Lynn J. Good>: The only other thing I would add to that is, as I think about regulated earnings growth, it's not
just the utilities. I think you put the pipeline into that category as well, a FERC regulated growth item that will show up
in commercial but nonetheless, is important to the growth picture.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And then I guess kind of from a treatment from an earnings perspective from the international,
because you guys took the charge in the fourth quarter, there's going to be no change in realized tax rate even as you
bring international earnings back to the U.S. because I guess you guys frontend loaded the tax payment. Is that the right
way to think about what you guys did?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes. That's correct. What we've done is recognize the income tax liability associated with
historic earnings. Prospectively, we will not accrue any U.S. income taxes, and we're projecting that our effective tax
rate for 2015 will be about 32%.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Just one last question. Just on the renewable investments, you had Dominion at their
Analyst Day, who said that they were going to keep investing for another year or two and then look to monetize those
renewable businesses, given the fact the lower EPS contribution to asset deployed. How does that fit to you guys'
thoughts on investment in that business and the right fit for you relative to maybe some of these yieldco folks who can
pay more for a similar set of assets?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, I think there are a couple of questions in there. One, our competitive positioning, and then
what is the long-term strategic fit of renewables? We continue to see it as an important place for us to deploy capital.
We see growth in that area. But like any element of our business, from time to time, we'll step back and see where it fits
and how does it optimize value. But that's as far as I would go at this point.
Overall, we see renewables becoming an increasingly part of the generation portfolio, and we'll continue deploying
capital in a manner that creates the most value for our shareholders.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey, it's Julien, good morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, also known as Michael. How are you?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Thank you, quite well. I wanted to perhaps follow-up on Dan's question there, and
kind of come back to the 4% to 6% for 2016 and 2017. Is that weighted towards 2017, or are you really thinking about
a real pickup next year? And if so, what are those drivers as you think about the domestic businesses? And to what
extent does capital deployment also drive some of that improvement, 2015 to 2016?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, I would point to guidance for 2015 and then the long-term growth rate of 4% to 6%. And
we've given you some visibility on what you're going to see in 2016, so we hope to close the Eastern Power Agency.
We'll begin showing earnings from other long-term capital deployment. We have certain things that'll occur on riders,
so I think we've given you the pieces. We're not prepared to give specific guidance on 2016 today, but we feel like
we've developed a pipeline that'll drive growth into the future.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: But to be specific here, is 2016 kind of the improvement, or ultimately you're not
ready to say 2016 versus 2017 to get to that 4% to 6%?
<A - Steven K. Young>: I don't think we want to get into 2016 versus 2017 at this point. But what I would describe to
you is that the growth portfolio is strong. We are projecting to be investing an average of $8 billion a year. 2014 was a
relatively low capital year, and that's just the nature of the business in terms of the timing of the resources you need for
your regulated businesses when you're closing deals.
We're looking at 2016 being nearly $10 billion of investment if you include the NCEMPA acquisition. And our rate
base is growing, our regular rate base growing 6%. So, it's hard to know exactly how that will manifest itself through
rates, riders, AFUDC exactly, but the investment base is growing.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And a small detail here. You said you expect that the Midwest transaction
would close mid-year. Is that a reflection on any more bearish view on timing, or is it really kind of – or could
potentially be a little earlier than that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, It's a planning assumption. I think with the accelerated comment period that FERC put
forward in the settlement that Dynegy has reached with the Market Monitor, we believe closing could occur more
rapidly. But for planning assumptions, we put it into the second quarter and we'll update as events unfold. It's difficult
to predict with certainty FERC's timeline.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you. And congrats, Beau.

We'll go next to Brian Chin with Bank of America.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning, Brian.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Just to springboard off Julien and Dan's questions, for the recovery of the EPS trajectory back to
2016 from 2015, the way I took your prepared comments there's a little bit of a drag in 2015 on FX and oil. So, is some
bounce-back on those assumed in the 2016 guidance, or is it your view that the growth portfolio is strong enough to
account for an FX oil price environment that sort of perpetuates from 2015 onwards, and you still get back to the 4% to
6% trajectory?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Brian, what I would say, we'll be closely watching oil prices. For example, we do not believe
that the level we're at today will persist. In Steve's remarks, we said into 2017. We also are not projecting they persist
into 2016 at this level either. So, we have a combination of things in our portfolio that we think will come together.
But, I think directing attention to the investments is important because that's going to be the most significant driver of
growth over the long-term for the company.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Great. Thank you very much.

We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Quick question, just so I understand what you've done on repatriation. You described
it as a tax-efficient solution, but then you seem to be booking what I guess is a worst-case scenario on tax. What
happens if there's some form of a tax holiday going forward? Will you then release some of this reserve? And because
you've structured it as a note, does that effectively help with this? Could you just put some light on that comment?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Sure. Let me give a little color to that. We booked roughly $370 million in the fourth quarter
related to this, and that reflects a tax-efficient structure. We don't expect before 2016 any comprehensive tax
legislation. There are various proposals that are kicked about. And in fact, President Obama's proposal talks about a
19% tax on repatriated earnings, which would be less efficient than what we put in place. So, I think we have
maximized our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and taken advantage of our tax positioning pretty well with this
structure.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. So, there's not a potential for it to improve, or is there? That's kind of my...
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, I think that we recognized the right liability based on our historic earnings, and it
basically represents kind of a top-off tax between foreign tax amounts accrued and paid and the U.S. tax rate. And what
is also unique here is that we will not be accruing any U.S. income taxes prospectively, which helps us as well.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then another topic on wholesale, I think, I heard you say $0.10 of
wholesale may come in 2015, on top of $0.06 in 2014. Does some of that carry forward into 2016 on a full-year basis,
and just what you would think about 2016 and 2017 on the wholesale line?
<A - Steven K. Young>: As we move forward, 2014 and 2015 were big years where we stepped into wholesale
contracts, so we saw some nice growth there. That will level out a bit after 2015. We will continue to see some growth
in wholesale as our existing contracts grow and we step into some smaller ones. It won't be at the level that we have
seen in 2014 and 2015.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks, Jonathan.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Mike.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hi.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Just a question on slide 23, and then kind of thinking about core growth in net income
versus growth in EPS. Your Regulated Utility growth is about 2%, kind of as you outline on this slide. Commercial

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: ...in 2015, meaning that won't be there in 2016. Just curious when you think about drivers
of the 4% to 6% longer-term, how much of that is driven by just longer-term continued reductions in the share count?
Or do you view this as kind of a one-time buyback that's being done now and then there's no more kind of major capital
allocations outside of dividends on the equity side of the balance sheet going forward?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Michael, we're certainly going to use balance recapitalization to address the exit of the Midwest
generation business. We think that is an appropriate utilization of proceeds, given where we are at this point.
I think what you can expect on Regulated Utilities is that growth will be lumpy at times, for lack of a more
sophisticated word, because of capital deployment, rate cases and other things. So, as you look at 2015, it's a no rate
case year. And so, we would expect growth to accelerate there around reflection of the earnings from the investments
we're putting in place.
We also expect commercial will grow as we continue to put renewable investment to work and as the pipeline begins to
show up. So, I think we could talk through each of these individually, but there will be growth that shows up from
deployment of investment. And this share repurchase we think is consistent with the exit of a business.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And just to sanity check one thing on the pipeline; will you be booking AFUDC
earnings during construction? So, the earnings impact will actually happen before the pipeline goes in service?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes. That's correct. We will, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks so much.

We'll go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Good morning, Lynn and Steve.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hi.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: I just wanted to talk a little bit more about 2015 at the Regulated Utilities first. We've
talked about it a lot so far, but just I would have expected a little bit more growth even without a rate case there, given
the fact that you're getting the load growth and all of that wholesale growth even though weather normalization is going
to hurt you. And then you also mentioned a couple pennies of a tax hit as well. Is there anything else within 2015
specifically that we might be missing there?
<A - Steven K. Young>: I think typically, when you look at 2015 for the Regulated Utilities, you've got the organic
load growth that we're looking at for retail, the wholesale. Those are pieces there. We should have some growth from
riders in AFUDC as investments build. But again, 2014 was a low capital year, so we're just starting to build the tank
on some of these larger investments such as the Lee Combined Cycle and the Citrus County. So, there may be a lag in
some of that buildup that you see in 2015, relative to where we're going to be in 2016 and 2017. That may be a part of
it there.
And then, there's what we call rate lag, if you will, and that's O&M which we're trying to hold in check, and have had
success doing that thus far. But there's always emergent costs that have to be dealt with. And then there is additional
depreciation and interest on capital projects, smaller capital projects that go into service prior to a rate case. So, those
are kind of the major components.

And I think that one of the things you may be also factoring in is nuclear levelization, which impacts our O&M in an
unusual fashion. We got a large benefit in 2013 from nuclear levelization as we started to levelize nuclear outage costs,
and that has negative impacts in 2014 and 2015. After 2015, we'll be through with that and it won't be a driver.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Okay. And then, if we look at the drivers for the international segment for 2015, you
do say that you're assuming normal hydrology throughout the balance of the year or the entire year overall. It doesn't
look like that is much of a driver, though, in terms of EPS. We have the crude headwinds and the forex headwinds, but
should we not be thinking about that helping earnings a lot this year?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, I think you've hit the major drivers, which are the FX and the crude for international.
When you look at hydrology in Brazil, I think we're assuming normal hydrology. But I think even under normal
hydrology, the thermals will be dispatched first throughout the year. That will put some constraints on our
hydro-generation capabilities.
Our contract pricing does grow and those contacts are profitable, but given the thermal dispatching order even under
normal hydrology coming out of two years of drought, that will constrict some of our ability to make sales into the spot
market. So, there's some offsetting things there in Brazil. I think you hit the big drivers for international with FX and
oil pricing, though.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you, Chris.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Steve, in your 2015 guidance you gave us your assumptions for oil price as well as the FX in Brazil.
Can you remind us what the sensitivities are around that base assumption?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes. The 10% movement on the price of oil is in the neighborhood of $0.01 to $0.02. That's
an annual basis.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: $10.
<A - Steven K. Young>: $10 on the price of – I'm thinking of oil always being around $100. And then a 10%
movement on FX rates for the entire year is in the neighborhood of $0.03.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thanks. Okay. And then secondly for the NCEMPA acquisition, I see that you've assumed $0.05 to
$0.10 of earnings. Why is there that $0.05 delta in that contribution? I would have thought it would be fairly set once
you complete that acquisition.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Those are assumptions around financing basically. If it were financed entirely with cash, then
you'd be at the upper end of that range. If it were financed 50% at holdco debt, then you'd be at the lower end of that
range. So, we're just incorporating some financing sensitivities there.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. And then lastly, Lynn, coming back to the international business, once you've brought that cash
back in and [inaudible] (51:49) what happens to hydro and the remaining out in Brazil with FX going? There's still that
variability out there.

From an earnings perspective, I don't hear much about that it's going to grow like your regulated business does. So
strategically, would that still fit the profile that you're trying to create here with stable, visible, predictable earnings and
dividend growth?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Ali, I think you raise a good question, and certainly as we undertook the strategic review we
were looking at both elements. We were looking at cash optimization and we were looking at growth. I think we came
up with an outstanding solution around cash, and I think it's particularly timely when you think about the level of
capital spending and projects we've identified in the domestic business. But, we do have some near-term headwinds
from a growth perspective.
The NMC investment was not a part of the strategic review. That's a joint venture that we're in until the latter part of
the 2020s, and so we will continue to have some volatility around oil prices. And I think the business in Latin America,
we do have some foreign currency. We have hydrology in the short-term, but we believe that those markets represent
strong markets over the long-term, and we'll continue to look for ways we can optimize value out of that portfolio. I
think stepping back from all of that, we should also recognize that this is only 10% of Duke's business.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Right. But we are done with the review. This is not something you'll come back another year or two. I
mean this was pretty comprehensive and we are done for now.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi, how are you?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hello.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yes. Good.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just a follow-up on the oil and currency expectations post-2015. As you know, the forward
curve is sloping upward to begin with. So, I was just wondering when you say that you don't expect them to stay at
these low levels, are you talking about the forward curve in general?
In other words, do you have an expectation above the forward curve or [indiscernible] (54:03) for the most part right
now – or is this just – you're just commenting on the fact that the forward curve goes up considerably in the next few
years?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. So, we use the forward curves, Paul, to plan our business. We'll, of course, look at
sensitivities around that, but we do not have an independent market view.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then with respect to the sale of the Dynegy, I think Julien was asking about
this. If you guys were to sell it earlier, considerably earlier, would that have a material impact on 2015?
<A - Steven K. Young>: No, that would not have a material impact. You would lose some of the earnings from the
Midwest gen from that period of time, the recapitalization benefits would kick in earlier, and the net of those two is
immaterial.

Our last question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Andy.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hey, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hi. How are you doing?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Just one clarification on the wholesale at the utilities, or really I guess at the Carolina utilities.
How does that work in a rate case? Because you have your growth and then you said there was like smaller growth in
2016 and 2017. But if you file a rate case, let's say, in North Carolina, is there some type of true-up? I'm just trying to
remember.
<A - Steven K. Young>: There is not a true-up. Some of the mechanics I'll explain. When you file a rate case, you will
typically look at who are your firm customers, retail and wholesale, and you will allocate costs in that fashion. And
then the states will set retail rates based upon those costs allocated to the retail customer load. So, the existence of firm
wholesale does impact base rate allocations.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: On a prospective basis.
<A - Steven K. Young>: But prospectively. You don't go back and say, let's redo the allocations in the past.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. So for like modeling purposes – I'm just throwing out numbers – let's say there was a
$0.15 benefit over a two-year or three-year period in between the rate cases. You don't lose that $0.15, but I guess it
gets taken out on the retail side. So, if you were going to have, I don't know, a $200 million rate increase, there's some
type of adjustment on the retail side to compensate for the benefit on the wholesale side. Is that kind of the way to look
at it?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Prospectively, that's a way to look at it, yes. You will reallocate costs based on your retail and
wholesale customers, again, on a prospective basis.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: And is there a way for us to kind of figure that out, or that's too complicated for us?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Andy, I think offline the IR team could talk you through that, but I think we're talking about
something that's two or three years down the road and probably a better conversation as we get closer to the rate cases.
