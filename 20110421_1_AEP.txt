MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2011
Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participant lines are in a listen-only-mode. Later there will be an opportunity
for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's conference call
is being recorded.
And I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Treasurer, Chuck Zebula. Please go ahead.
Charles E. Zebula
Thank you, Leah. Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2010 Earnings Webcast of American Electric
Power. Our earnings release and related financial information are available on our website, aep.com. The presentation
slides are also available on our website.
Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that cause future results
to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the factors that may cause
results to differ from management's forecast. Joining me this morning are Mike Morris, our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their
remarks.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.

Thanks, Chuck, and welcome to everyone on the phone. It's kind of nice to be the first regulated utility reporting
earnings for the first quarter of 2011, particularly with the strong performance we had with our $0.82 a share of
ongoing earnings, $0.02 above what appeared to be consensus going in and a full $0.06 above first quarter of 2010,
when in our service territory the economy had not really recovered at all.
Based on what we see today when we look at cost control at the company, the recovering economy in our jurisdictions
and most of our states, particularly in the west, we feel very comfortable about reaffirming our earnings midpoint for
2011 and every bit as comfortable about reaffirming our midpoint earnings for 2012. Brian will give us some
granularity on the 2012 number because I know many of you aren't totally convinced that we'll be able to get the work
done that we think we can get done and I would simply remind you that over each of the last seven years we have
reported at or above our midpoint year-over-year and we see no reason not to believe that to be the case for 2012 as
well.
When we look at slide three, let me talk a moment about the regulatory plans. Rate proceedings so far have been quite
successful. As you know, about $200 million of the stack of $235 million that we need to secure for our performance in
2011 has already been approved or will adjust automatically according to rate adjusters throughout our many
jurisdictions. The $35 million that remain are fully covered by a number of adjustments that will happen during the
year and other rate cases that will be processed during the year, so we feel very comfortable. Now just as we've done
year-over-year-over-year, we'll actually do a little bit better in the rate-making process than we came in with our needs
forecasted.
Ohio is a very interesting jurisdiction, I know, and many of you are quite concerned about Ohio and we join you in
those concerns. However, we have historically been treated well in Ohio and we continue to feel that that'll be the case
going forward.
As you know this week the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed the 2009 ESP plan and decided that 10 of the 13 issues
that were raised were insufficiently supported and were rejected. Three of them, interestingly enough, were found to be
of some concern to the Supreme Court. One, the retroactive rate-making that they decided was inappropriate based on
the rates not being approved till March 18 of 2009, rather than the requirement of January 1. I would simply remind
you that that had everything to do with the Commission's decision to take each of the cases of and by themselves.
Obviously, because of the way the Senate Bill 221 was written, there is no need for a refund of those monies, but it
does tell us quite clearly that our 2012 case will need to be finished this calendar year and in place by the first of the
year. The two other issues were sent back to the commission for remand with an interesting direction. One had to do as
you know with POLR and it was a question as to whether or not it was the formula-based rate or a cost-based rate. And
the Supreme Court simply suggested to the Commission that they needed to give more data because they couldn't find
the cost support that they predicated their decision on.
That, obviously, will have some effect on what POLR looks like in 2012 case, but it also sends a crystal clear message
that the Supreme Court will spend a great deal of time making sure their decisions are in the letter of the law that was
passed in Senate Bill 221.
The other issue that there was some other concern over was the recovery of an environmental recovery system that was
pre-dated the 2009 date. That, too, was sent back to the Commission for reconsideration and we believe that inside of
the nine numerated items, even though it has the introductory phrase of, without limitation, the Commission should be
able to find plenty of comfort in allowing for the continued recovery of that through the rest of 2011.
I don't mean to say for a moment that these aren't issues of concern, but they are issues we think can easily be handled
by the Commission on remand and of course we'll make those points as we go forward in the remand proceedings that
the Commission will undertake.
When we think about the 2012 ESP, I know there's a great deal of concern over that and we have filed a number of
options and approaches that the Commission can take to find what we think is the a very reasonable approach in the
2012 ESP. It really directs itself toward what we think is a balance between very small increases for our customers for
'12, '13 and '14 while addressing the issue of very important required returns for capital to be invested. There's been a

great deal of confusion over the issue of environmental spend and new generation in Ohio as we go forward. And I
think if any thing the Supreme Court's decision of this week tells us crystal clear that they will absolutely look to the
letter of the law and Senate Bill 221.
And to that purpose let me share with you what we think is very important language in Senate Bill 221: An electric
security plan can have construction work in progress recoveries for costs that are associated, if the electric utility
demonstrates a need for the new generation and/or a need for the environmental spend. If that has been done under a
competitive bid process and allowance approved under section 4928.143(B)2(b) shall be non-bypassable for the life of
the facility.
We find great comfort in that language and I think the Commission should find equal to comfort in that language as we
go forward because, again, the Supreme Court made it clear that the letter of the law will be followed. So I know there's
been a debate about whether or not those kinds of capital investments can be made and with that reading and our duty,
which will be to demonstrate the need for the new facilities, if they are there and/or the retrofit of facilities, will allow
that to be considered to be non-bypassable for the entirety life of the facility that's built or retrofitted. So we do find
some comfort in that decision and we hope that the Commission does that as well.
Let me move to the last point on Slide 3, the environmental update. I won't be specific about the four rules, three of
them are now in hand, we continue to have an evaluation of that and I'll now talk more deeply about them as we get to
Slide 4. We have yet to see the Coal Ash rule but we continue to work with our colleagues on the whole notion that we
hope it doesn't come out with the absolute hazardous waste designation and we will wait for that to happen whenever
the EPA decides to come to that conclusion.
When we look at the environmental activities, our goal will be to constantly strive for compliance at the end of the day.
But the end of the day can't be on the current timeline that the EPA's orders have issued, that's an issue for us, it's an
issue for our states, it's an issue for most of the generation fleet throughout the United States. So we, along with our
allies of the other coal-based utilities, our state commissions, our elected officials, as well as our friends in the union
and at NARUC in a much broader sense, will continue to argue for a more realistic timeline.
We don't think that the one year that the EPA could assign to this as well as the one year that the President could assign
to this is even an adequate extension of time to get this done in an orderly fashion. And that will continue to be our
advocacy in front of the EPA when we made our comments, but also working with Democrats and Republicans in the
House and the Senate to try to bring some rationale approach to that.
I think the most important point to be made here is that there is no desire on the behalf of American Electric Power to
undo the Clean Air Act or the accomplishments that have been realized over the past years and will be realized in the
future; and we think that's an important point. We feel very comfortable that we'll have an opportunity to make those
points and we think that rationale approach will ultimately allow for us to have a very achievable approach to that
endeavor.
You often asked us for more granularity about the undertaking of what the bills would mean to our fleet. If you will
move to Slide 4, I think it's evident that you can see with 24,685 megawatts of coal-based generation, these rules are
incredibly important to our customers, to our employees, to our shareholders and to the states wherein those plants are
located. We tried to break these down into three principal categories so that you can get a pretty good idea of how we
see the potential impact of all of these rules as they pertain to our coal-based fleet. I will note for you that this does not,
particularly in a 316(b) issue, address the issues of how that might affect gas-fired facilities going forward but this is
really to be specific about our coal fleet.
Fully 42%, 10,317 megawatts have already been retrofitted and are in the performance category that we think make
some sense for us going forward. We've tried to show you that there are, however, capital investments that will need to
be made on some of those facilities going forward and we think that those capital investments are well within a regional
approach for us to take. On a low case, meaning that some of the comments we'll make about considering retirements
of some units at some sites to be considered in an overall evaluation of the emissions of that site in general, would
show us the low case of some $766 million that needed to be spent on the overall Air rules. Or on the high side, $1.046

billion, that'll allow to have us have very cost-effective production from those plants as we go forward.
The partially-exposed plants, or 36% of the overall fleet, also have some very interesting numbers going forward and as
you'll look at the top of the slide, you'll see these are capital investments that would need to be done through the year
2020. Here, we're looking at a total expenditure; it could range from a couple of billion dollars to as much as $6 billion.
That's about what we have done on most of the 42% of the facilities that were done over the last handful of years.
And lastly, the fully-exposed plants. We've been quite clear that we fully intend to retire two of 5,480 megawatts of our
overall coal fleet because they are less efficient and have not been retrofitted in any particular way. That leaves us with
what we think are very reasonable approaches.
What we're showing you on the bottom of Slide 4, our additional costs that would be incurred to replace those 5,500
megawatts of new probably combined-cycle gas facilities going forward.
All of this will be done in a timeline that syncs up with the things that our states feel are important as well as our
Commission and having an eye always on the impact that it'll have on the customers in our jurisdictions. Hopefully,
looking at the front cover of the Wall Street Journal today, we'll continue to see economic recovery throughout the
United States, as we're seeing throughout the world. And we'll be able to continue to make these capital investments
without having too negative of an effect on our overall customer class.
At the end of the day, however, I think it's of an important point to see that our fleet is no different than everyone else's
fleet and that our plants will continue to stack up at the end of the day in the dispatch order that they really do before
going into these capital investments because everyone will be required to make the same kinds of capital investments.
Many stations will be shutdown. We think that'll work to the benefit of our capacity fees going forward, as well as our
Off-System sales going forward.
So we know this is an issue. It does have an appropriate name called, the train wreck, although out of respect for my
colleagues in the train business, it really is in the front of coal power production in United States, but if done right with
an appropriate timeline, it's very handleable for our company and we would think everyone else.
When we look at our rate stack in the jurisdictions where we do business, we'll be within 80% of the average rate in a
state like Indiana to 100% of the average rate in a state like Kentucky, even after having made these investments. We
think that that's a clear message that says difficult, but accomplishable. We'll continue to advocate for reasonable
approaches as we deal with our friends at the EPA, and in Washington, and in various states where we do business.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to give us much more specificity about the earnings and the impact of some of
the load profiles and other things that we've seen, and then we'll look forward to your questions and answers. Brian.
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. This morning we'll review year-on-year reconciliation of first quarter
results. We'll look at load trends; we'll review drivers for the balance of the year and 2012 earnings guidance and get to
your questions as quickly as possible.
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see that ongoing earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $392 million, or $0.82 per share.
This is $27 million higher than the same period last year in which AEP earned $365 million or $0.76 per share.
Here are some highlights for the quarter-on-quarter comparison. Weather was unfavorable by $20 million or $0.03
when compared to last year. However, weather was actually favorable by $20 million when compared to normal. Retail
margins were down $0.02 per share or $17 million and were primarily associated with lower residential usage and
realization, which were somewhat offset by increased industrial usage. We'll provide some more detail on this on the
next two slides.
Non-utility operations net was lower by $0.01, primarily due to lower earnings from generation and marketing. This
was the result of a forced plant outage at the Oklaunion plant during the cold snap in Texas in the month of February

and reduced marketing deal flow.
Off-System sales net of sharing improved $0.02 or $12 million quarter-on-quarter. This result was driven by physical
sales, which were up 14% in volume and a 45% increase in physical margins. Capacity sales contributed to the positive
comparison. In addition, although AEP Dayton Hub pricing was down 3% over the same quarter of last year, natural
gas prices were down 19%, allowing AEP to dispatch its Eastern combined cycle plants into the PJM market.
Operations and maintenance expense accounted for a positive $0.04 per share or $30 million, net of revenue offsets,
primarily due to our cost savings initiatives instituted in 2010 and lower storm restoration expenses. In the detail on
slide 15, you will see that line nine, O&M expense shows $1 million increase for the quarterly comparison. This
however, was more than offset by a $31 million increase in revenue from trackers and riders. Rate changes accounted
for positive $0.06 per share or $44 million across several jurisdictions.
I'm turning to Slide 6, you'll see on the bottom right-hand panel that overall weather normalized sales were up 2.5% for
the quarter. This increase was driven by an increase in industrial load of 7.1% and in commercial load of 1.2% for the
quarter. In residential normalized sales, last year's increase was 0.6 of 1% and our estimate for this year is 1.9%. Given
the first quarters results, we may fall somewhat short of that estimate but as Mike indicated economic indicators are a
positive in much of our service territory.
Before we turn to the next slide let's discuss industrial – to discuss industrial sales trends let me give you some color on
the economy in our service territories, as compared to national trends. Overall our Western service territories in the
State of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas are experiencing a reasonable economic recovery, while our seven
Eastern states are experiencing a recovery in fits and spurts. Estimated unemployment rates for the country as a whole
are 8.9% for the first quarter of the year, compared to 9.4% in our Eastern service territories and 8% in our Western
service territories, for an overall AEP unemployment rate of 8.8%.
GDP growth for the country is estimated to be in the 2% range for the first quarter of this year, compared to estimates
of 4% in our Eastern and Western service territories. We believe that our unemployment rates and GDP growth will
meet or exceed U.S. numbers through the balance of the year.
On slide 7, you'll see that the top five sectors that account for approximately 60% of AEP's total industrial sales. You'll
notice that all five of our top sectors are up for the quarter, led by primary metals which notched a 12.8% increase
quarter-over-quarter. This sector was led by our largest customer Ormet, which returned to full production from
two-thirds production during the quarter. In fact, all 10 of our industrial sectors showed improvements for the quarter.
With these sales we have now returned to 90% of our pre-industrial sales.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the left-hand side of the slide where we talk about our 2011 earnings. As Mike said, we
are reaffirming our guidance range of $3 to $3.20 per share. First, let's continue to talk about the economy. As we
discussed on Slide 6, our quarterly load growth was greater than our estimated annual rate in our earnings guidance, but
was heavily weighted towards the industrial class.
This means that businesses in our service territories are putting people back to work. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
Economic News Release for the month of March confirms this by indicating decreasing unemployment rates in 9 of our
11 states. This is an encouraging sign for the underlying economy in our states and for overall electricity sales.
In terms of rate increases, as Mike said, we've obtained 85% of what was in the estimated guidance. This includes base
rate orders and formula rates throughout our service territories. We have additional rate filings in play that will get us
close to the $235 million target that was included in guidance.
We are continuing our stringent operations and maintenance expense controls. Our guidance for the year included an
O&M expense decrease of $34 million, net of tracker and rider revenue increases. As discussed earlier, we obtained
$30 million due to cost savings initiatives and lower storm costs in the first quarter. With these results, we are on track
to exceed the annual savings identified in guidance.
Our guidance anticipated that customers switching, primarily in the commercial class at Columbus Southern Power,
would result in an incremental loss of load of 14% or $53 million for the year. Although the timing of this load

switching is occurring faster than what we have forecasted, capacity and energy sales have partially offset the financial
impact, so we remain comfortable with our year-end financial estimate.
Off-System sales are ahead of last year, due to some strength in physical and capacity sales, with the look at the first
quarter performance, forward pricing, and trading and marketing opportunities, we would anticipate Off-System sales
to come in somewhat higher than the guidance estimate of $262 million.
With our first quarter results within expectations and with the insights that I just provided, we remain confident in our
2011 earnings guidance.
Now moving onto the right-hand side of the panel. Looking at 2012, our point estimate of $3.25 per share, you
remember we put this estimate in front of you last fall and we did so intentionally to demonstrate our confidence in
management's ability to grow the earnings of the company. Later this year, we will give you a range around the $3.25
per share and more detailed information as we always do, but let me give you some further insights into why we have
confidence in our estimate.
First, let's talk about a number of components of the recovering economy. So far this year, we are seeing load
recovering greater than 2%, as we said, mostly in industrial. Remember, just a 1% increase in load spread
proportionally across our customer classes, results in $0.08 to $0.10 per share increase.
The recovering economy also impacts Off-System sales and we've seen positive results in the first quarter this year and
see signs that this trend will continue. Further, our River Operations group benefits from a recovering economy as well.
And this year is expecting a 2% share increase over 2010 earnings, due to increasing grain and coal exports. We also
believe this trend will continue.
Second, we still have rate cases that will positively impact our results in 2012. These include the Ohio Distribution rate
case and the Virginia Biennial case, as well as additional cases yet to be filed. Third, our Transmission business is
actively constructing projects, predominantly in Texas and Ohio. These projects will provide meaningful earnings
contributions in 2012. We have also demonstrated our ability to control O&M spending and will remain vigilant in this
regard next year as well.
Mike has addressed many of the issues in regard to the Ohio ESP filing for 2012 and our belief that the law provides
for our ability to invest and recover that investment in the state and the Ohio Supreme Court order from earlier this
week, supports a strict interpretation of the law and the code that will enable that investment.
In conclusion, the investment opportunity at American Electric Power remains strong. A solid affordable dividend,
coupled with achievable earnings growth prospects. We look forward to delivering these results to you in 2011, 2012
and beyond. Thank you for your time and investment in American Electric Power.
I will now turn the call over to Leah to begin taking your questions.

[Operator instructions]. First, we go to the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Mike, if I could go to Slide 4, which is very helpful, can you – and we look at the CapEx
numbers just want a clarification question and then I'll ask a more concrete, but the numbers of CapEx would – if you
wanted to think about say the least exposed plants would you add all those numbers together in the high and low
columns to get to full compliance? Or is there some redundancy in those numbers that we should just take the high
number of each one of those categories as to what your exposure would be?

<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, they – you surely wouldn't add them together and I would direct you toward the low
side rather than the high side as we believe we'll continue to do this in a very cost effective way. Obviously, somewhere
in between is the answer but, no, you shouldn't add them together, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay and then of this CapEx how much is being spent or how much of the program is currently
in process right now are over the kind of the next three to five-year spending horizon versus the second half of the
decade?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, I guess we'll have to have Bette Jo get back with a little more specificity to that
question. Some of it is being done but I want to make sure we give you a pretty concrete number. Clearly, on the least
exposed plant we continue to make capital investments as required. We're making some progresses, some design
activity on the partially expose and on the fully exposed making no capital expenditures on an environmental side for
sure.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And, Mike, can you just kind of explain why the design activity is just happening now kind of
given the fact that the rules have been in varying forms out in the market for a decade or so?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, Dan, I think you know, though, we had done a lot of work on the CMRA and CARE
rules as they existed and they were vacated in 2009. There's been no real design for the rules as they might come out of
the EPA in 2011 or how they might be finalized by the end of the year. And you can see by the way that they did
316(b) and the way that the looked at some of the issues on the Mercury and HAPs rules they've given us some
flexibility. We're going to argue for a little bit more.
A company like American Electric Power, with its in-house engineering skills, where I don't want my teams to do to be
cost effective and cost control is to design something that then needs to be redesigned, and then redesigned, and
redesigned. My engineers have plenty of talent and plenty of desire to do that, so let me tell you it takes a lot to stop
them from doing all that.
But this has been kind of the mantra of some of the utilities that don't have the same endeavors. They keep saying, oh,
everyone's known for 10 years this is out there. That's just not true. We had done and, in fact, made capital investments
to comply with CMRA and CARE and many of those have already been approved and earning rates and being
recovered. But they are also going to satisfy some of the requirements going forward for these four new rules.
So again, I think you're very well aware of those skill sets of the engineering team here at AEP. We're ready to go
whenever these rules come out final and we've got nine of these units done and it takes 48 months to bid them, to
design them, to build them, to sync them to the system. Do think you can do that in 24 to 36 months is folly; to think
that you can do that with the magnitude of what will be need to be done across the country, is simply unachievable.
So at the end of the day, one way or another, the federal government will come to the realization that we can't shut the
U.S. economy off and we've got to address a timeline that makes sense.
We can get everybody to where they want to go environmentally by 2020. That's two or three years beyond what they
could do the plan at 2016 or 2017. And have done it in a reasonable way. That's our advocacy; that'll continue to be our
advocacy. But this whole notion that these things have been out there for a long time is poppycock.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay and I guess just one last question, Mike, if I look at the spending on the replacement
generation and you kind of assume that CCGTs are going to cost you – it'd be a ballpark $1,000 a KW. It looks like you
only need 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts, 2,000 megawatts of capacity to replace the 5,500 megawatts of exposable plants,
is that the right way to look at that?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, that's pretty accurate, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay, thank you, guys.

And our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hey, how are you doing?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Doing great, thanks.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just on the – just a follow-up on that last part, why is it that you only need so many gas to
replace so many coal, could you just elaborate a little bit on that?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, when we look at some of it, when you look at a number of our smaller plants and the
place that they stack up in the overall dispatch stack, they run not very frequently, particularly with gas prices the way
that they are. And I think it would be very difficult for us to go the state commissions and say lets replace 5,500
megawatts with 50, 500 megawatts when the capacity factors are in the 20% and 30% range.
Some of it we may have to do more, depending on how much renewables we have to do because as you know the
intermittency of renewables need to be augmented by combine cycle gas. But when you get to these units and you look
at the overall busbar cost of the power, particularly because of the efficiencies and what we believe to be reasonable
gas prices, we think can handle all of our retail load needs going forward, with fewer megawatts than the 5,500 we'll
take offline.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And I guess there's no reliability or I guess you don't see the capacity need for that? It's just
pretty much a capacity factor situation, is that how we should think about it?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, that, as well as you know, we continue to advocate very strongly for an augmentation
of the transmission grid, and if some of that were to be done, you'd have to just simply build fewer megawatts, which is
a real cost savings for everyone; and again, we hope that's something that the federal government can finally get their
arms around.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Great. Now just finally I just want to go over to the Ohio Supreme Court ruling. And I mean, if
I understand you guys – if I understand what you're saying, it sounds like you feel that there might be some changes in
terms of how the ESP filing might be made but that you don't expect any quantitative difference, is that how we should
think about this POLR formula versus cost or what have? It sounds like it's more of a question of sort of supporting
your cases as opposed to perhaps augmenting it in terms of significant numbers. Is my understanding accurate from
what your statements are? Or is it a little bit different?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, Paul, there are two ways to look at that. So the whole issue in front of the Supreme
Court was that the Commission had really looked at the overall value proposition for the customers, of us being their
provider of last resort. But in the order they said that POLR was cost based. The argument was that there wasn't any
identifiable cost other than this formula that we put in there.
Actually because they said it was cost based and there wasn't enough support for that, the Supreme Court came to the
only decision that they could. However, as you read the order the Supreme Court also said that formula is fine, if that's
what you'll use, just tell us that that's what you used going forward.
You may remember also that the Supreme Court said it's kind of difficult to understand this because American Electric
Power hasn't incurred any lost load or customer switching. Well, clearly, that's the case today. So we think there's
plenty of room on remand for the Commission to satisfy that if they like.
If they want to go the other side and have a detailed cost demonstration of what it takes to keep units always ready to
run whenever people come back, we'll be happy to do that. The only thing we're trying to say is that there's plenty of
room on remand for the Commission to handle this in any way that they would like and we will be fully prepared to

respond to whatever their data needs are.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, and then the residential usage for last two quarters it seems like it's really come in here.
This is weather not-normalized number that you see on Slide 6.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Is there a trend here we should be thinking about? I noticed that you guys haven't changed you
expectations for 2011 but this is weather normalized. And I'm just sort of – if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit
more about what trends you're seeing and what you think the future might hold for it?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: So I think what you're seeing here is a pretty reasonable family response to the overall
escalation of a number of prices in the marketplace that they deal with every day. Food's more expensive, gasoline's
more expensive, many other things are continuing to go forward in an almost uncontrolled basis. So I think customers
are at long last doing some of the energy conservation that we've felt would come our way eventually.
As I've always said, Americans know how to conserve and they are always driven by their pocketbook, and that's what
I think we're seeing. Long-term trend, no, we aren't seeing less meters, we're seeing more meters. You look at the sales
of electric appliances during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. It remains high.
So I wouldn't worry about it to a great degree but there is an effect over both of those quarters. We will watch it very
closely, but it doesn't cause us to make any change. One of the nice things that you see on that slide is that, different
from our 2010 experience, commercial sales are coming back in a very strong way. We're encouraged by that. That has
a lot to do with the unemployment rates going down. People getting jobs and since they're working all day, they're
eating out instead of staying home and cooking. We're seeing some differences but nothing to be alarmed.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: You bet.

Next we have a question from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you very much. I wanted to talk again about the environmental CapEx. Could you
provide some break down of the coal CapEx for Ohio? For what percentage or what portion of this grand total would
you have to spend for Ohio?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Sure. So all you need to do is look at those numbers and take the Ohio Power and the
Columbus Southern Power Company numbers and break those out. So it'd be probably a pretty direct proportional
basis. Look at the megawatts in total divided into the dollars in total and you'll get your own answer.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And when do you think that we will find out if the Commission is comfortable with
the non-bypassable surcharges for the environmental CapEx and the re-powering of your plants in Ohio?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, whenever they issue the order on the 2012 ESP, which we now know will clearly be
in calendar year '11. The schedule calls for all of that to happen toward the later half of the year. We think something
with the overall hearing concluding in July or it could be issued sometime near that point in time. We continue to talk
to all of the folks about the potential to address some kind of a settlement in the ESP case. I don't know if that's
achievable. If it is it would be good for all of us because they have a pretty clear message of what that means. But
again, and I don't want to downplay the Supreme Court decision that what it does say is read the letter of the law and
the letter of law says these kinds of expenses, if demonstrated to be required, are absolutely non-bypassable.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: And do you think that we should draw some conclusions on the decision from the PUCO on
Duke's MRO? Do you think that there's going to be any takeaway for your ESP from the decision?

And next we have a question from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Good morning, Mike. I got a question for you just thinking long term, not one year or two
year, not 2012, but maybe 5-year or 10-year. I mean, when I try and think out what's normal, normal for AEP, just like
any other utility, should be kind of, I mean, to keep it simplistic, rate-based math. And then the question of whether you
can actually earn or not earn your authorized rate of return. I mean, you have one or two non-regulated assets but the
bulk of it is kind of rate-base math. And yet, when you talk about the environmental impact and the environmental
regulations, you talk about how it should create upward pressure on your capacity fees and on your Off-System sales.
That doesn't necessarily seem to go in tandem with thinking about the normal for AEP in terms of, like most other
regulated utilities, rate-based math. Help me understand this.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, what I meant by that particular point was that what you'll see inside of the PJM, both
for the overall bidded price for capacity, as well Off-System sales and the energy prices with you, if you take our 5,500
megawatts of retired stations and you multiply that across the region by others who will have the same challenge, those
fees will go up and that's good for our shareholders and obviously, good for the energy send-out that we'll have from
American Electric Power.
But to your point when I look out 5 or 10 years, I think this will be a very rate-base oriented company without question.
The transmission activities that we're doing are either rate-based at the state level or the federal level, as you know,
with the FERC rates that we feel are very appropriate going forward. And I think you'll see, I would hope, based on
comments that have been made by governor here in Ohio, particularly about the need for jobs created in Ohio and
electricity to be produced in Ohio, I think you'll see a much different view 5 to 10 years down the road as to how we'll
handle these activities here in this state.
The Governor made a very interesting speech as he swore in the newest member of the Commission, Andre Porter. And
when he said Ohio has a choice to either be an energy buyer like California and at the expense of all other neighboring
states or to be self sufficient in energy as he thinks Ohio ought to be, we took great comfort in those statements.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And just one quick follow-up. When you think about kind of, not next 2 to 3 years,
but 5 to 10 years, which of your subsidiaries actually economically benefit at the bottom line from, let's say, higher
capacity prices? Could you walk us through where that would actually not get taken back or taken away from a
regulator as part of a fuel cost?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, that would go into if there are system sales that would go into the sharing formulas
that we have throughout all of the jurisdictions and I don't know that they would change a great deal. One of the things
that the Supreme Court said about sharing in Ohio is that's a system that has no requirement for that going forward. So
we think that the capacity numbers will be affected by the approach we take in the next round in PJM, whether we're
FFR or whether we're not. So all of those will come to the benefit of all of our Eastern jurisdictions we think, as we go
forward.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Mike, much appreciate it.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: You bet, Michael.

And next we go the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Back on the environmental CapEx, I'm afraid, I just – I'm wondering if you guys could give a
little more color on what it is that pushes you from the low to the high end, particularly on the some of these bigger
numbers? Is it how much of that is timing and assumption around timing? And how much of it is technology? And just
this is or not because there is obviously a very big range here you're still talking?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: So the bulk of it would be on the final determination of the EPA that the flexibility that
they talked about isn't necessarily real and the timeline debate that we are making is also unachievable. Because what
you'll see on the high side is a seller's market for the welders and facilitators of the design of facilities as well as the
build of the facilities. So we think that when you think of the overall economic impact, that clearly is going to be
debated in the House and the Senate, it already is on both the Democratic and Republican side of the aisles, we think
we'll be closer to the low side going forward.
So if everyone is out bidding for the same stuff at the same time, it's gong to get more expensive. If we've got a longer
timeline and we can be an early mover because we've already done a lot of environmental study of our stations and
their emissions, and to the earlier question, we've already done a great deal of preliminary design that we know won't
change much, we think we'll be an early mover in that space, and that will allow us to continue to be on the lower side.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: So you've basically taken the proposed rules as they are today and some tolerance around
how whether the flexibility will actually play out the way the EPA's positioned it and then thinking about kind of
timing and competition for getting things done?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: That's exactly the way we tried to build the numbers.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: You bet.

And next we'll go to the line of Paul Ridzon from Keybank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Could you just tell us what the latest numbers are for shopping at Ohio Power and CSP?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, Paul, this is Brian Tierney. We're at about 12.7% of total CSP load right now. And as
you know, we expected to see ratably over the year, and guidance go to about 17%. One of the reasons we're not overly
concerned about that is we think that there's more switching up front as some of that lower hanging fruit is taken off by
some of the competitive retail suppliers.
And we think that of the people who will stay, they're becoming a larger percentage of the remaining pool. We're also
seeing, as I mentioned earlier, some capacity and energy offsets in terms of sales that we're able make to help
financially offset the customers who are leaving our system. So, while the percentage is higher than what we forecasted
at this time of the year, the financial impact is not commensurate with that higher percentage.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: And these capacity energy offsets are they, better than you were anticipating when you
first kind of thought about this?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: They are better than what we thought about.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: What's driving that?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Some of the things that we talk about in Off-System sales in terms of the heat rates being
higher than what we thought in the market. So as we're able to dispatch our units that aren't being dispatched for use of
our own load or aren't able to take those in the market, that's higher than what we thought. And as just in terms of
volume as some of those customers leave us and they're paying capacity payments, they're exceeding where we thought
we'd be at this time year-to-date, associated with the volume that's being served by competitive suppliers.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: And when you look at megawatts that you've won in other territories versus what you've
lost, how should we think about that?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, we're doing reasonably well in that activity also, Paul. It looks like 1.5 million
megawatt hour. So we continue to have some success and we'll continue to work in the area. So it's almost like the old
telephone game of customers call and say, they're leaving and we offer them an equally attractive rate or something
even a bit higher than the competitor because over the years we've treated these consumers pretty well and they know
that. So we're seeing some success in our retail operations and we continue to be aggressive in other jurisdictions other
than our own.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: And then just what's the latest thinking on PATH?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: The latest thinking on PATH?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Yes.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: We're ready, willing and able to go forward whenever the PJM wakes up and makes a
decision that makes sense.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Kind of what's your outlook as to when PJM could do that? Or what their timeline is?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, let's go back to one of the earlier questions. Why do you need to replace 5,500
megawatts with about a 1,000 megawatts combine cycle gas? That, the PATH project would allow for a rationalization
of facilities being built throughout the PJM to handle the impact of the potential premature offline reality that will come
from the EPA rule. So clearly, things are lining up to that project being done. It has always made sense and we believe
that it will always make sense. We aren't spending a penny on it right now, however, because it's crystal clear that the
way PJM sees it, they don't think they need it till 2020. We think time will demonstrate that it needs to be a little bit
earlier than that, and we stand ready to move forward on that project with or without our current partners.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Do you think PJM has thought hard enough about upcoming retirements?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, I'll tell you we had a very interesting meeting with them a week or so ago with their
leadership team and I think they got an eye-opener. And there's no question that there will be retirements from these
activities and you also see the arguments in front of the FERC that, please don't make the demand/response players
actually respond to demand reductions. I mean, how silly can that possibly be? If you're going to manage your demand
by people saying we'll drop off line when peaks are tough and then they argue that they don't want to dropped off line,
you can't run a farm like that; that's PJM's shortcoming.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: You can't make that up in volume, huh?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Not a chance, not a chance.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon MBA>: Okay, thanks a lot, Mike.

Next we go to line of Andrew Levi from Caris & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Just going back to Ohio and the non-bypassable charge, I guess two questions relating to that.
Number one, I guess you mentioned you're kind of talking to some of the parties, some of the interveners. Has the Ohio
Supreme Court decision – has that changed anyone's kind of positions? I mean, I know it's only been a few days but
have you seen kind of the other parties more willing to talk now relating to that?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: I wouldn't – it really is too early. I think a lot of folks are still reading it to see what it does
to their hold card, but what I quoted to you is verbatim from Senate Bill 221. That's exactly what it says and we find
great comfort in that, we have always found comfort in that. The Commission has not had to address the issue. We put
it in front of them in this ESP, particularly as it pertains to environmental investments.
We are, as I mentioned, quite heartened by the words that we heard from Governor Kasich, simply saying that he has
no desire for the State of Ohio to become a net importer of electricity at the whims of the neighboring states who are
competing for the same economic development investments and jobs that Ohio will compete for.
We feel pretty comfortable about what we're seeing when you look at the elected officials as well as phraseology we
heard from some interviews with some of the commissioners as they were being – taking over the chairmanship, as
well as joining the commission staff?
<Q - Andrew Levi>: And clearly this is a big key component of your entire filing.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: It is.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: And so as far as being able to grow earnings going forward and not absorb cost just for the
shareholders. How do you kind of – I mean, I hear what you're saying and I hear, obviously, what the Governor is
saying and you can read between the lines, which is a good thing to do. But what is the strategy between now and the
end of the year as you go through this filing? I mean, the commission at times has kind of had a mind of its own lately
and, obviously, you have a new chairman. What's the strategy to try to convince the Commission beyond obviously,
we're trying to work out a settlement, to see it your way. Because as you know, there's a neighboring utility who doesn't
see it your way and also has influence within the state. So what's kind of the political/regulatory strategy between now
and the end of the year regarding this?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, I think that the three utilities that want to make capital investments in Ohio see this
thing pretty clearly and collectively that capital investment in Ohio is important. We've also all made it very clear that
if we don't receive the appropriate message that capital investment in Ohio on the generation fleet will simply not go
forward, stations will be unfortunately shut down, property taxes will go down, job unemployment numbers will go up.
And so the cheer to the ESP is let's create jobs in Ohio, let's be self-sufficient in electricity so that we can bring other
jobs into Ohio and let's put capital to work so that the property tax base in the jurisdictions where those stations are
located go up. That's a pretty good cheer against the other one which is, let's not build anything, let's have electric rates
go higher so that we force jobs out of Ohio and let's have the cost of electricity go up. Let's cheer for Ohio shrinking,
that's not much of a cheer. So we feel comfortable about where we are.

<A - Michael G. Morris>: Hey, Neil, how are you?
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: Good, thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good, good.
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: I had a question on the Ohio Supreme Court opinion.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yep.
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: I guess specifically the Court took issue with this cost justification for the POLR charge.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yes.
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: But even if that justification was inadequate, how specifically does that violate Ohio law?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, it really doesn't. All it says is that the Commission would have to have another view
of how to go about determining what the exact POLR charge ought to be. I'm sure you know, Neil, that there are
different charges for residential, commercial, industrial customers. They would have to go back through those numbers
and simply find some comfort that those are reasonable charges to have.
Take a look at Michigan. I know a lot of you follow other states; we do business in Michigan so we're pretty familiar
with that. You can't just have a fleet sitting around and putting no capital to work on it and then when all of a sudden
22% of your commercial load decides to come home, all on the same day because other suppliers have failed to
perform, you just can't turn it around like that.
So provider-of-last-resort is something that we take very seriously as do all of the other utilities here in Ohio. And
doing it on a standing basis, as we're required to do, has cost associated with it; we can demonstrate those. We try to
demonstrate the value proposition in the overall formula that we presented and the Supreme Court said pretty clearly
that if that's the way you'd like to go Commission just tell us that on remand.
So the Commission has this in their hands. We think that that'll be reasonable about how they go about doing it and
we'll be required to justify those charges or they'll get adjusted and if they do, they do.
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: But back to the Court's specific objection. When you actually read SB 221, it seems like the
PUCO has very broad discussion to allow all sorts of charges and doesn't even necessarily need to provide justification,
at least for SB 221.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, remember when you read the case what they said to the Commission, an earlier case
is about POLR, was that they needed to be somewhat specific about how they came to their determinations. And what
the court is saying to the commission here, not that what you've done is wrong or violative of 221, it's just that you're
telling us your basing it on cost, yet when we look at the record we do not see an adequate support for the cost that you
say that you're basing it on. However, we see this formula and if the formula is what you determine to be the base of it,
that's fine with us, just tell us that. So it isn't illegal, that's why they remanded it rather than fixed it themselves. They
simply said you need to give us more information so we can see a clearer path on the logic for the decision that you
made.
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: So the issue is not that – what PUCO did violates SB 221, it more violates some earlier Supreme
Court opinion on POLR charges?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: No, no it kind of – again, the phraseology in the order itself for the 2009 ESP says we are
basing the POLR charge on cost as well as the protection that it yields to the customers. But the cost base of POLR will
be the X,Y and Z for the three classes of customers. And the record just simply doesn't have a full portrayal of what
those costs are. So there have been a number of appeals already determined on the 2009 ESP by the Supreme Court and
in those they simply have continued to send messages to the Commission. 221 gives you a great deal of latitude,
without question, but you need to demonstrate to us where your decision falls within the latitudes granted.

So if you look at the environmental spend in the nine subsets, we would argue, and may well yet argue in front of the
Supreme Court, that the introductory term, without limitation, means that those nine are enumerated but that there
could be 10, 11 and 12. That was the view that the Commission took. What the Supreme Court said in their order was,
without limitation, means these nine are very, very broad and you can stuff a lot of things in them if you'd like, but
make sure you tell us which of the nine they qualify for and tell us why you believe they fit into that place.
So, nothing illegal, nothing out of bounds, nothing really wrong, just give us more data and more rationale for why you
made the decisions that you made in the '09 case and that will spill over, we think, in a potentially constructive way in
the '12 case because the appeals in '12, I would argue, should be less because the specificity by the Commission will be
more.
<Q - Neil J. Stein>: Okay. Yeah, that was pretty much all my questions. Thanks so much.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: So we're ready for one final question, operator, if someone's on the line.
Operator
Thank you. That will be from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Hi. Good morning. Mike, just on the issue of the non-by-passables. I guess the other part of
the law says that the ESP needs to be better in the aggregate than an MRO.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Right.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Could you give some sense with the exact non-bypassables you're proposing kind of how
you show that it's better in the aggregate than an MRO?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, we think that we've made those portrayals in the filing that we've got in front of the
Commission and that will surely be part of the record as it continues to unfold. When you look at the overall market
price over a three-year cycle and you look at the rates that we've included for generation in the ESP and the investments
that we might need to make to keep some of those very cost-effective power plants on line, we think that we'll be able
to demonstrate that. But it'll be detailed cross examination of testimony and the actual hearings that'll go on, so it would
take us till about 10:30 to share all of that data with you and that really isn't accomplishable on the phone call. But
that's our challenge and that's what we're fully convinced we'll be able to do as we've done many times before.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: And just to – did you file the exact environmental investments that you think you'd need to
make over this period?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: No, what we included was a rider that would adjust for environmental investments that are
made on a going-forward basis. So the way that that would happen is we would made a demonstration to the
Commission that these needed to be done in compliance with whether it's the Transport rule or the Mercury, HAP's
rule, or 316(b), or CCS and you would demonstrate that you bid out the concept of who's going to actually implement
the construction of the policy and those will be the touchstones and once demonstrated, you'd make the rider
adjustment.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: How do we know then whether it's better than an MRO, if we don't know what the numbers
are?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, we'll continue to try to demonstrate that as we go forward with doing it. So it really
would be up to the Commission to look at that activity as they go. These are the same decisions that they had to make
last time. You could have easily looked at the ESPs that we all did and looked at market rates and forecasted them as
they've actually unfolded. We probably would have all been on a MRO for the last couple of years instead of ESP. So
these are difficult decisions for the Commission to make but we think decisions that they in fact will make.
