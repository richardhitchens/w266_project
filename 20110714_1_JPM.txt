So with that, let's turn to page 1. For the quarter, we generated net income of $5.4 billion, $1.27 a share on $27.4 billion
in revenues. We're highlighting several significant items in the quarter. They're included in the numbers for the lines of
business throughout the presentation, but I'll walk through them quickly.
First, as we've done in previous quarters, we're noting significant loan loss reserve releases. This quarter we have a
$0.15 per share increase in earnings from a reduction in Card Services' allowance for loan losses. We're identifying
$0.12 per share increase in earnings from securities gains in the investment portfolio in Corporate. Third, you'll see a
$0.15 per share decrease in earnings related to incremental expected costs on foreclosure-related matters, and I'll talk
about that later. And then finally, $0.19 per share decrease in earnings from additional litigation reserves,
predominantly for mortgage-related matters. And that runs through Corporate.
We ended the quarter with significant Tier 1 common: $121 billion. We continue to maintain strong Basel I and B III
ratios of 10.1% and 7.6% pro forma respectively. And these capital ratios also incorporate the impact of the repurchase
of $3.5 billion worth of JPMorgan shares in the quarter. You'll also see ROE in the quarter was 12%. Our return on
tangible common equity of 17%. Those two numbers are circled on the next page. And then broadly speaking, we did
have solid performance across the lines of business, but there were two positive trends for credit. First we are reporting
positive loan growth across each of our wholesale businesses. Total loan growth in wholesale, $32 billion
year-over-year or 15%, and $12.5 billion or 5% increase on the quarter. And then second we're continuing to show
improvement in our consumer credit trends but I'll talk about all those in specific.
So with that, why don't we turn to page 3, which is the Investment Bank. You see circled net income of $2.1 billion.
That's on revenues of $7.3 billion. We had strong IB fees in the quarter of $1.9 billion. That's up 37% year-on-year. We
continue to be ranked number one in fees but it still remains a highly competitive marketplace. We demonstrated
particularly strong results in our advisory and equities revenues this quarter, and for those that like to look at the league
tables, they're in the back on page 19.
We had solid market revenues of $5.5 billion, up 20% year-on-year, down 17% quarter-on-quarter from the first
quarter, which is seasonally strong. $4.3 billion in revenues and fixed income, and this generally represented consistent
client flows across all of our businesses in fixed income despite the difficult macroeconomic environment. $1.2 billion
in revenues in equities, very good results particularly given the volume declines in the cash market and the overall
volatility.
Prime services continued to grow this quarter, and we launched our international equity prime brokerage platform in
Europe. We expect to do the same in Asia in the first quarter of 2012. Credit costs, you see $180 million reduction in
the allowance for loan losses. That's largely related to net repayments, and you see non-accrual loans declined to $1.7
billion this quarter. Just remember we do expect credit costs to normalize going forward.
Expenses in the quarter of $4.3 billion in the investment bank, down 4% year-on-year, and you see comp-to-revenue
ratios of 35%. We continue to expect to maintain a 35% to 40% comp-to-revenue range for the full year. And the final
note is you did see modest loan growth in the IB balances up 3% quarter-on-quarter. Some of that growth is driven by
the build-out in our loan book associated with the global corporate bank. And on the international side, revenues grew
for the first six months of this year 11% from the first six months or first half of last year.
Page 4, Retail Financial Services, this is – as you remember, the consolidated view. I'll just spend a moment here. A
little over $580 million in net income in the quarter on $8 billion worth of revenue. Let's jump into the details on page
5. So if you go to the top of the page on page 5, Retail Banking, we had solid performance, net income of $1.1 billion.
That's on revenues of a little over $4.6 billion – a little under $4.6 billion. Revenues were up 5% year-on-year. That's a
function of higher debit card revenue, deposit related fees, investment sales, and offset slightly by lower deposit
spreads. Key drivers, from the prior page, we had 6% deposit growth, investment sales revenues were up 10%
year-on-year, business banking originations up 31% year-on-year. We built 52 new branches this quarter.
And then just a quick note to the right, you see on Durbin, we do anticipate the annualized gross revenue impact for the
Retail Banking segment to be $1 billion plus or minus. As you know, the final rules won't be implemented until the 1st
of October, so we won't see that impact until the fourth quarter. And we would expect mitigating actions to close a

significant amount of that gross impact over time.
Bottom of the page, Mortgage banking, Auto and Other Consumer, net loss of $450 million on revenues of $2.2 billion.
Revenues excluding MSR of $2.1 billion reflect $34 billion of mortgage loan originations this quarter, wider margins
year-over-year. Solid performance in Chase Auto in the quarter, and then you see lower repurchase losses, $223 million
for the quarter. Remember, that's contra revenue. And just a comment on repurchase losses, they're lower than trend
line this quarter just for timing related matters and we do expect the next two quarters to be more in line with our
guidance of $1.2 billion for full rate – full 2011 run rate.
You see expenses in the segment of $2.6 billion, and that includes the $1 billion incremental I discussed on page 1
related to foreclosure related matters. Other expenses continue to remain elevated as well, and that largely reflects the
ongoing high costs associated with default related expenses.
With that, why don't we turn to page 6 and the real estate portfolio. You see net income loss of $66 million. That's on
revenues of $1.2 billion, down about $150 million year-on-year, and that is a function of lower NII associated with
portfolio runoff. Balances declined year-on-year a little under $30 billion, a little under $7 billion quarter-on-quarter,
but the NII impact is consistent with the guidance we had previously given you related to a $700 million run rate for
2011.
Details of credit on page 7, you see the circled number here, net charge-offs of $944 million; modest improvement
versus the prior quarter. If you take a look at page 17 in the appendix, you'll see delinquency rates have also declined
modestly across all the portfolios, and all other things being equal, that would have a positive impact on future
charge-offs. I would remind folks that the second quarter tends to be positively impacted by seasonality so you might
see modest increases in the back half of the year, all other things being equal.
So if you step back here, given some of the uncertainty in the economic environment, the impact of severities related to
potential declines in HPI and future delinquencies as well as some of the industry discussions with regulators, we have
made no changes to reserves this quarter in either our non-credit impaired or our purchase credit impaired. You also see
we have maintained our guidance of a $1.2 billion plus or minus per quarter. Obviously if these trends that we just
reported continue, we'll readjust that guidance.
Page 8, we have updated a slide here that we used in Q4. It really lays out all our thoughts related to the mortgage
related reserve positions, and I'd say there are two pieces to this slide. On the top you've got real estate portfolio
reserves and agency-repurchase reserves. So start with real estate. NCI reserves, $9.7 billion at the end of this quarter.
They're more than two times our second quarter net charge-off annualized rate of $3.8 billion.
On the PCI side, we believe we're appropriately reserved based on our best estimates of life of loan losses for this
category. You should know that includes HPI deterioration of approximately 5% from current levels, and in order to
give you some sensitivity, an additional 5% decline in HPI which would be a total of 10% from today, would add about
a $1.5 billion to our reserves for that category.
On the agency repurchase reserves side, $3.6 billion of reserves and remember our guidance is $1.2 billion plus or
minus for 2011 for RFS. So if you stop and think about these two items, if credit trends do improve and repurchase
demands diminish over time, which inevitably they will, this may lead to a further reduction in those two reserve levels.
Now the last two items talk about incremental exposure, so first foreclosure related matters. We added $1 billion to
previously existing reserves for this category, and we believe our current reserves are our best estimate as to the various
costs for a whole multitude of complex foreclosure related matters, but that includes fees and assessments related to
foreclosure delays as well as payments for other settlements including the DOJ, state attorney generals and others.
For private label, we continue to build litigation reserves for this issue. We added to that in the quarter, as I told you.
And so if you step back for these two items, we believe these reserves are our best current estimates, but we do have a
long way to go until these items fully play out. And we could incur additional expenses for both of them. But
ultimately, in time we expect the costs for all of these items on the page to normalize.

So with that, let me move on to Page 9, Card Services, circled net income of a little over $900 million, revenues of $3.9
billion. Credit continues to be the story here. If you focus on the circled numbers at the bottom of the page, 5.28%
charge-off rate for the Chase portfolio, that's an improvement of a little over 90 basis points from last quarter. 30 plus
day delinquencies declined to 273 this quarter. That's an improvement of a little over 50 basis points from last quarter
and is a very low rate on an absolute basis. As a result of these improvements in our delinquencies, we did reduce our
estimated future losses, and as a result, released $1 billion dollars of loan loss reserves pre-tax.
And then just a quick moment on guidance for Q3. Because of the continued signs of improvement we're seeing, we do
expect 3Q charge-off rate to be 4.5% plus or minus, and that was our estimate, as you may recall, that we would reach
that level mid-2012, so rapid improvement in this portfolio. Revenue picture similar to last quarter, but down
year-over-year and the lower revenues year-over-year are driven by an average reduction in balances outstanding of
$21 billion year-over-year. That's been offset, similar to the prior quarter, in very positive sales volume. Chase
volume's up 10% year-over-year, 11% quarter-on-quarter. We continue to believe that sales volume is outpacing
industry sales growth, and as a result, we think we're improving our market share.
I'd also highlight a net revenue rate at the bottom, 11.95% excluding WaMu and Commercial Card. That's up almost 50
basis points quarter-on-quarter and it's in line with the steady-state target of 12% that Gordon shared with you all at
Investor Day. And then a final comment on balances. We are experiencing very high repayment rates, and if those
persist, outstanding balances could be between $115 billion and $120 billion at year-end
Page 10, the Commercial Bank, circled net income of $600 million. That's on record revenues this quarter of $1.6
billion. Revenues up 9% year-on-year. That's growth in liability and loan balances, record gross IB revenues this
quarter for the customer base. ECS circled, end of period balance of loans of a little under $103 billion. That's up $2.5
billion quarter-on-quarter, $7 billion year-on-year. And that balance has increased for each of the last four consecutive
quarters. The middle market end of period balances are up 17% year-on-year and they've actually increased five
consecutive quarters. And again, we think loan growth is a mix of demand, market share gains as well as the effects of
the build-out of the WaMu expansion states.
The utilization rates for loans continues to remain low, but we did actually see this quarter a modest up-tick in middle
market utilization rates. And then just a final note: you see the liability balances grew almost 20% year-on-year to $163
billion. That continues to be driven by clients generating free cash flow and their own balance sheets continue to
improve.
Page 11, Treasury and Security Services, net income for the quarter of $330 million, up 14% year-on-year, 5%
quarter-on-quarter. TSS revenues and margin continue to be negatively impacted by the low rate environment we have.
Revenue growth in the quarter up 3% year-on-year, 6% year-on-year if you excluded the transfer of Commercial Card
to Card Services. Record assets under custody here, $16.9 trillion in WSS. Record trade loan balances, $27.5 billion, up
68% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. And just remember as well, the second quarter gets seasonal benefit from the
dividend season and ADR activity. Expenses continue to be up as we continue to invest in our international footprint,
and we're starting to see some benefits to that. International revenue this quarter represented 55% of total revenue for
TSS. That's up from 49% a year ago, and revenue internationally is up 16% year-on-year, 9% in the quarter.
Page 12, Asset Management. You see circled revenue of $2.5 billion. Solid revenue growth, 23% year-on-year. It was
driven by higher performance fees, positive markets relative to last year, and positive flows into our long-term
products, up $19 billion quarter-on-quarter. This is now the ninth consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows in
Asset Management. Circled net income of $440 million in the quarter, that's up 12% year-on-year, modestly down
quarter-on-quarter, and that's on higher expenses from investment spend and higher performance based compensation.
Here again, international revenue is up for this business, 27% year-on-year.
Page 13 is Corporate Private Equity, $444 million in net income for Private Equity in the quarter, a strong quarter.
Gains reflect a number of specific realizations, improvements in the market value of positions we held in the quarter.
You see Corporate reported net income a little under $60 million, and two items run through this. So we already noted
the securities gains as well as the litigation expense, and we continue to have guidance absent these significant items
and absent private equity, corporate should generate $300 million plus or minus per quarter.

Page 14, Fortress Balance Sheet, I've covered most of the items. We've added some additional items, a chart at the
bottom and some bullet points I want to highlight. Remember as it relates to Basel III, the countercyclical buffer and
the G-SIFI surcharge are going to come in over time and you see that in the chart to the bottom left. The minimum in
January of 2017 will be 7%, and you see our current estimated Basel III of 7.6% today.
Second observation is we continue to believe we are going to generate significant excess capital over this period, and I
would say after investing for organic growth and consistent with meeting those guidelines over time, we expect to be
able to return excess capital to our shareholders, and we don't intend to accelerate the compliance as it relates to the
G-SIFI surcharge, but we'll get there over time.
I think page 15, I have covered operators, so with that, why don't we open the line up for questions for Jamie and
myself.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks. Quick follow up on your comments on the fortress balance sheet. If you don't plan on
accelerating and you're obviously generating a lot of excess each quarter, do you have buy-in from the regulators to
deploy as you see fit? And I'm not implying that you're going to have a 100% payout ratio for the next five years, but
curious on your thoughts on that.
<A - James Dimon>: So, we have to – you have to apply under ICAP or whatever it's called, the regulators, to increase
dividends and buy back stock. We already announced we had the permission to do $8 billion. It's quite obvious to us
we're going to have a lot of extra capital and cash, not just the in next short run, but over the next several years. And we
will apply for more as appropriate. I can't tell you exactly what they're going to do.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Understood, understood. How about another swipe at capital at a different angle, if you – I think
people are underestimating your ability to mitigate on the risk weighted asset side, and that will actually supercharge
actually your capital ratio growth over the next couple years. If you look at the buffer itself, the G-SIFI buffer, the way
I calculate it, you have about an $11 billion capital penalty relative to any given pure play.
<A - James Dimon>: Right.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Of the businesses that you own. Is there anything that can be done about that, whether it be a
spin or shrinkage or...? I'm almost as frustrated as you about it, but I'm curious to get your thoughts on what can be
done about it.
<A - James Dimon>: You couldn't possibly be as frustrated as me, okay? So you're right. It's how you calculate it. But
a lot of things are going to happen, Glenn. For example, I think it will force competitors in a lot of areas to go to the
higher number. So you're going to find a lot of people, they won't be able to survive at 7 in whatever business they're
in, because all the other competitors are going to be at 8 or 9 or something like that. But assuming your number is right,
it is not a huge drag on returns. But it also gives the opportunity to cherry pick the businesses you want. So I think you
will see a lot of very tight management of RWA type businesses, balance sheet items. In a lot of ways I personally
think that's a waste of time, but that's what will happen so that you can get good adequate returns on capital.
In some ways a G-SIFI will be a plus. You'll win business that other people have a hard time competing for, in other
things it could be a negative, like, for example, owning consumer assets might be a negative. On the other hand, you
can originate, sell, securitize, so you can still be in the generation business but not necessarily the holding the asset
business. And I also think you'll see plenty of non-banks, good and bad, grow to handle and own some of these other
asset classes and other forms of securitizations do the same thing. So it's a long road, and I think we'll still have very
good business when it's all said and done.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Yes, hi, good morning. Doug, there seems to be a big build-up in liquidity on the
balance sheet. You mentioned that. Can you give a little color on that? Is being driven by the lack of investment options
amid low rates or is it being driven by the new regulatory rules that might be coming out around liquidity?
<A - James Dimon>: We have deposits coming in, in middle market, TSS and we accept those deposits and we have to
invest them. So it's not a deliberate building up of liquidity. It's just dealing with the deposits as they come in.
Remember that liquidity is only one side of the balance sheet.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: And any color on the net interest margin this quarter? Was that the big driver of the
decline sequentially in net interest margin this quarter?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It was a combination, Glenn (sic) [John], of we sold some certain assets, the Kohl's
portfolio, a mix in our loan balances towards more lower yielding assets, and then deposit inflows you talked about.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: And is there any – do you have any outlook on the net interest margin or net interest
income, Doug?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I think if rates stay where they are, you can continue to expect to see modest pressure
on NIM.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay. And then just a question on expenses, did you see the increase in FDIC
premiums this quarter, and could you tell us what that was?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, we did. And approximately $100 million.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay. And that's...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Run rate on a $1 billion change run rate total, increase of $100 million this quarter.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay. And then...
<A - James Dimon>: We're paying more FDIC insurance and we're paying for all the bankrupted banks.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: And last thing for me, Jamie, could you give some commentary around your
exposure to the European countries that are subject to concern and how you think about sizing downside risk for you
guys?
<A - James Dimon>: Right. So Greece, Italy, Ireland Portugal and Spain, it's still about the net exposure, so it's net of
collateral, and it's non-sovereign collateral of about $15 billion. Think of those exposures as banks, sovereign, and
corporates. And we're managing that exposure to – we have a big business in those countries and we intend to be in
those countries for a long time, so we're not going to cut and run.
In my Chairman's letter I wrote about worst case, which I do not expect to happen, even today, that it could cost us
maybe $3 billion after tax. That's my best guess by the way, so that can obviously be dramatically different. But I still
don't expect that. The real impact of failures over there would be on what does it do to the global economy, what does it
do to other exposures in Europe, what does it do to, you know, exposures in the United States. And you can guess as
well as I can. I don't expect it will be a disaster for French and German banks. Obviously there are exposures in France
and Germany and elsewhere, but I think those things will probably all be fine.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Hi. Just a follow up on that. Some people look at the disclosure and looking at different
pieces of the disclosure you can come to different conclusions as to whether or not you're a net buyer or seller of
protection on your credit. Could you just give a little color as to how you're thinking about that as it relates to the
European exposure that you have?
<A - James Dimon>: A buyer of credit exposure on the five nations I just spoke about?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: On – I mean, you can't get to that level of detail, obviously, in the disclosure, but you
can see whether or not you're...
<A - James Dimon>: Here's the problem with numbers that you see, because there is a public disclosure that shows
those five countries being like $100 billion, right?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: But that $100 billion does not include collateral, it does not include hedging. And we do a lot of
hedging, both specific name and country hedging. So that's the issue with that. So my $15 billion is net of hedging, net
of collateral, and I mean non-sovereign collateral. So we wouldn't include Greek collateral – Greek sovereign collateral
for a Greek repo. We only include collateral outside of Greece. So that's where the $15 billion comes from. That's the
best estimate of the exposure. It bounces around all the time. And there was some report in the press today, I saw that
Greece and – I mean Germany and France was $300 billion. Same issue. Those are very gross exposures, and the
numbers would be 10% of that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: But can you give us a sense as to how big of an exposure you're comfortable with?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, we're comfortable with the $15 billion right now.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: The bulk of that is in Spain and Italy and a lot of that is also corporate. And you know corporates
are – you've got to be very careful when you talk about – even when you had failures in Argentina and Mexico, a lot of
the corporates were okay. So you've got to be very careful. We've been doing business in those countries for a long
period of time. So our current thinking is that we're going to continue to do business there and manage those exposures.
We're not trying to drive them down. And I hope that one day some of these European nations appreciate the fact we're
not cutting and running.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: And then just separately on the Moody's last night announcement that they would put
the U.S. government debt on review, how do you think about managing the risk around that?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, when you say manage the risk around that, that's a tough one to answer. The risk around –
when you're talking about just a downgrade risk? I think that's manageable. But that will cause problems and issues
because some people need AAA collateral, some people can't own. So it will cause issues. I don't like these downgrade
issues. But a government default issue is far more severe than that. And that would cut across intraday lines, revolvers,
takedown of revolvers, money market funds, securities lending. Something like $3 or $4 trillion of Treasuries are used
as collateral around the world. It would change the pricing of securities. Some buyers – some owners would be forced
to sell because they're not allowed to own defaulted securities.
I don't know what the rating agencies would do if the United States goes into real default. If it goes into real default,
can they keep the United States at AA plus? I don't know. If they move it down to D, which is default, that would cause
a lot of other issues and people would be forced to sell. So there are huge cross-currents in that, and it's not the kind of
thing that I think people should play with. And what surprises me about the conversation at all isn't – you can talk about
all the potential catastrophic outcomes, but no one can possibly say in my opinion who is semi-rational could possibly

say that there is no chance of a catastrophic outcome. And therefore why would you take that risk?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: And then just lastly on Basel III, could you give us a sense as to how you see the
RWAs trajecting? Should we be looking for this type of shrinkage rate Q-on-Q going forward, or how do you think
through that?
<A - James Dimon>: First of all, it's so far out. So what I think we're saying now is that we originally made a
statement that we're going to go to the 7% right away. We're at 7.5%. We don't need to be higher than 7.5%. I'm not
sure the regulators want people to move higher than that very quickly because they do believe that would cause a lot of
banks to dramatically reduce their balance sheets. We're going to generate so much excess capital, but there's no need
to be over 7.5%.
So one of the things that will drive excess capital is the runoff, and what I call natural mitigation. There are certain
things in the balance sheet that will run off that are big users of capital. Think credit hybrids, re-securitizations, lower
rated things. And then there will be other decisions we make over time of businesses we may not want to be in because
they use up too much capital. And so it will be a wide variety of things. But I think at the end of the day we'll still be
able to get very good returns for our shareholders and the capital we do deploy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: I guess the other thing is as RWAs are coming down, you're going to see that ratio drift
up, obviously, all other things equal, and there's only so much you can buy back at least at this stage. So you're
basically saying...
<A - James Dimon>: That ratio is going to drive up so fast people are going to be surprised. And that's not just for us
by the way. I've mentioned this before. You're going to see a lot of banks in the U.S. and maybe some banks around the
world start to generate huge amounts of excess capital. Everyone is on a different timetable. So maybe some banks may
be a quarter or two behind us, but it will happen and then they won't know what to do with it. That's what's going to
happen. We're going to have huge excess capital in the banking system in about 12 months. Way beyond what the
banking system needs and God knows why we have to hold all that capital, but that's where we are.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: I guess what I'm saying is we shouldn't expect that you're going to be able to manage to
your 7.5% ratio Q-on-Q-on-Q.
<A - James Dimon>: All I'm saying is we don't see any need to go over that. We may not be able to avoid going over
that, is that what you're saying?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Yeah, okay. Thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: And then if we have that problem, we'll figure out what we can do.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Thank you. I guess within the Card business, it looked like NII came down quite a
bit, and I guess a lot of that is Kohl's or part of it is Kohl's at least. And then fee income kind of went up quite a bit. Is
there any kind of movement within that we should know about or kind of strategy shift?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Kohl's, you're right. We had $3.7 billion of assets out, impacted NII. We had high –
remember that was more of a loan trade as opposed to a fundamental business trade. So we had high expenses
associated with that. And then fee income is up because we've got more transactors, and that's a function of the sales
volume.
<A - James Dimon>: Which is great. I mean the sales volume is up 10% or something.

<A - James Dimon>: It's really extraordinarily good.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: If you exclude Kohl's, sales volume was up 13%.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Got it. And then I guess your commentary on agency put-back, I guess, seemed
positive. One of your competitors a week or two ago I guess took the other tack saying they were seeing a change in
agency behavior and actually seeing more put-backs from Fannie Mae. Have you seen any adverse changes in kind of
what they're doing?
<A - James Dimon>: No, we've estimated the agency put-backs and obviously there's change in the timing issues, but
we – it was our best estimate. If we see a different thing, we'll let you know. We've been a little conservative on that,
hopefully.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Got it. And then just lastly, you talked about recouping a portion of the Durbin
Amendment, and I know it's something you've talked about in the past. Any terms of being able to quantify that or kind
of where you are in terms of kind of putting strategies in place?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes. So it's $1 billion. It's very careful – we're not going to do anything that's not consumer
friendly. So a lot of that, quote, recoupment will be – and some of this has already happened a little bit with rewards
programs and we're going to test various things, and you already have some checking accounts that have modest fees in
it. So we're going to come up with something that will help mitigate that a little bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - James Dimon>: Morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: A question on the home lending net charge-off guidance. You know, you're under $1 billion
now for the quarter for the first time in a long time. I'm conscious of the seasonality comment that you made. But with
the guidance still at $1.2 billion, is it realistic to think that it could pop that much based on your models? How much
would we need to see unemployment rise or home price depreciation accelerate in order to get back to that $1.2 billion
kind of number?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, so the reason – you're right. It should run lower than $1.2 billion, but embedded in our
thinking is as home prices go down a little bit, there's a lot of uncertainty, we still have the DOJ and the AGs, there are
going to be changes in how we have to modify loans and service loans, we have foreclosure delays and all that kind of
stuff, so we're just trying to be conservative here. It's not likely to be higher than $1.2 billion next quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. Thanks very much.

<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: So if there were a settlement announced that was consistent with what you were expecting,
the P&L impact would be small or nothing going forward?
<A - James Dimon>: It's just an estimate. So it will be plus or minus something, but yes.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Sure. Okay. And just to also follow up on the Durbin question, you mentioned kind of things
that could be consumer friendly. Have you kind of looked at or tested any kind of changes in products that might, you
know, kind of be able to get better interchange rates than a debit product like switching people to charge cards? Is that
something that you've kind of looked at? How should we think about -
<A - James Dimon>: We're going to look at every possibility, and there are a lot of restrictions of what we can do,
because they've blocked off like a charge card with automatic deductions at the end of the year, but we're going to look
at every possibility and hopefully offer our customers great products and great services, better than some of the
non-bank competitors, and get paid for it.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great. Okay. And I guess maybe just kind of following up on the capital question, last
quarter you kind of felt like – you kept talking about the stock buyback as being relative to kind of where the price of
the stock is. I mean, would it be fair to say that given everything that you see now that in the third quarter you'd still be
deploying capital in that direction?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, but we're not going to tell you what we do day in and day out, but we bought $3.5 billion
around these prices, and like we said, we're going to have continued capital generation, so we're in a position to buy
more.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thank you very much. On the foreclosure expenses that you've taken now, I think either with the
MSR evaluation and this one is a straight-up $1.3 billion, do you think you got that ring fenced? Do you think you need
to continue to take some of these expenses or do you think you've taken most of them at this point?
<A - James Dimon>: So GSE, we think we're done. The foreclosure delays and settlements, etcetera, we have an
estimate. My guess is it can be a little bit higher, but it's hopefully not a huge number. MSR, work will be done. It
could be a little bit but it shouldn't be a lot more. And the private label stuff will probably go up a little bit, but I doubt
it will go up more than the reserves we're going to have to take down in the next 12 months.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay, and the other – go ahead.
<A - James Dimon>: It's possible we're very over-reserved in mortgage land too so – but that's litigation. We think it's
going to go the litigation route. We don't know how you can do it the other way, so that's why we have it under
litigation. We're not going to disclose exactly the numbers for that.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And the other question is going back to the NIM question again, you know, with rates
staying here and I think you said a little bit earlier in the call that you expect modest declines in NIM, at what point do
you just let the balance sheet start to roll down? I mean, what's that sacrifice? Because if you grow your balance sheet,
it seems that you're going to have more NIM pressure. Just let it roll off with rates at these levels?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, we don't look at NIM. NIM is just – we have profits, and we have clients. So the clients are
the same as deposits. We don't want to turn them away if they're good clients. So even if you have to invest at a very
small spread, you probably would do that, right? Because you're building your business. And obviously what we are
constantly managing our interest rate exposure, and rates going up will help us. Whether – we can change that
tomorrow and increase our NIM, but then you're taking far more exposure against rising rates.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: Hi. For the investment banking revenues, quarter over quarter, Asia was the lowest in a
while, and Europe didn't go down as much as the overall segment. Can you describe what's happening there?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yeah, Mike. Asia, just lower volumes. It's a heavily equity related business in Asia
both in investment bank and markets and lower volumes second quarter. Europe, we had good performance this quarter
in our markets business and the investment bank.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: And the markets businesses, why did it get better? Are you benefiting from the volatility?
Is there more activity? What's happening there?
<A - James Dimon>: Everything was down a little bit from last quarter, but all the businesses pretty much continue to
have pretty good flow. Client flow businesses. And...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: I guess I'll just ask my question straight out. I mean, is there a chance for another scenario
like you had in the United States in 2008, 2009 in Europe over the next couple of years given what they're going
through?
<A - James Dimon>: Mike, your guess is as good as ours on that. Of course it's possible that some of these things start
to get worse and cause severe problems, so we're very conscious of that. And how it blows back to the United States,
it's hard to tell.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: Let me shift gears. Syndicated lending, how much did that contribute to the growth in
wholesale loans, and what were your syndicated lending fees this quarter? And what's your view on the market overall?
It seems like it's really growing quickly.
<A - James Dimon>: It's a good business. But it's less than 20% of the $1.9 billion of total investment banking fees,
and the balance sheet – remember, only some of that stays in the balance sheet. We sell old loans, we syndicate loans,
we have distressed stuff that goes off the balance sheet. So the build-up – most of the buildup, as I think I've already
mentioned, was global core banking and the conduit business, which we still think is a good business. But the syndicate
business, the investment bank balance sheet, loan balance sheet stuff bounces all over the place because corporations
always have the ability generally to go to the markets. So they always decide between bonds and loans and even at the
loans, some of that – a lot of that stuff gets syndicated.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: All right. Let me shift gears to credit cards. I mean, you improved the loss rates by 100
basis points; now you expect another 75 basis points lower. You're typically pretty conservative in your guidance. What
gives you such confidence that those losses are going to go down so much?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, Mike, we have tremendous visibility on next quarter already just by looking at
delinquencies and roll rates. So you have very good visibility one quarter out and some visibility two quarters out.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: So what's your new...
<A>: We won't see that one go up in the next quarter. Put it that way.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: What's your new estimate for mid-2012?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, we're not going to give you one, but if things continue the way they are, it will be pretty
good.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: And lastly what was the average price where you bought back stock last quarter?

Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Susquehanna.
<Q - David Bruce Hilder>: Good morning. Thanks. Two timing questions and then one about the reserves. Would you
expect to have changes in debit card or consumer pricing ready by October 1st to begin mitigating immediately?
<A - James Dimon>: No, so you'll see the full effect of Durbin will be fully felt in the fourth quarter. It will be about
$250 million, and it will be barely mitigated in the fourth quarter.
<Q - David Bruce Hilder>: Okay. And any thoughts on timing of the resolution of the state Attorneys General
investigation on foreclosures? There had been some speculation that it might be resolved by now.
<A - James Dimon>: I would do anything to get it done today, but our counsel advises us that it could take quite a
while. There are a lot of parties engaged in this. And I gather people have gotten much closer on that, but if we get that
call, we'll be down there on an airplane and we'll be signing off. One of the reasons to do that is it's good for the United
States of America to get behind us all this stuff, to fix it, and move on. Delaying foreclosures and all the uncertainty
around mortgages is not a good thing for the economy. I think you understand that. So we stand ready to do it as soon
as we can.
<Q - David Bruce Hilder>: Thank you.
<A - James Dimon>: But we've got to get it right. We're not going to do it and be subject to double and triple jeopardy.
We'd rather litigate it.
<Q - David Bruce Hilder>: And for the corporation as a whole, was the total litigation reserve expense in the quarter
$1.3 billion that's in corporate, or were there additional litigation reserves elsewhere in the segments?

Obviously the NIM percent was down a fair amount this quarter, but the net interest income dollars was down a little
less than $100 million, and with the balance sheet starting to grow from here, do we see continued stabilization and
then some growth in the back half of the year in the dollars?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: You're going to have declined pressure from the portfolio run-offs, a little less for card
over time, but continue in RFS. And loan balances are going to drive the aggregate dollars, and we'll see where demand
is.

<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, as we think about the macro environment and a lot of
us have been waiting for higher rates and more activity overall and hopefully it's going to come but it's hard to have too
much confidence in that any time soon, is there kind of a plan B in maybe if the investment spend and card, retail, asset
management, the deposit pricing? Just what are some of the contingency plans that you have if we're stuck with low
rates for a few more years and we're just kind of hobbling along with 2%, 2.5% growth?
<A - James Dimon>: I'm not sure what you mean by plan B. We're not going to stop growing our business and hiring
bankers and opening branches and growing checking accounts and trying to do more trading business and making
middle market loans, because you have a peculiar interest rate curve and if it squeezes margins a little bit in some
places, so be it.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: I guess...
<A - James Dimon>: We can change that in two minutes. So if you want an increased NIM, we can just increase
interest rate exposure and increase NIM.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: But I guess the concern I hear from some investors is that banks in general continue to
hold out hope for higher rates and that the deposits will be worth more and keep a bigger expense infrastructure than
what's needed for the current environment, hoping for rates to rise, revenues to come back, and it is possible, looking
out a few years from now, that things aren't much different than what we have right now.
<A - James Dimon>: If it's not that different, we'll still be fine. You know, we'll figure out ways to price products and
services and make a margin. We'll be fine.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly if I may, as we think about your private equity business, it's
continuing to turn out very good returns. I think there is going to be some limits in what you can do in this segment
with regulation going forward. Are there any thoughts or opportunities to unlock some of that value or how it might
play out in terms of being sold or spun out?
<A - James Dimon>: You're making a good point. We have – we are blessed to have One Equity Partners, which we
think is just an exceptional group of people. And obviously we always say about private equity, those gains themselves
are going to be lumpy. We're like Warren Buffet in this one. We prefer 20% average but lumpy returns than 12%. So
over time this number will go up or down, but it's real earnings for the company. You just can't book into your model
every quarter, but it's real earnings for the company, and we expect to get those 20% returns over time.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: And I guess my question was about the business as a whole. Will it still be under the
JPMorgan umbrella or over time will it be sold or spun...?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, yes.

<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Good morning. Couple of questions left. One, as we look at you building a lot of excess
capital and as we look out there potentially could be a lot of distressed sellers out there, how are you thinking about the
potential for acquisitions to cross a regulatory capital threshold and maybe push your capital requirements up even
higher than the 9.5% kind of Basel number people are talking about now?
<A - James Dimon>: We don't know the final rules on that yet. Remember, that stuff will be in effect for eight years,
so give us a little time in that one. But we would certainly use our capital if we thought there were things that we could
do that were great for shareholders, whether it's buying a company or buying assets. So if you have any brilliant ideas,
give us a call.

<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Okay. And secondly, when we talk about the five European nation exposures and the gross
versus the net, how can we get some comfort from the outside about the effectiveness of hedges? Because I keep
having flashbacks to the crisis where things like monolines were viewed as effective hedges and we found out they
weren't.
<A - James Dimon>: Right. But we didn't have a lot of that either, did we? So I've already said it was non-sovereign
collateral. Some of these things have collateral. That's usually pretty good. We are very careful what we take as
collateral. Some of the hedges are not perfect. There's some country CDS hedges that are offsetting company type of
exposures. And we have specific name exposures that are sometimes directly offset. So some of it is in the trading book
or derivative exposure which change over time, but we're – that's why I say the $15 billion – and we're pretty
conservative on it, and obviously you can make money be worse or better off than you think. But it's not going to move
by $15 billion. You're talking about being plus or minus $1 billion here or there.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hi, good morning. One question on fixed income trading. That held up, I think, a lot better
than people were expecting. We saw year-over-year improvement for the first time in five quarters. I guess a better
comparison versus a year ago, but also is that a sign that we're starting to see spread compression ease in fixed income
as things normalize here? Or is that unique to you guys just showing some good market share? How should we think
about your results there? Was it just lumpy or you think that's indicative of the market industry sort of stabilizing?
<A - James Dimon>: I think I can categorize it as that spreads have normalized. They have been back to normal for a
while. Obviously it changes in every business a little bit, and the flows have been good. You know, they've been good
fairly much across all the products. Some months were lower than others, but it's really those two things.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Fair enough. And on the deposit side, you had a big improvement I think $50 billion
or so sequentially on average deposits. Most of that seemed to be in TSS. Is that a reflection of a flight to safety given
the macro concerns out there? And if so, does that continue into July?
<A - James Dimon>: I think a little bit was a flight to safety and a little bit was just people managing their own
balance sheets, and there's a lot of liquidity around the world, and some of it went away early in the quarter.

stuck with higher capital, you may not like it but you're stuck with it. One thing you can cut expenses or you can
re-price. So can you talk about across the businesses and maybe particularly in investment banking what you're doing
in terms of re-pricing and how you manage that with competition?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes. I don't think in the wholesale businesses you're seeing re-pricing yet, because I don't think a
lot of these things are actually effective yet. I think you have seen some re-pricing in consumer business and more
relating to all the other legislation, the card and the overdraft and stuff like that. So I don't think you've seen it exactly

yet in wholesale businesses.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: But you need to. And I know just anecdotally you're re-pricing some of your products. Are
we not even in stage 1 yet, is what you're saying?
<A - James Dimon>: We're not even in stage 1 of re-pricing.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: There are a lot of other changes coming too: Margin requirements and how these things get
applied globally, the liquidity requirements which I think will cause some re-pricing, so there is very little yet.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. But even from a cost structure basis to offset that, there's got to be re-pricing?
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, I think you're going to see re-pricing in certain types of deposits and certain types of loans
and certain types of revolvers, shorter duration revolvers. I think you're going to see those things but we haven't really
seen them yet.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. The second question is on if you could – this is a stretch, but if you could provide
some type of outlook on the impending announcement I guess that's coming over the next two weeks vis-à-vis Fanny,
Freddie and new housing initiatives? What the scenarios could be either if it's Fanny, Freddie back-stopping or
guaranteeing mortgages or potential cram down, what the best policy in your opinion would be, and then what various
limited various policies, how that would affect you? And then I have one last question.
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, I guess again – so the one that's going to happen is the reducing the maximum size of the
guarantee from 750 to 630, whatever it is. We don't think that's going to have a substantial impact, but we think 1% of
volume is done in between those levels. So the impact of that will be jumbos will go up a little bit, and where you sell
the agencies will go down a little bit. Most of the changes they're talking about are not in the near term. They're just
talking about them to be effective years from now. So there's plenty of time to figure out how to do that. At the end of
the day we'll be in the mortgage business and I think it will return to being a good business. You know, it will be much
more conservative, much more carefully done, there'll be much different servicing standards. But I don't think the
announcement is going to change that much.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. Thank you. On the investment banking side, your DCM results are so much better
than what we have heard from the rest of the Street. And so what we hear from the rest of the Street is there's a risk off
trade during the quarter, volumes were low, people got a lot of, obviously this wouldn't be flow, but people got risk
averse because they got a lot of the moves, silver, whatnot, wrong early in the quarter and your results were so strong.
Is that suggestive of the fact that your clients are more risk aggressive, or can you put that into context with the rest of
the industry?
<A - James Dimon>: When you say DCM, are you talking about primary issuance or are you talking about trading,
secondary?
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Primary issuance and trading.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So we kept the number one share and...
<A - James Dimon>: And we were more of the lead manager in the number one share.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right. So kept the number one share. Market share actually for us grew a little bit
in the second quarter as a percentage matter.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. And that's...
<A - James Dimon>: And part of the DCM number is also syndicated loans, which we're obviously pretty strong in
too.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Okay. So maybe that makes up the difference. Could be?

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Good morning. Two quick questions. Just in terms of the home lending portfolio, we saw that
drop about $30 billion year-over-year, and that's in line with the outlook that you had given. Any update on the pace
that we can expect that portfolio to continue to shrink over the next year or two? That would be the first question.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: 10% to 15% a year.
<A - James Dimon>: Forever.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Forever. I guess maybe that's what I'm looking for. Any idea on when you think that might
start to stabilize? Obviously not in the near term, but...
<A - James Dimon>: It's going to go down 10 or 15% a year until it's close to zero. That's what it's going to do.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: Listen, the world isn't doing subprime anymore. The world isn't doing – well, so home equity
will come down to a number and then stabilize, but it's a lot lower than it is today. And jumbo is a decision that you
make whether to put on balance sheet or not, and I think that class of asset will be most affected by some of these
G-SIFI things, so we'll see on that one. So we can buy or sell portfolio things any time we want.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: All right. So you expect that to continue to come down pretty much at that pace at least over
the next several years?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. And then second question would be is there anything that would stop you, as you
continue to deploy excess capital? I know it looks like you have about $4.5 billion left on your current repurchase
authorization. You may want to increase your dividend. Is there anything that would stop you from going back to the
Fed before the end of the year to get more approvals to deploy even more capital than you have approved right now?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, remember, the board is the primary driver of capital decisions, and so, no, the board – if
we think it was appropriate to talk to the regulators again about capital, we would.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Right. Prior to the next round of capital stress tests?
<A - James Dimon>: Right. I think it's important to point out that the board is responsible for this company, not just
the regulators.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator
Your next...
<A - James Dimon>: It's still America. Capitalism is still alive. If the regulators start making all the capital decisions,
then they should be the board.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys share some color on the asset yields? In your loan
portfolio, we have been hearing anecdotal evidence that competition is very, very aggressive. Did you guys see that this
quarter as the yields came down sequentially to 5.36% from 5.62%?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So that driver is really a mix related issue. You know, spreads on loans if you look at
our commercial bank middle market stayed very healthy this quarter.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good. The other question I have is regarding Jamie's comment about what could happen if the
U.S. is downgraded to an AA plus. Would that actually help your business? Would you guys see an increase in
business as people start shifting their portfolios?
<A - James Dimon>: It's possible, but we're not wishing for it.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Sure, no, no, I understand that.
<A - James Dimon>: It's a bad way to win. We want to see the United States be happy and growing and jobs. That's
what we want to see.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Certainly.
<A - James Dimon>: And if for some reason that's not great for JPMorgan's share so be it.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And finally on the comment you guys made about the payoffs or repayments on the credit card
portfolio, you expect them to remain pretty high; the guys on the front line, are they telling you why you're still seeing
such high repayments on the credit card portfolios? What's driving the consumers' behavior?
<A - James Dimon>: Well, I guess part of our repayment has just been a mix to much higher quality clients and more
transactor clients, so some of that was expected. It's going to stabilize soon, and so, no, the rate may not actually
change at one point. But we'll eventually have growth in the portfolio anyway.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Hi, thanks. Yeah, Jamie, I was wondering if you could elaborate on your comment you made
earlier on about the fact that the G-SIFIs will have higher capital ratios that might force the companies that will be in
lower buckets to actually have higher capital as well. I wasn't sure I really understood that.
<A - James Dimon>: What I'm saying is do this by business, okay? If you are a company right below the G-SIFI and
some of these G-SIFIs or SIFIs have a lot more capital, you may start losing business because of that because it might
be easier for boards and investors and people to say, you know what? Leave those deposits with the G-SIFI, put it over
here. So I'm saying it may become a small competitive disadvantage for the non-SIFI. And so I could see that you're
going – I could see you might hear from some of the smaller banks that they're going to be forced to hold the higher
capital numbers for competitive reasons.
I don't know about that, but I'm just – look, I think it will be a lot – I think when you do something like this, like a
G-SIFI where they're going to give all these reasons why you have to do it, I think it's going to cause a lot of distortions
which are harder to figure out today. I think we'll win some business because of it. I think there are things not in the
balance sheet because of it. I think you're going to see some small banks complain about it, not realizing that that's
going to hurt them competitively. So I just think you'll see a lot of to-ing and fro-ing because of this issue.

<Q - Ron Mandle>: I guess I could see it more in the commercial businesses or not even commercial but in the big
wholesale businesses than I could see in the more down in the branches consumer businesses.
<A - James Dimon>: Yeah, I think you're probably right. It will be more in the global wholesale businesses than
maybe the consumer side.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Yeah, and then my other question regarding litigation, you know, one attorney general who
operates nearby seems to be going off on his own beyond the 50 or in addition to the 50 states. How are you thinking
about what Schneiderman is up to, and are you reserving for what he may be thinking about and the subpoenas that he's
been sending out and so on?
<A - James Dimon>: I'm not going to talk about any one particular person, but there are 50 state attorney generals, and
so it's a complex issue, which I think is why it's taking so long to resolve some of this stuff. Like I said, I think it's in
everyone's interest to resolve it.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Yeah, and then just one last litigation question, the FHA was taking a look at some things that
accompanied Deutsche Bank had bought regarding the quality of the loans. Are you – might you be involved in that
investigation at some point?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't know the answer to that. I think we have been very careful in our FHA underwriting, but I
can't tell you what other actors are going to do. There have been so in flaws in mortgages that it's just – it's been an
unmitigated disaster. We just really need to clean it up for the sake of everybody. And everybody is going to sue
everybody else, and it's going to go on far long time.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Right. Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks very much. Just a question in terms of the branch growth trends,
now that Todd has taken over the responsibility for that part of the business. Is there any thought of changing your
growth estimation for the number of branches over the next couple of years since you laid out at the analyst day earlier
this year?
<A - James Dimon>: Not necessarily. There's no change in strategy because there's been a change in management. But
I would always – ask Todd. You can rethink it. If you think we should do something different, different places,
different types of branches, different locations, different pace, you should tell us, and we don't mind changing our
plans. But we don't change right now. Remember, a lot of that is building out where we are. It can make a lot of sense
even though it may not be a macro thing, but you still might want to build out cities where you don't have enough
branches.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: And then one question from a footnote in the slide deck in terms of your – the WaMu
private label exposure. You noted that you and the FDIC have differing views on how that needs to be approached. Is
that something for which you can focus in terms of litigation risk, or is that another type of risk that is not really
included in what you would view as litigation risk?
<A - James Dimon>: We think they're responsible for the private label issues that came out of WaMu. We brought the
assets and certain liabilities, and we don't think that was one of the liabilities we bought. I'm sure that will be in
litigation too.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And Doug, just one quick final question: What were the numbers for CVA DVA
this quarter in the trading business?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: The trading business is about 140 positive DVA.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski MBA>: I have to admit, I'm one of those nerds that looks at the Fed's H.8 data every
Friday afternoon and on the total loan volumes, and just systemically they look like they're turning around. You know,
for most of the last 18 months, they were shrinking, and now we've got them flattening out, and they look like they're
going to grow. And I'm just curious, just philosophically, if for example, systemic system wide loans grow 5% in the
year ahead just to pick a number, should we expect JPMorgan's loan volumes and then the attendant net interest
revenues also to grow kind of in proportion at 5%, or do you think that you have a larger runoff portfolios than average
and that that would keep you down – your trends below the industry?
<A - James Dimon>: I don't know. We break it out by business. So we expect the core bank will grow – the core bank
will grow probably with the trends, and we think middle market will grow faster than middle market trends; small
business was up, what, 28% or some huge number. We think that will grow faster than middle market trends. Credit
card we think will grow faster; though we have a little bit of runoff left, but will grow faster. And then obviously it
offsets mortgage. There's a huge mortgage runoff that is going to continue forever.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski MBA>: And then just as a follow up, the home equity lines according to the Fed H.8
data are going down about 5% a year, you said 10% to 15%. I mean, are you really making a strategic bet that this
product is dead in the rest of the world?
<A - James Dimon>: I think the home equity product unfortunately is a good product that just became part of the –
became part of the bubble at the end, okay? But the product itself is a good product, and how much did we originate
last quarter? We were originating $1 billion or $2 billion a quarter...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I don't know that.
<A - James Dimon>: ...so we're going to stay in that business. It's just going to be – that runoff, it will run off, but we
are originating what we originated last year. So originations are very different than total balances in this one.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski MBA>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - James Dimon>: They will never go back to where they were.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski MBA>: All right. That's it for me. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Tanona with UBS.
<Q - William F. Tanona>: Hi, good morning. Just two quick ones here. In terms of IB backlog, can you give us any
color and also did you see any dramatic changes as the quarter progressed given all the macro uncertainties out there?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So backlog is solid, but it's dependent on market conditions for execution on that
backlog.
<A - James Dimon>: During the quarter you had a lot of kind of ins and outs, slow weeks the past few weeks, but
that's – it's probably more of that than normal this quarter, but...

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And just remember, third quarter tends to be seasonally low.
<Q - William F. Tanona>: Yep, that's fair. And then secondly in RFS, obviously there's a lot going on there, and we
have seen expenses increase dramatically here in the last year. But when you think about the retail-banking segment
really expenses haven't necessarily grown. So just trying to get a sense as to where we should expect the retail financial
services expenses to kind of peak out here given that you guys are actually going to start embarking on a major roll-out
of new branches.
<A - James Dimon>: I think the way you should look at it is that the retail branch, it's not a major roll-out, folks, we've
been doing 120 branches forever. We're just talking about increasing it to 150, 175, maybe 200. So I think you'll see the
retail branch expenses grow over time, but not dramatically. Just grow over time. The one that you're going to see
dramatic changes in expenses eventually will be mortgage, because we're still bearing high costs related to the high
level of defaults, foreclosure expenses, OREO expenses, and things like that. And I read all the time that we make more
money on defaulted loans or foreclosed loans than we do servicing normal loans, and I find that mystifying. It costs us
a fortune to deal with these kind of things, so eventually those expenses will come down. And some of those run
through the mortgage MSR and some don't.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Holton with The Boston Company.
<Q - Michael W. Holton>: Hey, good morning. Doug, you talked about charge-offs and normalized credit costs across
a couple different segments, and just thinking for the back half of the year, overall corporate provision costs, would you
expect those to be kind of flattish, up a little bit, down a little bit? What's your best guess at this point?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Overall provision flattish.
<A - James Dimon>: For the whole company or just corporate?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No, for wholesale.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hey, I just had a follow up on the private label securities reserves. I think I heard you say,
and I may have misheard you, but I think I heard you say that you thought you were at this point fully reserved for what
you think the cost there could be over time. Should we assume that that's based on your belief that you're not
responsible for the WaMu stuff that was originated before and which you believe is the FDIC's responsibility?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. So if in fact the ruling turned out not in your favor on that, there would be some
additional reserve that would have to be built presumably?
