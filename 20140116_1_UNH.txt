I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group,
Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given that we provided a comprehensive review at our investor
conference just over a month ago, and that our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results are generally in line or ahead of
that discussion, we'll keep our formal comments brief this morning and spend more time on your questions and topics
of interest.
We see five takeaways from this morning's discussion. 2013 was a very strong year, as we meaningfully advanced the
enterprise's capabilities, our growth and growth potential, diversification profile and market momentum. There are
certainly near-term 2014 pressures, particularly from ACA implementation and Medicare funding actions that will
divert more than $1.50 per share in earnings from us in 2014. But we have plans and actions in place to offset these
reductions and to grow revenue to a range of $128 billion to $129 billion and produce earnings in the range of $5.40 to
$5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion.
In 2013, we deepened our capabilities and market relationships and successfully moved beyond significant
undertakings, such as the OptumRx insourcing, the implementation of the large long-term TRICARE contract, and
extensive ACA readiness and compliance efforts. We move into 2014 with operational readiness and performance
levels stronger than ever before.
As Medicare Advantage under funding is hurting seniors' benefits and causing disruptions to beneficiaries, our focus
will remain on advocating for fair and consistent government funding to this program that now serves some 30% of this
country's Medicare beneficiaries and on continuing to innovate, shape, and improve our Medicare Advantage products
and services to sustain these benefits and bring the best resources and service experience to American seniors. We will
continue to focus on delivering earnings per share growth in 2015, with our ultimate performance dependant, in part, of
the results of the Medicare Advantage rate setting processes for 2015.
And finally, while we will work intensively through the near-term pressures just discussed and covered
comprehensively at our investor conference, we believe even more firmly that, long-term, no organization has greater
ability to serve and enable a more effective modern health care system and to respond to a national imperative to
improve the performance of health care and reduce its costs, from consumer benefits and well being, to care delivery
and enabling technology. UnitedHealth Group's long-term growth and earnings potential in these undertakings has
never been more compelling than it is today.
To briefly review 2013, full year revenues grew nearly $12 billion, or 10.7%, to $122.5 billion, and net earnings grew
4% to $5.50 per share. Earnings were at the top end of the range we provided more than one year ago, despite the
subsequent imposition of sequestration, which cost approximately $250 million in operating earnings, or $0.15 per
share, in 2013. Cash flows from operations of $7 billion were more than 1.2 times net income. Fourth quarter cash
flows were $1.1 billion and we ended the year with more than $1 billion in non-regulated cash. We raised our dividend
by 30%, once again, in 2013. It is now at a $1.12 per share annual rate and we purchased nearly $3.2 billion of
UnitedHealth Group shares in 2013. Return on equity for the year approached 18%.
UnitedHealthcare continued its extraordinary growth in 2013. We came to serve 4.5 million more people this past year,
entirely through organic growth, including more than 900,000 people in public and senior markets benefit programs
and nearly 400,000 people internationally. Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has grown by a remarkable 14 million
people over just the past four years. Our benefit businesses are distinctively diversified, locally, regionally, and by
product and customer type. UnitedHealthcare earned $7.3 billion in 2013. UnitedHealthcare's operating costs were well
managed in 2013, as were medical costs, with commercial trends in the area of 5%, hospital usage per capita was lower
for the fifth consecutive year in 2013, and was lower across all our major benefit businesses.

UnitedHealthcare's results were negatively impacted by funding pressures on government sponsored benefits, three
calendar quarters of sequestration in Medicare, and reduced levels of overall reserve development. Despite these
pressures, UnitedHealthcare grew fourth quarter earnings 9% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. UnitedHealthcare ended
the year more aligned than ever with key care provider partners. We have $28 billion in annual medical spending and 8
million members served under fee-for-value contracts, including more than 2 million people under the most progressive
of these performance arrangements. We are intensely focused on expanding our integrated and accountable care
leadership throughout 2014 and we have set an aggressive target of having more than $65 billion in value-based
contracts with care providers by 2018.
Turning to Optum, our health services platform, our focus on growth, simplification, integration, and building larger
and deeper relationships produced record revenues and operating earnings in 2013. Revenues grew 26% to $37 billion.
Every reporting segment produced double digit percentage revenue growth. As just one example of Optum's
performance, our local care delivery business in OptumHealth increased both the number of payer partners and
increased the number of people it served by 6% and it expanded operating margins more than two percentage points in
2013. Medical cost performance and patient satisfaction levels were excellent, with the overall trend held flat and our
physician groups participating in health plan contracts with quality star ratings ranging from no less than 3.5 up to 4.5
stars.
During the fourth quarter, Optum QSSI was honored to be engaged by and serve CMS in their efforts to enroll millions
of Americans through the Federal and state exchanges. Great progress was made over the past 90 days and we are
pleased to be a part of that effort. And we will stay involved in a senior advisory capacity as this project moves to its
next phase of development.
For the year, Optum's operating earnings of $2.3 billion grew 61%, or $875 million over 2012, and are now up 84%
over our 2011 baseline year. Fourth quarter 2013 operating earnings increased 43%. Optum reached its 6% operating
margin target two years early in 2013 and now has established a new target called 8 by 16, which means an 8%
operating margin by 2016.
As we enter 2014 with our company in a very positive position, we will continue to closely study the developments of
the individual public exchanges in 2014 and we'll be selective in our approaches for 2015. However, we expect to
realize strong growth by serving in several ways: as established Medicaid programs grow through the ACA expansion;
as eligible Medicaid prospects are identified through the Federal and state exchange market; and as the inevitable Dual
Eligible MME initiatives begin to form and are implemented.
The recent Tennessee Medicaid award for 2015, in which we earned the highest score among seven qualifying bidders,
our 2015 renewal in Hawaii and the Michigan MME award all reflect our strong capabilities and established
relationships in the rapidly growing Medicaid market. We have won 30 new RFPs or contract renewals in the past four
years and we have grown organically by more than 1 million people served through our UnitedHealthcare Community
& State business over that period.
Continuing on 2014, our initial Medicare growth is within our estimate, with balanced new membership growth and
large employer wins during the year, offset by our exit from plans covering 150,000 people and the loss of over 90,000
seniors in one state account. Our Part D and Medicare Supplement offerings continued to grow well in the marketplace.
We continue to expect commercial group risk membership to be stable in 2014, with our commercial individual insured
membership declining over the course of the year and the number of consumers served in fee-based arrangements
declining due to the loss of that large state account, as well as some migration to private exchanges for both retirees and
active employees.
Our 2014 plan includes the collection of insurance fees and related taxes from state Medicaid customers. We have
strong oral commitments from our customers that these will be paid and we will record these revenues as written
contract amendments are finalized over the course of the year. The timing of these final commitments could affect
quarterly earnings progression. UnitedHealthcare's earnings in the first quarter will also see year-over-year variances
related to reserve development, capital gains and the effect of sequestration, which did not take effect until April 1,
2013.

Optum continues to build out its businesses around the themes of engaging consumers, aligning and optimizing care
delivery, modernizing the health system's infrastructure and using data and analytics to make the health system more
informed, aligned and effective. Optum expects strong top and bottom-line growth in 2014, with operating earnings in
the range of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion on $45 billion to $46 billion in revenue. This performance will put earnings
growth in the area of 25% and that growth rate includes, in both years, the earnings contribution from realigning our IT
and global services businesses into Optum in 2014.
This natural alignment will help us create and capture growth opportunities in business process outsourcing for health
care and in health care IT assignments similar to our efforts in service to CMS. Optum's earnings are expected to be
strong in the second half of 2014, due to growth investments early in the year, such as fully implementing Optum360,
as well as more traditional seasonal earnings patterns.
In the fourth quarter of this past year, both S&P and Moody's affirmed our corporate debt rating and upgraded their
outlooks. We ended the year with more than $1 billion in available cash and a ratio of debt-to-total capital below 35%.
We continue to project cash flows from operations in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in 2014 and expect to return
well more than $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend.
Standing back from the numbers, UnitedHealth Group is in a very strong position. We have posted consistent growth
for several years, as measured by people served, revenues, contract backlogs, cash flows, operating earnings, dollars
under value-based contracts, and so on. We have leading positions in our market, but our market share is much lower
than leaders typically have in more mature industries. We serve large and growing markets, so we have considerable
organic growth opportunities for the future: our scale benefit to consumers, clients and customers we serve, through
innovation, cost advantages, efficient service, and so on; and this naturally engenders further growth. That model is
expanding in care provider services and care delivery, with government agencies and national employers and with
consumers, and in Brazil, in Europe, and beyond. Very large and sophisticated customers are seeking an
enterprise-level partner, one with proven capabilities and the financial strength to help them navigate the changes that
both consumers and government regulations are driving throughout the market, a partner like UnitedHealth Group.
In closing, I would simply, once more, shorthand the key takeaways. 2013 was a very strong year in growth,
achievement and capabilities, and putting some big operational tasks behind us. 2014 will feel the impact of the ACA
taxes and Medicare funding pressures, but we believe we can produce revenue growth in earnings in a $5.40 to $5.60
per share range. We suggest the quarterly earnings progressions need to better accommodate the first quarter and first
half factors we discussed this morning. And finally, in the longer-term, we believe our prospects to grow and produce
positive change across the health system for the benefit of all the system participants and our shareholders remain
exceptional.
So thank you for your time this morning. We now would like to address your questions to discuss areas of interest to
you today. So can we ask the moderator to take over and we'll respond to questions, I guess, again, one per analyst,
please, out of respect for the others in line.
Q&A
Operator
The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. You touched on Medicare headwinds for 2015 in the prepared remarks and I wanted
to better understand if that headwind compared to 2014, so an incremental headwind in 2015?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I don't think we were really suggesting anything other than we had said at the investor
conference that, obviously, there were rate actions taken related to 2014 that we believe significantly under funded the
program. And we had indicated there that we continue to be watchful about the funding posture on the Medicare

Advantage program. And we will continue to be watchful of that and continue to advocate strongly for consistent,
reasoned funding of these programs and the continued commitment to American seniors who participate in them. I
think we didn't really mean anything more than that.
<Q - Sarah James>: As I think about items to watch, there was that update in December of the 200 basis point change
in fee-for-service cost trend assumptions, so that kind of got us to a starting point of down 6% to 7%. And I think about
some offsets to that. United's been very successful in medical cost savings through ACOs and risk sharing contracts
with providers. So could you quantify what kind of trend bender these efforts could create across the entire Medicare
book?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I don't think we can at, kind of, that distance. We think these programs are extremely
effective and they're effective in terms of their cumulative effect. And we are intensely engaged on them across
basically all of our benefit businesses, but certainly as they relate to the government programs. In terms of the
discussions that were held in December, we are not going to speculate, really, on what ultimate funding may come
forward or change our position on that. We are going to be intensely engaged as that process goes forward and, as I said
before, we're going to continue to advocate strongly for strong and responsible funding to these programs. And I think
we really can't speculate on a process that has really just not even really formally begun. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next with Christine Arnold with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Hey, there. Thanks for the question. Steve, you highlighted some seasonality issues, both
in Optum, investing in Optum360 and then some seasonality issues there, as well as some timing issues potentially with
the health insurance fee. Could you help us think about some of these timing issues within both Optum and
UnitedHealthcare and how they might impact progression of earnings relative to what we've seen historically? I know
you talked about first quarter, those three factors, but any help you could give us would be appreciated.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I think – well, I think the generally theme is to be, I'm going to hand these off
because they do really touch different parts of our business and I'll probably ask John Rex to speak to some of the front
end on Optum and then in terms of the Medicaid activities, Steve and Dan. But I think that we're, obviously, suggesting
that you re-look at the progressions in terms of, again, I'll say the first half versus the second half of the year, given the
timing of when these Medicaid contracts will actually fall in in formal terms and the patterns of the Optum business,
both in its new business and its traditional seasonality, but, John, you want to start out?
<A - John Rex>: Yeah, so when I think about Optum in 2014, so we'd expect a pattern, a first half, second half pattern
of roughly 40%/60% in terms of earnings progression for the year. Now think about 2013, we were up to 40%, 45% in
the first half, so the impact there, you're seeing some impact of the investments we're making in these larger, more
comprehensive relationships that we've talked about and that would be an impact that you see, particularly as you look
across the Insight and the OptumHealth business.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And things like Optum360.
<A - John Rex>: And Optum360, in particular, are the ones we've talked about most.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Right. And then, Steve, do you want to talk about Medicaid?
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Hi, Christine, it's Steve Nelson. We have, as you've heard me say before, we have a
year-round process where we engage states on rates. And we call this rate advocacy and especially from a competency
of our business, but the fees and the tax impact have been a part of that we consider part of our costs. As we sit here
today, the states have, I'd say, overwhelming majority of our states, have agreed to reimburse us for both the fee and the
tax impact. Actually, most states have technically said no to us. We continue to be engaged with them in a productive
and I think thoughtful discussion, so it's more work to do, but the progress is really significant and our outlook is
positive. In terms of how we recognize revenue, Dan, you want to comment on that?

<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure, Christine. On the revenue recognition side, as Steve mentioned, the overwhelming
majority, we've got commitments with respect to revenue recognition, will be written commitments. We have a very
good share in hand today, but still have some more to get. And we'll make progress over the course of the first quarter
and throughout the year and that will influence the timing of the revenue recognition.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: And can you elaborate on what portion, maybe you're not comfortable, but if you are,
what portion you have written commitments on that health insurance fees to get all of it recovered? And are they
throwing in efficiency adjustments below the line, like telling you that you're getting the health insurance fee, but then
saying you're going to get all this new membership, so maybe we don't need to pay you as much or are they recognizing
the pent-up demand? Thank you.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: You fit a couple in there. With respect to the insurance fee specifically, the majority of our
states are looking to do a lump sum true-up once the fee is actually known, so we'd expect to get it in the September
timeframe from a reimbursement standpoint. And in terms of how many we have in hand from a written commitment,
we have less than half, but more than a third, but we're making strong progress and we've got – we expect in the next
week and the coming weeks, to see more of that as well in the second quarter.
Your other question around pent-up demand, that was more, I think, aimed at the expansion population and the newest
members into those markets. We do have an expectation of higher use related to those new members. And we have in
the vast majority of our states, a separate rate sell that does account for and reflect a higher initial use pattern. We
expect that obviously to moderate over time as our clinical programs take hold.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Great, thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Medicare Advantage, sounded like said
you're seeing membership on track versus your expectations. I'm wondering if we can get a little more color here in
terms of what you're seeing in open enrollment, specifically maybe talking through some of the impact from changes to
your physician network. And on member attrition, because of this maybe are you seeing any selection issues happening
here in terms of particular members leaving more significantly than others, et cetera?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'll have Jack respond to this. And I'm sure he will hit this point, too, but we would remind
you that we start out the year 250,000 or so down, given the market exits we took and the single contract that we lost.
So, Jack, you want to pick up on that?
<A - Jack Larsen>: Sure. Good morning, Justin, Jack Larsen. Maybe before I tackle the multi-part question here on
the 2014, let me go back and remind you about 2013 and the very strong growth year we had there, almost 1 million
new members with something around 425,000 in Medicare Advantage alone. With respect to the 2014 AEP
performance, let me take the growth part first. I'd say we were on our plan in all of our major product lines, Med Supp,
Part D, and MA. I think for individual Medicare Advantage, we took a little bit of a different approach this year and
really aimed at preserving and, in fact, growing our share in markets that we would consider to be long-term financially
stable viable markets for us. And in these particular markets, we had really strong growth, and we had retention,
member retention, that was actually improved over what we had seen in prior years.
And I would say in some other markets, we made the decision that we were going to cede some share to others. And in
those markets, where we made some benefit decisions, we saw retention slightly less than historical levels, as well as
the rate of production on new business. And I think as Steve referred to, you hit it right on. We started with about
150,000 people affected by market withdrawals. Now, on the group side, we, I think, chatted at the investor conference
about the loss of the large state base contract of about 90,000 people effective January 1 and you're seeing those

numbers in the recently posted CMS results.
That will be offset effective February 1 through the win of a large state and that would be in roughly the 90,000
member range. So all in, I'd say we're right where we thought we would be this AEP and feel pretty good about our
plus or minus 50,000 member growth that we shared with you at the investor conference.
In terms of mix, it's just way too early. I don't think we're seeing anything that surprises us, but we're doing that
analysis now. We need to see a little more information on our inbound members from CMS and I think we'll have a
better point of view the nest time we speak in the quarter.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Jack, maybe just in terms of any comments on the impact to enrollment from these physicians,
from the physician network changes and maybe talk a little bit about what benefit that's going to give you in terms of
quality improvements and cost going into 2015, and then just lastly, on those markets that you did decide to take a step
back on, would it to be fair to say, should we think that the markets should be concerned that that the members are
being put back into the market or that you're exiting are significantly different in terms of morbidity or risk code versus
those in the existing book that maybe there could be selection issues in the market broader? Thanks.
<A - Jack Larsen>: So as I said earlier, we did see levels of attrition a little higher in those markets that we chose to
cede some share. And some of those markets are where we are taking our network optimization, networks restructuring
kind of work. And it's also, it's geography, but it's also products as well. So we differentiated between HMO products
and PPO products.
I think in terms of just what we are trying to accomplish in our network activities, you know, there's just a ton of
pressure all over the system. And Steve referred to it and we talked about it at the investor conference. And I think that
rate pricing pressure is probably most acute in Medicare. The system's fragmented, clearly has rising costs and I think
everyone agrees it's got the opportunity for demonstrably better outcomes.
I think what we're – the themes we see and really what the Affordable Care Act is telling us is law, and CMS is
suggesting us through regulations is that the industry has to change and we have to change. We have to be more
integrated. We need to be more aligned. We need to have a provider network that is aligned with us better, both in
terms of data and financially and we need to do all that with far less resources. And I think these are the themes that
we're responding to. This is what you are seeing us and others do in the marketplace with respect to reaching out and
making affirmative changes in our network.
So we're really evolving to meet the requirements of a Medicare program that's going to be successful in the future. So
while it's going be a little noisy and a little turbulent, we acknowledge that. I think we're conforming our business in the
right way to be successful in the Medicare program of the future.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Gail, do you want to comment?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure. Hi, Justin. It's Gail Boudreaux. In addition to what Jack just said about [ph] Medicare
(30:10), I think it's important to think about this activity across network is going on across all the benefit space. And
Jack referenced some of just the incredible pressure in the system around rising costs, connectivity, and, quite frankly,
getting better outcomes. But in addition to just the shaping of the network to meet the unique populations of Medicare,
we're also very focused, as you know, on increasing our pay-for-performance across Medicare. We talked about that a
little bit at our investor conference, moving that up dramatically over the next few years, greater clinical integration and
it's all to drive better outcomes.
And again, that was to respond to CMS' desire to have greater primary care-centric networks and better outcomes. But
that's happening across all of the benefits businesses and it's really important about, as we think about modernizing the
health care system. So what we're trying to do there I think is evident in Medicare, but it's also evident in our other
businesses and our support is to provide better data and allow these physicians to better and more effectively manage
these patients.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. And next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I think I might just switch gears and ask you about Optum and the
experience with QSSI. Obviously, in the last two months, you guys have gotten a lot of kudos for how that's worked
out. Can you comment on maybe your thoughts on the business implications of the way that's played out? Does that
open up other contracting opportunities with the Federal government, outside the Federal government and beyond?
Give us some flavor for that, if you would.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Obviously, I think that you're suggesting that it's had a very positive reputational
effect. But, Larry, if you're on the line, do you want to start this? And then maybe, Andy Slavitt, comment as well?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. A.J., I think you probably know this, but let me give you a little history here. When we
started the project prior to October 26, and I'll just use that date, we were a contractor that built the data services hub as
well as the registration process, something called EIDM and then we controlled all the testing. When we got brought it
in on October 26 to work on fixing the site, we got, obviously, to work with CMS and HHS. And they did a great job of
kind of outlining everything to us so that we kind of understood where we were at and that's why we became the
general contractor. And in becoming the general contractor, we were operating under what I would call an urgent
timeframe for about 60 days to get things accomplished. And then we were able to get through that, learn a lot and it's
now in what I'll call a more normalized environment. And we have just become, as I'm sure you've read, a senior
advisor and I'll have Andy talk about that in a second.
But what I would say is we obviously learned a lot in terms of working with the Federal government and being part of
the whole process. I would tell you that we are also working with a lot of these states and I think that when we were at
our investor conference, we talked about we were moving over on the UHG IT side, the – what we do with our
technology infrastructure and so forth. So we believe that's going to tie in nicely to what we did for the government, to
be able to offer [ph] candidly (33:53) around the industry, so it's going to expand what we do. So we appreciate what
we were able to accomplish and what we've learned, but we believe we're just kind of starting. Andy, you got anything
else?
<A - Andy Slavitt>: Yeah, I just had a couple of quick thoughts. And first of all, then this is – some of this is repetitive
of what Steve and Larry covered. And clearly this was a job done principally by CMS with the help of a lot of
contractors. We were glad to be and continue to be glad to be involved. I think in terms of implications, I'd just point to
three things. First is, we try to build our reputation on big complex problems that we can solve for clients in health care,
and hopefully, more clients will have had an opportunity to see Optum in action and that's a good thing. Second, Steve
mentioned in his opening remarks and Larry just hit on it, we can bring technology outsourcing to this industry in a
way that we think is unique to health care. And so we think there's opportunity, both in and out of government, for us to
do that. And the third, there are situations very much like this around the country in state-based exchanges, where some
level of business problem solving, prioritization and leadership will be called for, and we're happy when we're able to
jump into those situations as well.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: I'd just finish by reinforcing the fact that that – we were pleased to be part of that. That was a
broad team effort. There were more significant efforts and progress made in terms of the participation from CMS and
their leadership and their staff, and all of the partners of the outside suppliers around that, everybody pulled together in
an extraordinary way to do that, the only way that could have been accomplished. And so really the credit really should
be spread broadly.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay, great.

Operator
We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to Medicaid
quickly, understand the comments about the lump sum true-up in that most states, or all states, have essentially verbally
agreed that they'll give you the true-up for the fee. But from a GAAP earnings perspective, can you just help us
understand whether you can, on a GAAP basis, just assume you're going to get it in the first quarter and second quarter
if you haven't actually received anything in writing or, just generally, how the fee might impact EPS on a quarterly
basis? Thanks.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Chris, hi. It's Dan Schumacher again. With respect to recognition, obviously, the expense
associated with the tax will be incurred in each month across the year. On the revenue recognition, we will rely on
written communication. And where we have those, we'll be booking revenue in each of the respective quarters. And
where we don't, we'll be waiting until we do.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: So even though you mentioned lump sum, they may pay a lump sum but you'll recognize it,
appropriate matching once you get a contract.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Correct.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: But so in theory this could create a – if you don't have something inked at least early in the year,
it could create a bit of a headwind in the first and second quarters of 2014. Is that correct?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: That's why we mentioned it. That's exactly why we mentioned it.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin M. Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks. I want to go back to the commentary around 2015. I obviously appreciate
that it's a little bit early to be talking about it, but with all indications that the 2015 MA rate may be as bad, if not worse,
than the 2014 we've seen proposed, can you just give us a sense of what within your business might be doing better in
2015 than 2014? I mean, I struggle with the concept. I think you started off by saying you expect growth in 2015, but
the impact will really be determined by the final MA rate. So I just want to see, if the rate is as bad in 2015 as it is in
2014, what operational levers within MA or outside of MA can you see at this point that might help you show a growth
rate better than what you're showing in 2014?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, again, we're not going to speculate on where the funding activity will ultimately play
out. We have a very broad and diverse business. We are intensely focused on improving our performance, both across
the board and, as you can see, the performance that has been achieved in broadly in several areas across
UnitedHealthcare, the extensive growth in Medicaid, the very strong performance that we had in the commercial
business this past year and the opportunities internationally. And then the opportunities for Optum, I think, are
impressive. And they have established a track record of performance and we are intensely focused on our costs and the
continued improvement of our businesses.
So I would think that they would be all the traditional kinds of things that one would be pursuing and we are pursuing
them, I think, with significant intensity. I just think that in January, off the strength of a phone call conversation in
December with CMS, that we shouldn't necessarily take undue direction from that and that we will just see how this
process proceeds. And as I said before, I think that there is a broader sense of responsibility to American seniors than to

have under funded the program by our measures, about 6.7% last year, and if there is speculation that there would be
under funding at that level again in this year, that would be almost a 13% pullback on Medicare Advantage over the
course of two years, and we would think that that would be extraordinarily disruptive.
<Q - Kevin M. Fischbeck>: So then I guess...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: It remains to be seen.
<Q - Kevin M. Fischbeck>: I appreciate the commentary about the under funding, it does seem to be a significant cut
over a couple of years, and also it's very difficult to propose or to forecast was going come out of CMS at any point in
time, but when the rate hits, we have to interpret that the day it happens. And everything that you've outlined to me
sounds like things, to your point, that you've been working on for 2014. And you're seeing benefits from it in 2014. I
guess the question is, so that if we see something similar from MA in 2015, if you do the same things to offset it in
2015, there isn't a reason for acceleration outside of the MA business or is there, I guess is my question?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I think that we have probably more areas to accelerate and to grow and to build on
than perhaps anyone else in the space, and then we would take the steps necessary with respect to benefit adjustments,
market considerations, network actions, premium actions, cost and distribution costs, so there's a broad repertoire of
actions that we are taking, and the question really comes down to the intensity of those and that's where we get down to
disruption.

We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. It's obviously still early in the year, but the issues around the roll out
persist. And over time, obviously, you would think that things would start to work themselves out, but just given the
timeline of bids due just in the next few months, I guess what are your thoughts on playing in the exchange in 2015?
Should we expect a similar approach and maybe more limited activity or have you seen enough where we should start
to expect it to be sort of a more active participant? And then maybe just how much, if at all, is the 2015 MA outlook
just sort of influential on that decision or not, or is that sort of something that's kind of mutually exclusive? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. So, Gail and Jeff, do you want to start?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure. Well, first of all, in terms of the public exchanges, I think you know that we've got a
very modest footprint. And as I shared at investor day, our decisions around 2015 and our participation will really be
very much reliant on how this market matures. So at this stage, we're really not projecting our participation. We will be
looking at sort of how robust the enrollment is, what the risks in those markets are and the consumers participating and,
quite frankly, the cost structure is in those markets. So at this stage, I don't know that we have any additional guidance
to give you from what we shared at the investor conference. But that's our outlook.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Would you expect to have that, though, just in the next kind of few months? I mean, I'm sure
there will be some level of incremental.
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Again, it's a maturing marketplace. It's really early. It just rolled out. We'll be looking at a
market-by-market basis. So we're not going to give guidance around our participation at this stage, but we're going to
watch the markets mature and we'll get more information and we'll be sharing that with you as it becomes known to us.
In terms of your second question on Medicare and does that influence our exchange participation, I would say no, it
doesn't. We're going to look at – we look at each of our markets very specifically and look at the dynamics in those
markets. So we will take a very focused look at exchanges and, as you heard from Steve, we'll also look

We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Morning and congratulations to the entire enterprise on proving the wisdom in the decision
to separate benefits and services, create Optum and then bring it back in to learn from and help the rest of the
organization, especially with respect to fixing health care back up, which kind of proves the point of the whole
organization, tremendous effort. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Now to my question, though. I'm sensing some sensitivity among investors and, indeed,
some uneasiness on my end. Perhaps I don't understand exactly what kind of pricing decisions you made for 2014, with
respect to your estimates of cost trend and recoupment of the fees through higher premiums, where possible. There's a
sense out there that trend is kind of tight to premium right now and that perhaps if the fees are 100 to 200 basis points,
there's only 80 basis points or so of wiggle room. That was one statistic suggested to me. And so I'm wondering if you
could comment on that and give us some comfort or some indication of what's happening there. Especially with respect
to a trigger here, that the medical cost ratios seemed a tad high in the fourth quarter and I'm wondering if that's anything
that might be indicative of this pricing versus cost trend in 2013 and then in 2014 adding in the compensation as a fee.
Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So we'll have Jeff kind of speak to that pricing discussion and if we have not yet fully
answered your question, then we will clarify it on the end. So, Jeff, do want to start?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Sheryl. It's Jeff Alter. So I think the market test and their surveys are correct. Our
pricing in 2014 is stronger than it was in 2013. And you mentioned it. A part of the reason it's stronger is because of the
ACA fees, taxes as well as the essential health benefits across all markets. And then when you look at small group and
individual, the move to community rating, depending on which side of that marketplace you're looking at, you could
see some much stronger pricing.
Your suggestion around cost trends versus pricing, just a couple of things that think of. One, we have not changed the
discipline of pricing that has gotten us – has been successful for us for a very long time. We look at our forward cost,
which now include, as I mentioned, some impacts due to the ACA. But we're certainly as focused on medical trends as
we have ever been in the prediction of medical trends. The medical trend for pricing was about a point higher in 2014
than it was for 2013 and we matched our premium to that. Again, I know it's been a few years, but we'll go back to the
MLR. We managed this across hundreds of intersections, so that we try to stay as close to that rebate line as possible.
So depending on which market you're looking at or studying, we may have rebates that are still to be paid in that
marketplace. And we're continuing a long hail to adjust to that very tight band around that MLR. And in other markets,
we have the ability to price a little bit stronger. So that is all in that calculus that creates our forward pricing as we
move forward and now, more than ever, impacts for the ACA are also included in there.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Good discipline, well aligned with medical cost trends and really not particularly
significant changes in the marketplace, still competitive, but we think we're pricing well.

<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sheryl, this is Dan. From a fourth quarter standpoint, if we look at that, medical costs were
well controlled, and if we look at the implications on both loss ratio and trend, they were very much in keeping with
our expectation from investor day and set the stage for the right jumping off point into 2014.

Operator
We'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Oh, hi. Good morning, wanted to just ask on the commercial enrollment, and what you're
seeing from employers, as sort of two-part question. Number one, are you seeing anything significant in terms of
employee uptake of coverage now that there's this broad awareness of the individual mandate? Some employers
evidently are seeing that. In some cases, I gather, it's significant. And somewhat related to that, just curious on
comments on the commercial risk enrollment results for the fourth quarter, just those were stronger than we expected. I
just wonder if you can remind us if there was a special factor there.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Sure, Matt, it's Jeff Alter. I guess on your first question, it's sort of hard to tell. I think that would
probably most happen in our largest clients and it takes a little bit past January 1 to make sure all those enrollment files
are correct. And we usually feel better about commenting on sort of the national account growth or growth in existing
accounts by the time we get to February. It's a little too early to talk about that. We do see interest for some employers
to create a different benefit construct that could allow for growth, but we haven't seen those results come through yet in
our January 1 enrollment.
Talk about our fourth quarter 2013, I think there were a few things that were driving that. There was a fairly large push
in our individual business, due to sign-up as many enrollees as possible early so that we could give them that advantage
of an additional year without the ACA impact. And that program was an aggressive program and it was very
successful. And then we had, we had mentioned, probably throughout 2013, that there was interest in our small group
clients for alternative plan years for them to be able to keep their benefits for that additional year, even prior to the
President's announcement. So that did drive some, I'll call it, one-time growth in the fourth quarter of 2013.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Just so I can understand, because what I'm a little confused about is I would think that
those dynamics would make you feel more secure about retention at the small group and individual level, but not
necessarily explain growth if you're doing early renewals with your current account base. Was there an element to this
that also drove some growth?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yes. So in some markets, the value proposition that we put into the market was not matched by some
competitors, and so we were able to take some share. And then, you're right, it did help attrition. It also helped just sort
of retention of the groups that might have left anyway, so when you think of a small group attrition rate of somewhere
in that 15% to 20%, those groups that were renewing in that fourth quarter, there was a better retention rate.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Right. And sorry, just last thing on this, wouldn't this make you maybe feel a little bit
better about the guidance on individual, not that it necessarily moves the needle much, but given what you saw towards
year-end?
<A - Jeff Alter>: We're not – at this point, we're not changing our guidance for 2014. There's a lot to play out.

We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pete H. Costa>: Thanks. Can you talk about OptumRx for a minute in terms of the growth you expect in 2014
and 2015, probably from outside clients, but also I want to understand how the rule changes that came out on preferred
networks will impact you, whether there's integration expenses that you'll save that you won't have to do next year?
And then from the early marketing window, what are you seeing in terms of how it's starting to look for 2015 and then
the potential for your specialty trend to help you win business?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay, Dirk?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Okay, so let's start with growth. I think we had a nice momentum coming out of 2013. Our
value prop continues to resonate in the marketplace. If you look at 2014, sort of excluding our last wave of the
migration, we'll probably grow north of 1.5 million next year. Base on what we sold on January 1, we're pretty
confident in that number. As it relates to CMS, I'd like to comment more broadly, I think what we'd like to see from the
CMS proposal, any CMS proposal, is in the rule making, is the ability to continue to invent the efficient mail channel
and manage preferred networks in the system with historical practices. And we believe both those things are really
good for the beneficiary and good for the Medicare program.
Last thing was specialty trend, I would say a couple of things. I think we continue to have a good advantage with our
ability to manage not only the specialty benefit, but then the specialty spend within the medical benefit, but also in our
formularies. I think that's a good thing that we've historically done and our trend has reflected that over time. I think
that got all of your questions, did it not?
<Q - Pete H. Costa>: Just integration expenses and bringing in the costs from doing the big integration that you've
done this year of bringing that PBM in house. Is there some substantial savings that we should be expecting going
forward?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, we did recognize that savings, and as I talked about at investor day, there's – we're not
changing our guidance for next year. The avoidance of those expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 definitely provided us
with an earnings lift in 2014.
<Q - Pete H. Costa>: And nothing incremental for 2015?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: No. It's already in our numbers.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, I would say [ph] that, that's what it is (54:57). It's already in our numbers.
<Q - Pete H. Costa>: All right. Do you think the changes, the rule changes, if they happen as they are proposed, will
hurt your competitors more than they will hurt you in terms of preferred networks?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: I can't really speak to what I think about that right now. We'll hold off. We're sort of in the rule
making phase as we speak right now. We've got to let the full rule play out. We'll give our comments during the
comment period, as will our competitors. And we'll be able to speak more deeply about this as the year progresses and
we get a specific visibility into what the rules are.

We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up just on the commercial pricing and cost trends and would be
interested if you could maybe drill in just comparing small group and large group for your expectations for 2014. So
with the expected 100 bp increase in cost trend, how does that compare between small group and large group and then
maybe just an update on sort of the pricing environment in small group versus large group and whether you're seeing
any variance there?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Sure. So we're not going to get into that level of detail in a call like this. I would say just a comment
around small group pricing, this is a transitional year for many markets. We're moving out of medically underwritten
into community rating. So I think on a call like this, in a summary discussion, it's hard to discuss small group versus
large group when you have such a transition going on in small group, as we move to that community rating formula.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Yeah, and, Scott, this is Dan Schumacher. I would just add that, obviously, in small group,
there's a lot more variability than there is in large group, because small group's going through the transition to adjusted
community rating. And based on your health status previously, there is more variation in the price differentials at the
group level in the markets than there is at the large group, which is always the case.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I don't think there's any really new change in the marketplace.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: No.
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: No. This is Gail Boudreaux. I would just add to Jeff and Dan's comments, the tone of your
question, which is that the small group market has remained pretty consistent, with the exception of the change to
community rating. The market competitiveness is relatively the same, as we've commented the last few quarters.

<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Question just broadly about M&A, 2013 was very quiet by
United standards, the deployment of capital for acquisitions at $300 million or so. So I'm curious. Is there something in
the environment you think that the level of uncertainty around reform has created a bigger divide between buyers and
sellers or is there something else going on there? And maybe I know you guys don't talk specifically around a pipeline,
per se, for M&A, but of things you're looking at, would you consider it to be similar to what we've seen in 2013 or do
you think there's going to be more opportunity going forward?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Maybe we'll comment very broadly, but we generally don't like to comment on what our
view of the potential expansion marketplace is or what our interest might be or our – because we consider that to be
somewhat competitive and strategic. I would just offer broadly that often, the biggest impediment is valuation and
whether we feel comfortable with how the market is valued across a particular set of assets or asset classes. Do you
have any comment, Jack?
<A - Jack Larsen>: Josh, I think I'd just also remind you that we were coming off the, at least for us, we were coming
off the Amil acquisition, which was quite substantive in the fourth quarter of last year, and what shows up more as a
financing activity as opposed to an investing activity, is the tender that we did for the Amil public shares, which was
about $1.5 billion as well, so it was roughly about $1.8 billion or so allocated to M&A type activity. And then lastly,

just to reiterate our investor conference, we are clearly an M&A competent company. And our interest in M&A
continues. Our agenda is virtually the same, which is really around building key capabilities, geographic market
presence, with possibly a slight bias more toward Optum and the international markets, which we think are
fast-growing and expansive markets. But we also look to – for opportunities to leverage our scale broadly in our
business.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. So we'll take two more questions. So the next, please?
Operator
Next question will come from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andy Schenker>: Great. Thanks for the question. Just thinking about Medicaid, clearly, you don't break out
Medicaid MCR's, but at a high level, how should we think about the cost for the business, maybe excluding the
industry fee, reflecting the growth and mix that you'll be seeing, including long-term care duals, the expansion of
re-procurement? How big an impact can mix have on MCR and would any changes be temporary, once you get these
people into your care management programs or should there be a long-term shift upward in the MCRs for that product?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We don't comment. Maybe Steve can make a few comments on this, but, in general, we
really don't get into margin discussions at that level of depth. We have historically suggested that the range of margin
for those businesses in the 3% to 5%, 3% to 6% level, depending upon the performance of the business in a particular
year, and that mix ultimately, even if one offering were to be particularly strong, it tends to generally ultimately come
down into that general range of 3% to 5% for that kind of business. And we're really not changing our perspective on
that. And I think that that's well aligned with the marketplace. That said, Steve, do you have anything to offer?
<A - Steven Nelson>: I think those are good comments. I would just say, generally, the opportunities to grow in
Medicaid are robust, and they include a variety of populations, for example, more complex populations. The expansion
population has different utilization characteristics, at least the first has been mentioned and has been engaged with them
and our, both the complex populations and the expansion population engaged with them in our distinctive clinical
models and our [ph] right of (1:02:07) capabilities that we have, I think, a really strong track record. We'll be able to
bring a lot of value to our state partners and good outcomes to these populations. So it's part of our business. It's part of
the growth opportunity. And we're actually – really like our position and our opportunities in this space, and just to
expand on Steve's earlier comments in the beginning, a really stronger track record in competing successfully for this
business so, with that.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Yeah, it's a very localized business, local programs, so these margins run their range from
year-to-year across that, those geographies, and given our scale, we aspire to the higher ends of those margins, but we
will run the range of those margins cross our markets over time. So it is a business with a great deal of variation
market-to-market.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's a very good question. Next question, please, our last?
Operator
Our final question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dave H. Windley>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. On specialty drugs, I'm hoping to get a sense of
magnitude. Do the Hep C drugs have the potential to make a meaningful impact on the trend in specialty? And from a
rate advocacy standpoint, are you having discussions with the states? As I understand, a lot of this may hit in Medicaid.
Are you having discussions with the states about then potentially backstopping you in some way on the costs of a drug

like Solvaldi? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, Dirk, do you want to comment in general? And then I think that sounds to me more
like a Medicaid question than a drug question. But maybe you want to talk about specialties and...?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, well, just Hep C in general, I think – we know that new therapies have recently been
launched, that the competition is valuable for our strategy. I'd say, like any other drugs, we compare the efficacy versus
the cost of these drugs. And when we look at those, we'll decide where to place them from a tier perspective. We
would, of course, steer utilization from a tier strategy standpoint to those that produce the most effective and most
efficient outcomes. So we're really about turning that into the overall drug/medical spend as we sort of take our
approach to pharmacy management, and I think Hep C is similar. And as far as where they are in the trend, I'll turn it
back to Dirk.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Sure. So from – we do expect higher utilization of these drugs in 2014. We did see that in
2012, as well, when we had the new introductions that came in in the mid-2011. But that's obviously something that's
part of our forward outlook. It's contemplated in our pricing. In terms of the implications on our trend, we are talking
basis point, not points. And it's fully reflected in our forward outlook. With respect to Medicaid specifically, just as the
insurers' fee and other elements are components of cost, it is an element that goes into our build-up. It's an active part of
our dialogue to the extent that we're covering pharmacy benefits in a state, and it will be part of our rate advocacy
process that Steve Nelson talked about.
<Q - Dave H. Windley>: Very good. Thank you.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So thank you. I would say that that will conclude our comments today. We remain intensely focused on the challenges
and the opportunities of 2014 and 2015, and we thank you for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in
our enterprise. Thank you.
