MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded. At this time for introductions and opening comments, I would like to turn the call over
to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please go ahead.
Paula Waters
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard, and then Leo Denault, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate everyone with
questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions. As part of today's conference call,
Entergy Corporation makes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
J. Wayne Leonard
Okay, thanks, Paula. Good morning, everyone. At our analyst conference last April and since then we've discussed our
plans and strategies to positively resolve overhang issues that are negatively influencing your view of our future
prospects. At EEI in November, I made a number of personal predictions on how I saw the future playing out. One was

that we would find the right partner and financial structure to allow a divestiture of our transmission business in a way
that is in all stakeholders' best interests.
Another was that Vermont Yankee would not be shut down. While neither of those are closed issues as of today, we are
pleased with our progress. As for other viewpoints I expressed, I stand by those as well, and while we don't have
specific outcomes to report today, we have been equally active in making them a reality. Starting in Vermont,
consistent with our in-depth analysis, on January 19 the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont declared
unconstitutional the state of Vermont's attempts to force the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant to close on March 21 of this
year. The court ruled that Vermont Act 160 and a provision in Vermont Act 74 were preempted by the Federal Atomic
Energy Act because they were enacted with radiological safety concerns in mind. Act 160, passed by the Vermont
legislature in 2006, requires legislative approval for continued operations after March 21, 2012, before the Vermont
Public Service Board could decide whether to grant a Certificate of Public Good, or CPG, to Vermont Yankee.
The provision, struck down in Act 74, had required legislative approval for storage of spent nuclear field from
operations after March 21, 2012. The court found that -- quote -- there is overwhelming evidence in the legislative
record that Act 160 was grounded in radiological safety concerns and the concommitment [sic] desire to empower the
legislature to act on those concerns in deciding to question of Vermont Yankee's continued operations -- end quote.
Similarly, the court concluded that -- quote -- radiological safety concerns were the primary motivating force for
enacting Act 74, in particular the requirement for a permanent legislative approval for spent fuel storage after March
21, 2012 -- end quote. Furthermore, the court found that the issuance of the CPG for continued operation cannot be
conditioned on a below-wholesale market power purchase agreement with Vermont or Vermont utilities or Vermont
Yankee's selling power to the Vermont utilities at rates below those available to wholesale customers in other states.
Over the last few years there has been a nearly constant Entergy bashing in Vermont, among other things, our
company's integrity and our trustworthiness. We have chosen to not engage those attacks in the media. However, Judge
Murtha's meticulous 102-page order rejects the state's assertion that -- quote -- Entergy comes to the court with unclean
hands -- end of quote -- by stating, -- quote -- defendants have offered no evidence Entergy acted inequitably or in bad
faith, and the court holds this argument unpersuasive -- end quote.
The court's decision is good news – good news for our 600 employees at Vermont Yankee, the environment and the
community. It also supports the proposition that the rule of law applies to everyone. The American justice system is
blind in its application but sees the facts beyond the surface in getting to the truth.
Since the ruling was issued a little over a week ago, the number one question being asked is what are the next steps. We
do not know what Vermont's next step will be. If they plan to appeal Judge Murtha's decision to the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals, they are required to a file a notice with the court by February 21.
As for us, we are considering our options for recovering from the state of Vermont the costs and attorney fees incurred
in the case thus far. In addition, today we filed a motion with the Vermont Public Service Board asking the board to
take action in the existing CPG docket without further proceedings to grant a new CPG or amend the existing one to
permit operations at VY through March 21, 2032. As a reminder, in March 2008 we filed a request with the board to
issue the CPG for operations past March 2012. Hearings were held in the second quarter of 2009, followed by the filing
of proposals [ph] for decisions and initial briefs (6:17) for the parties in July 2009.
With the judge finding that no nuclear safety or power contract issues can be the basis for denial, we believe there is
nothing standing in the way of issuing the CPG. We believe the evidence is complete and supports the decision to allow
continued operation. The law does allow the plant to continue to operate past March 21 if a decision on a new CPG has
not been made.
There may be arguments that the issuance of the CPG is premature until the state decides whether to appeal the
decision and, if so, the appeals process is exhausted. But nonetheless, the record in the case is complete now.
In other license renewal news, the Pilgrim Nuclear Station came one step closer to obtaining the 20-year extension of
its operating license. On January 11, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, or ASLB, dismissed the last pending late

file of contention and formally terminated proceedings before them with the words "denied" and "terminated" in capital
letters.
Five appeals of ASLB decisions, including the most recent ones, have been filed with the commission. As we stated in
our August 23 motion, NRC regulations allows us to ask to issue Pilgrim's license renewal with a deal pending. That
motion remains pending with the NRC. However, issuance of Pilgrim's operating license might not occur until all of
the appeals are resolved. As we have stated repeatedly in the past, the NRC's timely renewal doctrine allows for
continued operations past June 8 if our application remains unresolved at that time. In the state of New York,
preparations have begun for hearings before the ASLB on Indian Point's license renewal application. There are
currently 14 consolidated issues admitted into proceeding that will be the subject of hearings which are expected to
begin the third quarter. On a parallel path, hearings continued from October 2011 through January of this year before
administrative law judges of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC, and were
completed for the designated first set of issues.
The issues covered in the first phase were the efficacy of our wedgewire screen proposal, would the DEC properly deny
the Water Quality Certification application based upon the impact at any of the leakage of radiological material into the
ground water beneath Indian Point and whether Indian Point impairs the best uses of the Hudson River. Remaining
issues include endangered species consideration, the management of [indiscernible] (9:08) water discharges and
whether cooling towers are the best technology available on this site.
The trial on the remaining issues is expected to resume later this year but an end date is not clear at this time. The start
of these hearings is certainly a milestone in both the NRC and state processes. But I would note that Pilgrim entered
this hearing stage on its NRC application in April 2008, nearly four years ago, and Pilgrim had two admitted
contentions in the NRC license renewal proceedings versus the 14 consolidated contentions before the ASLB for Indian
Point today. The decision on Indian Point's continued operation ultimately rests with the NRC. The water quality
proceedings before the New York DEC are focused primarily on the evaluation of operations with cooling towers
versus operations with our proposed wedgewire screen alternative or simply maintaining the status quo.
And nothing has changed my view that these proceedings, including any appeals, could take many years to complete.
While we do recognize certainty has value to all stakeholders during the potentially extended timeframe it takes for the
NRC to render a final decision, Indian Point can continue to operate under the NRC's timely renewal doctrine.
Actually, that is pretty certain itself. In other words, the weight of the policy contentions the NRC must wade through
does not lead to an expeditious shutdown but more likely that this process could extend deeply into the license
extension period we are asking for. It could be a horse race on which process takes longer to litigate, the federal or the
state.
In other EWC matters, Entergy closed on its acquisition of the 583-megawatt Rhode Island State Energy Center power
plant in late December. The RISEC plant is an efficient plant that diversifies EWC's position across the dispatch curve
and provides us with additional dispatch flexibility to extract value from market volatility, enhances our ability to
manage risk and value across our New England portfolio, something we've seen in recent weeks.
EWC will continue to focus on managing open portfolio commodity risk and actively seeking optimal hedging
products, volumes and timing going forward. At year end 2011, EWC had sold 88% of nuclear generation for this year
and 81% for next year at prices that are now $7 to $15 per megawatt hour above the current market. At the utility, on
December 5 we announced that the Board of Directors of Entergy and ITC Holdings approved an agreement by which
Entergy would divest and then merge its transmission business into a subsidiary of ITC's Reverse Morris Trust
structure. We will seek various approvals for the transaction, including from each of Entergy's retail and regulatory
jurisdictions. We believe the transaction provides tangible benefits to customers and all other stakeholders.
Moreover, this outcome is consistent with congressional intent and puts the policy in direction and also addresses
transmission issues raised by other entities that rely on the operating company's transmission system. Immediately
following the announcement, we began working jointly with ITC to obtain an understanding of our regulators'
perspective on the proposed transaction in advance of initiating any regulatory filings.

We fully intend those filings will address any issues of concern. We'll make the change in control filings once this
studying process is complete and target to close the transaction remains in 2013. One prerequisite to closing calls for
the Entergy system to have all the necessary approvals from the state and local regulatory jurisdictions to join a
regional transmission organization, and progress continues on that front.
The change of control filings to join the Midwest Independent System Operator, or MISO, made in all jurisdictions
except Texas. Texas operates under a requirement issuing order within 180 days of filing. And as a result, we want to
let other jurisdictions make further progress on our request to join MISO before Texas is required to issue a decision.
Procedural schedules in the MISO change of control proceeding for a Louisiana Public Service Commission and the
Arkansas Public Service Commission have hearings occurring in May and in early June followed by potential decisions
shortly thereafter. Decisions in the other jurisdictions are expected by the third quarter of 2012. It is our belief that
change of control filings to join MISO should be considered separately from the ITC transaction.
In other utility regulatory developments, Entergy Texas filed a rate case in late November requesting that two $112
million base rate increase and a 10.6% ROE. The rate case will also set baselines for transmission and distribution as
well as purchase power capacity costs that could be used in future rider recovery mechanisms. Transmission and
distribution riders have already been authorized. The Public Utility Commission of Texas opened the rulemaking
project last year to consider a purchase power capacity rider mechanism as well.
In the Entergy Texas rate case, the parties have agreed to a schedule that contemplates a final decision by July 30 with
ultimate rates relating back to June 30. In Louisiana, in mid-November the Louisiana Public Service Commission
approved one-year extensions of formula rate plans for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. As part
of the approval for the extensions, both Louisiana utilities will be required to file base rate cases by January of 2013.
Also, for Entergy Louisiana, the FRP extension included a provision related to the Waterford 3 steam generator
replacement project, initiating recovery without any regulatory lag through the May FRP filing, assuming an in-service
date at the beginning of 2013 subject to refund improvements review.
Any overearnings will be applied to produce the incremental revenue requirement. These rates are expected to stay in
place until completion of Entergy Louisiana's base rate case to be filed in January of 2013.
In Mississippi developments, two more independent firms hired by the Mississippi Public Service Commission have
completed their review of Entergy Mississippi's fuel and energy procurement practices and procedures.
Moreover, these latest audits continue to confirm that there have been no improper charges by the company to its
customers. The fuel audits are the sixth and seventh MPSC commission's independent audits since 2008; all have
reached the same conclusion.
Inquiries into Entergy Mississippi's fuel purchase practice began after rising gas prices led to a 28% increase in the
typical Entergy Mississippi city residential bill. Earlier this month, the Mississippi Public Service Commission voted
unanimously to certify the audits and file them with the state legislature.
In 2012, utility has the full agenda once again addressing regulatory and capital project initiatives. In addition to the
annual formula rate plan filings in Louisiana, Mississippi and New Orleans. Utility will complete the rate case in Texas
and prepare for rate case filings in Louisiana as well as potentially other retail jurisdictions as they plan for the
proposed integration into MISO.
Utility will also seek approval of the change of control filings to join MISO by third quarter while separately pursuing
approval for the spin-merge of the transmission business.
Further, utility will focus on cost-efficient integration planning to enable a seamless transition to MISO and for the
spin-merge of the transmission business.
In addition, Entergy Arkansas will continue to prepare for its exit of the Entergy System Agreement now less than two
years away.

At nuclear, two major capital projects will be completed in 2012. First in the spring, the approximate 178-megawatt
upgrade at Grand Gulf is scheduled to be completed during the refueling outage. Once the upgrade is installed, the
reactor at Grand Gulf will have the largest capacity of any single nuclear generating unit of its type [ph] in the (17:45)
nation. Then, the Waterford 3 stall refueling outages steam generator vessel head replacement project is scheduled to be
installed. In the utility fossil generation fleet, the process to obtain regulatory approval in Louisiana to issue the full
notice to proceed on construction of Ninemile Unit 6, a 550 megawatt combined cycle power plant, is nearing
completion.
New Orleans regulators are expected to get final approval for Entergy New Orleans' 20% participation at the Ninemile
6 project at the February 2 city council meeting. At EWC, goals for 2012 are consistent with prior years. Beyond our
over-arching objective of safe and secure operations of the nuclear fleet, we expect to close out Pilgrim's license
renewal proceeding and of course defending against any attempt to nullify or overturn any part of the federal court's
recent decision of January 19, 2012.
While resolution at Indian Point will not occur this year in the regulatory setting at least, EWC will continue to
establish a fact-based record of compliance with all laws and regulations in the NRC's license renewal proceeding and
in the water quality proceeding before the New York DEC. Should an opportunity for achieving certainty in Indian
Point arise that is fair to all stakeholders, you can be assured we will pursue that with a number of creative ideas and
have an open mind to the needs and ideas of others. EWC will also continue to apply its dynamic point of view in the
midst of uncertain and rapidly evolving commodity markets, weighing fundamental views of use of natural gas and
power prices against forward hedging opportunities exist in the market. Finally, we will communicate updates to our
long-term financial objectives at a future date. Among other factors, timing will depend upon when there is better
clarity around long-term commodity price paths as the transmission spin-merge transaction progresses.
2011 was once again a strong year, financially and operationally. At utility, we maintained reliability of the bulk
electric system through 2011 highest events, tornadoes and record flooding. And in the summer, we set a new record
for non-coincident peak hour loads for the system in three of our four jurisdictions. At the same time, we improved our
J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction scores, with two jurisdictions noted among the most improved
utilities.
EWC continues to set operational records. Longest continuous rounds were completed at Pilgrim at 642 days and at the
once seriously troubled Cooper Unit in Nebraska at 483 days. And Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim were evaluated once
again in the excellence categories compared to peers, a distinction held by a total of five plants in Entergy's nuclear
fleet.
Financially, operational earnings per share of $7.62 exceeded last year's record of $7.10, marking the 11th record in the
last 12 years. And operating cash flow remains strong at $3.1 billion. This did not equate to similar record performance
in the 2011 shareholder returns. Earnings have grown at a compound average annual rate of 10% in the last 13 years
since the end in 1998.
Although the 2011 earnings reporting season has just began, the 12-year annual average earnings growth rate for the
members of the Philadelphia Utility Index was about 4% at the end of 2010. So earnings have grown about 2.5 times
the industry average, even in a depressed commodity market.
During this 13-year period since the end of 1998, Entergy shareholder return has averaged 10.6% per year compared to
the 6.8% annual return for the Philadelphia Utility Index, or about 150% of the industry average, ranking in the top
quartile of the Index members. But Entergy's 2011 total shareholder return was 8.3%, significantly below the 19.3%
returned by the Philadelphia Utility Index, ranking us in the bottom quartile.
We take no comfort from what we've accomplished in the past or the difficulty resolving the overhanging issues
expeditiously without giving up substantial long-term value. Recent events, such as the ITC transaction announcement
and the district court's decision on Vermont Yankee, illustrate our commitment and our resolve to do well and do right
by our stakeholders. Specifically, we will not be satisfied with anything less than returning to the top quartile in total
shareholder return on both an annual and a cumulative basis.

Before closing, I want to take this opportunity to thank two key members of our leadership team whose retirements
were announced this morning: Bob Sloan, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and Gary Taylor, Group
President-Utility Operations. Both have achieved the end we're all aiming for – to retire having successfully achieved
their professional goals while still having the opportunity to fully enjoy the next phase of our lives.
In Bob's case, the recent successful outcome in our federal litigation regarding Vermont Yankee tops his distinguished
career with Entergy and General Electric before that. During his time with Entergy, Bob reshaped the legal department,
enhancing the quality and efficiency of legal services to meet the company's changing needs; developing more robust
practice areas than any key personnel, including the environmental, labor, nuclear and the federal regulatory area.
Assuming responsibility for the legal organization is Marcus Brown. Marcus is on the call with us today. Marcus has
been on point for high profile litigations, including leading the Entergy legal team in the Vermont Yankee case and
legal efforts in Entergy New Orleans' successful emergence from bankruptcy with a full compensation and
reorganization plan.
Gary's influence on the company's success reaches throughout the company in both the nuclear and the utility
operations. During his seven years in the nuclear operation organization, including the last four as CEO of Entergy
Nuclear, Gary elevated safety and operational excellence to best in class. He was instrumental in our acquisition of the
Palisades nuclear power plant and brought together the utility and non-utility into one organization for the first time.
He brought the same safety and operational excellence focus along with the commitment to our customers in delivering
shareholder return in the utility business over the last five years. Gary is fully committed through his retirement on May
31 with a seamless transition to a successor who will be named at a later date. So you will get every opportunity to
extend your well-wishes at the upcoming investor conferences to Gary, and I hope you do.
Now we'll turn the call over to Leo. Leo?
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Wayne, and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth-quarter and full-year 2011
financial results, our cash flow performance for the quarter and the full-year and a review of our 2012 earnings
guidance, including some comments on quarterly timing of results.
In reviewing 2011 results, a few things stand out. We achieved record operational earnings per share for the seventh
year in a row and 11 out of the last 12. Utility EPS grew more than 40%.
EWC's nuclear fleet achieved a 93% capacity factor, including two scheduled refueling outages, below the 30-day
targets.
We successfully closed on two planned acquisitions, the 580-megawatt Acadia plant for the utility and the
583-megawatt Rhode Island State Energy Center, which will expand EWC's product options in New England. Utility
announced an agreement to spin off and then emerge its transmission business into ITC and we will return nearly $800
million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Before I talk about the full year, I'll quickly review the financial results for the quarter. Slide two summarizes fourth
quarter 2011 as recorded in operational earnings results, which were lower in parent and other compared to a year ago,
while results were higher at utility and EWC.
On slide three, the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results are outlined in more detail. Parent and other
operational results declined in the fourth quarter, due primarily to higher income tax expense. Parent and other as
reported results for the quarter included a special item. The special was for expenses incurred in connection with the
proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy's transmission business, which we announced in December.
Now turning to the utility earnings in fourth quarter, 2011 were higher than last year. The major driver was again lower
income tax expense. After excluding the effect of prior year regulatory item that was offset in other income, net
revenue was not a significant driver for the quarter.

Retail sales declined 1.8%; however, on a weather-adjusted basis, increased by 0.6%. Weather was negative for the
quarter versus the positive weather we experienced in the fourth quarter last year. The weather-adjusted sales growth
was driven by higher industrial sales, which increased 2.5% quarter-over-quarter as the positive benefit to facility
expansions continue.
Sales and other retail segments declined compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. At EWC, operational results were
higher than fourth quarter last year. The increase was due to a lower effective income tax rate and a reduction in the
decommissioning liability which also reduced decommissioning expense. Partial offsets include the absence of a gain
on the sale of our interest in the Harrison County plant, which we sold on December 31, 2010, and lower net revenue.
EWC's net revenue declined largely as a result of lower energy and capacity pricing for its nuclear fleet. EWC's nuclear
generation was 95% hedged for the quarter and the average price for the sold portion of the portfolio was around $52
per megawatt hour. The average energy price for the – market energy price for the quarter was $35.
The effect of these lower prices was partially offset by higher nuclear volume. Billed sales for the nuclear fleet were up
7.5%, with fewer planned and unplanned outage days. The fleet capacity factor was 93% for the quarter compared to
86% in the prior year.
On slide four we've summarized EWC's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and full year. While we have occasionally
presented EWC's adjusted EBITDA in the past, we will now provide this view as part of our quarterly discussions on
EWC's results. For the quarter and full year, EWC's adjusted EBITDA was lower than the same periods a year ago. The
decrease is largely attributable to the absence of the gain on the sale of Harrison County plant and lower net revenue, as
I just discussed.
Slide five provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow in the current
quarter was just under $1 billion, about $240 million higher than the same quarter last year. This change was due to
lower pension funding and lower working capital requirements.
Moving to full-year results, slide six compares 2011 as reported in operational earnings to 2010. Higher operational
earnings at the utility were partially offset by lower results at EWC in parent and other.
On an operational basis, 2011 earnings per share ended the year at $7.62, up 7.3% over 2010. The main drivers for this
increase where an income tax settlement with the IRS recorded in the third quarter of the current year, which reduced
income tax expense $382 million, less $199 million regulatory charge to reflect a regulatory agreement to share a
portion of the tax benefits with customers; higher utility net revenue, after excluding the effect of the regulatory charge
just mentioned; accretion associated with Entergy share repurchase program; and a reduction in the decommissioning
liability at EWC, which reduced decommissioning expense.
Items providing a partial offset include lower net revenue at EWC and the absence of the gain on the sale that EWC
noted earlier.
Slide seven provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the full year. For the year 2011, operating cash flow was
$3.1 billion, down from a record $3.9 billion in 2010. The decrease is due primarily to the absence of the receipt of
roughly $700 million of proceeds associated with storm-related debt issuances for 2008 hurricanes in Louisiana and
lower EWC net revenue.
Slide eight details our 2012 operational earnings guidance, which we are affirming today at $5.40-$6.20 per share.
Previously issued as reported earnings guidance of $5.40 to $6.20 per share for 2012 does not reflect any potential
future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business. As
reported, earnings guidance will be updated to reflect this special item as actual costs are incurred throughout 2012.
The details of our earnings guidance shown on slide eight should be familiar to you, as most of the drivers have not
changed since we initiated guidance last November. In keeping with past practice, we have, however, adjusted a few
line items to reflect final 2011 results, including weather, the decommissioning liability adjustment noted at EWC and
income tax by segment. While we do not update all line items in our guidance table, we do provide details on

assumptions at the time guidance was issued and comparable information today.
While we are affirming our operational earnings guidance range, we already know of some challenges that I would like
to highlight. First, I'd like to touch on commodity prices. Since the end of the third quarter, we've seen natural gas and
power prices decline roughly 20% across the curve through 2016.
As you know, there has been some rebound in the last week or so. For EWC's plants in the Northeast market, 2012
market energy prices now average in the range of $35 per megawatt hour compared with an average unsold energy
price assumption of $46 reflected in guidance. Conversely, forward markets for New York capacity have shown signs
of initial recovery from their low point last summer.
Another headwind that we face for 2012 is pension expense. When we issued guidance, we assumed a pension discount
rate of 5.6%. The final pension discount rate is 5.1%. This lower rate, combined with other updated assumptions, will
result in higher pension expense. We estimate the earnings impact will be in the range of $0.24 per share below the
guidance midpoint assumption. Some offsets include lower interest costs, lower depreciation and the capacity prices
that I mentioned earlier. With that in mind, earnings estimates currently point to the bottom of the range. That said, it is
still early and with the focus on things we can control such as spending levels and operations, we will continue to work
towards offsetting these challenges and keep you updated on our progress.
One last point on 2012 as it relates to quarterly results. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, slide nine outlines
some key events to keep in mind when considering the quarters. 2011 earnings were heavily weighted in the third
quarter due to the IRS settlement and associated regulatory reserve.
2011 EPS includes $0.52 of weather, primarily in the second and third quarters. Utility net revenue can be affected by
seasonality as well as the timing of regulatory rate actions, such as the Entergy Texas rate action, which we are
assuming effective around mid-year. We're also assuming Hinds and Hot Spring acquisitions and the Grand Gulf
up-rate to be placed in service around mid-2012.
At EWC, the fourth quarter of 2011 included an adjustment to the decommissioning liability, which reduced
decommissioning expense $0.12. While there is ongoing impact of this adjustment, it is not significant.
Quarter-over-quarter, non-fuel O&M variances are affected by both the timing of spending and the occurrence or
absence of specific events.
Finally, tax items are lumpy by nature. Significant tax benefits in 2011 were realized in the second and third quarters.
In closing, I'd like to recap some accomplishments from this past year that position us well for the future. We
completed the RISEC acquisition, which adds a new flexible plant to the New England market.
EWC also added nuclear hedges last year, particularly for 2013 delivery, while the Entergy sold-forward position more
than doubled to 81%. This provides additional certainty on future revenue streams, not only increasing the volume
hedged but also prudently utilizing firm product structures to address a challenging commodity market and unique
portfolio positions such as pending license renewals.
Looking ahead to 2012, EWC will continue our focus in key areas of the merchant generation business, including
license renewal for our nuclear plants, our analytical and market-facing capabilities and positioning EWC to capture the
long-term potential upside from key rate expansion.
At the utility in 2011, we continued to build on the utility's progress to give the operating company the opportunity to
earn their allowed return on equity, and the growth story for the utility based on productive investments and flexible
regulatory mechanisms remains intact. As we plan our strategies and initiatives for the future, we continue to take the
steps necessary to remain financial flexibility as reflected in solid credit metrics and strong liquidity.
As an example, the ITC spin-merge transaction will increase flexibility of the utility's investment alternatives and
protect credit quality of Entergy and its operating companies. I can assure you the management team is focused every
day on accomplishing the goals that Wayne laid out for you earlier this morning towards the overarching financial goal

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Hi, good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: My first question is on some of the tax items. I – just reading the footnotes to the
variance table, you talk about the consolidated adjustments which net to zero and also the shift of the nuclear power
marketing, but within utility you also highlighted favorable income tax adjustments and then apparent unfavorable
income tax reserve adjustments. Any chance you could quantify those or give us a sense of whether they netted out and
what was the net impact of tax adjustments in the quarter?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the net impact wasn't that significant. You've got the consolidated tax savings -- those
adjustments are all net to zero just shifting between utility, EWC parent and other. And the impact of all the other
adjustments was pretty close to zero as well. So the overall effective tax rate, if you look at that, is 36%.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So the net is just noise within the segments that you're referencing that.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Correct.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And on a year-to-date basis, is there a similar number you could give us?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, on the year-to-date basis, the big issue that we have is the IRS tax settlement, which
effectively turns a temporary difference to a permanent difference, and that was the big third-quarter adjustment that we
have. Other than that, we make all of those consolidated tax adjustments in the fourth quarter, so those are all
embedded in the year as well. But the big item for taxes for the year was the IRS settlement. That's the $382 million
that I mentioned, but – in the third quarter – but then you also have the offset because of the regulatory sharing
agreement of $199 million in the same quarter, which impacted the utility segment's revenue.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Thanks, Leo. And then, if I may, on another topic, Wayne, I think you
mentioned the thought that the Vermont PSB would reopen the existing proceeding they have on the certificate of
public good. Is it possible that they could start a new proceeding altogether? What are your thoughts on sort of those
two different routes?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, we've had a lot of discussion among ourselves about what we think they may or may
not do. And if there's four of us in the discussion, there is four different opinions on what they may or may not do. So
the – I'm not going to speculate about that. We expect that they will follow the law. We expect that they will follow the
record at some point in time in this case. I expect that there will be pressure to let the appeal – if they appeal – exhaust
before they make that decision. But we're just going to have to wait and see first of all whether the state decides to
appeal.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Thank you. First, Bob and Gary, best of luck, just in case I don't get to see you. And on
the questions, the [ph] wheel (41:14) on the pension increase that you're projecting now for 2012, the additional $0.24,
is there a way to break that out between the effect to the utilities versus the effect to the other – the unregulated
businesses?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah, there is. It's about – in general, our pension liabilities are about 75% of the utility and
25% is the EWC portion of that. So in all of those things, when you're looking, whether it's a cash flow statement or
whatever, that's the general rule of thumb.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And did it – obviously that may mean that you under-earn a little more in 2012. So
does this potentially change any thoughts on timing of rate cases?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the way pension – net pension expense runs through the regulatory mechanisms such that
it's a cost of service. So what we'll see is anything that has a test year, for example, of 2012 will include the pension
expense that we recorded in 2012.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Right. So just get trued up in the formula rates potentially in that process?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Either the formula rates were in the 60% or so of the business where we have those or in rate
cases when they – whenever those are a test year.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then I guess my last question is just on the ITC transaction. I know you're still
in the, I think as you called it, the vetting process, but on the regulatory side, do you have – would it be fair to say to
expect filings in the second quarter on the transaction with the states or too hard to pin down still?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Steve, this is Wayne. I wouldn't want to discount that or commit to it. We have another
round coming up of visits with regulators and – actually starts next week – and have better insight into where we stand
at that point in time, so ask me that at our next conference.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: We'll have a better idea, okay?
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Ashar Khan>: My question has been answered. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Hi, thank you. Leo, I guess I thought I heard you earlier say that the nuclear decommissioning
impact on the fourth quarter would essentially not affect 2012. What was – what did you reflect in the fourth quarter
and why doesn't it have an impact on 2012 earnings?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: It's basically a reset of the liability based on a commitment we made to the state when we
acquired the plant that we would review the cost of decommissioning at this time. So it's a step – a commitment we
made to the state of Vermont that we would re-estimate what that liability is. And so we're actually just making a
change in the liability going forward based on change in assumptions, mostly around interest rates, escalation rates, et
cetera. And so that reset of the liability runs through the income statement in the period which you do it. Going
forward, because the liability is lower, there's an impact between now and the end of the plant's life, but it's not a big

number like this one; it's a much smaller number.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: So it's not really the kind of thing that you're going to notice one way or the other going
forward.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And going back to taxes, if I look at the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2010, it
looks to be in the 26% range versus the 37% range this quarter. What were the drivers behind the change in effective
tax rate quarter-over-quarter?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: We had some – trying not use the buzz word for it, but basically when we finished up the 2009
tax return in 2010 there's some adjustments made to what we actually filed versus what we would have estimated at
that time, in that those were made in the fourth quarter. That happens every year, it just happened to be a little bit more
significant last year at the utility.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. And last for me is can you update us at all on – I guess you had filed several years ago
for a large nuclear decommissioning loss, which gave rise to tax benefits. Can you just update us on where you stand in
that process, and has the IRS issued any type of ruling on the position that you took?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Are you talking about – when you say filed for a loss, you're talking about the tax deduction
we took?
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Right.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Okay. That's going to be a long time before that gets resolved, most likely. We had – if
you're talking about the deduction that we took actually I think on the 2009 return associated with the decommissioning
liability at the Northeast plant. By the time that comes up to audit cycle, by the time we get through review and
wherever that's going to go, it will be quite a while before we have resolution, unless something comes up to settle it
sooner.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And we should assume that you're not taking or that you haven't taken any of those NOLs as
a credit towards earnings, or is that not the case?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, to the extent that we've had resolution, for example, in the recent tax settlement, those
things – the recent IRS settlement is kind of an outgrowth of all of that. There was a combination of benefit from the
tax positions that we took plus we utilized about $2.5 billion of the NOL at that point in time. So those do get taken
care of as we run through resolution of those issues to the extent that there is a reserve against those.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi, good morning, guys. Just...
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Hi, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just looking at some of your long-term planning assumptions that you provided in the fall, I
guess my first question is of the $4 billion to $5 billion you thought you could return to shareholders in a lower
commodity price environment, how is that number being affected? Are you guys are still seeing yourselves within that
band and what kind of credit metrics should we watching to understand where you could fall out against that number?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: We would still see ourselves in that band. At the amount of repurchases we've done since
then plus the current dividend, we're already at the bottom end of that. Commodity price movements, the acquisition of
RISEC, things like that impact the distributable cash flows and how those will work.

And recall that from a buyback point of view, we really focus – the buybacks come from either the EWC business, the
commodity market-based business or unique events like asset sales or things like that. So we still see ourselves in that
range, but arguably with today's commodity prices that puts us down the range rather than up.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: What kind of metrics should we be looking at most specifically as far as coverage ratios and
that sort of thing to kind of calibrate where the balance sheet should be?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: In terms of which ones – I'm sorry, you were a little bit -
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Yeah, I guess [indiscernible] (49:35) interest, what kind of coverage metrics are you guys
focused on?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, we don't really disclose targets of where we're trying to go with those. Our metrics have
traditionally been very strong within our ratings category. Our debt to capital ratio usually hovers around that 55% debt
to cap on a gross basis. We focus mostly on maintaining a significant amount of liquidity to manage the business, both
the needs of the utility but also obviously within EWC. But typically we strive for and we accomplish cash flow
metrics that are reasonably strong within the ratings category we [ph] are too (50:21).
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: But we don't give out specific targets or anything like that.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess just one last question, I know there is a lot of work to get done on the ITC
transaction, but when you look at the 6% to 8% compound earnings growth, do you guys feel comfortable at those
numbers even if, just on the traditional distribution business is a traditional utility business ex-Transco, if you look out
between now and 2014?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the 6% to 8% objective included the transmission business. We haven't done anything, as
Wayne said, to reset what it would look like once we accomplish the spin and those have – obviously they went
through 2014 anyway. So we're going to have a – we don't really have an update on those. We'll look at those as we go
forward. Certainly the transmission business is a – has a lot of capital associated with it but so does generation. The
biggest CapEx to depreciation spread is in transmission, but the biggest numbers are in generation.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So wanted to first address Arkansas as we are looking towards the MISO and ITC
transaction and transition, respectively. Specifically, as far as contingencies go, I mean I know we're still a little bit
ways away from the end of 2013, but I just wanted to hear a little bit about could Arkansas go independent for a little
bit, just how much of a hard deadline is the end of 2013 vis-à-vis Arkansas and getting this all done?
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: This is Gary and I'll start with the end part. December 2013 is a firm and fixed date. They made
the system agreement in that date and we've got to be prepared for them to have an option. And to that point, we've
really been proceeding with really three options. One is basically the RTO with it going to MISO. And then the one that
will be probably most likely, if we were not to get there, is would also be the standalone option. That's obviously not
the one that's in the best interest of our customers and the one that would be more costly, but we've been proceeding
with all of those options kind of simultaneously. As soon as we can get an answer from the commission, hopefully here

in June, then we would basically terminate those others.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: At what point do you need to make a formal notification? Let's say end of this year it
doesn't look like you gotten – have a determination in hand or what have you, do you need to make a decision with
respect to investments to get yourself ready to transition into an independent system for whatever period of time?
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: We are actually making those investments consistently at the same time, right now. So the
reality is we're spending money for both options and the sooner we can get one we would actually terminate one. But
we are assuming that we would go through the end of this year holding both those options open until the commission
makes a decision. And we need to file with FERC in 2013 for our intention of where we plan to go.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right, great.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Did I cut you off there?
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: No, that was fine.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right. And then finally just to follow up on the EWC side in terms of the recent
scrutiny at the Palisades plant, just kind of commenting around how you guys see this – how do you guys intend to
change operationally your operation of that unit?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: I'll give it to John Herron, our Chief Nuclear Officer. John?
<A - John T. Herron>: Hi, Julien, this is John. Couple of things. First of all we're certainly disappointed with some of
the performance issues that we've had at Palisades. I can assure you that not only the leadership team at the site along
with our corporate leadership has put a lot of attention on this facility to make sure that we turn the tide here. We've
had multiple meetings with the NRC assuring them not only what the causes of some of these issues were but what
corrective actions we've taken and making sure that – that the entire organization at Palisades is engaged with making
sure that we don't continue to make some of these performance errors. But we've definitely had significant oversight in
making sure that the leadership team there is very focused on turning around this performance at that facility.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Just as a follow-up, is there a key review date that we should be looking forward to
there, sort of a key decision move-forward date for NRC in terms of kind of unflagging the unit or anything like that?
<A - John T. Herron>: We're still working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on two issues and we haven't got
their final review on that. Typically when you have something like this, you'll have a root cause, you'll have the
corrective actions and typically about a year when you're able to sit down with the regulatory body and then go through
making sure that the corrective actions that you've taken have resolved the issue and that you're assured yourself that
these types of issues won't continue. So it's early to say right now what the final date's going to be, but it typically runs
about a year from the time you get the final report from the regulatory body.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thanks for the clarity, John.

was just wondering is there any possibility that that could happen at other plants?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: It has happened. I mean, we've done some of these in the past, but there is no schedule for some
of those plants at the moment. This was something that we did as a result of our agreement with Vermont when we
acquired the plant, so typically there's – if there's some rationale for doing that, you'll go through that process. But right
now there really wouldn't be for the other plants.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So there's nothing really on the horizon that could happen in that area?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Not at the moment.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, and then just with respect to the ITC transmission, I'm sorry if I missed this but any sort
of follow-up with respect to discussions with utility regulators in terms of their – but I mean sort of the local state
regulatory folks, how they're looking at this and how they -their discussions, how they're responding?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well. Yeah, I had mentioned that we planned on at least two rounds with our regulators
before we make our filing to make sure we're addressing all of the issues that are on their mind. We've had the first
round. Rod and I are doing this personally. The second round starts next week.
But the main issues, as you are aware, we haven't really heard any immediate reaction from our regulators publicly.
They've reserved judgment until they see the filing. Obviously, they've heard over the last few years from a number of
parties that, in technical conferences that they believe independents – it's a paramount power system, particularly given
the magnitude of the merchant generators. They've heard that over and over and over again.
So I think the details of how we would plan on proceeding with this, what impact it may have on customer rates, what
impact it has on their own authority and ability to influence the construction plan, things of that nature. They're going
to want straight answers to those questions, and we think we've got good answers for those questions or we wouldn't
have done the deal. But we'll – I think like I told Steve, I think it was Steve Fleishman earlier, I'll reserve judgment on
that until – for this next round and see if after they've thought about it new issues arise. I don't expect new issues to
arise.
But again, the good news is they have not came out with a premature opinion of the transaction. They're waiting to see
exactly what we file, and that's what a regulator should do.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So it's pretty much sort of what your kind of – within the range of what you had expected
in terms of reaction, is that a good way to characterize it?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: I think it's – I think, yeah, I think it's in – like I said, it's in the range of what good
regulators should do. Oftentimes across the country you've seen regulators react before the filings and we haven't seen
that with our regulators and we appreciate that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

And we will take our last question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the – your comments relative to the earnings
guidance range, guys. So does the – you said you would expect to be at the lower end of guidance. Does that include
the assumption that you've completed the sort of amount of the buyback that's already been completed but exclude any
future buyback, or does it exclude that totally?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the guidance range that we provided, Greg, excluded any repurchases similar to the
guidance range that we gave last year. So within that same set of assumptions, which includes no buybacks, we would
point towards the bottom of the range.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. But you've already executed a small portion of it?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: We executed some buyback last year.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, and should we presume that given how soft the commodity environment is and that sort of
– obviously the impact that would have on cash flow, that you would be less anxious to complete the buyback in the
next 12 to 18 months, or is your decision on when to complete the shareholder value return program sort of
independent of what's going on in that space?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: The commodity prices are a factor as they relate to free cash flow, and so that's a factor that's
considered. I wouldn't want to imply that we are preprogrammed to take an action on that regardless of what's going on
there. So to the extent obviously cash flow is better, that gives us more flexibility; to the extent that it's a little bit
tighter because of where the commodity prices are, then that's going to give us pause because it impacts not only our
cash flow and our liquidity but certainly we've got to always keep an eye on credit metrics and all of that. So it's
certainly a major factor in the buyback, particularly given the fact that the buyback is really geared towards distribution
of the capital that comes out of the commodity-based businesses at EWC.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Very clear. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: All right.
