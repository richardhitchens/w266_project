MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Kristi and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Medtronic's First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to
prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions]
Thank you. It is now my pleasure to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead.
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Kristi. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief
Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2014 first quarter, which ended July 26, 2013.
After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be
considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statement.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports
filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investor portion of our
website at medtronic.com.
Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first
quarter of fiscal year 2013 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter
revenue of $4.1 billion, representing growth of 3% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.88.
While our results reflect that we are broadly outperforming the med-tech sector, they were at the low end of our annual
revenue outlook. However, we delivered in the bottom line, overcoming a number of challenges through strong
operating discipline.
Looking ahead, our assumptions for the full fiscal year remain intact, and we are confident in both our outlook for the
remainder of the year and our long-term competitive position in the changing healthcare environment.
We continue to strengthen and geographically diversify our business, in order to deliver consistent and dependable
growth. Overall, our Q1 results vary by business and geography, with strong performances in some areas offset by
challenges in other parts of our business.
While our international operations perform well, growing 9%; our U.S. business declined 1%. This was driven by
pressures in three distinct areas: CRDM implants; PainStim; and Diabetes. We expect full recovery in all three of these
businesses within the fiscal year, so let me briefly walk you through the key dynamics.
In CRDM, we continue to grow our global implantable revenues meaningfully faster than the overall market. But our
U.S. implantable results were affected by lower levels of bulk sales because of the phase and timing of our new
high-power products.
Gary will provide details later, but the net outcome was that the bulk sales were at the lowest level in six years,
affecting not only high-power but also our Pacing business. At the same time, overall pricing dynamics improved and
hospital inventory levels came down, which should improve our growth through the balance of the year.
We fully expect to have our new technology on contract in our major accounts during Q2 at a price that reflects the
proven clinical and economic benefits of our latest devices. This should result in a more typical level of bulk sales in
the next quarter.
Turning to Neuro, the business had a mixed quarter with strong performances in DBS and Gastro/Uro, both posting at
or near double-digit growth, offset by declines in U.S. PainStim. We received FDA approval for our game-changing
MRI system much earlier than expected and made the decision to transition manufacturing in Q1 and absorb supply
constraints in both previous and new product. This family of products is now launching in the U.S., and while it is still
early in the quarter, they are being well received by our customers, and the PainStim business has resumed its growth.
In U.S. Diabetes, we had another challenging quarter, declining 3%; but this was by no means unexpected. As we
mentioned last quarter, the business will remain under pressure, until we receive approval of the MiniMed 530G
system. We continue to work diligently with the FDA, so that we can make this important technology available this
fiscal year. Upon launch, we expect our U.S. Diabetes business to return to solid growth on the strength of our new
products and our ability to recognize revenue we have deferred over the past few quarters.
Now let me discuss the rest of our business, where there are number of positive highlights. In our Spine business, Core
Spine outperformed the relatively stable market, as our new products and enabling technologies continue to make a
difference.

Our U.S. Core Spine business, excluding balloon kyphoplasty grew 1% this quarter. In BMP, the declines appear to be
tapering, and we saw relative sequential stability again this quarter. The independent reviews of INFUSE,
commissioned by Yale University were completed in Q1, providing further evidence that for approved indications,
INFUSE is a safe and effective treatment option.
Later this fall, we are expecting final publication of our retrospective analysis of a large, national payer database
investigating the cancer incidence in the real-world usage of INFUSE. The manuscript of that study was recently
published online, ahead of print by the Journal Spine. The authors found that no evidence – the authors found no
evidence that administration of BMP at the time of lumbar fusion surgery was associated with cancer risk.
Looking ahead, if current trends continue, we expect our global FY 2014 BMP revenue to be down in the mid
single-digits, which would be a significant improvement from the 15% decline last fiscal year and would represent a 40
basis point to 50 basis point improvement to our overall company growth.
In U.S. Coronary, revenues and stent sales exceeded our expectations, solidly outperforming the market with 4%
growth, despite having annualized the launch of Resolute Integrity. Our international regions continued to deliver solid
results. And as I mentioned earlier, revenue is up 9%, driven principally by Japan and emerging markets. Our
international regions have now grown in the upper single-digits for 12 consecutive quarters, which is the type of
consistent and balanced performance that we are looking for.
Japan had another outstanding quarter, up 29%, driven by the continued success of our new products, including Advisa
MRI pacemaker, Resolute Integrity DES and Endurant II AAA Stent Graft.
In western Europe, while our growth was aided by advanced purchases of CoreValve in Germany, we did see another
quarter of relative stabilization across the region. Our European team is navigating through the various market
dynamics to unlock potential growth opportunities, using innovation as well as our breadth and scale to partner with
different stakeholders.
Emerging markets grew 15% with strong performances from Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe
regions, partially offset by pressure in Latin America and India. Latin America was softer than expected this quarter, as
we transition from some of our dealers to direct sales. Our India region declined as we faced challenges from
government-imposed pricing reductions for stents as well as temporary disruption from the termination of a coronary
distributor.
Looking ahead, we remain focused in high-teens growth in emerging markets in the near-term, while striving for 20%
or better over the long-term. We believe these markets will continue to provide an independent growth factor for us,
becoming an increasingly significant source of consistent and reliable revenue over time.
Let's now turn back to the U.S. region. As I discussed previously, we expect to fully recover from the specific
challenges we faced this quarter, but we also have an additional number of exciting growth drivers, which should
significantly improve our performance in the U.S. over the next seven quarters; it is worth spending a few moments to
briefly highlight them.
First, in addition to the recently launched Viva CRT-D, Evera ICD and Advisa MRI pacemaker products, the CRDM
business also plans to launch the Reveal link late this fiscal year. This is our next-generation implantable loop recorder,
which will expand our offerings across the patient continuum of care.
In Endovascular, we're expecting approval of a dissection indication for the Valiant Captivia thoracic platform along
with obtaining an SFA indication for the Complete SE Vascular Stent in peripheral.
In Spine, similar to our SOLERA platform in thoracolumbar, we are planning a complete refresh of our anterior
cervical plate family of products. Starting with expected approval of our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc, we will launch
a series of additional new products over the coming quarters. Cervical makes up nearly a quarter of our U.S. Core
Spine business, and these launches should enhance our competitive position.

In Surgical Technologies, we are developing the next iteration of our highly successful O-arm Imaging System, which
will expand a number of supported clinical applications and therefore increase further its economic value proposition
for hospitals.
I would also like to note that Cardiocom, the new service and solution acquisition that we announced last week, will
also immediately start contributing to our growth. I will discuss Cardiocom in more detail in a moment.
And finally, we're making excellent progress on three fundamentally new therapy areas that meaningfully impact our
outlook for FY 2015 and beyond; our CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve; our Symplicity renal denervation system
for treatment-resistant hypertension; and our Admiral drug-eluting balloon. These products are market-leaders in
Europe and we are planning to launch all three of them in the U.S. with CoreValve and Symplicity in FY 2015 and
Admiral in FY 2016.
Regarding CoreValve, we have filed with the FDA all the extreme risk modules for our U.S. pivotal trials and they are
preparing for launch in the first half of FY 2015. Extreme risk data will be included in late-breaking clinical trials at
TCT later this fall and the high-risk data is expected to be presented at the ACC next spring.
With respect to Symplicity, we have completed patient randomization in our U.S. HTN-3 pivotal trial and we expect
the results to be presented sometime in the first half of calendar year 2014, while targeting U.S. approval in FY 2015.
In addition, we expect the FDA and CMS parallel review program to reduce the time between FDA approval and full
reimbursement. For the Admiral DEB program, we completed enrollment in our initial SFA pivotal trial and have
submitted our first PMA module.
Turning now to the rest of the P&L, our organization delivered at the bottom line, despite multiple pressures. Revenue
came in a little lighter than expected. We had higher than expected share count, there were significant FX headwinds,
and our gross margins were negatively impacted by specific quality issues.
Gary will cover all of these items in more detail later; but on the final point, I want to emphasize that while diverting
resources to enhance our quality systems can be costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance
has and always will be a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic.
At the same time, we continue to make progress in a number of key operating initiatives, including product cost
reduction and working capital improvements. We are in the middle of a $1.2 billion product cost reduction initiative,
which helps us successfully offset pricing pressure and stabilize gross margins.
In our working capital improvement program, we have set a goal of increasing our inventory turns by 50% in FY 2017.
Not only does this instill good fiscal discipline, but it strengthens our already-robust levels of free cash flow generation.
Over the next five years, we expect to generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. We remain committed to returning
50% of this to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level, we believe is
appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow.
We are constrained by U.S. tax policy, which creates a negative incentive for us to repatriate cash to the U.S. The
remaining 50% gives us the flexibility to make the necessary investments for sustainable growth. We continue to be
very disciplined in how we deploy our capital with a strong focus in returns.
As we've said in the past, we expect any M&A transaction to surpass our mid-teen risk-adjusted hurdle rates and we do
not expect these investments to be dilutive to shareholder EPS growth expectations.
We've spoken in some detail regarding our ongoing strategic commitments to new therapies, but I want to conclude by
noting that we continue to take meaningful actions to realize our transformational opportunities of globalization and
economic value. We believe successful execution on both of these areas will position us to win in the changing
healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our long-term performance, while creating
potential upside to our baseline expectations.

Consistent with our focused strategy to generate economic value for multiple stakeholders, we are specifically
exploring two areas, where we can offer important solutions for healthcare systems around the world; disease
management and hospital efficiency.
First, in Disease Management, we announced the acquisition of Cardiocom, a leading developer and provider of
integrated solutions for chronic disease management. Cardiocom is an example of how we can pair our existing market
leading therapies, with a set of complementary services and technology solutions that treat broader patient populations
across the care continuum.
Our combined offerings has the potential to concurrently improve outcomes and lower costs by reducing
hospitalizations, improving remote clinical management and increasing patients engagement. These benefits are
particularly compelling to a wide set of stakeholders, including governments, payers and hospital systems, because they
provide enhanced clinical and economic value over the long-term.
Our initial focus with Cardiocom will be heart failure and hypertension, but we're building long-term plans to offer
complete solutions in our key chronic disease verticals of cardiovascular and diabetes, striving to not only improve
individual patients lives, but also ensuring that the overall healthcare ecosystem remains viable.
The second area where we expect to generate significant economic value for our customers is hospital efficiency. As
we continue to work closely with hospital administrators around the world, we understand that they are deeply
concerned with driving efficiency and optimizing the overall cost of operations.
We are working together to develop innovative solutions for these problems, including implementing process
improvements, adopting new financing models, deploying new purchasing and inventory management strategies and
outsourcing certain functions. In the coming weeks, you will hear more about our hospital efficiency efforts and I look
forward to discussing them in more details as they are announced.
In closing, I would like to add that the challenges facing healthcare are not easily solved, but we believe we are
uniquely positioned to increase our competitive advantage in the changing healthcare landscape by offering solutions
that improve the financial viability of global healthcare systems. Our market leading products, in-hospital footprint,
healthcare economics expertise, Lean Sigma resources and strong financial position give us unprecedented breadth,
global reach and scale and allow us to offer broad valuable solutions.
We are determined to transform Medtronic from being a primarily device provider today into the premier global
medical technology solutions partner of tomorrow.
Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results, before we take any questions.
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. First quarter revenue of $4.083 billion increased 2% as reported and 3% on a constant currency basis,
after adjusting for a $55 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Q1 revenue results by region were as follows: growth in Middle East and Africa was 24%; Central and Eastern Europe
grew 21%; growth in Asia-Pacific was 20%, driven by 29% growth in Japan; growth in greater China was 15%; Latin
America grew 12%; and Western Europe and Canada grew 2%; while the U.S. declined 1%; and India declined 7%.
The emerging markets grew a combined 15% in Q1 and represented 12% of our total sales mix. Q1 diluted earnings per
share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.88, an increase of 4%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.93, an
increase of 12%. This quarter's non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments included an $18 million restructuring charge, the final
charge related to the initiative we announced last quarter, a $40 million cash charitable donation to the Medtronic
Foundation and a $96 million gain primarily related to the change in fair value of our Ardian contingent consideration
payments, which are based on annual revenue growth through FY 2015.

Given the current slower commercial ramp in Europe and extended U.S. regulatory process, we now expect our
contingent consideration payments to be reduced, as additional value of the Ardian business has now shifted beyond the
final revenue milestone date.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.160 billion grew 4%; the results were driven by solid growth in
Structural Heart, Pacing, Endovascular, AF Solutions and Coronary, partially offset by a modest decline in U.S. ICDs.
CRDM revenue of $1.193 billion grew 2%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $655 million declined 2%, roughly in line with
the market. In the U.S., our ICD revenue declined 4% below the market, which we estimate declined 2%.
As Omar mentioned, due to the phase and timing of our new products, there were many instances where we were not
able to get our new products and their associated pricing premiums on new hospital contracts before the end of the
quarter. And we were generally unwilling to offer bulk discounts for our latest technology off the previously contracted
price.
Concurrently, some hospitals chose not to make stocking purchases ahead of our new products being available on their
new contracts, which led to meaningfully lower levels of bulk sales in the quarter.
At the same time, our U.S. ICD implant dynamics changed markedly during the quarter, following the mid-quarter
release of Viva and Evera with a daily implant growth rate shifting from negative to positive in the back half of the
quarter. Our lead deferred ratios remain at elevated levels and our U.S. ICD pricing continued to show signs of relative
stability, declining 2% year-over-year as both our Viva CRT-D and Evera ICDs received price uplifts in the market.
As Omar mentioned, bulk sales were significantly lower in Q1 and were responsible for our entire revenue decline, as
daily implant revenue actually grew 1%. We believe our top technology tiers and high-power are now significantly
differentiated in the marketplace, which allows us to minimize pricing pressure and stay very disciplined on new
product pricing.
We are seeing good market adoption of Viva and Evera. Viva has our proprietary Adaptive CRT algorithm, which
significantly reduces RV pacing and has been clinically proven to improve response rates of CRT therapy, resulting in
improved device longevity and a reduction of heart failure hospitalizations.
In addition, our Attain Performa Quadripolar Lead along with our VectorExpress implant optimization algorithm is
driving differentiated CRT-D market share capture in Europe and will be available in all major markets outside of the
U.S. by the end of the fiscal year.
Finally, both the Viva CRT-D and Evera ICD contain enhanced shock reduction algorithms, battery and circuit design
improvements to extend device longevity, and the unique PhysioCurve design, which meaningfully reduces device size
and enhances patient comfort.
Pacing revenue of $474 million, grew 6%, outperforming the global market by 450 basis points. Our international
Pacing business grew 14%, driven by the strong customer demand for Advisa MRI pacemaker in Japan. AF grew in the
mid-teens, driven by over 20% growth of Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon System; as customers continue to adopt
the second generation system due to its more efficient, safe and effective treatment for paroxysmal AF.
Coronary revenue of $435 million grew 3%. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $273 million, including $105
million in the U.S. and $25 million in Japan. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, positive data regarding early dual
anti-platelet therapy interruption, unique FDA labeling for diabetes and long-term clinical performance is receiving
strong customer acceptance globally despite competitive product launches of next-generation products. Resolute
Integrity is also the one product line that is featured in virtually every one of the CVG multi-line product contracts we
execute.
In renal denervation, while Q1 revenue continued to be modest, we are investing and developing referral networks,
reimbursement, technology development and clinical and economic evidence to further strengthen our leadership
position for this large, long-term opportunity in hypertension. We are now anticipating CE Mark for our
next-generation Symplicity Spyral multi-electrode catheter before the end of the fiscal year.

On the clinical front, we received IDE approval from the FDA earlier this month for Symplicity HTN-4, which is
focused on expanding the indication to include uncontrolled hypertension patients with systolic pressure between 140
millimeters of mercury and 160 millimeters of mercury.
In Structural Heart, revenue of $313 million increased 13%, driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valve
franchise, including a meaningful acceleration of advanced customer purchases of CoreValve in Germany. Excluding
this impact, we estimate international transcatheter valve market grew in the upper single-digits.
In Germany, the Spenser patent injunction ruling has been a significant disappointment to customers who are
concerned about having access to our market-leading transfemoral technology and the increased difficulty they will
experience in assessing – accessing our unique valve size, catheter size and indications for use options.
We respectfully disagree with and have appealed the court's decision. We ultimately believe that the Spenser patent
should be found to be invalid and we, along with many others, are challenging its validity at the European Patent
Office.
In Q1, we became the first company with CE Mark approval for valve-and-valve procedures using CoreValve and
CoreValve Evolut. We also continued the launch of our Engager valve in Europe, our entry into the transapical
segment, which represents approximately 20% of the European TAVI market.
In addition, the first implant of Engager direct aortic occurred in July and we expect CE market approval for this
product in FY 2015.
In Endovascular, revenue of $219 million grew 7% with solid growth in both our aortic and peripheral businesses. In
aortic, strong growth continued in Japan with the launch of our Endurant II AAA Stent Graft System. Our thoracic
products grew over 20% on the strength of the Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and international markets. In peripheral, our
market-leading drug-eluting balloons posted strong double-digit growth.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue of $1.554 billion grew 3%, results were driven by growth in
Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and Core Spine, partially offset by declines in BMP; it is worth noting that
starting this quarter diabetes will be reported as a separate group and is no longer part of the Restorative Therapies
Group.
Spine revenue of $765 million declined 1%. Core Spine revenue of $641 million grew 1%. Excluding BKP, our Core
Spine business grew 3% globally and 1% in the U.S., outperforming the market. The U.S. Core Spine market continues
to show signs of stability with a low single-digit price mix decline and flat procedure volumes.
Our new procedures and technologies, including our SOLERA posterior fixation system, BRYAN artificial cervical
disc, premium DBMs and AMT interbody devices are driving growth in our Core Spine business.
We are also differentiating our Spine business from the competition through enabling technologies that we leverage
from our Surgical Technologies business, including O-arm Imaging, StealthStation navigation, and POWEREASE
Powered Surgical Instruments.
Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for Spine surgery, as they see clear value from improved surgical
precision and more efficient procedures.
We are still early in realizing this large differentiated opportunity in Spine, which is resulting in increased revenue and
share for our spinal implants, as well as solid growth of our – of capital equipment in our Surgical Technologies
business. Our Kanghui Orthopedic business in China continues to perform well, with its revenue growing in excess of
20% and offsetting a loss revenue from our former Weigao joint venture.
Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $361 million grew 13% with double-digit growth in all three businesses:
ENT; Neurosurgery; and Advanced Energy.

The strong performance in ENT is attributable to solid growth in image-guided surgery and monitoring as well as the
successful launches of TriVantage EMG Tube and the Indigo High-Speed Otologic Drill.
Neurosurgery, which grew 12%, was driven by capital upgrades of the StealthStation S7 Surgical Navigation System.
Advanced Energy had another outstanding quarter, as its strategies to focus on its core four markets of orthopedics,
spine, breast and CRDM replacements resulted in growth of over 20%.
Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue of $428 million increased 3% on solid global growth in DBS and Gastro/Uro.
DBS delivered another strong quarter driven by double-digit new implant growth in the U.S. In addition, data from our
EARLYSTIM trial, which was published earlier this year in The New England Journal of Medicine, is generating
significant interest in international markets.
In Gastro/Uro, we had strong mid-teens growth of InterStim Therapy in Western Europe. In PainStim, results came in
below our expectations this quarter, as customers awaited the launch of the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord
stimulation system in the U.S. This product launched earlier this month and we expect this innovative technology to
drive growth and share gains in the coming quarters.
Now turning to our Diabetes Group; revenue of $369 million grew 1% and international markets growth was 8% as we
continue to see strong adoption of the Veo pump with low-glucose suspend and Enlite CGM sensor. In the U.S.,
revenue declined 3% as customers continue to anticipate FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G, the U.S. version of this
pump and sensor.
We have now deferred $33 million of revenue, including $11 million in Q1, as some customers plan to upgrade to the
new technology when it's available. We have diverted significant people and resources to do everything possible to
address the FDA's quality system findings quickly and effectively. This diversion is negatively affecting the timing of
our upcoming product launches and we now expect our next-generation pump platform, the MiniMed 640G to launch
in international markets in the second half of this fiscal year.
Turning to the rest of the income statement; the Q1 gross margin was 75%. After adjusting for a 30 basis point negative
impact from foreign exchange, the Q1 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational basis was 75.3%.
It is also worth noting that the gross margin includes significant spending related to resources diverted to address
quality issues in Neuromodulation and Diabetes, which negatively affected the gross margin by 40 basis points.
Looking ahead, we would expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of 75% to 75.5% on an
operational basis.
Third quarter R&D spending of $360 million was 8.8% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies and
evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in fiscal year 2014 to be around 9% due to
the trade-offs we are making to partially offset the device tax as well as shifting R&D resources to resolve pending
quality issues, which gets recognized in cost of goods sold.
First quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.416 billion represent 34.7% of sales. After adjusting for the 20 basis point
negative impact from foreign exchange, Q1 SG&A was 34.5%. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage
our expenses. In FY 2014, we would expect to drive 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement, which would
result in SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis. And it is worth mentioning that we typically see
most of our leverage in the fourth quarter.
Amortization expense for the quarter was $86 million. For FY 2014, we would expect amortization expense to be
approximately $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $44 million. Net gains
from our hedging program were $18 million.
As you know we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our
earnings from foreign exchange. However, recent movements in unhedged currency exposures is creating increased
headwinds for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Based on the current exchange rates, we expect FY 2014 net other expense to be in the range of $100 million (sic)
[$180 million] to $220 million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. Medical Device Tax.
For Q2, FY 2014, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million based on current
exchange rates.
Net interest expense for the quarter is $40 million. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $11.3 billion in cash and
cash investments and $11.2 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect FY 2014 net interest expense to be
in the range of $150 million to $160 million.
In Q1, we generated $891 million in free cash flow. As Omar emphasized, we are committed to returning 50% of our
free cash flow to shareholders. In Q1, we paid over $280 million in dividends. And in June, our board approved an 8%
increase on our quarterly dividend, which puts our payout ratio at approximately 30% and is the 36th consecutive year,
we have increased the dividend. We also repurchased over $1.3 billion of our common stock.
As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. First quarter
average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.021 billion shares. Our fully diluted share count is highly than
expected, primarily due to the recent movement in Medtronic's share price. Consequently, we have seen an increase in
stock options being exercised, which has resulted in more shares being issued.
However, it's important to note that the cash we receive from these stock option redemptions, which was $560 million
(sic) [$570 million] in Q1, was used to repurchase shares on the open market to offset some of the diluted impact.
These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.
Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17.3%. Excluding the impact of unusual
items, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%. Included in our tax rate for the quarter is $3
million net benefit associated with the finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves
for the quarter. For fiscal year 2014, we continue to expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%.
Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2014 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Based on the
stabilization trends in our businesses as well as our first quarter performance, we continue to that believe full year
constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for fiscal year 2014. While we cannot predict the
impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact, if the exchange rates were to remain similar to
yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY 2014 revenue would be negatively affected by
approximately $190 million to $230 million, including a negative $40 million to $60 million impact in Q2.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect FY 2014 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the
range of $3.80 to $3.85, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% on an operational basis, after
adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY 2013 as well as the headwinds from the Medical Device Tax
and the incremental interest expense in FY 2014.
It is also worth noting that while we do not provide quarterly guidance, when looking at the quarterly earnings per
share consensus and a continued uncertainty on the timing of Diabetes MiniMed 530G approval as well as the FX
headwinds, we would not be surprised to see some models shift $0.02 to $0.03 from Q2 to Q4. As in the past, my
comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year.
I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by reiterating that in the end, Q1 was a solid
quarter; despite a number of challenges. While 3% top line growth is consistent with the outlook we provided at the
beginning of the year, it was softer than we expected and fell just below our mid single-digit baseline goals. However, I
also want to emphasize that our team executed well to deliver on the bottom line; and looking ahead, we remain
confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year.

We continue to focus on strengthening and geographically diversifying our business, so that we can deliver consistent
and dependable growth. Although, there will always be pressures in the dynamic environment, we intend to execute in
areas that we can control, including growing our markets and building our business, so that it is resilient enough to
offset the variables that are beyond our control.
And over time, we are striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations which are: consistent with single-digit
revenue growth; consistent EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue; and returning 50% of
our free cash flow to shareholders.
At the same time, we are positioning Medtronic to play a leading role in global healthcare by executing in our
transformational opportunities of new therapy development, economic value and globalization. We believe that crisp
execution on both our baseline and long-term growth strategies combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation
will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare.
With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President
of the Cardiac and Vascular Group; and Chris O'Connell President of our Restorative Therapies Group to join us again
for the Q&A session.
We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so we respectfully request that you limit yourself to only one question
and if necessary one follow-up, so that we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions

Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Morning. I wanted to focus first on pricing. Omar and Gary, you both highlighted CRM
sounded a little better in the U.S., down 2%. Can you comment on what Pacing was in the U.S.? Maybe what stents
were? And then broadly how Europe is behaving? I'm trying to see if some other comments from your competitors
about pricing looking a little better, if you agree with that view broadly?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll let Gary address this.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. I mean, Matt, overall, as you indicated, we saw a little bit of a – obviously, in ICDs we
saw a tempering of the kind of the decline down a couple percent. Pacing was also kind of down in that low
single-digits, and so we saw improvement there. Stents, I think have been – it varies kind of around where all those –
they have been probably closer and more in the high single-digits as far as some of the declines there depending on
what geography you're in.
So, we continue to see pricing declines in – on the drug-eluting stent side that are pretty consistent with what we've
seen over the last several quarters. But clearly, with the new product launches we had both in Pacing and on
high-power, we're seeing a little bit of tempering on the pricing pressure.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: And then just one quick ICD question, when you look at the bulking, Q4 didn't factor into Q1.
Is the comments from the call, you got a hit in Q1, but you expect to improve in Q2? Or do you think Q4 there was
some additional bulking on that quarter that impacted Q1?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think largely you're correct. I think it was mostly Q1. Isolated to Q1 itself and the dynamics
in between Q1 and Q2 as opposed to Q4.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. Matt, I mean, as we look through – I mean, we clearly saw a dip at the end of the quarter,
we know inventory levels dropped based on what we saw as far as implant usage and everything else. And so, we don't

believe that there was a big impact in Q4. Obviously, our Q4 was a very strong quarter, as you all know, but that – we
don't think that, that had an impact on the quarter. We do believe, we know from – as we indicated in our comments,
that a lot of these new products were not on contract yet, and we weren't willing to put discounts on the previously
contracted pricing. And so, as a result of that, we just didn't see the level of bulk purchases during the quarter that we
would normally see, and we know inventory levels are down as a result of that. So, that bodes well for the future. We
think it bodes well not only for pricing, but, obviously, also we would expect the bulk purchases to come back to more
normal levels as we go through the rest of the year.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Great. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Omar.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Maybe just two quick questions. Gary, just in terms of the German injunction impact for
CoreValve, it looked to us like about a $25 million impact. Can you kind of give us a sense of what the impact was in
your mind in the quarter? And how do we think about that number heading into next quarter? Should we assume a
significant drop-off or still inventory levels are maintaining a relatively high? And then I had a quick follow-up.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Well, again, I'll try to – we don't know, obviously, David, exactly how much benefit we
received in the quarter from the advanced purchases. We know the customers were buying in advance of the anticipated
injunction. And so, as a result of that, that clearly had a benefit in the quarter.
We know our results were higher than what was going on in the market during that period of time. The numbers are
anywhere from – your numbers maybe is a little high, but overall we're probably somewhere in that ballpark. The
reality is we did have extra revenue during the quarter.
As you we go into Q2 and Q3, it'll obviously depend on – as here again in the quarter, we continue to be selling until
the injunction is in effect and we'll continue. So, there'll be some impact obviously in the quarter. Whenever the
injunction, when that occurs, if that occurs, then obviously, it will have an impact going forward. And it'll be spread out
over that period of time until that – we get that resolved.
But at this point in time, obviously, there was an advantage in Q1, we were aware of. So, inventory levels obviously are
higher on that product currently. Inventory levels on CRDM obviously are lower in the U.S., but clearly on CoreValve
they're higher as physicians bought in anticipation of a potential injunction.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. And then maybe Omar, just more of a kind of a strategic question; all throughout the
quarter, we heard the Chinese government taking greater action to look at price scrutiny in obviously the domestic
market. Most of that was directed at pharmaceutical providers, but there has been some around medical device
manufacturers. And historically, when we've seen this action by the government, we have seen an impact on growth
rates in China for drugs specifically but also somewhat for devices. Any sense of what impact some of the
government's actions are having on your business? Or is there any concern that you would see an impact on your
business later on in the year? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, look, we're watching China closely for obvious reasons. Now, the first thing that I'd like
to say is that in no way does any of this activity shake our belief that this is a market we've got to win in and we're
going to be committed to and we're going to understand locally how it operates.

Now, you're right that the Chinese government is looking at pricing very carefully and probably as they should. But in
our view most of that is directed around the go-to-market models using distributors, which we are looking at very
carefully. I mean it's a market where we eventually have to have more direct presence with the customers themselves.
Now the way we have traditionally gone to market, we've used distributors for a variety of reasons; a lot of those are
extremely necessary, and so we don't want to make any dramatic changes; but we are, as we are doing in almost every
other country in the world, examining our distribution models very carefully. That's the action that we're taking. And at
the same time, we're working very closely with the government to help put in investments, so that healthcare in China
can be dramatically improved. So, again, we're watching the situation closely, particularly, around the distribution
channels, but we don't expect at this stage any dramatic moves anytime soon; and again, as we said, we're just watching
it.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you. First question is just a follow-up on the CoreValve discussion. When do you
expect there to be a validity decision in Europe that would impact Germany?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike, do you want to take that?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yeah. Our expectation is next spring we would have a decision in that hearing.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Omar, on our call in June, you talked a fair amount about building a
comprehensive presence across all of the different platforms at Medtronic; Cardiovascular, Restorative and Diabetes.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Can you maybe just spend a few minutes talking about that? And how, in particular, in
Diabetes and Restorative that you think about how you want that business to look over the next, let's say, three to five
years and how you want those to evolve?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. I think that's a fair question, Mike. Just to give a little background, what I've said is that
our long-term strategy as we build the business out both organically and inorganically is to do – progress on two
definitive directions.
The first is to build out comprehensively the three big clinical areas that we've identified as our focus areas;
Cardiovascular, Diabetes and Restorative Therapies. The second was to expand along the continuum of care in each of
these areas. And so, you'll see us moving in those concurrent directions as we go forward.
Now in response to the specific question, in Diabetes, for example, today, we're a niche player, so to speak, in type 1
diabetes and patients who require insulin. We see that we've got a platform, which enables us to step into a broader
range of diabetes patients, who largely have type 2, first through our call center presence, which is very significant,
which we can broaden to apply to a broader patient group; and the acquisition of Cardiocom, actually helps in that
endeavor.
Second to our continuous glucose monitoring technology, which we feel is – as we improve this technology we can
expand into more and more patient types. And then thirdly, we continue to look at value products and our expansion
into emerging markets, which will enable us to come out with lower and lower cost pumps over time, which should,
again, address a broader set of population. I think in these areas, we expect to grow organically as well as inorganically
and expand our footprint into a broader range of diabetic patients.
In terms of Restorative Therapies, clearly, our strength is – our approach into that segment through neuroscience and
neurology, which has been our core expertise driven by DBS and other Neuromodulation products.

From there, we take advantage of the fact that in the U.S. at least, most of the neurosurgeons are spinal surgeons as well
and from that we've gone into spinal implants as you know and have built a big franchise there.
We're looking around that space both in orthopedics potentially, but also in other areas of neuroscience, in ENT, which
have overlapped that broad category. Again, both organically and inorganically, we're looking at these areas to try to
fill these gaps, and we see considerable opportunity in both of those areas.
At the same time, we're also looking for patient continuum of care movements in all three of these areas where we can
look at patient management, post-treatment and also diagnostic specifically related to the therapy that we're talking
about.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. One follow-up if you don't mind on CoreValve as well. The filing of the extreme
risk module, do you know if the FDA has accepted that at this point as an independent filing?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike do you want to take that?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: They certainly accepted the submission. How they're going to treat the approvals, they have
not decided yet, but as we've said all along, as the data becomes available we will submit it in its modules and we've
now completed the extreme risk submissions.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Hi, can you hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great. Thanks. So, two quick questions, one on ICDs and one on emerging markets. First just
on ICDs, is it – am I in the ballpark in estimating that the issue around bulk purchasing this quarter maybe impacted
you by $15 million to $20 million, is that roughly right?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Bob, this is Gary again, I mean, it's hard to get real specific, but the reality is if you look at the
normal levels, that's probably a little bit light, it's probably a little bit more than that in fact that impacted us, it's
obviously hard to say, because it will range – there's a range that we have; but if we look at it kind of a normal level,
that's even probably light.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. Thank you. And then on emerging markets, I just want to make sure I understand
exactly what you're saying, because obviously emerging markets are now driving well over half the total company's
growth. So, could you just go into a little bit more detail on, for example, what happened in India this quarter?
And then also just – what exactly are you expecting for emerging markets growth in 2014? And to the previous
question, is 2014 a year, given what's going on in China, where you think there is a little bit of extra risk to that growth
rate this year and then more confidence long-term? I just would love you to put emerging markets in better perspective.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look our outlook for emerging markets overall has not changed. We are confident that we can
deliver between 15% and 20% quite reliably and are striving to make that thing 20% or more. And in certain regions,
we actually have shown consistency at over 20% for an extended period of time.
In China, we haven't been able to do that, although our growth rate has consistently been 15% or better and touched
20% every so often. And so – and China is the biggest market, so we're very focused on driving that up as quickly as
possible.

Our plan is actually or looking at increasing China's performance on a steady basis through the coming quarters and
into next year. So, if anything, we're expecting to get closer to 20% rather than the other way around. There may well
be issues to do with government policy and all of that, but in general, healthcare is a tremendous need in China and
access to healthcare is a big focus of the government.
And we are making the investments within China as you know in our Kanghui acquisition, we've done the LifeTech
partnership as well, as well as put in direct salespeople in certain regions to access lower tier or second-tier cities, so
we're going full board in China and we expect the growth rate, in fact, to gradually and steadily improve over the next
several quarters. So, we're pretty confident about our China outlook as well as overall emerging markets outlook.
Now to do with India and a little bit to do with Latin America, I think there are two distinct issues there. Latin America
was clearly one in which we're transitioning from indirect to direct sales in certain countries and that happened in the
middle of the quarter. And as that resolves itself, which it will, I guess, this quarter or next, we should be on track and
not really be seriously impacted.
In India, the bigger issue other than the distributor transition, which we also went through for other reasons is – that the
government has imposed a very low ceiling on pricing for some of the stents. Now, we're working with the government
and they are working with our customers there to come up with a tiered strategy through which we can address that
market. But in the first and in the last couple of quarters, I'd say, it was a dramatic change to the system and essentially
froze sales from not only us, but all multinationals. We think we're turning that around and going forward we expect
that situation to ease a little bit.
On India as well, it's important to point out that although Coronary being the biggest business suffered pretty big
headwind because of this, the rest of the businesses, all of them, from CRDM to Spinal to Surgical Technologies, all of
them actually have been growing strong double-digit and are continuing to take a bigger and bigger share of our India
business.
And over time that will start to mitigate any volatility that we'd see in the stent market. So, again, our overall emerging
market strategy is not changing. We're expecting to grow fairly steadily in the high-teen mid to high teens and
eventually to 20% and beyond and we expect to report regular progress as we go forward.

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure. Sure. Go ahead.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry about that. Just wanted to focus in on the
Diabetes business, I guess, first I was just curious as to why you are not breaking it out from Restorative Therapies, if
it's foreshadowing any potential consideration that you guys might be looking to potentially I guess spin it off or
something else?
And then secondly, I guess, just with the 530G, you had mentioned in the prepared remarks, Omar, that you are
expecting approval in the fiscal year. And I had thought previously expectations were for the end of the calendar year.
So, I just wanted to double check on that and just kind of get your updated thoughts on timing there?

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. First, the separation out of Diabetes. I mean that is driven purely and completely by the
consideration of how our customers are situated. And like I said, we are focused around three customer groups:
Cardiovascular; Restorative Therapies; which broadly encompasses neurology and orthopedics and associated
technologies; and Diabetes, which is a different customer.
That's the reason why we broke it out into three, so that it'll give us more focus in three of these distinct areas, so that
we can drive both inorganic and organic growth in each of the areas in the way that I've described. So, anything, in
Diabetes is going to fill out the platform. And, of course, more and more patients, because we consider that to be a key
area of growth for us.
So, I want to make that very clear, that the purpose of this is just looking at our customer base in a logical and rational
way and grouping them around certain types of customers who will look at common components of our technology and
therefore prove that we can take advantage of our size and scale in addition to being really focused around those
customers.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: In terms of the approval, we've been saying the fiscal year I think since last quarter. I think
prior to that, we were expecting it earlier, we might have said so. But ever since last, the end of Q4, we've been saying
this fiscal year. That has not changed. We think that we, in fact, can get this on the market before the end of the year.
Again this is not completely in our hands, so I cannot say definitively, because there's a lot of variables here. But we're
working closely with the FDA and we're making progress and we are pretty confident that we can get this released in –
within the fiscal year. And when we do, we expect immediate traction both from an acceptance of a new product,
which has had considerable success outside the U.S. where it's available; and also from the recognition of all the
deferred revenue that we've had for the past – over two quarters now. So, that's the overall outlook, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then at what point I guess with the 530G, if that does kind of slip further,
where might you make a decision just to perhaps move forward with I think it's the 640G?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: No, I think, we're not considering that yet. We feel that at this stage, the 530G is well on its
way to approval and we think it's an unlikely scenario that we'd have to stick it completely. I think the patient benefits
of that have been proven to be quite dramatic both in commercial use in Europe and as well as some recent papers that
have been published in The New England Journal, I think it was, last quarter. And so, we're pretty committed and the
FDA is working together with us to get this to market. So, I think it's – skipping it is a very unlikely scenario at this
point.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. And Kristen, just to add to Omar's comment, I mean, the FDA's issues are not around the
530G itself. I think, they're also very supportive that it's a good product. Obviously, it's more around our quality
systems, which is what we're having to do the work on. So, I agree with Omar, I mean, we have no plans on not
launching the 530G. It's – the only question is when and that's what we're working with the FDA on.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the question.
Omar, in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about stabilization in Europe, but you also highlighted some of
the Medtronic specific efforts to leverage your scale across different regions and different product lines. Could you
maybe just go into a little bit more detail there on what you are referencing? I think when we met, I remember we sat
with Rob at PCR in May, you talked about a few examples of customer contracting. But maybe you could provide just

a little bit more detail on how that might impact your business quantifiably over time?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. Just to give you a perspective on what that is, that is essentially working with major
customers, primarily hospital systems in Europe and contractually, managing cath labs for them. And I think that gives
us the ability to work with the customer directly to improve their overall efficiency.
We're going to be making some announcements along these lines fairly soon here, so we'll wait to give you more
details on that then, when we're ready. But again in a nutshell, what this does is it allows us to work with customers on
a much broader basis than before. And in fact, be their partners in improving the overall efficiency of delivery. And to
some degree, it certainly helps us get some independent revenue streams, as well as build closer relationships with their
clinical customers – with the physicians in those accounts as well.
As I said in the prepared remarks, this includes everything from the efficiencies in cath lab, to how products are
sourced, to managing the way in which products are ordered and stocked and we are building up our technology base to
be able to support these various capabilities.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And there'll be some added benefit of our own products, but the primary perspective here is to
provide an overall solution to those customers.
<Q - David H. Roman>: And then, I guess, a follow-up just along similar lines. You also talked about in, on some of
the new product launches, particularly in CRM, that you were awaiting new contracts and looking to obtain price
premiums on a number of those products you were launching. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the dynamic
in getting price premiums right now? What is the environment like for that? What type of price premiums do you think
you can obtain versus historical averages, and how are you balancing that with sort of the cross-selling model?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, there's two different things. First of all on pricing, the initiative that we started on a
couple of years ago was to be very granular about the economic value – clinical and economic value for our products
and these products – although the development started long before we started to looking at it that way clearly have got
both clinical and economic value for which we have evidence.
And so, we expect to get pricing that is objectively determined in relation to the economic and clinical benefits of these
products have. And I think that is an important consideration that we do not want to walk away from, just because the
quarter-end or stuff like that. I mean, I think we work too hard both in product development and in the generation of
evidence to not make sure that counts.
And so, that's been part of the issue here. That we are in the process of making that case, and we feel confident that
we'll be successful and that'll drive up pricing. That's separate from our overall consolidated approach to customers,
which is continuing with success, our growth in accounts with full CVG contracts continues, and this enhancement in
the product can only help in that endeavor. I think both Gary and Mike, and perhaps this is an important question, I'd
like both of you two to maybe chime in a little bit with their thoughts. Maybe, Mike, do you want to go first?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So, just on the question of price increases, some of the features that we've added, for example
Adaptive CRT into Viva product line for our high-power CRT devices, it actually can eliminate less ventricular pacing
in the patient and has been clinically demonstrated to improve CRT response and reduce heart failure hospitalization.
And I think you're probably aware that, that 30-day hospital re-admission window is a very key area of focus for
hospitals in the U.S., and even longer-term the ability to keep patients from coming back into the hospital for heart
failure re-hospitalizations is a big issue. The fact that we've been able to demonstrate this means that we would like to
accrue the benefits of that in a price increase.
Now most hospital systems have put in place technology review committees to rigorously look at these questions
because they're obviously not interested in paying price premiums unless it's for proven benefits. And so, that takes
some time and that's exactly what we've seen happening.

So for hospitals that have chosen in the past to do bulk purchases of product, they basically are waiting to go through
their cycle, don't want to bulk old product because they know they would rather replace it with the new product, but
have to get through their pricing committees in order to get approval. So, that's been one of the main issues in the
quarter and the same thing applies to our Evera product line with its shock reduction technology. So, that really is the
dynamic that was playing out in the quarter.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, I really don't have much to add to what Mike just indicated. I mean, as he indicated, the
biggest issue was getting people on contract and that's the change that's probably occurred over – in the industry over
the last several years, where it used to be maybe just a little price increase that came in immediately and the doctors can
make that call and that decision. Obviously, with the buying decisions now in hospitals, these committees are more
engaged in that process and ensuring that the products have the technology. So, as he indicated, that slows down the
process slightly, doesn't mean you don't get the price increases, it just means that you have to go through certain
processes.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That is very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Hey, we're run past the top of the hour, but let's take two quick questions before wrapping it up.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, it looks like, excluding
the CoreValve stocking, you grew slightly below 3% this quarter. And so, I guess, Omar, my question is what gives
you the confidence that you'll be able to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal year 2014, especially, if you assume that there is an
injunction in Germany with the CoreValve litigation and you'll lose approximately maybe $40 million to $50 million in
sales? So, it would be helpful to hear from you kind of how you see the rest of the year playing out and what gets you
to the 3% to 4%? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, it's – we tried to lay out the three areas where we had pressures in a very distinct fashion.
And certainly in Diabetes is pretty straightforward. There's a pretty big chunk, all of which has probably more than
offset any CoreValve issues that we may facing the next few quarters, just that alone. And we expect even more out of
that. So agreed, we need approval and if we don't get approval, there'll be pressure there, but we're pretty confident that
we will and that's a very distinct thing that we can all look at very clearly.
I think in terms of Neuro, we're already seeing traction. Again, at the same level by itself, at the same level or close to
any pressures which we may face in Germany, so that alone again can – is likely to give us some tailwind, if you like,
in the remaining three quarters and we've already seeing that. So, this is not something that we're waiting for, because
we've already shifted to the new product in manufacturing and we're launching it, as we speak. And although, again, as
we said there – it's very early in the quarter, but all the evidence points to the fact that we will get what we're expecting
out of that.
And then finally we come to CRDM and we explain what would happen here, the bulk purchases were at their lowest
levels and the inventory levels are down; and again, nothing's for certain here, but if you just look at this thing on a
fairly objective basis over time, we expect those levels to recover, and we expect the pricing premiums because we've
already experienced that in places where customers have been through the technology review committees and so on.
And as we go through next quarter, we expect that to come true.
So, we've got three areas, which are very clear in their pickup in the remaining half of the year. Granted there'll be
some pressure out of CoreValve, but we feel that these three alone are sufficient to more than offset that pressure. And
in addition to that I highlighted a series of other initiatives that will come to fruition within the year, for which we
expect revenue. So, again, I laid all of that out, and we in our analysis feel that the guidance that we provided is quite
achievable.

<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. And just lastly for me, Chris, if Chris O'Connell is on the call.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: I just wanted to ask about the competitive bidding for insulin pumps and just wanted to
confirm that you feel that your pumps are pretty well protected by any competitive bidding that could be implemented
in January 2014? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First of all let me take that. That is correct. We feel pretty protected that, that's not part of the
competitive bidding process. It's a much more sort of unique product. It's not commoditized, even close, in that sense.
And we've got support from the physician community and the healthcare agencies in that respect. So, we don't really
see any serious risk of the pump falling under competitive bidding. Chris, anything you want to add.
<A - Christopher J. O'Connell>: No, I think that's right. It's really about defining the categories of pumps that are
going to be subject to competitive bidding, that's an ongoing discussion with CMS.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Jeff Warren>: One last question.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.
<Q - Matthew C. Taylor>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was just interested to see if you could talk a little
bit more about your transition to positioning yourself as you're really a provider of solutions? And maybe you could
help us understand, I know you said you had some announcements coming up, but can you talk about over time what
portion of revenue you think you are going to be able to derive from those kind of services? Is it going to be really
small and adjunct? Or could it be an actual meaningful revenue piece over time?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, over time, we think it will be meaningful, but it is going to take some time. And let me
highlight the Cardiocom acquisition, that's a pretty good example of the source of things that you can expect from us.
Here's a company which is a leader in terms of disease management. It has complementary services to what we already
have. It addresses a broader range of patients than the one we do and you put the two together and there's both synergy
as well as incremental revenue from an independent source. So, that's the kind of activity that we'd like to do which
leverages what we have, but it's not solely dependent on what we have, but in fact grows it independently.
And in the beginning, we expect just one plus one, if you like. In the long-term, we expect one plus one and more
through the synergies that we expect to derive. And we expect to move in that direction in those two areas. In disease
management, which essentially means looking across the continuum of care and primarily at this stage looking at
patient management beyond the therapy of people who have the same kind of disease, but without our devices and have
a structure through which we can manage those patients in hospitals systems and peers around the world recognized
that managing these patients is critical to us being able to manage the overall cost of care both in the U.S. and around
the world.
Hospital efficiency is a different area where we're looking primarily at making sure that hospitals are working in as
efficient manner as possible. And our initial focus is in the area of cardiology because that's where we have our biggest
strength and we've had some initial success in Europe in not only getting those contracts, but starting to educate them.
So, we expect that too to become a larger and larger portion of our business.
The independent revenue piece will be small to start with. Over time, it'll grow. I think the impact that it will have
through synergy on the sales of our regular devices perhaps will be more and more meaningful. But we'll have to see
what we get out of this as we go forward. But that's essentially the strategy. We're not taking in big numbers for this –
at this stage, but it's an area where we're focused. In the long-term, we think in both of these areas there's big
opportunities for us to tap into in terms of available patients who need the care and both from the government and

payers for us to be able to provide such solutions.
Finally, maybe a lot is going to depend on how quickly the U.S. in particular moves from a pay-per-procedure system
to pay-per-value system. The quicker that shift occurs, the greater will be the meaningfulness, if you like, of this
revenue. If that happens quickly, you'll see much quicker growth in that area from us. If that happens slowly, it'll take a
little more time. So, there are too many factors for me to kind of say definitively, but those are some of the
considerations.
<Q - Matthew C. Taylor>: Okay. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the really thorough answer.
