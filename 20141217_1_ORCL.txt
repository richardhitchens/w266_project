And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call
over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clearly, we are very pleased with our results as hardware and total revenue
were both above my CD guidance while total software was up at the high-end. Cloud grew 47%, on-premise, software
license and support grew 6%, hardware systems grew 4% and total revenue grew 7% in constant currency.
The as reported numbers were heavily impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other
currencies. Total revenue saw a 4% currency headwind which would double what it was at the time of my guidance.
Software and cloud as well as hardware systems saw growth rates affected by 3%. Currencies continue to move
significantly. So my comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates.
Total cloud revenue was $519 million, growing 47% with Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue of $364 million, up 41% from
last year and more than double last year's growth. The cloud bookings momentum of several quarters is now helping
drive SaaS and PaaS revenue growth. When bookings turn into revenue, it depends on many factors. But as I reviewed
the numbers over the last few quarters, one thing is clear, the acceleration in the business bodes very well for our
future. Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service revenue was $155 million, up 62% but due in part to prior-year compares
being low.
Overall, our cloud results were better than expected as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce and we're more than
three times the size of Workday. Our goal remains to be bigger and grow faster in the cloud than both companies while
improving our already high levels of profitability.
Total software revenues were $7.3 billion, up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove
nearly half of total company revenue at $4.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their
usual high levels as our growing install base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow.
New software license revenues were $2 billion. Looking at GAAP software and cloud results by region, the Americas
grew 8% with North America database growing double-digits and very strong cloud growth. EMEA grew 9% with a
cloud growth of more than 80% and Asia-Pacific grew 7% powered by Japan.
Overall, the hardware business including hardware support grew 4% with hardware system product revenue of $717
million and hardware support revenue of $619 million. Our engineered systems saw solid growth, with particular
strength in both Exalogic and Big Data Appliance as we continue to gain share.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income
was $4.4 billion, also up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was unchanged at 46%. Excluding MICROS,
both hardware gross margin and operating margin expanded by more than 1%. That we're able to maintain our
industry-leading operating margins with MICROS now part of the business, while growing our cloud business 47%, is
a testimony to the strength of our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%. That's higher than my guidance of 23%. And EPS was $0.69 in U.S.
dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 23.5%, a point higher than my guidance, and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56 in
U.S. dollars. The higher tax rate reduced EPS for both GAAP and non-GAAP by $0.01. This was the result of revenue
mix by region, driven primarily by foreign currency impact and a couple of other small factors.
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was down very slightly at $14.5 billion, as we increased CapEx spending a
little bit. Just so that you get a sense of the size here, CapEx spending over the last four quarters is about $150 million
higher than that same four quarters the previous year. We now have nearly $45 billion in cash and marketable
securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12 billion.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on

finding the right companies at the right valuations, and both are critically important. This quarter we repurchased 52.8
million shares for a total of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 200 million shares for a
total of $8.1 billion, paid out dividends of $2.1 billion, for a total that is more than 70% of our free cash flow. And the
board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.
Now to the guidance. As you can imagine, we feel very good about our prospects and our performance. But I have to
tell you, I'm always keeping an eye on the situation in the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given
the unusually high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect revenue by more than 4%, and EPS by
$0.04, if rates stay as they are just about now. But as we just don't know how much, I'm going to provide constant
currency guidance today.
SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis, SaaS
and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 31% to 35%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow
29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, new
software license and software support, is expected to grow between 5% to 8%. Hardware system revenue on a GAAP
and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be
somewhere between negative 2% and positive 8% in constant currency. Total revenue growth on a GAAP and
non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.69 and $0.74, again, all this in constant currency. GAAP
EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.55 and $0.60. Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and
a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% but this too may end up being different, especially as tax rate is very heavily impacted by
the mix of earnings, which is impacted by currency.
With that, I'm going to turn this over to Larry for his comments.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Safra. As Oracle's cloud business gets bigger, our growth rate is going up. As our competitors' cloud
businesses get bigger, their growth rates are going down. This has big implications I'd like to explain.
In Q2, we booked more than $170 million in new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring revenue or ARR. In other words,
we sold over $170 million of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions this past quarter. In Q4 of this fiscal year, we
expect to sell more than $250 million of new annual SaaS and PaaS subscriptions. That means during our next fiscal
year, we will sell well over $1 billion of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions.
What makes this particularly interesting is that next year, Oracle will sell about the same total dollar amount of new
SaaS and PaaS business as cloud market leader, Salesforce.com. Stay tuned. It's going to be close. We're catching up to
them and we're catching up very quickly.
Mark, over to you.
Mark V. Hurd
Thank you. Okay. Let me just give you a couple numbers and a few names and then we'll go to your questions. SaaS
and PaaS revenue, as Safra mentioned, grew 41% in CD. ERP EPM revenue grew more than 80%. CX revenue grew
nearly 50%. I think that company Larry mentioned, Salesforce.com, reported 28%. CX Marketing Automation grew
200% in revenue [inaudible] (12:26).
Bookings grew nearly 150%. I want to say it one more time: it was 150%. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM, and sales
force automation all grew triple-digits. All pillars saw booking growth in excess of 50%. We added more than 860
SaaS customers with more than 230 that subscribed to more than one pillar when they bought a cloud subscription from
us. Nearly 650 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter. In HCM, we added 230 new customers.

In CX, more than 460 new customers. In ERP EPM, 250 new customers. In one quarter, we added 2.5 times Workday's
entire install base. Nearly 150 of the new ERP customers did not have any Oracle ERP before they bought cloud
subscription from Oracle in the quarter.
Overall, Fusion had triple-digit bookings growth, triple-digit revenue growth. We had over 125 Go-Lives in Q2. That's
SaaS. In PaaS, we had a breakout quarter. We had 150 brand-new PaaS customers. As many of you know, we
announced PaaS at Oracle OpenWorld at the end of September. Three-quarter subscribed to multiple PaaS services.
The PaaS opportunity is big, given the size of our install base and you might argue it's big or bigger than the SaaS
opportunity.
Let me read you a few names from the quarter, [ph] NHR (14:18), Fidelity National Financial, Pella, Siemens, Barnes
& Noble, Baylor Health Care System, DIRECTV, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser, Nokia, Northrop Grumman,
Societe Generale, Skanska. And sales service clouds: Flowserve, 3M, Adidas, Equifax, DIRECTV, Fiat, Telus, United
Parcel Service, VISA, Yahoo!, [ph] Big Server, Cypress Semiconductor (14:45). In marketing cloud: Bloomberg,
Equifax, Fiat, Honeywell, Ricoh, Siemens, Telefónica, VISA, Emerson, Kroger, Lego Systems. In ERP EPM cloud,
Odebrecht in Brazil, H.J. Heinz, InBev, Lafarge, [indiscernible] (15:04) and I don't have more time to read more. These
are a huge list of logos that we gained in the quarter.
A couple other comments, premise software grew 6% in CD. I continue to expect this business to grow nicely while our
cloud continues to maintain hyper-growth. Moving quickly just to mention hardware, engineered systems bookings
grew double-digits, bookings for Exalogic, SuperCluster and Big Data Appliance, [ph] as Safra pointed (15:36), all
grew more than 50%. And I just want to make sure for those of you that don't listen to traditional hardware companies
calls, it is clear we are taking substantive market share in hardware.
And wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already at a $2 billion rate, and as I said at the Financial Analyst Meeting, our
SaaS pipeline is large. Since then it's gotten bigger. We outpaced our bookings growth plan for the first half of the year
and set our sights on 100% bookings growth for Q3.
With that, we will take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Rick Sherlund>: Thank you for taking the question. Good quarter. On the cloud side, I'm curious as far as the
new versus existing customers. I think we've got some metrics there. Could you give us a sense of, are you seeing a
conversion from existing on-prem customers? Or is most of this new business that you're picking up?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, first, let's go through it by pillar because I think that's the way you have to do it. In
marketing everything is really new. We don't have a marketing install base. So when we give you those numbers, Rick,
they're really everything coming is a net-new logo. Now it may be in a company that's got Oracle product but it's all
net-new. Most of our sales cloud is net-new. There is some Siebel conversion. But as I mentioned at the Financial
Analyst Meeting, our Siebel install base when you look at [ph] support (17:23) numbers is fairly stable. So we have a
lot of net-new even in, if you will, sales cloud. We have a mix in HR, both conversion and net-new.
And I think the important thing you saw this quarter as we talked before, Rick, I think it's not just the fact that our
strategy isn't the just best-of-breed in each of these apps but also to have a suite of capability and that's why I wanted to
mention the multi-pillar deals that occurred in Q2 because we have customers now that are not just buying ERP from us
but they're buying ERP and HR. They're buying sales cloud and marketing. And we also get the opportunity as you
know to go back into that install base once we've got one app and sell a second app, a third app, a fourth app, and so it
was an exciting quarter across a number of those metrics.

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I'd just like to add...
<Q - Rick Sherlund>: And for PaaS...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Rick, just for me to add one thing. As Mark said, you guys take it pillar by pillar. You also
have to take it layer by layer in the cloud. So where a lot of our SaaS business, our brand-new logos, people have never
done business with Oracle before, you would expect that in PaaS it's virtually all our install base. But the reason being
almost every moderate-size company in the world is already an Oracle user. So the PaaS we're selling into this install
base, as Mark said, SaaS is a bit of a mix depending on pillar.
<Q - Rick Sherlund>: Yeah. And Larry, you're seeing customers pivoting now to PaaS and infrastructure-as-a-service.
If you could maybe spend a moment on that.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, I think our – we're pushing very hard at PaaS as opposed to
infrastructure-as-a-service. I mean that's where our huge differentiation is and that's where we give you so much more
automation in terms of database tuning and installation and backup and recovery and logging and security. So our big
push is into PaaS. We are in infrastructure-as-a-service which is a low-cost commodity business where we have the
same pricing as Amazon and Google and the rest. We are in that because when our customers come, as Mark said
earlier, they're buying one pillar, they'll buy another. I can talk about layers in the cloud where they'll buy a few SaaS
applications, they'll buy some PaaS and they'll buy some infrastructure-as-a-service as they want to have a unified
security model in a PaaS network to interconnect all of these pieces.
<Q - Rick Sherlund>: Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Thank you, Rick.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey, good afternoon, guys. I have two questions. One, I want to follow up on the cloud
piece and then I had a question on the database. On the cloud piece, Larry, you talked about $1 billion in bookings. I
just want to make sure that I'm reading this correctly. That's an incremental $1 billion on top of your current...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yes. All new business – that's another business that we will have sold – when you
annualize it. This is not a total contract value. This is in terms of annual subscription rates.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: On top of...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: We will sell next fiscal year, well in excess – we expect to sell well in excess of $1 billion
of new annual subscriptions.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: And that's on top of the current...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Which is about what Salesforce will be selling in their next fiscal year. I think they're at
$1.1 billion, something like that, best as we can estimate, and we think we have a good chance of passing them. I don't
know if we will pass them or catch them, but it's getting very close. We're in that ballpark. So we're selling new
business at the same rate as the market leader next year, which I think, again, we're expecting this hyper-growth.
Salesforce is slowing down, we're speeding up. They're only twice as big as us. They're $4 billion – in round numbers
they're $4 billion, we're $2 billion. But we are growing a lot faster and we have a lot more products and we have a large
install base to sell into. So we think, again, I said I know it's just words, we said we think we can become number one
in the cloud. We think we will be number one in the cloud, and we'll be number one in the cloud very quickly.

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: And Jason, just to add to your question, I mean most of – all of our comments that Larry made,
that I made, we're all talking about ARR.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Right.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Not TCV.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Right.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So there's not a multiplier. Our average contract value is [ph] actually (21:51) longer than
annual, but we are talking in comparisons of ARR.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, IBM will announce $1 billion deal over 10 years. That $1 billion deal, to us, would
be $100 million. If it's a 10-year deal and it's evenly distributed, we would count that as $100 million of ARR, or $100
million over one year. We annualize all of this stuff. How much of revenue, once they're installed and running, and
there's a delay between when we book something and when we start collecting revenue, because we don't collect
revenue until the users are up and running and it's implemented. Okay. So there's that delay. But once they are up and
running, it's an annualized number we're giving you, not a total contract value number we're giving you.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: I got that part. But I also want to make sure I'm clear. This is incremental on top of your
current $2 billion-plus run rate?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Of course. And it should be a lot more than $2 billion, by the way, because that's next fiscal
year. So we're not going to end this fiscal year still with $2 billion. That will grow. We have bookings that have been
booked that have yet to be provisioned.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Yeah.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Therefore, you will have a bigger base on which those bookings will go. At the same time, the
bookings we get in the future will take time to provision as they go forward. So it is a layered model as you build up on
the revenue, Jason.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Great. I want to ask one thing on the database business. Larry, a lot of customers in the past
have been conditioned to wait for R2 of the database to come out. This time around, you guys made a major release this
past summer with the In-Memory option. I'd be curious to get your take on, what are you seeing in terms of customer
adoption? Are we starting to see folks say, hey, we're going to move to this incremental Dot release that came out, I
think it was June-July timeframe? Or are some folks still waiting for R2? What's the advice. or the guidance from
Oracle. in terms of when customers should migrate to 12c? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. So there are two major pieces of our new database release. One as you mentioned is
the In-Memory option, but that's not the only driving factor of people upgrading their database version. The other is
multi-tenancy, the multi-tenant option, which is appropriate for the cloud. It allows them to, again, convert all of their
existing Oracle applications and make them multi-tenant applications while preserving security and reliability, a better
way than do multi-tenancy at the application layer. Anyway, we think those two features in concert are driving – will
drive a much more rapid adoption of the Oracle database over the next couple of years. So we think our database
business is going to have a very strong 24 months coming up.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yeah. And Jason, the options did very, very well in the quarter. So there's no question
customers are extremely interested and are buying the options.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: All right. Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the answers.

<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi, happy holidays and good news from Oracle to hear that. Can you talk about the net
new cloud bookings and what exactly is driving that? If you can give us color by product, is it HCM or CRM? Or, to
Larry's point, the layer, is it the PaaS or the SaaS layer or geographies? And in particular, Larry, if you could drill into
the PaaS layer and help us understand is it a net new market? Or could it come at the expense of the traditional database
business, which maybe gets cannibalized? Or maybe not? Just wanted to get your thoughts on it. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Mark will probably give you a more detailed answer but my answer is yes.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Everything.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: It's all of the above. One is that we have such a broad – if you look at our product line
versus our competitors, we're Salesforce's only real competitor in sales automation. We're the leader in marketing
automation. We're fighting hard to be the leader in service automation where our competitor is Salesforce.com. We're
Workday's only real competitor in HCM and we think we've passed them in HCM but you can make an argument.
We're both fighting hard in HCM. But we're killing Workday in ERP. If you include ERP and EPM together, it's
planning, budgeting, performance management and the classic ERP, all of that, we've sold 2.5 times more customers
this past quarter than they've done in the life of their company. We are the clear leader in mid-range and high-end ERP
with no competition from Workday. They're just not there. Or when they're there, they're losing every time. So we're
very strong in HCM. We're very strong in ERP. We're the leader in ERP. We're the leader in marketing. We're the
leader in EPM. We're contending for leadership in service automation and in HCM. And we're the guys in second place
behind Salesforce in sales force automation. But every place else, except for that one segment, that one niche, we're the
leader or fighting to be the leader.
So we have incredible breadth of SaaS products. Our SaaS products are built on top of Java and the Oracle database,
the platform. And companies want to make extensions to the applications. They want to link the applications to their
existing applications and so on. Using our platform makes a lot more sense than using a proprietary platform from
Salesforce.com. We don't think it's a fair fight. By the way, Salesforce.com uses our platform to build their
applications. They just can't sell our platform as a part of their service offering to their customers because they have no
license to do so. We can sell our platform. We do sell our platform. So we sell the same platform that we build on to
our customers.
So we've seen a huge amount of interest both from our SaaS customers using our platform, and also this enormous –
this huge install base we have in the database business, [indiscernible] (28:29) and development and certain aspects of
their database work to the cloud. Not everything, but a part of it. A bit of a hybrid and we're seeing these customers
now experimenting. They're at the experiment level. But the potential for this, as Mark said, is probably bigger than our
SaaS business.
And I think we're going to be the by far the leading SaaS company in the cloud. Look at our product portfolio. Kash,
who wins in all of these battles? The suite vendors always beat the Point Solution guys. It's happened in every
generation of computing where the end-user, the customer, doesn't want to be integrator of 30 separate applications
from 30 separate vendors. No different now. Just all in the cloud now. Same problem, they don't want to integrate a lot
of different stuff. We have all the stuff pre-integrated. We think we're in a great position. We're seeing hyper-growth at
SaaS. We're seeing hyper-growth in PaaS. We're getting bigger and our growth rates are getting higher. That's unlike

<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Thanks, and happy holidays.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Listen, add to it the products are more mature. We're on Release 9 of our SaaS products,
right. Not only are our products more mature, we have more of them. Our suite is broader. We added sales capacity
before two and a half years ago. So realigning the sales force, adding capacity, they're trained, they're getting more
training and we have references. And when you add familiarity [indiscernible] (30:15) community to it, you just have a
lot of factors. There's no one of these factors in isolation, it's the culmination of a lot of work over a lot of period of
time.

Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great, thank you. Mark, I was wondering if you could share with us, your performance this
quarter, given what's going on with currency was definitely better than I think people were expecting on a constant
currency basis, even. I'm wondering how much of that due, do you think, maybe the U.S. environment, a deal-closing
environment getting a little bit better from a macro perspective? And how much of it is due to sales force efficiency
improvement?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So you're saying macro versus us?
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: No, macro in the U.S., right, seems to be doing better. How much of it is due to – is your
sales force productivity improving? And that's what's driving kind of the confidence and the guidance for next quarter
and your results on a constant currency basis this quarter? Because I think versus what everyone was thinking, things
are looking better.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, I don't think anything changed from what we had been seeing for a while. The only
difference is we saw it in pipeline, we saw it in proposal and now it's turned into actual numbers and performance. So I
don't think this is an event. I think this is a set of activities that have occurred over a long period of time as I tried to
reference in my previous question. I would not take some short term improvement in the U.S. macro and turn that into
– that's why Oracle had great cloud bookings in Q2. I think our performance was driven by exactly the phenomena that
I described. Better – great products, more mature products, better references, lots of capacity in our sales force, it's
better trained, it's out in the market and winning deals. That's what I think drove it.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, I'd like to second...
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Okay. And then...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I'd like to second what Mark said is we're just further up the learning curve on everything.
Our sales management team is terrific. We've realigned our sales force against our secular competitor. So we have an
HCM sales force the goes up against Workday. We have a sales automation sales force that goes up against
Salesforce.com and we have a service automation sales force that goes up – but they're different. It goes up against
Salesforce.com. We have a marketing automation sales force. We have ERP sales force. We have an EPM sales force.
We have all of these [indiscernible] (32:51) and we created those, actually Mark created those several years ago and
we've been hiring staffing and they're much more mature. We started working on some of these products.
A lot of these products are we built them internally. We started about 10 years ago, after 10 years of development, the
Fusion applications, again Mark said, We're in Release 9 and they're getting really good. The user interface is getting
good. We're getting – we have a lot of good customer feedback again over a period of years. We have improved the
UIs, we have improved that multi-national capability. We've improved security in the cloud, we are the leader – I think
we are the leader in application security in the Cloud.
So it's just walking up the learning curve, and at some point it becomes visible to everybody. Now I think we've been –
Mark, a few quarters ago talked about the size of the pipeline, look pretty good, they are kind of stunning. But I know
the next thing is it turns into bookings, the next thing it turns into revenue, the next thing is we have more revenue than
anyone else in the Cloud, and I think that's the next shoe that's going to drop.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Thanks, Heather.

Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thanks. I have a question for Safra. Safra, as you said, CapEx has creeped up a little bit. It's up
26% on a trailing 12-month basis or about $150 million. Non-GAAP operating margins have really held steady, as has
free cash flow. But as you transition to more cloud-based business, should we expect free cash flow to trail off a bit,
even if it's just temporarily?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: It's all so tiny. These amounts are so small in the scheme of what's going on. I mean I think it's
kind of unusual that I would even call out a $150 million increase year-over-year on the capital expenditure but since
you guys aren't even used to it, I figure, let me call it out, as small as it is.
Obviously, in the launch for PaaS and the volumes that we are expecting, we made our investments. And as we expand,
we will continue, but these are really tiny numbers and are totally dwarfed by our $14 billion-plus in free cash flow. It's
kind of – I am not sure other companies would've even mentioned it, and you are probably asking me because other
companies make these enormous announcements of spending billions and billions. And you have to remember, I
mentioned it at Financial Analyst Day, we control almost our entire supply chain. You see, we literally – we are very
close to starting with sand, and then we have computers. I mean we make almost everything, and as a result, we get
everything at the best possible prices and economies of scale. We are already a very large company, so we already had
huge investments over the years, and so we have a lot of capacity and again – so I would not fret on this really small
number, because I am not planning on making some announcement that we are going to spend billions because we've
already spent, and it's just showing up little teeny bitties at a time.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay, thanks, that's helpful. If I could, just a quick tactical follow-up and it's regards to guidance.
I mean we can go through our own calcs for foreign exchange effects to get a reported number relative to the constant
currency guidance, but generally, what's the delta in growth for the top line between constant currency and reported
numbers that you have?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: In this past quarter that we just had?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I think he's saying guidance.
<Q - John DiFucci>: No, actually, I'm talking about guidance. Yeah.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: No, I didn't give – listen, the rates right now compared to last year, depending on which line
item, because it depends, for us, geographic distribution and all of those things. It's over 4%, in some areas it
approaches 5%. It's – a number of currencies really collapsed in comparison to the dollar. So if that's what you are
asking me, I think I am answering, if things stayed as they are today, it is over 4% of impact in many of the big
numbers – of the numbers you guys follow.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Good afternoon. Safra, just on operating margins there's been a lot of focus, if you can continue to
drive steady operating margin improvement despite this transition in the cloud. I think you were clear to John that the
investments are already in. But as you look at the next level of operational improvement, where do you see the biggest
levers? And I guess as you transition in the cloud, as more of the business gets there, is this inherently a more profitable
business, from your perspective, as you get to that side?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Oh yes. I mean, there's no question. We've done the analysis, and I think I shared at least some
of it with you all during Financial Analyst Day. But there is no question that, at scale, we continue to improve our
margins dramatically, taking advantage of both our economies of scale and our controls, almost our entire supply chain,
and really our intense automation, which really ultimately results in our being very, very price competitive and

allowing our customers to spend much, much less all-in than they ever did, and yet we get a much more significant
percentage of their wallet share. So we expect, as we continue to go – I am very pleased with where margins laid out
this quarter, and as we get to volume, I actually think we will do better – continue to do better.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And I'd just like to echo the congratulations for this
quarter. Most people have touched on a lot of the other lines of businesses so far, but I want to ask a question about
hardware. You guys exceeded your guidance this quarter and guiding for growth year over year again next quarter. Just
give us a sense for what you're seeing in that hardware line. Are we finally hitting that point that you all have talked
about? That the stuff that you're not focused on is getting small enough and declining less that the growth areas are
starting to show through or just how we should think about that would be great.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, I think you should think about it that we are just winning. I mean that would be the
overriding thing I would take away. So you look at some of the markets we are in particularly in computers that are
scaled computers, the $20,000, $25,000 and up category that you typically see from most of the research firms. We are
gaining startling amounts of share.
And you are talking about growth rate, gains of share that are 7, 8, 9, 10 points of share gain. And if you are going to
ask what the drivers are underneath it, they're what we've been talking about before. We had double-digit bookings
growth in engineered systems as I described a few minutes earlier.
Safra and I both mentioned a couple of products and we've had very good performance out of what's called the Oracle
SuperCluster, The SPARC SuperCluster has had significant growth. We've had very good growth in a product we don't
talk about much called the Oracle Database Appliance. It's had significant growth for us. And so this whole strategy of
aligning hardware and software to gather is what customers want. I can make an argument to you; it's the same market
trend you see in the cloud. We just do more work for the customer. We integrate the products for the customer, the
customer doesn't have to do it. We optimize the software for the solution and it's delivered us strong growth. And so
when you look across really every line for us we had very good performance, by the way, I should add, in storage.
Storage, our network-attached product, again of now it's a bigger base, had very strong growth in the quarter as well.
So we're quite pleased with the performance we've seen in most of our product categories across most of our
geographies, particularly in terms of share gains.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Great. Thanks, guys, and congratulations again.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Thank you for fitting me in. I've got a question about two growth metrics that stood out to
me that exceeded my expectations, and I love some color. The first, and maybe this is directed to Mark. Mark, it felt
like North American database in the prior few quarters ran a little bit less than expectations. And yet Safra mentioned
in her comments that North American database sales were back to double-digits. I'd love to understand what drove that.
It doesn't feel like there's a big broader demand improvement, so I'd love to know how you pulled that off. It's
impressive. And then for Safra, you put up 9% software support revenue growth in constant currency. That's actually

the best number you've put up in a little while, and I'd love a little color on that. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, I think on the database question North America, Larry answered that a bit earlier talking
about 12c. I mean we are into a new release. We talked about the timeframes it would come on board. You saw a good
performance in North America, frankly when you looked at database overall in CD, we grew like 5, 6 points – [ph] I
will say (43:36) 6 in CD. And so again my guess would be we're gaining share. Again as you look at database overall.
I know you mentioned the metric you described about database, but as I tried to go through at Financial Analyst
Meeting, when you look at the CAGR on a three-year basis, it is a very strong upper-single digit CAGR in database. So
while you talk about one quarter or another, this is not new phenomena that you see this kind of performance in
database and that with 12c. Our pipeline has grown in database and I think it's reflected in the numbers that you saw in
the quarter.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Thanks. And Safra, yeah.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes, sure. I am actually looking at all the numbers and the contract base and it's been going up
– I mean it jumps around, but I have other quarters where it's very close. And remember we are selling in extremely
large amount, cancellation rates are very low. Attach rates are extremely high. And all of that added together just ends
up with a good number.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: All right. Okay. Thanks a lot.
