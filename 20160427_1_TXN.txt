MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q 2016 earnings release conference. At this time, I would like to
turn the conference over to David Pahl. Please go ahead.
David Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's
Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at
ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be
available through the web as well.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding
forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings
for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the
year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive, as well as improvement
in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics
market, which declined as expected.

Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue
declined 8%, while Embedded Processing revenue grew 8%. Earnings per share were $0.65.
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be
representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was
$547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing
shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from a year
ago.
Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago, and consistent with our targeted range of 20%
to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our
manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic
purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the
business. For the trailing 12 month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of
dividends and stock repurchases.
Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume analog and logic. Power
management and high performance analog also declined while Silicon Valley Analog grew. Embedded Processing
revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines led by processors. Our investments in
Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record.
In our other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products. Compared with a
year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to the lower demand in personal electronics that I described earlier.
Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4.5 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an
environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times which together drives high
customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years
because of our consignment program.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive
demand remained very strong, driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain systems. Industrial
demand strengthened broadly with most sectors growing. Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that
declined about $150 million as expected. Overall, personal electronics was down more than that, primarily due to
mobile phones. Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it
was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our
product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long lived positions. These four attributes taken
together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion and was 60.6% of revenue, a
new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing
costs, as well as the higher percentage of more profitable products.
Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year ago period. Over the last 12 months, we have invested
$1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of
which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense.
Operating profit was $968 million, or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points

higher than a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated
positions. Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations
was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we staged our inventory for increased shipments in the
second quarter. Also included were three to four days of inventory associated with the portion of the personal
electronics market that started slowing late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year.
Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, cash flow from operations was
$4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $552 million, or 4%
of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which
include the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year
ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow
growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be
valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to
return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt
retirement.
In the first quarter, we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01
billion. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was
reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months, and by 41% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to
reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return
excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter
with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our US entities owning 80% of our cash. Because our cash
is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4%
from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, for the second quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion, and
earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges,
will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then
decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in
2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model, and with that, let
me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an
opportunity for additional follow up. Erica?

<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yes, thank you, and excellent results. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's driving
the revenues in Q2 by end market?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Romit, we don't typically provide a forecast by end market, however if there's any large
shifts, we'll talk about that, much like we did last quarter within a sector in personal electronics. I can say that that
demand we would expect to grow sequentially, but it will be down significantly from a year ago. And I'd also say that
outside of that, we would expect the rest of our business to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. Do you have a
follow-up?
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah, I do. I know that the conversion to 300-millimeter has been an important part of the
improving margin profile and I was wondering if you could just update us on how much of the portfolio is converted to
300 and how much is left?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Romit, I'll go ahead and talk to that. Roughly a quarter of our analog revenue was generated
on 300-millimeter last year. We have total internal capability about $8 billion. So we're using about a quarter of that
capability at this point in time. Just to remind everybody else who is listening, the reason the 300-millimeter is so
important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3 times as many chips per wafer on a
300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4 times as much, so if you do the math, that
means the actual dye cost is only about 60% as much on a 300-millimeter wafer as a 200-millimeter wafer.
When you take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal, we wind up with a higher gross
margin on those chips that are manufactured on 300-millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us. As we look out
in the future, again we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300-millimeter and we continue to
increase our loadings in that space. In fact on a year-over-year basis, we actually had more starts on 300-millimeter
than we did a year ago.
<A - David Pahl>: Sounds good, and I'll just add to Kevin's comment, that as we reported last quarter, we qualified our
second 300-millimeter fab which is DMOS6 and we do have product running in that fab today. So thank you, Romit,
and we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from the line of John Pitzer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon guys. Solid execution as always. Kevin, I guess you could talk a
little bit about the Embedded Processing margin improvements. If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the
wireless business, you didn't get out of all the cost, and you put a lot of that cost into the embedded processing market.
If I look at sort of the incremental margin, op margin sequentially, it's greater than 60%. Are we sort of at a tipping
point here where that's kind of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this business? And is there any
reason why the Embedded op margins shouldn't converge with the Analog op margins over time?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, John, what you might recall is that a year ago, we were still in the process of winding up
some restructuring actions in the Embedded Processing segment. That finished about the middle of the second quarter.
It was a little – it bled over into the middle of the second quarter. And so consequently now we're seeing the benefit of
those cost restructurings. The margin improvement that we'll see, what we're running on this business now is a solid
25% operating profit in the quarter and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment.
As you noted, we had about a quarter of a quarter, about a 62% fall through to operating profit from the revenue
growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost
management but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue so that it can continue to drop through
more profit as we go forward. I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same sort of levels as
Analog, but we are confident that there remains room of improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued
cost containment and a drive towards revenue growth.

<Q - John William Pitzer>: And then just, you mentioned as my follow up, you mentioned in your prepared
comments some of the inventory growth you saw in the March quarter. I'm just kind of curious how long it takes to get
that closer to trend. As you exit June, would you expect to see days closer to your trend line, or how should we think
about that?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, I think that what's actually interesting, John, is our dollars of inventory are actually
down year-over-year. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our days of inventory were up, and that's up on the
expectation of increased shipments in the second quarter. And plus, there's a few extra days that are inside that 1Q
inventory as a result of the slowdown in personal electronics that we mentioned 90 days ago. We expect that material is
going to ship over of the balance of the year, and between the increased shipments in 2Q and the shipments of that
personal electronics material, we'll see the days of inventory drift back down comfortably inside our model very similar
to what we saw last year. If you go back and take a look at last year, we were also a little bit higher in the first quarter
in anticipation of second quarter growth, and then days drifted down as we came through the year.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay, thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari, please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Long>: Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya. Your Q2 guide at the midpoint implies flat to down
year-over-year growth. I was just kind of wondering when you expect to kind of return to growth and what the drivers
of that will be.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, so I think if you look at the midpoint, you're right, that year-over-year growth would be
down about 1%, as we talked about before. On a year-over-year basis, we'll still have the growth impacted due to the
weakness inside of personal electronics. Outside of that, we expect to see our businesses growing both sequentially and
year-on-year. And again, I think that we're in a good position to capitalize on the trend of industrial and automotive.
We think longer term that that's where the growth in our industry will come from. And just as a reminder, we had last
year about 46% of our revenues driven by there. So we feel good with where our products are positioned.
<Q - Charles Long>: Got it. And then, gross margin performance was strong in Q1. Outside of lower depreciation and
incremental 300-millimeter revenues, where are the other factors that are going to drive upside from here?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, you hit two important ones. So we had lower manufacturing cost year-over-year, driven
by as you mentioned lower depreciation and increased 300-millimeter wafer starts. But we also had a richer mix of
overall products as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks. Industrial was up very solidly for us, and in the industrial
space we enjoy a very nice mix of overall profitability. So you have that combination of events going on. And again to
Dave's comments a moment ago, as we continue to see content growth in industrial and automotive, we would expect
to continue to see a improvement in our mix from a profitability standpoint too as we look out over the quarters and
years. So it's all coming together very nicely for us right now.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And we'll got to our next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. In the quarter, OpEx came in a little high. I was
wondering if you could tell us the driver of what drove that, and what your thoughts are for OpEx for Q2.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Stacy, OpEx did come in a little bit higher than what we had planned for. There really
wasn't any one thing that drove that. There was just a number of small things that were being taken care of in the
quarter. As we look into second quarter, recall that 1Q includes about two months worth of our annual pay and benefit

increases. So as you look into 2Q, you'll need to account for that, that we would have the full three months of pay and
benefit increases. I'd expect the change quarter to quarter to be very similar to what you saw last year.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. Thank you, that's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the
comm infrastructure impact on both Embedded Processing as well as other. So Embedded's up 8% year-over-year. You
noted within your other business that your ASIC, custom ASICs are down year-over-year. I think both of those tend to
be driven very highly by comm infrastructure. Can you help us understand the differential between those two
businesses? Is one of them eating the other, for example?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, so first let me talk about our Embedded business. So our Embedded business, as you
remember, has three product lines inside of it. Microcontrollers and processors are both about 45% of that revenue, and
connectivity makes up about 10% of that revenue. So we saw growth in all three of those businesses. They all grew
very nicely. But it was led by processors. So our communications infrastructure processors would be inside of that
business, but we also sell automotive products that are inside of that business that drove that growth.
In the other business, the custom ASIC business, I'll just say that we sell a different mix of products to customers. So
it's not always the same. We've got some customers where we only sell both, just Embedded and Analog, into those
customers. So – and that said, just as a reminder, longer term we do expect that the custom ASIC business will decline,
because that functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs inside of the Embedded business. Thank you, Stacy.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Thank you guys.
<A - David Pahl>: We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about the out-performance in gross
margin. You said 300-millimeter. I was just curious what the utilization rates are. And as you look into Q2, seems like
guidance implies at sustaining at that level. I just want to make sure that was right, and what you are expecting to do
with the utilizations there.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, the utilizations actually haven't changed that much in a number of quarters, and we
don't expect it to change much in the next quarter or two either. The amount of wafers that we're starting are pretty
consistent as we go across the quarters. And Blayne, you can kind of see that in, when our days of inventory go up in
Q1 as we're building for increased shipments in 2Q, it allows us to run the factories at pretty close to similar utilizations
quarter over quarter rather than ramping them up and down to meet the in-quarter demand. So I wouldn't expect
utilization to change that much going into the next couple of quarters, just as it hasn't in the last number of quarters.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Got you. And then as my follow up, you had a correction in consumer as you pointed out. As
you look into the back half of the year, you said you expected to sell through. So do you expect your content in those
types of applications to be roughly similar this year, and therefore you should see a similar ramp like you did last year?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, we haven't given color on how much content we have. I'll just say that when we do engage
where we like to be able to engage, inside of personal electronics or those types of products that we'll sell across
multiple generations of products, and that's not always the case on every product that we make an investment in, but
that's where we want to steer our investment dollars. So we're confident that as we build that inventory, that we'll have
demand in the back half. We won't try to predict at this point what that demand will look like. So thank you, Blayne,
and we will go to the next caller, please.

<Q - Harlan Sur>: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Another solid showing by the Embedded
business. You pointed out particular strength in processors. I think you guys talked about comms as a driver there and
maybe some automotive, but your MCU products also grew nicely year-over-year. Maybe you can just give us some
insights on the end markets/applications that drove the growth in that sub-segment.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, our MCU business is really a great business that we're building, and as you know, we've been
investing in that business for some time. We've got and continue to invest both in TI-based architectures as well as
ARM-based architectures and we've got customers that want to have both of those. And we continue to be selective on
where we make those investments. Part of the way that you differentiate those products is by having peripherals that are
optimized for different types of applications. We develop microcontrollers that are targeted for ultra-low power
battery-backed operations that will be infielded for in some cases decades, as well as very high performance-based
microcontrollers.
So, and we've got very strong connectivity solutions, both wired, but as well as wireless, and that crosses over into our
connectivity business that we've got there and that we support over a dozen different interface or wireless standards
inside of that business. So again very, very broad based, and we really are encouraged by the results of that business.
Do you have a follow on, Harlan?
<Q - Harlan Sur>: Yeah. Within the industrial markets, which was obviously an area of strength for you guys in the
March quarter, you guys have talked previously about servicing like I think like 14 different sub-segments. So very
broad.
<A - David Pahl>: Right.
<Q - Harlan Sur>: You've also talked about content gains in industrial which is kind of a similar dynamic to the
automotive segment. Any of those sub-segments within industrial that are showing more of a bias towards more dollar
content gains on a go-forward basis?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, I think Harlan, the one nice thing about automotive is we can more easily identify what unit
SAAR growth is. And there's enough analysts that follow that market that we can track with the semiconductor content
gain. And in there, we think that there's probably somewhere around $350 on average that sells into an automotive.
That's a number that's been growing very nicely. And when I look at that, that's probably about 1% of the average sales
price of a car. So it's not too hard to imagine that that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the
future.
When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were three, five
years ago in the automotive market with industrial, you really can't do that same type of analysis unfortunately, because
we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that, there are literally hundreds of different end equipments
that we track and develop solutions for and there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going
on. And the beauty of it is it's not just one thing. It really is growth on a very broad basis. And I think that that's
reflected in our numbers not only this quarter but it's been reflected in the numbers for a number of quarters now. So
we really look forward to that opportunity in the future. Okay, Harlan, thank you and we'll move on to the next caller,
please.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. One more on gross margins. Is the 60.6% the new baseline and we
should we model the flow through from this level? Or are there any mix benefits that are helping you in the first half
that might reverse when the smartphone shipments start to ramp in the second half?
<A - Kevin P. March>: So you'll have several things going on across that. So that's a pretty tough call to make when
we're trying to get too precise. We would expect industrial and automotive to continue to be a growing portion of our

revenue over time. That's where we're focusing our attention, especially our R&D dollars. We would also expect more
starts as we look out into the future, proportionally more starts on 300-millimeter which is lower cost wafers. We
would also expect the depreciation declines that we've been seeing this past year to continue, albeit at a slower pace
than what we've seen in the last few quarters. So those will give you tailwinds. So even if you do have some of these
other products start back up, you've got enough mix going on inside there that these margins that we're operating at
right now are probably pretty representative of what the portfolio can do for our shareholders.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Got it. Very helpful, Kevin. And as my follow-up, you mentioned that sales growth in Q1 plus
what you got into Q2, excluding, I don't recall whether you said personal electronics or just your largest customer, that
sales growth is actually up year-on-year. Could you help us quantify what that growth trend is versus last year?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, Vivek, we're not being that precise. We just wanted to give some color generally that where
we had seen that headwind and the demand changing late in fourth quarter, that that portion of our demand inside of
personal electronics, that we expect that it will grow sequentially but be down significantly year-over-year. And we just
haven't gotten more precise than that. So okay, thank you, Vivek. And we'll move on to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Thanks for letting me ask a question, guys. I guess the first question would be your first
quarter came in at the high end of the range. Can you just talk about what was the positive surprise in the quarter? And
maybe associated with that, Dave, I think in the past you have given the sequential end market performance to match
what you've given and then year-over-year. If that helps answer both questions, that will be great.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Yeah so again, as we had said earlier, that portion of demand where we saw weakness came
in about as we expected. The strength was more broad based and we continue to obviously to see strength in
automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment. So very, very broad-based strength that we
saw.
So the second part of your question was sequentially what we saw from the trends. There no surprise that automotive
remained very strong and it was driven by infotainment as well as the hybrid electric and powertrain systems.
Industrial, again we had growth across almost every sector inside of industrial. Personal electronics down with most
sectors declining. And comms equipment was up sequentially, and that was the third quarter in a row that it actually
grew. And then enterprise systems was up due to projectors. So did you have a follow on, Ross?
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Yes, I'll make it quick and you just talked about the comm side, the third quarter in a row it's
been up. Generally, how do you think about that versus where we are after burning a ton of inventory and now coming
back? Are we to the point where we're shipping to end demand and now we can grow or shrink with that or is there
some other dynamics going on?
<A - David Pahl>: Can you repeat the first part of the question? Because you just cut out a little bit on our side.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Sure. You said your comms business was actually up for the third quarter in a row.
<A - David Pahl>: Oh right.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Obviously that had fallen due to the end market before that. So the question is, do you think
you are back to shipping to end demand and what do you view to be the growth trajectory of that business longer term?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I would say that business as you know, Ross, has always
remained choppy. And we had a very strong period of growth going back a year ago, followed by the declines that we
saw last year. It's just, it's really tough to be able to predict what's going to happen in that market. And we just
positioned product and inventory to be able to respond if that demand will continue to strengthen, and if it doesn't, we
know how to react in that environment too. So it still continues to be a really good business for us. We continue to

make investments in it. And we just know that it'll be choppy.
Longer term, we don't view it as a market that will be a growth. We don't think that operators will take their CapEx
spending up over the next five, 10, 15 years, but we do think that there will continue to be shifts in how they spend that
money. So we continue to make investments where we believe that that growth will be in the future. So thank you very
much, and we'll move to the next caller, please.

Yes, we'll take our next question from the site of Chris Danely. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Hey, thanks guys. I apologize if these questions is have been asked before. I got on
here late. I was listening to Xilinx and slamming my head against my desk. It sounds like you're guiding for a roughly
seasonal or slightly below seasonal environment. If you could just kind of compare now versus a quarter ago, versus a
year ago or the last six months how you feel overall about the overall environment. Is it seasonal, a little below
seasonal, better than seasonal, getting better, getting worse, any comments there?
<A - David Pahl>: Well, I'd just make the observation that we believe we're just continuing to operate in a very similar
macro environment that we've seen in the last two quarters and even in the recent years. And our guidance obviously is
our best estimate of how we'll perform. So we try to stay away from making any precise comments on what a seasonal
quarter looks like, as you know Chris, just because if you look at the numbers, there's usually a pretty wide variation on
what an average would tell you that it would be. So again, just a very similar macro environment to what we've seen.
Do you have a follow on?
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Yeah, real quick. Just on channel inventory and distribution inventory. I think you said
that channel inventory was up a couple of days, around 4.5 weeks. Do you expect channel inventory or disti inventory
to go up again in Q2? And then if you could just give us kind of the range that channel inventory/disti inventory has
been in for the last, call it two or three years. Is this basically at the bottom or is it a little off the bottom or closer to the
peak, or where would that be?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, well as you know, we've several years ago implemented our consignment program. So I
think we still continue to learn what the right level in the channel will be. And I'd just say that if we could actually
convert all of our shipments in distribution to consignment and carry that inventory ourselves, we'd actually prefer to
do that. So if anything, we'd encourage our distributors to take advantage of those programs. We've operated I'd say
around four weeks to 4.5 weeks I think, for some time. That number probably somewhere in that range, even if it
drifted up a little bit, it always just depends on the product that's out there and the speed at which it turns.
But we've got other peers that measure their inventory in months and not weeks. So we're very efficient on how we use
that channel. And it works out really well for both us and our distributor partners. So we feel very good about where
that level is overall. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess a question for me, I think the lower depreciation
helped you guys on the gross margins about 130 basis points year-over-year at least. Do you think that magnitude can
sustain throughout calendar 2016 or should we think about depreciation dollars being more or less flat from these
levels?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yes Amit, I made the comment a few minutes ago that the rate of depreciation decline that we
have seen over the past year will slow down meaningfully as we go into 2016. Recall that from a capital spending
standpoint, our model is to spend about 4% of our revenues on CapEx, which we have been doing for the last couple

years and we expect to continue this year. Our depreciation runs more than 4%, so clearly they will have to converge at
some point. Our depreciable life on most of our equipment is five years and you may recall that it was about five years
ago when we brought on several new factories, one in [ph] Izu, (37:40); equipment that we brought into our fab here in
the Dallas area and a factory we bought in China. And so we're seeing those depreciation curves roll down now. So the
rate of decline that we saw over the last few quarters this past year will slow down, although it will still decline as we
go into 2016.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. And if I could just follow up, I think you guys have about $1 billion of debt that's due
in the month of May. Is the thought process to just pay that off with cash on hand or roll it forward, and what would
that implication have for your interest expense line as you go forward?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well if we pay it off, the interest expense will clearly decline, but I expect that we'll probably
do what we've done similarly in the last couple of cycles on this, where we have, if the interest rates are favorable by
the time we go back into the market, we'll likely pay off a portion and roll the balance into a new issue. In either case,
whether we pay off the entire amount or just pay off a portion and roll over the balance, I would expect interest costs
will decline by several million dollars a quarter.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay, thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Please go ahead, Tore Svanberg. Your line is open.
<Q - Tore Svanberg>: Yes, thank you. So Silicon Valley Analog was up year-over-year and that – I mean that's better
than the industry, better than your peers. Was that mainly due to industrial and automotive strength or were there some
share gains or other things going on there?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, Tore, SVA does have a good exposure to both industrial and automotive, and that certainly
helped that business.
<Q - Tore Svanberg>: Okay. And as my follow-up for Kevin, Kevin, do you have a CapEx number for us for this
year, or should we just take 4% of whatever revenue we come up with?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, keep it simple. Just take 4% of your expected revenue number and you're going to be
pretty close to what we're spending.
<Q - Tore Svanberg>: All right, sounds good. Great job, guys. Thank you.

And we'll go next to the line of Ambrish Srivastava. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi, thank you. I had a question on the automotive business, Dave. We haven't talked
about the momentum that you guys seem to be witnessing here. Big sizable business, bigger than your peers, and
year-after-year just like the rest of the business, it's boring, but it grows. So the question I had was, where are the new
opportunities that you guys are now designed in, if we were to look at where automotive for TI was, let's say, a couple
of years ago? So what should we be thinking over the next couple of years? Thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure, Ambrish. Yeah, the automotive business that we're building continues to be very, very broad
based. So we've got strong participation in both Analog as well as Embedded. Inside of Embedded, we've got both
processors and micro-controllers, as well as even some connectivity designs inside of that business. From an Analog
standpoint, it actually is very, very broad based and one of the things that we've been focused on is broadening the

number of business units that the company participates in in Automotive. And I think if you went back five, ten years
ago, we might have had one or two business units participating in that marketplace. And today out of our 70 or so
different business units, I think over half of them actually ship products into that marketplace. So it's a very, very broad
base.
We've got five what we call sectors that make up the automotive market. And again, the largest one is not more than
mid single digits as a percentage of our revenue last year. So the five segments are infotainment and cluster, passive
safety, advanced driver assist systems or ADAS as it's known, body electronics which also includes lighting, and then
the hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain. So we've seen growth across all of those sectors, very, very robust growth in
a very broad way. So you have a follow on, Ambrish?
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: No, that was it for me, Dave, thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay, and operator, we've got time for one more caller.
Operator
Okay. We will take our final question from the line of William Stein. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - William Stein>: Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, around the middle of last year, I think was the first
time you highlighted the potential for a 10% customer. And maybe we've been sort of dancing around this point, but I
wonder if you expect that that customer will repeat a similar magnitude in this year.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, that's a projection that I won't make on today's call. I think that they and all of our customers,
we've got teams that work very, very hard to get products designed into. And with that largest customer, as we talked
about before, we sell them hundreds of products. We participate in all of their major platforms, and of course the
revenue would always be skewed to where they ship their products. And I think they publicly report that about
two-thirds of their revenues would be in phones. So our revenues will mirror those types of shipments.
So we've got good growth in automotive. We're seeing strengthening, and broad strengthening inside of industrial, and
so that's a trend. We'll see how those trends continue for the balance of the year. There's a lot of time between now and
the end of the year. And then we'll see what happens inside of personal electronics as well. So do you have a follow up,
Will?
<Q - William Stein>: Yeah, one on capacity if I can. I'm wondering if you acquired any capacity as you do
periodically, and if there's any update on the planned fab closure in Scotland.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Will, I'll go ahead and answer that one. We continue to acquire capacity. No new
factories here lately, but we do continue to pick up equipment that was quite expensive new for pretty good prices
when you buy them the way we buy them. As it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland, just as a reminder we
expect that factory will not close before the end of 2018. As has been with other factories in the past, when we close
those things it usually takes a couple of years. As you slowly do lifetime builds on the inventory and on certain other
parts of those factories, you'll re-qual into other existing factories. And that's just a multi-year effort. So it's progressing
as planned, and we again don't expect it to actually complete until about the end of 2018.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay, thank you very much, Will.
David Pahl
