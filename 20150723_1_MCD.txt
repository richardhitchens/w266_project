Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In May, I shared the initial steps we're taking to fundamentally reset
McDonald's business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we've made since then.
Our turnaround plan represents a significant step change in McDonald's and establishes the foundation for our
transformation as we work toward becoming a modern progressive burger company. Our number one priority is to
return critical markets to sustainable growth by regaining customers' trust and loyalty. These efforts must be led by the
markets. Local management and franchisees working together to deliver what people want from McDonald's: great
tasting, quality food at a value delivered with better service each and every time they visit.
Our focus over the last several months has been execution, transformation and challenging the organization to evolve
more quickly. Taking bold steps to change the way we think and operate, starting first with our structure. We've made a
fundamental shift in the way our business is organized effective July 1 to eliminate redundancies, maximize talent, and
create a greater sense of urgency amongst company and operator leadership staff, as well as with our suppliers.
This restructure arguably represented the biggest organizational change in our history. Yet, from inception to execution,
we completed it in just two months. It required significant change inside the company and we're already realizing some
of the benefits. Stronger discipline, sharper customer focus, and more acute sense of urgency, and a deeper
understanding of what legacy thinking and actions to challenge and how.
For example, market teams in Australia and Hong Kong have recognized and acted upon the need to offer greater
choice and personalization with our hallmark product, burgers. They are aggressively deploying elements of experience
in the future and seeing encouraging results. And in Germany, our brand relaunch highlighting new taste and a better
overall restaurant experience is giving customers reasons to think differently about McDonald's.
We've also recruited fresh outside perspectives as part of this restructure. Our new Chief Communications Officer,
Robert Gibbs, and Chief Marketing Officer, Silvia Lagnado, are high respected, talented leaders who will bring a
wealth of experience and outside perspective.
The next several months are about taking further action and reasserting our leadership. We must operate better
restaurants. That's why we are recommitting to operations excellence which, frankly, has been lacking in some markets.
Simply speaking, we need to be better at serving hot, fresh food, providing fast and friendly service in a contemporary
restaurant at the value of McDonald's.
Today, I'll highlight the steps we're taking and the progress we've made. While financial results remain disappointing in
the second quarter, we are seeing early signs of momentum. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect positive
global comparable sales led by growth in our newly created international lead market segment and China's continuing
recovery in the 2014 APMEA supplier issue.
Before we turn to the U.S., let me briefly highlight the progress we're making in some of our most significant markets
around the world. I'm energized about the actions our markets are taking and the impact they have on results. As we
translate our progress into the context of our new organizational structure, I can say with confidence that the
international lead market segments which represents approximately 40% of our business is moving in the right
direction. Australia, Canada and the U.K. continue to deliver strong performance. Germany is starting to turn and
France is gaining share despite the challenging headwinds. This segment will be a strong catalyst for our business.
Let's start with Australia. When June marked 10 consecutive months of positive comparable sales and guest counts.
The business has turned in Australia and the market is focused on sustaining positive performance. The combined
solutions deployed last year such as relaunching everyday value with the loose change menu and offering customers
barista crafted McCafé beverage in the drive-thru, established the foundation and Australia has successfully layered on
incremental initiatives to sustain that growth. Value breakfast was introduced earlier this year, and we began national
advertising for Create Your Taste customized burgers as part of our efforts to develop the customer experience in the
future.
The U.K. also continues to grow with 37 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales performance. Multiple
initiatives contributed to growth and market share gains across all dayparts. For example, we gave customers more

reasons to visit our restaurants by featuring premium products such as the Chicken Legend and Big Tasty and through
effective marketing and promotional efforts including monopoly.
Strong growth in breakfast was fueled by the market's first ever promotional breakfast item, the sausage and bacon
sandwich. And the team is improving the service experience by aggressively deploying experience of the future. 150
restaurants have been converted so far and plans are in place to double that number by the end of 2015.
Let's now shift to Canada, where positive comparable sales performance continues. The team is driving growth by
focusing on convenience, including the ongoing roll-out of dual-lane drive-thrus which improve the speed of service
for customers, particularly during our busiest times. The market is also benefiting from strong breakfast growth,
building upon a successful free coffee offer earlier this year, along with additional enhancements of the core menu
including new salads.
We're also seeing signs of progress in Germany. This was the market's first quarter of positive comparable sales since
the second quarter 2012. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to improve the taste and variety of core and
premium products such as the new premium Bacon Clubhouse range and the World Culture promotion, that feature
locally sourced and seasonal ingredients.
And I'm excited to announce today – about the announcement today of our developmental licensee agreements with
Autobahn Tank & Rast. This agreement gives us the opportunity to develop more than 100 new sites in fuel and service
stations across the lucrative motorway service station network in Germany with no capital investment required by
McDonald's. The first new restaurants we expected to open this year with the majority opening between 2016 and
2019.
Moving to China, one of our high-growth markets, recovery continues from last year's supplier issue. Comparable sales
remain negative with the second quarter at minus 3%. However, the top five cities, which represent about 50% of sales,
are leading the recovery effort with flat comparable sales for the quarter. Lower tier cities are not recovering as quickly,
driven primarily by weaker macro economic conditions in those outlying areas.
China is strengthening everyday value with a specific focus on the mid-tier price points, continuing to enhance
convenience for our customers through delivery and kiosks and elevating the quality perceptions of our burgers by
piloting customization through experience of the future.
We're on track to return to a normalized level of performance in China for the second half of the year. In fact, prior to
the anniversary of last year APMEA supplier issue, the market has already returned to positive comparative sales
performance in the first part of this month.
Let's now transition to the U.S., which represents over 40% of our business. Results here have been disappointing.
We're committed to changing the trajectory of the business and arresting the nearly three years of decline. We're
working to put more discipline back into the business, adapt more quickly to changing trends, offer more compelling
value across the menu, and bringing new energy and tenacity to simply running better restaurants.
The localized structure implemented earlier this year was an important first step. It's designed to liberate market teams
to be more responsive to local consumers and we're seeing pockets of success. The northwest region, for example, was
the country's top performing region in 2014, and continues to generate positive results year-to-date June. A strong
restaurant operations culture, coupled with aggressive promotions, like any size soft drink or coffee for a dollar, is
generating incremental traffic.
The Heartland region, which includes Kansas City, is also delivering comparable sales and guest count performance
above U.S. averages. There, a heavy breakfast focus, coupled with a modernized restaurant base has fueled momentum.
And Boston, which is coming back from the worst winter in its history, has deployed a combination of regional
products like the lobster roll, a $2.99 Happy Meal to attract families, and beverage value to drive sales and guest
counts.
The U.S. is focused on creating a better experience for customers by concentrating on value, service and menu. These
are not headline-grabbing moves, but they begin the return to running better restaurants.

So, first, getting back to winning on value. Having aligned with our franchisees on the need for national price-pointed
value platform, we're now making adjustments to our current offer for the rest of the summer. This includes better
marketing support and stronger coordination with local messages. We're also evaluating options for longer term
national value platform.
Next, we're enhancing the customer service experience. This starts with the basics. We've reduced the number of menu
items in restaurants to make it easier for teams to deliver better service. We're improving the speed of our drive-thrus
with simplified menu boards that cut the number of items displayed by about a third, yet still highlight the items that
deliver 80% or more of drive-thru sales. We're addressing order accuracy with new operational procedures and training
programs already in almost half of our restaurants. We're increasing the number of dual lane drive-thrus to deliver
faster service to our customers during the busiest times of the day.
And we'll be launching our mobile app in the U.S. in the third quarter. This is part of our global digital strategy that,
over time, is designed to streamline and improve the entire customer service experience. The initial version of the app
will make it easy for consumers to receive value when they choose McDonald's, through features like tailored offers
that are easy to redeem and rewards for regular purchases of their favorite McCafé beverages. And at the same time, the
team is already hard at work developing additional features to hasten the shift from mass communication to personal
one-to-one engagement with customers in the future.
And, finally, menu. It starts with our core products that define our brands. We've implemented new cooking methods in
our restaurant, toasting our buns longer, changing how we sear and grill our beef to deliver hotter, juicier sandwiches.
And we're looking to further improve performance during our most successful dayparts. For example, our all day
breakfast trials have gone well. So we've expanded those tests to better gauge customer response.
I believe we're making the right moves to begin to stabilize the U.S. business, but there is no silver bullet. No one move
will turn a business that's been in decline for nearly three years. And while recovery will be bumpy, I'm confident we're
moving in the right direction.
While our primary focus is on actions that will drive operating growth, we have also taken steps to unlock financial
value. On May 4th, we identified key areas of focus to unlock that financial value. In just two months, we've made
good progress toward all our targets, including G&A, refranchising and cash return. Kevin will provide more detail,
specific to those, in a moment.
In closing, I remain confident in the power of our brand and our network of franchisees, employees and suppliers to
capitalize on the growth opportunities before us. It's not enough to say that we want to be a modern progressive burger
company, consumers need to see us that way. Shifting deep-seated perceptions, the longer term proposition. It requires
us to move past legacy barriers and embrace behaviors of a true global leader.
We have made significant progress in a short amount of time. I'm confident the changes we are making are the right
ones and will position us to grow the business profitably for our system and our shareholders for the long-term. Thank
you, and I'll now turn it over to Kevin.

Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter
performance. Then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial
elements of our turnaround plan.
Let's begin by reviewing the major drivers of our second quarter results. Our overall financial performance continues to
be largely reflective of our top-line results. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 0.7%, reflecting
negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments with the largest impact coming from the U.S. and Japan.
For perspective, operating income for the quarter totaled $1.8 billion, down $127 million, or 6% in constant currencies.
The U.S. and Japan accounted for over 80% of the quarter's overall operating income decline.

With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our
franchise margins, which totaled $1.8 billion, a 2% increase in constant currencies. The growth in franchise margins
was driven primarily by restaurant expansion in Europe and strong comparable sales in Australia. Global company
operated margin dollars declined 8% in constant currencies to $665 million for the quarter, reflecting weakness across
our major geographic segments. The U.S., Russia, and China accounted for substantially all of the margin decline for
the quarter.
Second quarter cost pressures were relatively consistent with our expectations. In the U.S., labor costs increased
primarily due to planned minimum wage increases in several states and commodity costs rose approximately 1%
primarily due to higher beef prices.
Effective July 1st, U.S. company operated margins will also reflect our decisions to raise wages and provide paid time
off for employees at our company-operated restaurants, along with providing educational assistance for all restaurant
employees. We expect the total impact from these incremental labor costs to be approximately 200 basis points on U.S.
company-operated margins for the full year, further pressuring margins for the second half of 2015.
To help offset cost pressures throughout our P&L and remain in line with food inflation, we took a price increase at the
end of May. Our U.S. second quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, which remains below food away from
home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food away from home inflation for the full year remains
at 2% to 3%.
Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up about 2% in the second quarter. Our price increases in Europe
vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 1.5% year-over-year.
For the quarter we also reported nearly $50 million of other operating expense. Primarily due to $45 million of
severance charges in connection with the restructuring of our global operations. About half of these charges were
incurred within our corporate functions and the other half in Europe and APMEA as we move to a flatter, more nimble
organizational structure.
Moving down the P&L, it's worth noting our second quarter effective tax rate of 29.8%, which was helped by lowered
tax costs associated with the company's ongoing foreign cash repatriation. We continue to expect the full year tax rate
to be at the high end of our existing 31% to 33% range. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.26, which included a
significant negative impact of $0.13 from foreign currency.
Looking beyond the second quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind throughout 2015 as the U.S.
dollar remains strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. At these levels, we now expect foreign
currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.14 to $0.16 in the third quarter and about $0.45 for the full
year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Let me switch gears now for an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. In May, we announced our
intent to accelerate our cash return to shareholders in 2015. During second quarter, we returned $2.5 billion through
dividends and share repurchases. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through June to $3.9 billion, and we
remain on track to meet our target of $8 billion to $9 billion for the full year.
During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and increased overall debt by issuing $4.3 billion of
U.S. dollar and euro denominated medium term notes, with an average tenure of over ten years and an average interest
rate of just over 2%. Our overall philosophy on use of cash has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our
business to drive future growth. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long-term to investors
through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
As we execute the initial steps of our turnaround plan, we're actively evaluating our capital location decisions,
including our dividend, as part of our broader strategic planning process. As a result, we're targeting our annual
dividend announcement in November this year, a slight change in timing from our typical September update.
One of the key areas of focus for the turnaround is better leveraging our business model, including the benefits of
franchising. In conjunction with our goal to refranchise about 3500 restaurants by the end of 2018, and increase the

global franchise percentage to above 90%, we are already moving forward in several markets, including Taiwan, where
we recently announced our intent to pursue a developmental licensee structure.
Taiwan is a well-established market with more than 400 restaurants, the vast majority of which are company-operated.
While we're in the early stages of the process, the conversion of this market to a developmental license will mark a
meaningful step towards our overall refranchising goal.
The structural changes to our organization and our ownership mix not only better position us for future growth, they
will also deliver savings to our bottom line. Earlier this month, we made important changes in our corporate and
segment support teams, which included the elimination of some international and home office positions. While these
types of changes are never easy, they were right for the business and will result in a leaner, more agile organization that
can better respond to market conditions and, most importantly, our customers.
The rapid execution of these resourcing decisions is an example of our sense of urgency to reset our business and
change the trajectory of our financial performance. When we shared the initial details of our turnaround plan in May,
we established a target to achieve $300 million of net annual G&A savings. We expect to achieve about half of those
overall savings by the end of next year with the remainder realized by the end of 2017. Our planned refranchising
activity is contributing toward these G&A savings, due to the less resource-intensive support structure inherent in a
more heavily franchised model.
Importantly, we are not stopping there. We're moving to the next phase of our analysis relative to each of the financial
areas of opportunity, including ownership strategies, asset optimization and overall spending. We plan to provide an
update on all of these areas at the November investor meeting.
The July 1st reorganization of our business into the new segment structure is an important first step in our global
turnaround. In conjunction with these changes, we will be providing recast financial information that reflects results
under this new structure. We expect to furnish our recast summary financial information toward the end of third quarter
for the years 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details will be provided for 2014 and year-to-date June 2015.
In closing, let me reiterate that we are fundamentally shifting the way we operate and approach our business to get back
in step with consumers. McDonald's success has always been fueled by outstanding operations, compelling marketing,
and great tasting food. We operate under a unique business model that benefits from a highly collaborative relationship
among the company, independent franchisees, and third party suppliers, all who take pride in their businesses. We need
all of these elements working together to provide a world-class experience that makes our customers feel welcome and
valued.
Our turnaround plan is designed to fortify these fundamental cornerstones of our business. And our operational growth
led turnaround will also be supported by a comprehensive approach to financial management that's focused on driving
value for our system and our shareholders today and into the future.
Thanks and now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.
Q&A
<A - Chris Stent>: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator
Instructions] The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Thank you very much. Good morning. The question here, Steve, you talked about the early
signs of momentum now with the second quarter results behind you. You pointed to the fact that you expect positive
comparable sales on a global basis in the third quarter. How much of this improvement you are seeing is really the
comparison ease in Asia and the better trends in Europe versus any core improvements that you are now seeing since
the second quarter in the U.S. sales trend, if any? And I do have a follow-up on that if you do not mind.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Sure. So, first of all, one important context to put within my comments about it being
a positive global comparable sales quarter. Even without the impact and the bounce back from the supplier issue in

APMEA, we would be projecting a positive quarter. So, there is strength in the underlying, like for like sales growth
independent of that. Now, that bounce-back further supports it.
We are seeing it more across international lead markets, which isn't just Europe. Yeah, we're seeing that collective
group of France, Germany, U.K., Canada, and Australia are gathering momentum as a collective group, which is great.
The U.S. – what we're working hard to do is minimize – currently the U.S. is a little bit of a drag. We're looking just to
narrow that gap and return that business to growth. But we're not putting in anything significant for growth at all in the
third quarter, but we're working hard towards getting it by the end of the year.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Okay, and – am I still with you?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yes.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Just to follow up on that, obviously value, service, and menu are the headline drivers for the
U.S. going forward, and, obviously, a lot of moving pieces underneath that hood. But, I just want to ask on the value
piece, what is – you talked about a longer term national value platform that you're thinking about. What are you
thinking about in terms of that? Any color you can put on that, and maybe when we could really see it be implemented?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, that's right and, as you know, the owner-operators and the management team
came together and recognized the need for a national value offer across this summer. I think that's further emphasized
and cemented all their minds that the idea of national value going forward is a positive thing. The $2.50 deal is not the
answer, but that's certainly been helpful in this immediate term and, therefore, the owner-operator group have already
tasked themselves, actually, to come up with something they feel would be strong right across the country to benefit
everyone's business, whether it's in the northeast or the southwest. And we'll share more news when it comes, but it
won't be in the immediate term, but it will fill an important role for us as certainly, as we look through 2016.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Karen F. Short>: Hi. I guess, just following on that question. I mean, obviously, we know you rolled out the
$2.50 value meal in mid-June and, obviously, the simplified drive-thru menu was fully implemented by early July. So, I
guess I am wondering could – they obviously wouldn't have had any impact on the second quarter results, but any color
you can give on how both of them are benefiting July? Or maybe just talk a little bit about the success or what your
thoughts are?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, well certainly both those decisions that have been taken have helped our
business. It took us a little bit of time to execute the $2.50 as well as we wanted, because having rolled that out, it's
begun to conflict a little bit with a lot of energy in the regions, where the regions were taking it upon themselves to
drive value on a local level. So, we spent a little bit of time, the first two or three weeks just tidying that up, getting our
execution better in the restaurants and our marketing execution support for it. And we expect certainly a greater
contribution through the rest of the summer.
For the drive-thru menu boards, unequivocally positive from a consumer perspective and also from a – for the
restaurants, for the teams to deliver better service. So again, neither of them are going to be seismic changes to the
trajectory to our business. They're both positive moves and we're working hard and executing them both and they will
certainly both contribute to rebuilding some momentum through quarter three.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Andrew M. Charles>: Great. Thank you. The Australia turnaround is a few steps ahead of the U.S. with a similar
playbook between the two markets. Can you help us size up the difference between the two starting points? Was the
sales weakness in Australia as prolonged and as extreme as the U.S. currently is? And then I have a follow-up on that
as well.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: I would say by and large it wasn't far off, yes. What we've seen in turnarounds in all of
our markets, whenever we faced a turnaround situation, we've slightly taken our eye off the ball, the competition have
moved a little quicker than we have, we've lost the value foothold that's so important to our business. And we haven't

created compelling, energetic plans with our operators in a way that we like to do when we're going full throttle. So the
similarities heading into the turnaround were somewhat similar.
What I would call out Australia for, incredible credit to the team and the owner-operators there, is the pace with which
they've moved once they've galvanized themselves to get around big initiatives. They've gone for a small number of big
moves and they've gone quickly and they've gone together. And that's created visible change in the restaurants, visible
benefits to consumers and the traction is very, very encouraging.
And, by the way, with the new structure we have, with effectively six global major global markets. Our ability to
transfer that knowledge from market to market is that much quicker, so I know Mike Andres and the team and the other
operators in the U.S. are very familiar with the U.S., sorry, with the Australia story, with the U.K. turnaround story,
with what the German team have been doing and they will steal shamelessly and adapt it to local market.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you. I have two questions in different directions. First, Steve or Kevin, as
you're reviewing the next phase of the financial moves that you've made and plan to update us at the November
meeting. Does the real estate factor into that? Is that part of that analysis and part of what you might address one way or
the other in November?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, Joe it's Kevin. We're looking at everything, I'd say kind of the three components I talked
about, the ownership strategy, the asset optimization and cost structures. We're kind of going through deeper analyses
of each of those, and so you should expect to hear an update on all those components in November.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thanks. Steve you talked about, again, value, service and menu and when you were talking
about menu you mentioned all-day breakfast and the tests that are continuing there. But when we look across the
landscape of QSR's, there's a lot of new product news, really buzzy interesting stuff, not always operationally complex,
but just good new product news. And that really wasn't a part of the conversation today when you were going through
the menu piece. How do we think about new product innovation at the regionalized level? Can you give us an update
on that, please? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: No, it's a really good question, Keith. I think the thing I'm most excited about with
regards to the, if you like the new menu news, is the fact the energy is going into revitalizing our core menu and that
should not be lost. I mean, when we sit here and assess how can you make the biggest difference to the most customers
in the shortest space of time, improving our core menu and our delivery of the core menu is clearly the way to go. So I
don't want to lose sight of the fact that toasting of buns, better searing of beef, taking care of the dressings and the
packaging and the rest of it, that gets noticed by customers.
With regards to [indiscernible] (34:25) if you like new product development, I would say at a national level we'll be
looking at, if you like quality over quantity. It's not about having lots of national LTOs, because that does complicates
the business. It gets confusing to message right. So we would be looking at fewer higher impact items going out and
our team with Chef Dan and his team are working hard on that and then you'll also see the localize options, I called out
the lobster roll in Boston, for example, that could be much more nimble, shorter term, relative to the local consumer
demographic in taste and flavors. So I think you'll see the two levels. There will be not a frenzied activity. It will be a
calm, measured and higher impact, with fewer items national. And then, locally, there will be some energy, on the local
basis. But don't miss out – honestly, don't miss out the benefit of continually improving our core menu as well.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. I was just wondering if you could dig into reasons, examples why you're excited
about international lead markets accelerating into the second half, Are there specific examples of countries that are
picking up momentum or platform innovation that you're excited about? Like for instance, I think you were talking
about Australia being one of the early ones to pull out Create Your Taste. But the more texture, the better, as far as
what you're seeing in these markets. Thanks.

<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yes, I think, it's a great question, David. As you look at the five lead markets, first of
all, really strong local management teams and strong alignment with the operators is a consistency across all five. That
is a fantastic foundation. But there are peculiarities and merits amongst each and every one of them. If you go to
France, the advancements they've made with technology, for example, and how they have totally reappraised the
customer journey is fantastic to see.
So let me be specific. They now have self-order kiosks in all of their restaurants. They're taking upward of 40% of the
transactions, through the busy hours, through the self-order kiosks. And the reason that's exciting is probably three
reasons, I guess. One, for the first time, we gave customers a choice and they just welcome choice. Two, it takes some
of the stress away from the front counter and, therefore, you divide some of the pressure, some of the load during the
busiest times. And three, from a commercial perspective, we see higher average checks because customers spend little
time ordering, they can browse the menu for a little bit longer, feel a little less pressure, and they just tend to spend
more.
So, we're getting a lot of learns from that. If you go to Germany, for example, which is earlier stages of a turnaround,
the brand has got its mojo back. And when you do that, you start to attract attention for all the right reasons. The new
agreement we just reached, development license agreement, with Tank & Rast, is a fantastic agreement for us, because
if anyone knows the travel infrastructure, the transport infrastructure in Germany, you'll know that Autobahns play a
huge role. That's how people typically get from city to city. And, therefore, to have roadside presence in up to 100 sites
– effectively for no capital from our perspective, that's what happens when a brand and a market gets its mojo back.
You sort of attract the sort of partners that you want to be doing business with.
Australia are progressing. Essentially, they've become our lead market in what we call Create Your Taste. Now, all of
our markets are building out the broader umbrella, which is called Experience of the Future. Many components of that.
There is technology, there's digital menu boards, there's new service procedures, there's self-order kiosks, and
customizable personalization of food.
The Create Your Taste route that the Australian team have gone down, they've rolled out market-wide in little over six
or seven months, to a level where they can nationally advertise it. We're going to learn a lot of how that works. It's an
in-store solution currently. Can we drive traffic in store? Can we increase dwell time? Can we – does the table service
that goes along with that matter to customers? And our ability and our visibility from market to market on each of these
initiatives. I believe that is when McDonald's is at its best. When we have test sell actively pushing the boundaries, and
when something works, we can then transport it from market to market, at pace.
And, again, I don't want to minimize the – a number of things the U.S. team are working on. I mean, the U.S. is our
lead market for the mobile app. Now, we recognize we're a little behind some others, whether it's in our sector or in
broader retail, but when we put our mind to things, we're one of the best execution companies in the world. The U.S.
will start with an app with fairly modest capabilities, but the infrastructure is built so we can add to it and transfer it
from market to market, at pace, So, that is where I guess my energy and my confidence comes from, is that kind of
collective momentum, and you start to spur each other on.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.
<Q - Matthew James DiFrisco>: Thank you. Question is a little bit more on a modeling question with respect to an
update on your outlook for refranchising and selling the company-owned stores. I was wondering, what are the early
indications or side lines that you might have, with respect to what type of EBITDA impact it might have, as we look
out sort of two years from now? How much EBITDA are you basically taking off of your books? Or is it pretty much a
good substitute where we'd suspect that the stores you're selling could garner a similar rent and royalty structure than
the existing 82% of your worldwide base of franchisees?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, hey, Matt, let me talk real quickly about the refranchising. As you know, there's a lot of
kind of different things that go into that. So, the strategy and timing will probably vary across our different segments
and even within markets. Some markets will be completely franchised or converted to a developmental license, while
others will just have more conventional franchising. So, it's a difficult to estimate exact timing or exact financial

implications of each of those. As you can imagine, these are long-term decisions that we're making generally for at
least 20 years or so, with the right licensees and operators. So, it's important we get this right. And we'll save G&A and
capital as we do this. We'll certainly get a little bit more stable revenue stream. On an EBITDA basis, it'd be difficult to
generalize on what that means in total for the company, because it's going to be pretty lumpy over the next couple of
years, as we have specific transactions getting there.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi, good morning. Steve, I have a question about the U.S. business and the overall strategy
there. I think one of the key pillars of your turnaround strategy was to get more focused and reduce some of the
complexity and improve business at the core. And I think you even referenced that earlier in the call here. But at the
same time, we're seeing messages about all day breakfast and things that sound fairly complex. So, could you help
reconcile that with the overall strategy? It seems like there's complexity being added in some places when you're
thinking about reducing complexity in others.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: No, it's a perfect question, David. And I'd love to address that. So, as we explore
different initiatives to drive the business, clearly, all day breakfast is one of those. So, initially, the owner-operator
group, they took a fairly pioneering approach down in San Diego. And, actually, I was fortunate. I went down to visit
them just two or three weeks ago and spent time with the operators and their restaurants, understanding what it really
meant. So, we're trying to prove out and are proving out the consumer business case, the consumer demand for all day
breakfast.
But, to your point, you can't talk simplification and add to the meantime, what we're working on is are there multiple
ways to reduce complexity and streamline the job for our restaurant managers, enable them to be able to accommodate
this. So, what we want to do – and people say, "Why can't you move faster with all day breakfast?", for example. There
are a number of moving parts to this. So, what we're going to need to do is, A, prove out the consumer facing business
case, but also come up with parallel tracking work, such that the net impact is net simplification.
Adding one thing and taking one thing off is not simplification. So, what we want to do is simplify the operation in
sufficient other ways that even if we were to go with an all day breakfast, that the net impact on the restaurant is one of
simplification.
So, let me give you some ideas around that and what that really means. Some of that is around simplifying the menu,
go deeper into some of the rationalization, taking some items off. There are other ways of doing it than just the menu.
Operational procedures. We got a team with operators and some of our experts in our national operations team here in
the U.S., looking at other procedures that we can simplify in a restaurant, whether it's way we assemble menu items,
whether it's the way we have the packaging laid out, whether it's the way we use technology to be able to get orders to
the back of the kitchen. Just to take out steps and workload. We also have ideas just around the entire process of how
do we reduce the amount of noise, well intended noise that goes into a restaurant that managers have to deal with
[audio gap] (44:44) on service and facing the customer.
So, when you put all those work streams together and if we were to build a compelling business case that we – if we
were to believe all day breakfast is a sufficient sales driver, that it's worth making other complementary changes on
simplification, the net-net has to be simplification and it will only be upon that basis that we would be moving forward.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John Glass>: Thanks very much. Kevin, I'm just trying to understand – if you imagine the scenarios you – would
cause you to reevaluate the dividend policy in some way. Either there may be a negative scenario under which you'd
look at the payout ratio and say it's getting too high and you need to bring that back into line, or perhaps just like a
positive scenario where you're thinking the different cash flows that support that dividend that maybe dividing those up
among different entities. Could you at least provide us some direction in what way you're thinking about it. Is it a
positive event, a negative event because I think it's so important and critical to the investor based on your stock?

<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, John, as we think about all these financial areas, so the refranchising, the looking at
G&A, the ownership structures and kind of our whole strategic planning process that includes capital and how much
capital we'll be spending in the future, et cetera. All of these things become pretty interconnected, as you can imagine.
So our thought is we need to have the right view on all of these things together and talk about them in total as kind of
the whole picture. And so we'll have that whole picture for everyone in November as we go through our strategic
planning process, get a better view into capital and have a better view on all these other financial areas also.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: And I'd add – just add to that, John, as well that when we were a little bit of a pivot
point at the moment where we believe we're seeing some early stages of momentum, and if we were just to have an
extra couple of months of trading under our belt as well, that would also just give us another variable to put into that
equation as well. It's important to us, we are paying very acute attention to our trading performance momentum market
by market, particularly those major markets. And again, they all contribute to the underlying assumptions that help us
make the right decisions for the business and for the shareholders.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Karen Holthouse at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi, thank you for taking the question. If you look at regions that have seen called earlier
signs of momentum and are now – momentum that you're building on whether it's the U.K., Australia, when you look
at consumer metrics that were leading indicators of that, what were the ones that were most closely tied to then sales
accelerating and where do you see those metrics in the U.S. today?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: I would answer and I hope I'm answering your question the right way, Karen. What
we have done since the structure has been implemented is really identify, rather than try and have generic U.S.-wide
consumer metrics, is to fuel the regions with that type of information and insight for them to make sharper decisions.
So in some areas there is a stronger economic recovery than others. In others the competition is different. So the
dynamics and demographics are different. So what we've been doing – and the markets where we've seen the greatest
success are those that are using those consumer insights and responding quickest to the needs of consumers and what
else is happening in the marketplace. And typically they have taken one or two bolder moves.
They've put themselves out there and they've decided to take a bit of a charge and take some risks and show the way.
And we will be transferring some of those learns from region to region over time. I would say probably similar
characteristics of the leading regions at the moment are those who are using, whether it's their disposable income
metrics, unemployment metrics, value for money metrics, their assessment of our day-to-day operation and are
responding to those and are building plans that address the things that matter most to customers.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the labor investments, if you will, that you're making in the
U.S. I think that's something we have heard from a lot of companies. It certainly seems like the competition for labor
has stepped up a little in addition to some of the regulatory changes, whether it's $15 minimum wage in some
municipalities or overtime requirements that go into effect. I guess, first I wanted to get a sense of whether what you're
doing now is meant to preempt some of these actual legal regulations.
And also what is the implication for your franchisees, which is a second part of that is broader, how are the franchisees'
profitability economics and your relationship with them? So, if you could talk about labor costs and the outlook and
then also maybe give us an update on franchisee economics and where they stand with respect to some of the initiatives
that you're taking on that side.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Okay, let me begin and I'll talk about some of the labor challenges and economics. And I'll let
Steve just talk about kind of labor – or franchisee relations in general.
As you talk about, Sara, there's certainly labor pressures around the world, from a wage standpoint. I don't know that
we think of it as kind of undue pressure or anything that's going to harm our business. But, certainly, labor costs are a
pressure right now. In several states as you know, minimum wage has increased.

For us, margins, essentially, are a top-line game, so we need to grow sales. Certainly, we need to grow comp sales in
order to grow margins. And the specific labor moves that we've taken are what we believe we should be doing as a
business to make sure that we attract, recruit and retain the best employees we can for our business. And so, we're
doing that. In our mind, as long as the playing field is level across industries, we believe we can compete competitively
in the long run. And so our hope is that any of the regulations or laws that come through deal with all the industries
similarly, and then we'll all have to deal with the same concerns.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, with regards to the franchisees, I mean, understandably, they're concerned. I
mean, as independent businessmen and women, they are facing cost headwinds anyway, which is just the nature of
doing business in an inflationary environment. And when there's way above inflation threats on wages, then that clearly
concerns them. That certainly impacts their confidence and willingness to invest over the long-term if there's that sort
of degree of uncertainty.
That's said and done, over our 60-year history, we've had surges in costs before. We tend to go back and realize that
what we have to do is it's a top-line game. So, we face into the reality. We play the hand we're dealt. We have the
franchisees who work with management and it just will force us to drive tougher plans, harder plans, more meaningful
plans, and drive the top-line and get that carried down to help mitigate what are some above inflationary headwinds for
us. But they are certainly anxious about it, totally understandably. It's an open conversation that we have with them,
and we just use that concern to try and fuel some energy around growing compelling plans, and just turning it into a
positive for us.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just following on the U.S. focus. I have, I guess, a
two-part question. One, I'm just hoping you could maybe rank order in the U.S., the categories, or day parts, or
products, in terms of what you think is the greatest driver of the recent U.S. market share loss. It would seem like that's
the goal here, we are doing more of your regional attack versus more national. But I'm wondering if you could
prioritize where you're seeing your greatest weakness versus perhaps the most resilient.
And then the other part was just, could you clarify the follow-up to that earlier question, in terms of the franchisees?
Just wondering whether – it seems like we're hearing more about the more challenging relationship, and I'm just
wondering whether there's any actions being considered to help support the franchisees during the difficult period.
Whatever that might mean or whatever form that might take?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, thanks, Jeff. So, in terms of less day part, if you look at our
product mix and where we've seen the loss and the competitive gap open up is, we've lost out the value end of our
menu. So, breakfast remains very resilient. So it's really through the daytime day part where we have seen that gap
open up. Over the last probably 12 to 18 to 24 months really. As we moved away from the dollar menu, we didn't
replace it with offers of an equivalent form of value. And customers have voted with their feet. And the team have
recognized that, and that's why we put the summer value driver in place, and are working on a longer term or ongoing
platform.
In terms of relations, the owner-operators are an incredibly resilient group and they're fantastic to work with. We have
very open conversations with them. I know Mike Andres and his leadership team in the U.S. and the owner-operator
leadership team is spending more time together at the moment than ever, which is what you do as you start to rebuild
the business plans and drive some growth.
One thing that – and I had the opportunity and the fortune to spend some time with them as well. One thing that I have
absolutely wanted to make sure is really clear and evident to them is we will be willing to support the owner-operators
as they and the U.S. management team build compelling growth plans. This isn't about underpinning cost implications.
This is about – if you were to grow and invest in your businesses, we will do what we've always done, which is we'll
co-invest with them for growth. And that remains as true, if not more true, today than ever has done. And as they fill
those plans out and they finalize a lot of these tests that are in place at the moment, I look forward to co-investing with
them, it will be a great opportunity for us and it would demonstrate our support to them. And that gives the

owner-operators a huge amount of confidence, that we're here shoulder-to-shoulder with them. They're recognizing that
and we're building some exciting plans.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Jason West>: Yeah, thanks. Just, I guess, following up on that thought, Steve. Just can you talk about, as you're
trying to turn around the U.S. business and comparing it to some of the successes we're starting to see in other markets,
do you feel like the system needs some capital investments in the stores, whether it's equipment or menu boards or
things like that just to really – to get this turnaround moving? Or do you think we can do it without significant capital
investments?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: The initiatives we're working on, and Mike and the owner-operator leadership are
working on at the moment, are ones where I would say there is relatively modest investment needs. It's not the same as
rebuilding restaurants or dramatic refurbishments. I mean, there are some of our restaurants that do look tired and
independently, one by one, the owner-operator will make that decision for themselves and we'll support them on an
individual basis.
If we're looking at system-wide initiatives, we reckon it's an affordable investment level. It may involve some
technology investments, may involve some minor part equipment investments. And those are the sorts of things we'll
be co-investing with them. Because a lot of investments have already been made in the restaurant. They have invested
well and we believe the growth initiatives in this short to medium term are certainly not going to be of the order of
quantitative initiatives in the past.
<A - Chris Stent>: We have time for one more question from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: The question is on the U.S, once again. Just thinking about the drive-thru menu
redesign where I think a third of the menu items came off. Why not go further and really highlight that 20% or
whatever it is on the menu, that has the most turn to presumably increase throughput. And I ask this and kind of a
broader question is do you think the U.S. is in a position from a brand perspective or a customer perspective where the
in-store brand experience and the drive-thru brand experience can actually be split up? And clearly I'm asking a leading
question regarding the potential success of Create Your Taste in the United States as presumably you're seeing some
signs of it in Australia.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: So can we go further on the drive-thru menu board in terms of price elimination? I
think the answer is yes. And as we are exploring other platforms of growth, new items introduced, I think you'll see us
go a little deeper in terms of the menu rationalization. Whether that's just taken off the menu board and the
merchandising or actually taken out off the menu entirely I think you'll see a bit of both actually. So I think there's
further to go, and as a team we're looking at that as we speak.
In terms of the drive-thru versus in-store, I think the important piece to recognize is less, the Create Your Taste element
and having that in store is more where you place technology to offer a better experience for the customer. So if you're
going to introduce self-order kiosks clearly that's going to create a very different environment in-store. You're not
going to have a self-order kiosk for drive-thru but you maybe ought to have order ahead, you maybe have to use the
app and some of the technology we can introduce to that. I they will order ahead, get to your location, get recognized in
the drive-thru lane, it flies their order off to the back of the kitchen before they even have to place the order, so I think
technology will be a differentiator to give us different service models, but it will still be a McDonald's, they'll still
enjoy the McDonald's experience but just in different ways. So I think technology is a differentiator rather than a
different two-tier strategy.
Chris Stent
We're near the top of the hour, so I'll turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.
