Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Turning to slide four, in the first quarter, our
focus on execution and controlling what we could control produced strong results, despite a persistent challenging
macroeconomic environment.
We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.69, a 13% increase year-over-year. Strong local pricing actions
delivered a 1% overall increase in price. This is a strong achievement, given the deflationary environment that existed
late in the quarter in key commodity inputs.
Excluding Feedstocks and Energy, volume was flat, indicating share gains in key sectors as the year-on-year market
comparable was against a strong Q1 2012. Notably, we drove demand and share growth in emerging geographies,
particularly in Latin America.
Our Performance Plastics franchise delivered a very strong performance due to robust and positive U.S. feedstock
fundamentals and focused price discipline in Europe, where the market remains very soft.
Agricultural Sciences achieved record levels sales and EBITDA on healthy pharma demand and increasing sales of new
technologies. And equity earnings increased, due primarily to strong performance from our ethylene-based joint
ventures in Kuwait.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 10%, and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 170 basis points – a strong
outcome in the current environment. And we continued our intense focus on cash management, evidenced by a nearly
$500 million increase in cash flow from operations year-over-year. Finally, in line with our stated cash priorities, we
continue to deleverage, reducing gross debt just over $900 million in the period.
In sum, our results this quarter clearly illustrate the level of blocking and tackling and operational excellence with
which our executive team and business leaders are aggressively managing our businesses. Every member of our
leadership team is personally accountable for driving price and volume management, delivering our committed cost
reductions, optimizing cash-generation capabilities across our global asset grid, and prioritizing working capital and
capital expenditures. We are driving our total focus on cash, capital, and cost, with price maximization wherever we
can get it. All of this in a soft global environment.
As we enter the second quarter, we continue to make progress with strategic investments that enable us to capture
growth in our focused approach to end-user and geographic markets, while at the same time, aggressively managing
our portfolio. We are actively selecting out those units that are underperforming and deciding on their future, as well as
applying a best-owner mindset and discerning lens across the entire company.
I am confident we have the right plan in place to deliver near-term earnings growth and the right long-term catalysts to
reach our targets and drive sustainable value. I will have more to say on this in a moment, but first let me turn it over to
Bill for more detail on our financial and operating results in the quarter.
William H. Weideman
Thank you, Andrew. Let me begin by providing a financial summary on slide six. Dow reported earnings of $0.46 per
share or $0.69 per share excluding certain items. Certain items in the quarter totaled $0.23, which included a charge for
the early extinguishment of debt and implementation costs associated with our restructuring activities, as well as a

non-cash charge related to adjustments of uncertain tax positions.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA grew in the quarter, reflecting focused price and volume management, which brings
me to slide seven. Price momentum was strong in the first quarter, up 1%, despite a year-over-year decline in purchased
feedstock and energy costs. Local price increased in most operating segments. Importantly, we also delivered a 2%
price increase sequentially. We remain diligent in our price/volume discipline, and we will continue to keep a sharp
focus here going forward. Overall, volume was down 3%. Excluding feedstock and energy, volume was flat.
At a geographic level, volume was flat in North America, or up 4% excluding feedstock and energy. Volume grew in
Latin America due to strength in our Agricultural Sciences and Performance Plastics businesses. However, volume
declined in Europe.
Now moving to our operating performance on slide eight. Overall, we grew EBITDA and expanded margins, due in
large part to the price/volume management I just discussed. Another positive driver of performance was equity
earnings, which were up year-over-year due to gains in our Kuwait joint ventures.
In addition, we benefited from the impact of our previously announced restructuring actions. In total, we have already
shut down 17 sites, and the remainder are progressing according to schedule. In addition, our workforce-reduction
targets are tracking ahead of schedule. The savings from our restructuring actions will continue to ramp as we move
through the year.
Now turning to our operating segments, starting with Electronic and Functional Materials on slide nine. We saw a
modest increase in revenues as the segments continue to gain share and grow volume, offsetting modest price declines.
Dow Electronic Materials grew volume on strength within the semiconductor technology business. However, softness
across their broader electronics sector coupled with adverse currency impacts drove slightly lower pricing compared
with the year-ago period.
In Functional Materials, revenue increased across all geographic areas as the pharmaceutical sector demonstrated
renewed strength, and continued resiliency in the food and energy sectors further supported revenue growth in the
business.
Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions posted a sales decline due to lower volumes. In Dow Coating Materials, revenue
rose in agricultural coatings, primarily due to pricing initiatives. However, industrial coatings revenue was flat, as gains
in North America were offset by lower volumes in Europe. In addition, colder weather in the Northern Hemisphere in
early spring also impacted results. These same conditions also impacted building construction, where sales were down.
But I'd like to highlight that we are now beginning to see the benefit of our restructured actions and asset closures,
particularly in Europe. On a sequential basis, Dow Coating Materials grew both sales and earnings versus the previous
quarter.
Let me pause for a minute and discuss Dow Corning, where equity earnings were flat versus last year. Conditions have
stabilized as customers await the outcome of the MOFCOM ruling. We expect the current unfavorable conditions in the
polysilicon segment to persist, and we will continue to carefully monitor the dynamics in this value chain. If conditions
worsen, Dow Corning will take further restructuring actions as appropriate.
Now turning to Agricultural Sciences, which achieved a new sales record, surpassing $2 billion in revenue this quarter
and reflecting a third-straight year of double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. Crop protection showed continued
strong performance, with sales of new products up 12%. North America and Latin America both achieved double-digit
sales and volume growth versus the prior period. Seeds, Traits and Oils revenue grew an amazing 37%, continuing to
outpace the market. Strong volume gains in corn led by continued ramp-up of our SmartStax portfolio also drove
higher profitability.
Sales in Performance Materials declined due to lower volume, as we drove price increases and sequential margin
expansion in a volatile propylene environment. Polyurethanes achieved price increases on both a sequential and a
year-over-year basis, and epoxy increased margins sequentially due to price gains. In addition, we continue to improve
our competitive position by driving down costs where we are beginning to see the benefits of our restructuring actions.

Sales in Performance Plastics were $3.5 billion, down 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Here again, price
stewardship was the focus. And as a result, margins in this segment grew 720 basis points year-over-year. Margins also
grew on a sequential basis, up 470 basis points. Polyethylene gained pricing momentum throughout the quarter, leading
to margin improvement in every geography.
In Feedstocks and Energy, volumes declined primarily to a lighter feedstock slate mix in Europe, coupled with the
expiration of a sales contract related to divestiture of our polypropylene business last year. These factors contribute to
half of the overall company sales decline in Europe. This segment also benefited from higher equity earnings at
MEGlobal and EQUATE.
Before I turn it back over to Andrew, here are some insights into the second quarter. We expect Agricultural Sciences
will continue to post strong results, in line with normal seasonality. Planned-turnaround spending will be up
approximately $150 million sequentially, in line with last year. We expect customer buying patterns to remain cautious
in the current environment of falling commodity prices and economic uncertainty.
Our Performance Material franchise will see some cost relief, as propylene prices have declined, but we expect the
decrease in propylene cost will pressure pricing and customer buying patterns. You can expect our global tax rate to be
in the 28 to 30% range, as previously communicated.
U.S. housing continues its positive march from a very low base, and we expect an uptick in Coatings and infrastructure
solutions, in line with normal seasonality. And finally, in Performance Plastics, we expect profitability to remain strong
in the Americas, but expect industry margins to moderate in the second quarter as declining naptha pricing pressures
pricing, particularly in Europe. In addition, this segment will be impacted by a heavy turnaround schedule, as I just
mentioned.
And now I'd like to turn it back over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thanks, Bill. As you know, we've laid out clear plans to aggressively drive value growth. At a strategic level, our
actions are squarely focused on driving cash, cost, capital and pricing measures, with clear plans in each of our
businesses, improving our overall return on capital and reviewing our entire portfolio for strategic opportunities to
maximize and optimize value. Let me show you how, on slide 13. Our focus on ROC is critical in our decision-making
process, as it is the lens through which we are prioritizing investments and value-creation opportunities moving
forward.
For example, in Electronic and Functional Materials, Performance Plastics, and Agricultural Sciences, we continue to
invest for strategic value growth, as these businesses are exhibiting very strong underlying fundamentals in their
end-use markets, and Dow is very competitively advantaged. However, in our Coatings and Infrastructure and
Performance Materials segments, we recognize that there is still work to be done. I will share more on these actions in a
moment.
In addition to ROC improvement, we are applying a best-owner view of our entire portfolio to optimize shareholder
value. Turning to slide 14, for example, since 2009, we have divested non-core businesses representing about $8 billion
in revenue.
At our investor forum in December, we announced a near-term divestiture goal of $1 billion. And in March, we
accelerated this target, moving to $1.5 billion of proceeds within 18 months. This demonstrates our bias to achieve
more, sooner.
Here again, our actions are well under way. In the first quarter alone, we divested the stabilizers portion of our Plastics
Additives business. Announced an agreement to sell our 50% ownership in Nippon Unicar Company Limited, a
Japanese joint venture aligned with the Dow Electrical and Telecommunications business. We divested our 50%
ownership in Nichigo-Morton Company. We announced plans to sell our Plastics Additives business and shared our

intentions to divest the polypropylene licensing and catalyst business this year.
You should expect to see and hear more as we move through the year. We will be guided by ROC, and where we are
competitively advantaged in end-use markets and capabilities, we are investing. Where we are not, we have stopped or
slowed multiple projects: [ph] the subparticulate filter (16:08) program, our Dow Kokam investment, the sugar cane to
polyethylene project in Latin America and our coal-to-olefins project in China, just to name a few.
Turning to slide 15. We also continued to address ROC in underperforming businesses, shutting down assets that do not
have sustainable competitive advantage over the long-term, and reprioritizing R&D investments. For example, in
Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions, we have already shut down or idled five of six targeted assets, primarily tied to
deflated or nonexistent European construction markets. In fact, in 2013, we plan to reduce costs by $100 million, and
we will reduce capital expenditures across this portfolio, preferentially investing in high-return, quick-payback projects,
all with a focus on driving improved return on capital.
We are taking very specific, targeted actions to address total costs, as well as driving margin improvements through
price and maximizing the value of our integrated portfolio. From an equity-earnings perspective, we do not see
substantial further downside in this segment. Dow Corning's results seem to have stabilized, as pricing appears to have
bottomed. However, customer sentiment remains uncertain, pending the Chinese MOFCOM ruling, as Bill discussed.
We will continue to monitor this very closely. In total, Dow's short-term actions are expected to deliver a nearly
150-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margins for Coatings and Infrastructure.
Longer term, we are focusing on monetizing our innovation pipeline to generate new incremental EBITDA by
prioritizing growth investments in projects at or near commercialization. For example, in Dow Coating Materials, our
hiding technology platform is enabling paint producers to more efficiently use titanium dioxide to reduce costs or
improve performance. And in Dow Building Solutions, our new Polymeric Flame Retardant offers a more sustainable,
high-performing solution to insulation manufacturers, and is being globally produced and marketed through an
innovative licensing program.
Further, our PVH investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast will enhance propylene integration benefits across Coatings and
Infrastructure, and is expected to lift EBITDA margins by 150 basis points in this segment medium-term.
Turning to slide 16 and moving to Performance Materials, where here again, our approach is not one-size-fits-all. This
is segment includes businesses with high return on capital, and higher-than-normalized EBITDA margins.
However, we realize there's more work to be done. To that end, we continue to take purposeful actions to enhance ROC
by focusing on optimizing price and margin, and decreasing structural costs. Specifically, we are consolidating and
closing assets, particularly in European markets, where weak industry conditions persist. This includes the
consolidation of our Formulated Systems houses as well as reduction of our epoxy footprint.
In polyurethanes, we are taking strategic steps to upgrade our margins with the start-up of our propylene glycol facility
in Asia. We are also harnessing opportunities from growth in attractive businesses within this portfolio, leveraging our
integration advantage and technology differentiation to maximize returns. For example, in Dow Oil and Gas, strong
shale-gas dynamics are fueling opportunities for customer-focused, science-based growth.
Our Polyglycol Surfactants and Fluids business is well-positioned to provide customers with tailor-made solutions that
address specific customer needs in lubricant, [ph] flame or fluid (20:19), and agricultural sectors, to name a few.
Notably, both of these businesses achieved new quarterly EBITDA records.
And circling back to our ROC lens, we also remain squarely committed to continue the investments where Dow's
differentiation is rewarded, even in a soft macro environment, and where margin-growth opportunities are achievable.
Turning to slide 18, take, for example, our collective investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which remain a priority, as
they are purposely engineered to deliver on two fronts: enhancing integration advantage for our propylene derivative
businesses, and providing a robust platform from which to grow our specialty ethylene derivatives.

These investments are firmly on track. We successfully completed the first full quarter of operations with our St.
Charles ethylene cracker, which came online under-budget and on-time, and is now ramped up. We broke ground on
our new PDH unit in Texas. We continue to make progress on our de-bottlenecking project in Louisiana. And
engineering work is well under way for our new world-scale cracker and downstream units in Texas.
Positive disruptive trends in U.S. shale gas have led us to make different decisions about where and how we invest for
global growth. Our competitive U.S. Gulf Coast investments are projected to deliver $2 billion by 2017, and $2.5
billion when fully operational. And we are taking multiple steps to protect this profitability, not the least of which are
our activities on the policy front.
In addition, we are taking active measures to drive capital efficiency and improve the overall value of these projects. In
fact, the recently announced off-take agreement with Idemitsu and Mitsui for the new cracker at our Freeport facility is
a perfect illustration of Dow's commitment to invest in high-return projects that deliver advantaged feedstocks for our
downstream derivatives, while at the same time, building strategic partnerships to bolster the long-term profitability of
our investment.
Turning to slide 19, our Saudi project is also making excellent progress. And just last month, the joint venture launched
its Sukuk financing. The public offering received strong interest from Saudi's investment community, and closed this
month oversubscribed. The success of this Sukuk represents an important milestone in the overall collaborative efforts
we are undertaking with our partner to fund construction of this world-scale manufacturing complex.
This landmark joint venture remains on track. Construction is now more than 10% complete, with 17,000 workers on
site. And we remain fully on-schedule for the first production unit to launch in 2015, perfectly timed to take advantage
of the upcoming ethylene cycle. And it will be very profitable immediately upon start-up, with a positive impact to our
net-income line in year one.
Turning to slide 20, let me pause here and reinforce our view that a positive ethylene cycle is imminent. Our view is
that tightening ethylene balances are just ahead, and global industry operating rates will climb to enable a cyclical
run-up, driven by sustained high rates in the Americas and limited new capacity that will come online in this
timeframe, even assuming modest GDP improvements over these next few years.
This means a positive cycle will begin later this year or early next year. And we expect, therefore, a $2 billion EBITDA
uplift at peak margins. This is on top of the EBITDA from our U.S. Gulf Coast investments and our Saudi position.
Turning to slide 21, this approach of the cyclical peak will further expand already-healthy margins in our downstream
technology-differentiated derivative businesses. Case in point, our world-leading Performance Plastics franchise. Here
we are leveraging our integration benefit to fuel competitive advantage while simultaneously driving technology-based
growth.
In Dow Elastomers, our NORDEL IP Hydrocarbon Rubber technology is providing customers in transportation,
infrastructure, electrical, and telecommunications sectors with greater control and precision, enabling a higher-quality,
more-reliable product.
Our game-changing INFUSE Olefin Block Copolymers offer customers a solution with flexibility and
high-temperature resistance, and enables products with excellent elastic properties that are resistant to abrasion. Our
unique Hot Melt Adhesives AFFINITY GA portfolio provides enhanced color and thermal stability and higher
productivity for packaging and non-woven applications. And then there are our ELITE resins used in food packaging,
which enhance the functionality of high-performance sealants, reducing packaging thickness without sacrificing
toughness.
Performance Plastics is a perfect example of how we are leveraging customer relationships and market knowledge to
point Dow's technology engines directly at the industries our customers serve. One need only look to the more than 40
new product extensions launched last year alone in packaging to see how we are applying material-science expertise
and translating customer needs into innovative solutions that impact our bottom line.

Turning to slide 22, Performance Plastics is just one of several areas where Dow is perfectly positioned to meet the
needs of attractive, high-growth markets.
Another example is Electronic Materials where innovation is mandatory for survival and speed is rewarded. Here again,
we are working closely with our customers, investing in emerging technologies that enable lighter, brighter, more
efficient Electronics. We are unlocking the power of our deep material science and applications expertise, and
partnering with customers to ensure leading positions in winning areas.
Specifically in the OLED sector, our active-matrix materials offer brighter colors while conserving energy, making
smartphones brighter with longer battery life. And Dow's MICROFILL technology improves the reliability and
performance of the printed circuit board for portable devices by offering improved thermal connectivity. As a result,
about 40% of revenue in this business is from new products launched in the last five years.
Turning to slide 23 and our Agricultural Sciences portfolio, where we are achieving consistent record-breaking growth.
New products in our crop-protection portfolio grew nearly 20% versus 2011. These are completely novel molecules,
showcasing the power of Dow's R&D pipeline. We use our deep understanding of the market to anticipate farmer
needs, close customer relationships to respond to farmer needs, and then discover and commercialize solutions for these
needs.
Recall in 2008, we declared a goal of achieving $800 million in sales from new crop protection products. We made
strong gains towards that target in 2012, and with the ramp-up of sulfoxaflor and pyroxsulam, we have every
confidence that we will deliver on this commitment in 2013. Our Seeds, Traits and Oils portfolio is approaching $1.5
billion, and here our technology strength has enabled us to build a reputation for outperforming the market with 37%
growth just this quarter alone.
Earlier this month, we announced a cross-licensing agreement with Monsanto. This breakthrough agreement enables
next-generation SmartStax corn to stay ahead of the curve with additional insect protection, and expands our ability to
offer Enlist technology broadly to growers. And it cooperates what we have known for some time: Dow AgroSciences
is a technology powerhouse and a partner of choice.
Let me turn to slide 24 and to Dow's earnings trajectory where, as you can see, we are focused on ensuring an
aggressive offense, taking both strategic and growth actions as well as surgical measures across our portfolio by
delivering on our commitment to cash, costs, capital, and pricing measures; capitalizing on our industry-leading
feedstock advantages and positive U.S. shale gas dynamics, as well as taking advantage of the upcoming ethylene
cycle; driving the next decade of growth through our investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara in the Middle
East; and harnessing the power of our innovation portfolio.
In total, our EBITDA trajectory from a base of $7.7 billion – the last 12 months – to north of $10 billion – is already
being funded in our CapEx and expense plans. And we are confident that we have the projects and programs to deliver
this near-term earnings growth.
Turning to slide 25, as we take these deliberate steps to restore our earnings-growth trajectory and further improve our
cash flow, we are being very consistent in terms of how we will use this cash. First, paying down debt. We retired $900
million of gross debt during the quarter, and our interest expenses continue to decline.
Second, rewarding shareholders. In February, we announced a $1.5-billion share buyback program. And we remain
fervently committed to rewarding shareholders, evidenced by the fact that we have increased our dividend for two
consecutive years. As our earnings grow, you should expect our dividend to ramp-up further, maintaining our historic
payout ratio of 45 to 50%.
And third, funding prioritized organic-growth opportunities. I have said it before: we have more than enough growth
opportunities in our portfolio. We do not need M&A to achieve our goals.
Importantly, last quarter, we received the final award in the K-Dow arbitration, covering interest and costs, and now
totaling nearly $2.5 billion. Interest is accruing daily. And once payment is received, it will go directly to our balance
sheet.

Turning now to our outlook on slide 27. Last quarter, we told you that our business plans did not anticipate material
economic tailwinds materializing in 2013. We said we would plan 2013 as if it was a rerun of 2012. This has proven
appropriate, thus far.
However, we are seeing decent improvements in the United States as well as in Southeast Asia and Brazil. But China
has not seen strong market traction coming out of the Lunar New Year, and conditions in Europe remain very weak.
We have built this perspective into our plans, meaning we will continue to work the plan we laid out for you in 2012,
pulling every lever in our arsenal to drive ROC higher and ultimately deliver an ever-strengthening and growing
earnings performance.
But importantly, conditions do seem to be stabilizing in the global macro environment, which is a positive sign. And
we are increasingly confident that our management actions will continue to produce results for our shareholders.
Finally, while we are not counting on macroeconomic tailwinds, if these tailwinds resulted in higher growth, then that
would be additive to our previously shown and assumed base-case EBITDA and cash-generation trajectory.
On slide 28, let me assure you then. We have kept our focus on the work that needs to be done. These have been and
are difficult business conditions, and we worked hard to post these very good first-quarter results.
However, there is still more work to be done. And rest assured, we are doing it. We are tightly managing our
performance with metrics posted and tracked in operating meetings we hold every week, driving our targeted ROC
actions by managing costs, pushing price, and prioritizing investments.
We are, indeed, focused on cash, cost, capital and price, and maintaining a laser-like concentration on strategic
portfolio management, where we are addressing underperformers, investing for value growth, and applying a
best-owner mindset to every aspect of our portfolio.
With that, I will turn things back over to Doug for Q&A.

Thank you, Andrew. Now let's move to your questions. First, however, I'd like to remind you that my comments
regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the
following Q&A.
Nicole, would you please explain the Q&A procedure?

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
<A - Doug May>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Now, Andrew, overall, your price/volume strategy – it seems like you had the first positive
pricing quarter in a long time, but your volumes turned negative. So I guess was that a deliberate strategy? And what's
the risk?

Because many companies that have tried this, many times it has backfired on them, especially in a weak environment.
So I just was wondering if you can talk about that strategy.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. And so let me go backwards.
The volume point, actually – as I said on TV this morning – is something that is hidden in where the volume loss was.
Actually, it primarily reflects some end-of-sales agreements from our polypropylene divestiture year-on-year.
Therefore, the comparable on Feedstocks and Energy is not good because of that loss of those agreements as – we were
expecting it, of course. Plus, a lighter feed slate led to lower coal-product sales.
So it was less about losing volume based on price measures. That was mostly, therefore, in our Feedstocks and Energy
business.
Rest assured that we are watching very carefully price/volume trade-offs. And we believe that the ability to lead price
increases in a lot of our business was based on understanding where to maximize margin. There are some very
competitive assets that we have, where we can really play our low-cost position. But we also have to watch our
operating rates.
So yeah, that's a weekly tracking activity, P.J. We are very, very selective on how to get it done. And there are some
chains where price wasn't very responsive. But in the main, we got price where we needed to get it.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: And then secondly, if I look at your divestitures so far, they've been mostly in commodity areas.
Polypropylene, polystyerene, some technology there. Would you think of divesting any specialty assets that are
underperforming?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, with the announced list that we did in March, that Bill did at one of the conferences,
included a couple of specialties, plastic additives and polypropylene. So, for the first cut, polypropylene licensing is a
true high-margin specialty business. The plastic additive and polypropylene business is, therefore, a good performance
in the specialty portfolio. But we don't see them as strategic versus our other choices. And really that's our lens. It's
ROC and strategic choices.
Strategic choices are made on where we can actually be winners in end-use markets. Like Electronics, for example,
where we've got a little bit of M&A going on occasionally. AgroSciences, a little bit of M&A going on occasionally.
Portfolio managing, so we can grow where we need to grow. And if these are specialty businesses we can't grow, we
will divest them. So, yes, you can count on us doing more.

Our next question will come from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Good morning, Andrew. Hi there.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hey, Hassan.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: A question around – obviously, your volumes were very strong on the Latin American side
of things. And over the last couple days, there has been this tax reduction announcement, as it pertains to certain raw
materials for petrochemical producers out in Brazil. Now, how do you see that, if at all, sort of impacting trade flows
and the like going forward?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, as you know, our portfolio in Latin America – and the quarter showed this – the big
performers were AgroSciences, which has nothing to do with that particular point, and Performance Plastics, which has
a little to do with that point. But also remember that a bulk of our Performance Plastics in Latin America is from our
Argentinean asset, which is [ph] solutionally a (38:27) low-density polyethylene that goes into things like food
packaging.

We have customers, for example, [ph] multi-layer fills for (38:34) food packaging in Brazil. We just had a big win
where five of the six layers are our film, our plastic in that film. So very high in specialty. We don't see, therefore, the
down-draft from the commodity and petrochemical side as much as others because of the nature of our mix.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: And I'd also expect that being sort of mostly naptha-based producers out there. Sure, their
local competitiveness may – you know, it may boost sort of margins locally. But the delta between ethane and naptha is
so, so high that I wouldn't expect trade flows to be negatively impacted at all.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I wouldn't either, Hassan. Look, you can see that from a variety of different ways. [ph]
Browns is (39:14) wanting to invest in Mexico. Lots of Latin American producers coming up to the U.S. We've said
our assets in Texas and Louisiana are being built for U.S. demand. But if we export, some of it will go to the Americas
and, therefore, we will be advantaged, even with that point you're making.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: And a follow-up, if I may. On the polyurethane side of things, this you talked about some
pricing strength at the cost of volumes. But on a sequential basis, did you see an uptick in profitability?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: We did, sequentially on polyurethane, yes. And basically, the point that P.J. made, strong
block and tackling price/volume management. Our polyurethane and epoxy business has sequentially, and our Coatings
business, really improved based on exactly that point.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Thanks.

Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Doug May>: Good morning, Kevin.
<A - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Good morning. Question for you, Andrew, regarding your ethylene cycle outlook, and
specifically the $2 billion EBITDA uplift that you put forth. I'm wondering how much of that relates to or depends on a
scarcity-driven peak in the ethylene chain. It would seem at the moment that there's not a lot of help on the demand side
to get operating rates up. I think one of the industry-leading consultants has rates peaking out around 88. Do you
disagree with that? Do you think we'll go higher on operating rates? And, if so, how do we get there? Are you counting
on asset rationalization, for example?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: In the main, Kevin, the commentary is around a 2.5% to 3.5% global GDP growth rate
these next several years, with the early years, like this one, being closer to the 2.5% versus 3.5%. So look, that 2%
delta, we have it going into the 90s early next year, based on conservative GDP assumptions. Again, we can always go
south from there.
If you go south from 2.5% global GDP, you will get rationalizations. I think especially at – I've never seen a cash-cost
curve on ethylene as steep as this one. The Northeast Asians, the Southeast Asians and the Europeans are very
disadvantaged in a slow-growth economy or a no-growth economy. So there will be pressure if the GDP goes downside
from our assumptions. Our assumptions I think though are pretty solid and have the operating rates into the 90s next
year.
<A - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay. And then as a follow-up, if I may. Shifting gears to chlor-alkali. I was wondering if
you could provide us with sort of an operational update, but also some thoughts on the strategic outlook for that
business and whether or not you're still seeking a partner for the medium-term?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, ECU dynamics for Dow have, as we stated many times, value-add to chlorine for our
downstream derivatives. As time goes by, we will continue to look for more partners of the Mitsui kind and the
Shintech kind, who are interested in the EDC vinyl
chain. We are not, and therefore we are, if you like, asset-light, less capital-intensive in that area.

As we get assets coming up to the end of useful life, we will make decisions around partnership or shutdown. And I
think that's protecting our downstream assets. If we can find a low-cost chlorine provider versus producing our own, we
will go that path. We are firmly on that path, and nothing will take us off that path because we see the value-add.
Remember also, we now have a PO process that doesn't need chlorine. So as we look at building against PO and PO
derivatives in the U.S., that won't be chlorine-based.
So you can see us making those moves over the next several while. Once we get DMCA started up in the back half of
this year, we will be relooking the next lot of chlorine investment with a view of not doing it ourselves.
<A - Doug May>: Thanks, Kevin.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Duffy Fischer, Barclays.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Yes, Good morning. Congrats on the good quarter.
<A - Doug May>: Thank you, Duffy.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Andrew, there have been several statements over the last probably four or five months around
the divestitures. So first was $1 billion in revenue, then we had $1.5 billion of proceeds. Today in the press release it
looks like you're kind of increasing the scope of that.
Can you triangulate those numbers? Over the next two years, what kind of sales contribution should we be thinking
about as going? And what kind of proceeds would we get back all-in for what's on tap now?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I will let Bill answer that, Duffy, if you don't mind.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yes, Duffy. So to your point, I mean, we first announced that we were going to divest
$1 billion. And as you know, we upped that to $1.5 billion over the next 18 months. That $1.5 billion is defined as
pre-tax proceeds. So that's the definition.
And as Andrew highlighted in his comments, we've already announced the plastic additives and the polypropylene
Licensing & Catalysts. I can just give you a quick update on those. The plastic additives we actually took to market in
March, and so we're expecting a signing sometime in the second quarter and closing by the end of the year. And the
polypropylene licensing catalyst we'll take to market in the second quarter, with an anticipated signing in third quarter,
again, targeting the signing by the end of the year.
So I can tell you without giving you specific numbers, those that we've already laid out will be a significant portion
already of that target that we laid out. And our target is to complete those by the end of the year. So hopefully that
helps. So it's pre-tax proceeds in the next 18 months. The ones we already have announced, we are targeting to
complete by the end of the year.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. And then if we switch to Dow Agro, I guess kind of two questions there. One, the deal
that DuPont signed with Monsanto, where it looks like now DuPont is going to take the double stack of dicamba plus
Roundup into their soybeans, where before it looked like DuPont was going to take your Enlist. Strategically, what
does that do to your outlook for Enlist in soybeans?
And then just a second question. How many HERCULEX acres, either stand-alone or inclusive of SmartStax, do you
think you'll get this year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: On the – with Monsanto and DuPont put together, our Enlist soybeans license with DuPont
is global, just to remind you, and is particularly valuable in the Latin American market, where dicamba does not enjoy
the same registrations and widespread use as 2,4-D. So we don't really see much effect on that license. And the
Monsanto license for DuPont only covers North America.

And, frankly, the NPVs of our Enlist entire project with the arrangement we now have with Monsanto actually have
improved the NPVs in totality, including this new arrangement between Monsanto and DuPont.
I think on the number of HERCULEX acres for this particular year, we are seeing a pretty rapid – I mean, it's about
70% of our corn portfolio, but I don't have the acres, top of mind. So we'll get back to you specifically on that, if you
don't mind, Duffy.

We will go next to Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.
<A - Doug May>: Hey, Bob.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Hey, good morning. It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today.
<A - Doug May>: Oh, good morning.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Andrew, I was a little surprised about your comments around the volume decline in the
feedstock business, that it was due to lightening the cracker feed slate. It seemed that last year the light end of the feed
slate was pretty well advantaged over the heavy end. And I guess the polypropylene contract had something to do with
your decision to run a little bit heavier.
But did you make any efforts to lighten the feed slate over the last year that enabled you to run lighter? I think you
mentioned specifically in Europe you ran a little lighter. Were you just able to run a little bit more propane through
Terneuzen or were there any efforts done over there to lighten the feed slate?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I love it when a question has the answer. That's great. That's exactly it. The propane in
Europe was exactly the lighter aspect of it. And as you know, we have the ability to be the lightest of the crackers in
Europe is in Terneuzen because of our conversion of propane over the many years we've been there. So it just led to
less aromatics sales because we had less co-product sales from cracking propane.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Great. And then on slide 18, I noticed it looked like you raised the target EBITDA for the St.
Charles Cracker. I think you had been talking about $150 million previously. Now you're talking about a $350 million
run rate. Just wondering what changed there? And for 2013, are you still thinking $150 million? And is that just
because of running at lower operating rates for some reason?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, just two data points we've given the market now. $150 million was this year. $350
million was its run-rate number, which the ramp-up will be as we get the ethylene cycle, and that will be the next year
or two, as already answered on a previous question.

Our next question will come from Peter Butler, Glen Hill Investments.
<Q - Peter Earle Butler>: Good morning, good morning.
<A - Doug May>: Hi, Peter.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter Earle Butler>: I was looking at your Ag chemical numbers, and you had a very healthy sales gain, but the
EBITDA was up just a lot less. And I'm wondering why. There are several possible reasons, but among which, the bad
weather and also Easter week was the last week in the quarter, so that could have had an impact. Did you see a shift in
earnings from the first quarter into the second quarter? And, if so, how much?

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So, Peter, a little bit, but, no, not much shift at all. And really at the end of the day, less
shift than normal. Way less. And it was really – what it really is, and we've said this to the market for some time, this
year is a big year, as is next year for the launch of four major new products for Dow AgroScience.
Dow AgroScience's big year-on-year growth was the beginnings of all those new product launches are appearing in the
expense column, ahead of the revenue column. And so Refuge Advanced, POWERCORE, sulfoxaflor and Enlist are all
coming now this year.
And this is big EBITDA numbers that we're pre-funding with R&D and marketing and promotional strategies. That's
why there's a disproportionate amount of the sales dollars went into funding all of that versus the EBITDA column.
That's it pretty much, and that's it alone.
I just want to reaffirm, this agreement with Monsanto is a validating, game-changing agreement for Enlist. And
basically it says it's going to be the trait of choice, frankly, for not just corn but for a variety of traits, not the least of
them being soybean.
<Q - Peter Earle Butler>: During your presentation, I think Mr. Weideman when he was discussing the extraordinary
sales growth you had in seeds and traits, I think he said something about that this part of the business had a high
profitability. And that isn't my understanding. I thought that the seeds and traits, due to very high front-end expenses
was running no profits or even a loss. So did I just not catch that right?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, Peter. The way you answered that is correct. You didn't catch that right. So what
I was talking is about is the significant revenue increase that Andrew talked about, 37%. But you're correct. We're
investing in this business with all of these product launches. So really what I was talking about, the 37% increase was
on the revenue line.
And I would also state that that has been a high-invest business for us, the Seeds, Traits and Oils. So I would just tell
you that that's approaching breakeven at these days.
<A - Doug May>: Thanks, Peter.
Operator
We will go next to John McNulty, Credit Suisse.
<A - Doug May>: Hi, John.
<Q - John McNulty>: Yeah, thanks for taking our questions, and good morning. So with regard to the portfolio
management, it sounds like you are taking maybe a little bit more of an aggressive tone, in terms of identifying
potential divestiture candidates and strategic actions and opportunities. First of all, is that the right way to think about
how you are looking at it? That it is a little bit more – there's more scrutiny? But also, does this potentially mean there
are maybe larger-scale assets that historically might have always been viewed as core that might not be going forward?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, John, your question – so since we had the December investor forum, we talked about
ROC. We also talked about markets where Dow can really grow because of its successes. Packaging, from a plastics
point of view, Agro Sciences, what we just finished talking about, and food and nutrition.
So it's very natural in a portfolio context to do two things. And if it comes across as more aggressive, then fine. One,
market-driven capabilities, and keep investing in the things you are winning at with an ROC best-owner mindset.
Therefore, nothing is sacred. We are going to keep driving that. That's what you can expect from us in the next many
months and next many quarters.
And it's not just businesses that are on the commodity end, as per the question I got from P.J. We will be looking at
specialty businesses that we can't grow at the pace they need to be grown. And we'll be making those decisions from a
portfolio point of view.

<Q - John McNulty>: Great. And then just maybe as a follow-up. With regard to cash flows, your cash flows in the
quarter were much bigger than they normally are. At least seasonally, this tends to be a pretty light quarter for you and
they were pretty strong. So is there anything different about this year that maybe changes the seasonality of that? Or
should we be expecting kind of the usual big ramp-up as we get later on in the year in terms of your cash flows coming
in?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, sure, this is Bill. You should continue to expect our cash flows to ramp as we go
through the year, because our working capital is a use of funds. Because, as you know, we build inventories ahead of
our turnaround season and also we build inventory in the first quarter for the product launches that Andrew talked
about in Ag. So going forward, you should expect our cash flow to continue to ramp.
What drove our significant improvement in cash flow this quarter versus a year ago were our higher earnings and also
the actions that we've taken. For example, our CapEx spending is lower this quarter versus a year ago, and it will be
lower for the full year. So you should expect cash flow to continue to ramp as we go through the year.
Operator
Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Andrew, if I heard your comments earlier in regards
to the ethylene cycle correct, it sounds like you're assuming probably a greater-than-historical GDP multiplier for
ethylene. Is that correct? And, if so, what gives you confidence in that, given the data that's out there so far?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: No, we don't expect greater than what we've used historically. In fact, historically, it's been
as high as two. We're using a 30-year average when we look at the multiplier, so no change there is the short answer,
Vincent.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: And what is the -- may I just ask what the multiplier is?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, 1.4.
<A - Doug May>: On average, right? But it has variability, of course.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah.
Operator
Our next question will come from David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Andrew, just on ethylene prices, if you look into 2014 and given new ethylene supply, is
there the potential for ethylene prices to drop materially into the low 20s, even teens, on a cents-per-gallon basis?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, yeah, I mean it's a fascinating question. I think if you're on the producer side of this,
you're basically seeing ethane at rejection levels.
And with all the dry-gas wells shut in, when gas prices went down below $3 – as you know, gas prices are now getting
up, as we predicted. But ethane is staying quite low. And the question before the house is, if they keep producing
NGLs, what's the bottom?
I don't think we are smart enough to call bottom, but I can definitely tell you that ethane is going to be like this now for
the next year or two or three. And we'll keep testing bottoms, and frankly, keep testing breakthroughs higher than 30
cents per gallon or 35 cents per gallon.

So I think ethane will be range-bound with sorts of bottoms like you're talking about possible. Maybe as kind of
detours. But in the 20s for the next year or two, I think, is what our guys are calling.
<A - Doug May>: Maybe one or two – sorry, go ahead.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Just on China, quickly, Andrew. Why were your volumes up in Q1? And what's your
forecast for the full year for your China volumes?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: China volumes were down 3% year-on-year.
So – now, remembering that Chinese New Year and all of things Peter talked about – Easter and all that – not that it
affects them, but just global buying patterns.
One thing – one little factoid you should now in China – their GDP now only has 25% of it driven by exports, where
that number used to be historically around 50% or 60%. That's a big change, one.
Two, consumption is down. They have pushed down government spending on all wasteful areas, including frivolous
things like banquets.
So I would tell you China is soft, but starting to show trend-positive. I'm not calling the turn. I think we are planning as
if it will be soft all year. But there's a chance for tailwind second half.
<A - Doug May>: Maybe time for one more question.
Operator
And our final question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna International.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes, thank you. A question on the propylene impact in Q1, and how that is going to play out in
Q2.
We saw propylene spike in January-February to reverse most of that. So what was the absolute dollar impact on your
margins, both in Performance Materials and Coating? And are you going to be able to recover that surge, given that's
it's fallen back? And as I understand it, about half of your propylene derivatives aren't indexed to propylene itself?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, I mean propylene moving around like it did in the quarter is not a good thing for
commodity-based propylene derivatives, in terms of price power.
The good news is that all the Coating stuff is not impacted by that as much as it used to be. And the ones that are, like
slabstock polyol for bedding, where there is weak markets, there is clearly going to be margin squeeze. In the face of
falling propylene, it's going to be hard to maintain price momentum.
The way we're answering that is we're looking at de-selecting customers and de-selecting assets, if we have to. So that
we can keep high margin or, if you like, above the cost of capital. That's our ROC lens.
But there will be volatility. And with downward projection already in April, there is going to be – it's going to be tough
sledding to keep the price momentum in more commodity-like propylene derivatives. The bottom-line answer
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Finally, Andrew, on the last call, you indicated that as the Freeport joint venture with Mitsui
came up, that you'd make some offset enclosures, and that you'd have an update for us on what you're going to do with
the Louisiana chlor-alkali asset. So could you make a comment on that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. As the last question, I don't want to make this the headline again. The comment I
have is no comment.
We are basically – we'll reevaluate, after DMCA comes up, what happens to the chlorine envelope, as I answered on a
previous question.

Yeah, I do. Thanks very much, everyone, for tuning in. Obviously, we feel very good about our quarter, because we
controlled what we could control. We had an EPS beat. The revenue miss is not great because of what Bill said and I
said about the Feedstocks.
We feel good, not because of the beat. We feel good because of what we're doing. And what we're doing is we're
working hard on the portfolio. We are working very, very much on the things that matter in terms of prioritizing growth
with a best-owner mindset. And shareholder value for us is key. You can expect us to continue to reduce debt, and you
can expect us to continue to remunerate shareholders, and at the end of the day, as the economy stabilizes, to continue
to control what we can control.
Thanks, Doug.
Doug May
