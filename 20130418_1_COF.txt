Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Jeff. Before we get started this evening, I wanted to take a moment and say a few words about my friend and
our CFO, Gary Perlin. As we announced a few months ago, Gary has decided to retire and will be transitioning out of
the company over the course of this year. After a decade of great work at our company, this is Gary's last earnings call.
Now at Capital One, as you know, we always search the world to find the very best talent, and that's how we found
Gary. I tried to get Gary to join us in 1994. He chose other options, but we didn't give up, and he finally saw the light in
2003. And since then Gary has made an impact to Capital One on every step of our journey to build a great company
and reward our investors. He's been a strong leader and a wise and trusted advisor. And as you know, he's smart, he's
rigorous and he has the highest of integrity. I know you will join me in saying thanks to Gary and wishing him the best
as he immerses himself in his many interests beyond Capital One. I'm grateful for everything he's done to put our
company in a strong position.
As we wish Gary well, we're also welcoming Steve Crawford to our company as our new CFO. Steve will officially
take over the CFO role on May 24, and you'll be hearing from him during our second quarter earnings call. Steve brings
more than two decades of big-time financial services experience to the table, including having been the CFO of Morgan
Stanley, and he knows our company well. Steve has already hit the ground running since joining us in February, and
he's fully engaged in having an important impact on how we continue to win in the marketplace, how we manage our
business and get our investors paid. Gary and Steve have been exemplary in working together to ensure a smooth
transition and I'm looking forward to working with Steve for many years to come.
And now, with my deep appreciation for all he's done over the last decade and for one last time, I'll turn the call over to
Gary.
Gary L. Perlin
Thanks Rich, for those very generous comments. It's been a personal and professional privilege to work with you and
the entire Capital One team for 10 very exciting years. I also count as a highlight the opportunity to meet and interact
regularly with so many analysts and shareholders. You all have both challenged and supported me, and I hope that I've
returned the favor in a spirit of friendship and mutual respect.
Now, as always, let's get down to business. We'll turn to slide three. Capital One earned just over $1 billion or $1.79
per share in the first quarter, including $2.5 billion of pre-provision earnings, which after adjusting for the benefit of
moving our Best Buy partnership portfolio to held for sale is about in line with the quarterly run rate we anticipated for
2013. In addition, earnings in the quarter benefited from lower provision expense, which was driven by a $261 million
allowance release. Lastly, we recognized a $97 million charge for rep and warranty expense in the quarter, which was
driven by a $107 million charge in discontinued operations, offset by a slight benefit in continuing operations.
There were also a few notable events in the quarter. First, we redeemed $3.6 billion of high coupon, trust preferred
securities on January 2, which had a benefit to net revenue this quarter of $9 million. This includes a $75 million
benefit to interest expense, largely offset by a one-time non-interest income reduction of $65 million attributable to the

accelerated amortization of issuance costs.
Second, we announced our agreement to sell the Best Buy partnership portfolio and moved about $7 billion of loans to
held for sale as of February 1. This movement to held for sale resulted in a $40 million benefit to revenue in the quarter
and a $41 million reduction in provision expense. The provision benefit results from the fact that expected charge offs
are absorbed by the carrying value of the held for sale loans after reclassifying some $289 million in loan-loss
allowance. Revenue similarly benefits as reversals of fee and finance charges are also taken against the carrying value
of the loans. All told, the movement of loans to held for sale resulted in an $87 million benefit to income before tax in
the quarter.
We expect earnings will be positively impacted for the first three quarters of this year until the partnership portfolio
sale closes. This positive impact on 2013 earnings will be partially offset by the reduction in earnings once the sale
closes, late in the third quarter. We have included an appendix slide in this presentation, detailing expected quarterly
financial statement impacts by line item. These estimates are limited to 2013 and do not necessarily reflect opportunity
costs in 2014 and beyond. That's because we expect to capture incremental cost savings going forward and because
revenues would likely have fallen as a result of our choices around card practices such as exiting payment protection.
Turning to slide four, I'll briefly discuss highlights of our first quarter income statement. Pre-provision earnings were
up 7% in the quarter or 5% net of the benefit from moving the Best Buy partner to held for sale. This improvement was
driven by a decrease in non-interest expense, partially offset by the expected seasonal decline in revenue.
Revenue was down from the fourth quarter, as seasonally lower balances and purchase volume in our Domestic Card
business were partially offset by higher margins, which I'll discuss shortly. Non-interest expense decreased 7% from
the fourth quarter, when operating and marketing expense levels tend to be seasonally high. The quarterly impact on
operating expense from the amortization of purchased intangibles and integration costs are detailed on this slide and
expected annual impacts, which really haven't changed in our estimate, are shown on slide 12 in the Appendix. At this
point, non-interest expense is currently tracking a bit below our projected run rate for 2013, which I shared with you on
last quarter's call. Rich will have more to say on expenses in a few moments.
Putting these items together, please recall that our January estimates for revenue and expenses for 2013 were
approximately $22.5 billion and $12.5 billion respectively, resulting in pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion.
Three months into the year, those estimates for the full year remain within any reasonable margin of error.
We saw a 23% decline in provision expense in the quarter, primarily driven by a $261 million allowance release,
partially offset by $67 million in other provision expense. The other expense was driven by a reserve build for
unfunded commercial commitments, reflecting a one-time change in estimate, and by foreign currency adjustments.
The largest component of the allowance release was in Domestic Card due to better than anticipated credit performance
in the quarter, including delinquencies, and an improvement in drivers for our future outlook. Still, the coverage ratio of
allowance-to-delinquencies in Domestic Card rose above the level in recent quarters.
Finally, we recorded a $97 million charge in rep and warranty in the quarter, of which $107 million was recorded in
discontinued operations, offset by a $10 million release in continuing operations. This expense reflects our assessment
of probable and estimable losses in light of the current environment, largely in relation to non-agency mortgage
developments.
Turning now to slide 5, I'll touch briefly on loan balances and margins. Average interest earning assets fell in the
quarter as a result of both lower cash balances and a seasonal reduction in loan balances. The decrease in loan balances
was offset by net interest margin expansion. Reported NIM increased in the first quarter to 6.71% from 6.52% in the
fourth quarter. Two factors drove the quarterly increase in NIM, offsetting the reduction resulting from the simple math
of the first quarter having two fewer days' worth of recognized income. The first positive impact was from the
redemption of trust-preferred securities early in the quarter. This resulted in an 11 basis point benefit to interest expense
as well as an 8 basis point benefit from reducing the cash balances that had been built up in anticipation of the call of
those securities. There was also a 7 basis point improvement from the $40 million revenue benefit from the announced
sale of the partnership portfolio. Although those loans are now accounted for as held for sale, the balances remain as

interest-earning assets.
Looking forward, we continue to expect about $12 billion in loan run-off in 2013, about $10 billion in mortgage run-off
and about $2 billion in Domestic Card. Planned run-off will continue in 2014, which we estimate at about $8.5 billion,
of which $7.5 billion is in mortgage and $1 billion in card. As for NIM, we continue to expect that we'll experience
some cross currents. Like the rest of the industry, low interest rates, relatively flat yield curve and weak loan demand
represent headwinds. However, we expect to see the continued beneficial effect of lower rates on deposits and other
borrowings and a rotation from lower-yielding mortgages to a broader mix of consumer and commercial loans.
Turning to slide 6, our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis rose about 80 basis points in the quarter to end at 11.8%.
We expect that we will continue to generate substantial amounts of capital in coming quarters, inclusive of our
previously announced intention to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share beginning this quarter, subject to
final approval of our Board of Directors at its scheduled meeting in May.
As noted on our last call, we have formally begun on our journey to adopt Basel II, also referred to as advanced
approaches, which for Capital One will take effect on or after January 1st, 2016. Using our evolving estimates of this
impact, Capital One's Tier 1 common ratio under currently proposed rules for implementing Basel III over coming
years, would be about 8.5%. This estimate incorporates the amortization of PCCR and the scheduled pay down of
capital punitive investment securities. Let me remind you that this ratio is now above our assumed target when Basel III
is fully phased in over the next several years.
Rich will address in his comments our intentions for capital management in light of our strong balance sheet position
and expected generation of substantial amounts of additional capital going forward. With that, let me hand the call back
to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 7, which provides an overview of solid business results in the first quarter. Our
Domestic Card business posted strong profitability in the quarter. As Gary already discussed, first quarter results reflect
the impacts of the planned Best Buy portfolio sale and held for sale accounting. Excluding held for sale accounting
impacts, ending loan volumes declined 7.4% in the quarter, which compares to quarterly declines of about 6% in the
first quarters of 2012 and 2011. Expected seasonal patterns and planned run-off of some of the acquired HSBC branded
loans drove the first quarter decline.
Purchase volume excluding HSBC increased about 5.5% compared to the first quarter of 2012. First quarter last year
had two more processing days than the first quarter this year. Adjusting for the difference in day count, the
year-over-year growth in purchase volume would have been about 8%.
Domestic Card revenue margin excluding held for sale accounting impacts was about 16.3%, in line with normal
seasonal patterns. Charge-off rate increased 8 basis points in the quarter to 4.4%. Delinquency rate improved 24 basis
points to 3.4%. Charge-off and delinquency trends were both modestly better than expected seasonal patterns. As we've
discussed for several quarters, we believe that cautious consumer behavior is one of the key drivers of persistently
weak consumer demand and the resultant pressure on loan growth. However, the flipside of relatively weak loan
volumes is relatively strong credit performance, which we've observed over the last couple of years.
The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined about $1.5 billion, in
line with our expectations. About $800 million of continuing growth in auto loans was more than offset by about $2.2
billion of expected mortgage run-off. Auto loan originations were down $500 million compared to the first quarter of
last year, a decline of about 11%. The year-over-year decline in originations reflects increased competition and our
choice not to chase growth that might compromise the sustained returns or resilience of the business.
Consumer Banking revenue was stable compared to the fourth quarter. Loan yields were stable and deposit interest
improved modestly. Provision expense was relatively stable. The Auto Finance charge-off rate showed modest seasonal
improvement and the overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains below 1%.

Our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of solid growth in profitability. Loans grew 1% in the
quarter and 12% year-over-year. Revenues were up 4% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in
loans and deposit balances. Revenues grew despite increased competition and pressure on margins. Our loan yield was
down 56 basis points from the first quarter in 2012, which is largely due to the continuing impact of the low rate
environment, movement of our portfolio to more floating rate loans with better credit and the absence of a favorable
one-time impact we had in the first quarter of 2012.
Non-interest expense improved about 12% in the quarter, driven by the absence of several nonrecurring items from the
fourth quarter of 2012. Quarterly operating expense was down about 1% compared to the first quarter of last year.
Our charge-off rate in the quarter was 7 basis points. We continue to see improvements in nonperforming loans and
criticized loans, so we expect a strong credit performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue.
Turning to slide 8, let me pull up and talk about how our businesses are positioned. Our Commercial Banking business
is in a strong position to continue to deliver steady growth and profitability. While increasing competition, particularly
in middle market lending, may continue to impact pricing of new loan originations, we have a diverse set of businesses
in attractive markets. For example, our focus on strong local market, commercial real estate, and our deep industry
verticals in C&I lending continue to drive solid growth and profitability. Across our Commercial Banking businesses,
loan growth, credit and profitability trends remain healthy.
In Consumer Banking, both our direct bank and branch-based deposit franchises remain very well positioned. We
continue to see the benefits of local scale and attractive markets, and we've made great strides in operational and
customer improvements in our branch franchise. On February 1st, we rebranded ING Direct to our new direct banking
brand, Capital One 360. Rebranding efforts and customer communications are going well. Capital One 360 is now the
leading digital bank positioned at the forefront of where banking is going.
Our Home Loans credit trends remain strong and meaningfully better than the assumptions we incorporated into credit
marks on the acquired Home Loans portfolios, and our servicing operations are solid.
In our Auto Finance business, our focus on building deep relationships with our most valued auto dealers continues to
pay off. We're delivering surefooted growth by expanding this relationship approach to new geographies. We still see
solid overall profitability and above-hurdle returns in new originations, but we expect that increased competition will
drive returns from current levels closer towards cycle average. We expect that our Auto Finance business will continue
to deliver solid growth and returns.
Our Domestic Card business is very healthy and delivering attractive results. Margins and returns are strong even as we
invest in franchise enhancements. Charge-offs and delinquencies are normalizing at strong levels with expected
seasonal patterns, and it's important to note that reported results in our Domestic Card business are inclusive of our
partnerships business which has lower margins, average charge-off rates, and lower returns compared to our branded
card business.
The key issue is loan growth which reflects both some weak demand and just as importantly the strategic choices we're
making. We are choosing to let the least resilient loans we acquired from HSBC run-off. We're also continuing to
emphasize resilience in our new originations as we remain largely on the sidelines of the high-balance revolver space in
the Domestic Card market. This choice to avoid high balance revolvers swamps the other factors that impact loan
growth because this part of the market presents the greatest opportunity to grow loan balances through the use of
balance transfer teasers and through balance stimulation offers to existing customers. For years we've talked about the
resilience issues with high-balance revolvers and we've consistently chosen to avoid this part of the market. By
definition, the value and benefit of resilience is harder to see during the good times but our choice to largely stay out of
this part of the market was one of the key drivers of our relatively strong performance through the Great Recession.
We continue to actively pursue revolver customers that have lower balances and indebtedness levels as well as
transactor customers where we are gaining share. While the transactor business does not deliver near-term loan growth,
it does deliver attractive and sustained economic value through high spending and interchange revenue, low attrition,

low credit losses, and franchise-enhancing customer relationships. Our choices are evident in selected Domestic Card
metrics. Loan volumes reflect both significant planned run-off and our choice to stay out of the high-balance revolver
space. The fact that only 6% of our Domestic Card loan balances are on promotional rates is another result of avoiding
high-balance revolvers. Purchase volume growth reflects the continuing growth of transactor customer relationships.
And, over time, we expect the run-off will subside and that the gains we are seeing in the customer segments we're
focused on will more clearly drive loan growth. Our Domestic Card business is delivering significant shareholder value
today in the form of strong and sustainable returns and capital generation.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 8. Our businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter. We
have great businesses with attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns, led by strong and sustainable profitability of
our Domestic Card business. Our Auto Finance and Commercial Banking businesses are delivering solid growth. Our
balance sheet is strong, and we continue to generate significant capital. In the near term, we continue to navigate the
challenges of the prolonged low interest rate environment, weak consumer demand, and significant planned run-off of
certain acquired mortgage and card loans. We are not content to simply watch these market challenges and run-off
trends play out. We are fully mobilized to protect the profitability and returns of our business by managing costs and to
deliver shareholder value by returning capital.
I'll discuss cost management first. Our outlook for non-interest expense in 2013 remains $12.5 billion, comprised of
$11 billion in operating expense and $1.5 billion in marketing expense. In 2014, we expect operating expense to
improve to about $10.4 billion. We expect acquisition-related intangible amortization to decline by about $100 million
compared to 2013. While this is a non-cash item that amortizes away, we intend to manage our businesses to ensure
that these savings hit the bottom line.
We'll also manage down our integration costs by about $160 million versus 2013 and intend to manage so that these
cash savings hit the bottom line as well. We expect to realize the remaining operating expense improvements through
our continuing efforts to manage expenses tightly and operate more efficiently across our businesses. Our operating
expense outlook does not include the potential impacts of either positive or negative non-recurring items which we do
not forecast. As always, we will make decisions about how and when to spend marketing dollars based on our current
and expected view of opportunities in the marketplace.
Moving now to capital. As Gary discussed, we're in a strong capital position today, and we continue to generate capital
on a strong trajectory. With the successful completion of the 2013 CCAR process in March, we're planning to increase
our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share beginning in May, subject to approval by our Board. As we discussed, we see
this as a first step. Based on our current forecasts and subject to regulatory approval, we would expect to request share
repurchases that would drive 2014 total payout ratio to a level well above current bank industry norms, driven by
several factors. We expect that our business will continue to generate attractive returns, adding to our existing capital
strength. We expect significant planned run-off to continue through 2014, and we believe purchasing our own stock is a
particularly compelling alternative at the current time.
We've started discussions with our regulators to seek approval to begin share repurchases in 2013. While we have not
yet reached agreement for this – while we had not yet reached agreement for the sale of the Best Buy portfolio at the
time of our CCAR submission in early January, our CCAR plan indicated that in the event we reached an agreement to
sell the assets we would seek approval to distribute capital freed up by such a sale. Any such share repurchases would
be subject to approval by our regulators and, if approved, would not be executed until the time the portfolio sale
actually closes.
Pulling up, our outlook for the next couple of years implies that diligent expense management and significant capital
return will be key levers to create shareholder value and we are highly focused on delivering that value as quickly and
effectively as possible.
Now, Gary and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?

Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to
ask a question, please limit yourself to one question, plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-ups after
the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.
Matt, please start the Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll pause just a moment to assemble our roster. We'll take our first
question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hi, thanks. And, Rich, thank you for all the clarity on costs and capital. Just a follow-up on the
comments on CCAR; you talked about that the plan contemplates you being able to go back and repurchase some stock
that was freed up. Can you give us a sense of what that incorporates? So is it you're allowed to repurchase stock of the
capital that was actually freed up from the transaction or is there a different amount? And, second, just when you just
say total payout way above bank industry norms, can you try to quantify that or at least put it in a range for us?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes, Ryan. First of all, when we – there is not an official CCAR process that we are
reentering here. So our intent is consistency with what was in our original CCAR process – or application, if you will.
And that was very explicit about this Best Buy component. So what we are trying to free up is the capital associated
with the Best Buy sale. But, again, what actually happens along the way in these conversations is something that there's
not an official process and we'll have to see what happens in the Fed conversations.
With respect to what do we mean by payout above sort of industry norms – bank industry norms, well, as we look out
there, I think the bank industry norms are running around 50% in terms of total payout ratio and our intent for 2014 is
to distribute well above that.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
We go next to Craig Maurer with CLSA.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, good evening, thanks. So quickly, if the buyback – if you were to get new approval for
the buyback, the earliest we could hope for is basically fourth quarter as you expect the sale to close in the third,
correct? And, secondly, you discussed loan growth being still the big challenge out there. Could you discuss what
you're seeing from competitors, especially in the card industry that could be limiting that availability? Thanks.
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Yeah, Craig, it's Gary. I'll take your first question. And again, as Rich said, there's not a formal
process, but just following our own capital plan, we would wait until after the sale closes and the capital is freed up to
begin any repurchases that are approved by the regulators. So that would be probably end of the third quarter, early
fourth, yes.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Craig, in terms of the competition, I assume we're talking about in the card business. I
think competition in the card business is at a – it's always intense but it's at a fairly stable and reasonably rational level.
The biggest issue, I think, we start with is just demand itself, industry – revolving debt is generally going sideways. It's
been going sideways for an extended period of time. Certainly, purchase volume in the industry is – the card industry –
since the bottom of the downturn, the card industry has seen their own purchase volume grow faster than retail sales in
the same way that the reverse effect happened on the way down. So that's been a pretty good thing. And I think the
industry has settled out to a place where supply is down from where it went to in 2011. I think what happened is, as
competitors saw the sun just start to peek out a little bit in – with respect to the Great Recession, they stepped on the

gas with respect to direct mail volumes and marketing in 2011 and I think found that there wasn't nearly the response
that they had hoped for. So what has happened is direct mail volumes are now like 30% down from there, generally
stable. Pricing out there in the marketplace is generally stable, I think going up just a little bit. And so I don't think our
opportunities are really being driven by competitor actions. I think they're really being driven by the choice that we
make in the – again, if we denominate our conversation by loan growth, then really the choice is about the high-balance
revolvers and the balance transfer teaser rate gain. That is the thing that most dominates the metrics with respect to loan
growth. But, if I look beyond that, yes, demand is weak. We are gaining share in all the segments that we are investing
in. I think we very much like the economics of what we're booking, and we don't want to push anything in an unnatural
way, but the key thing is we're saying we want to make sure that our – that we can maintain the exceptionally high
returns we have in the card business and we've got to do that through managing our expenses carefully. Redoubling that
imperative, of course, is having Best Buy move out of the equation. So there is tremendous energy on the expense side
in the card business and then across the company on both expenses and in terms of capital return.

We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: All right, thank you. Good evening. First off, congratulations and good luck to Gary. Also, I
appreciate the added disclosure. I had one question specifically to Best Buy and then one for Rich. Just on Best Buy, I
was looking at that table that you guys had in the slide deck towards the end of it and I was wondering is the fourth
quarter the number to look at and annualize. And when I do annualize that number, it kind of approximates about $0.38
in EPS after tax. I was just wondering whether in that fourth quarter number there is some seasonality. And then you
talk about getting some operating leverage into 2014. So does that mitigate that impact? And then secondly for Rich,
perhaps you could just talk about marketing because that was one point you made into 2014. I was just wondering how
much of that number is discretionary and how much of it is allocated to cards? And to the extent that you're not seeing
the growth, how much of that can you pare back? Thank you.
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Okay, Sanjay, it's Gary. Let me address your question. Looking now at slide 11 of the
presentation in the Appendix, we've given you the quarterly estimates for this year of the impact to Best Buy because
you're going to see those playing through from one quarter to the next. If we close late in the third quarter, we wanted
to show you what you might expect in terms of impact in the fourth quarter. But, as I said earlier, it would be wrong to
simply take the fourth quarter and annualize it in terms of the opportunity costs, both because of the additional
non-interest expense that we expect that we can take out of our base, some of it related to the moving out of that
particular partnership, but also because the revenue stream associated with that book of business we would've assumed
would have started to decline because of the choices we've made around some of the card practices. I mentioned
payment protection being one of those.
In terms of the bottom line EPS impact, remember as well that there's not only the opportunity loss of the earnings, but
to the extent it frees up the capital, to the extent we're able to use that freed up capital to repurchase our shares, we
think we can mitigate significant maturity of any opportunity loss in terms of EPS. Rich?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes. Sanjay, on your question with respect to marketing, we have the whole
information-based apparatus of Capital One geared toward very rigorous measurement about what we're marketing and
what we're getting for that. We don't measure success of marketing by loan growth metric. It's really measured by the
creation of value. And before we originate, after we originate and after programs have aged for many years, we of
course – we estimate and then re-estimate and go back and assess and see what we have learned. In this environment of
certainly not a lot of torrid loan growth, there still is good opportunity to create real value and we are very comfortable
with what we see, and we have a lot of evidence for the – I think the positive choices that we're making. And that's
why, as we're managing expenses so tightly, we're separating out our commitment, if you will, that this is where we
think operating costs are going to go. And then the marketing call will continue to be more of a line of scrimmage call,

We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks, good evening. I was hoping you guys could help me reconcile some of the
commentary, just trying to make sure that I understand how you guys are thinking about the capital return from a value
creation perspective. Your – you've described the value creation aspects of capital that can be freed up and returned as a
result of Best Buy. But my understanding was that you guys had paid an 8.25% premium or thereabouts to acquire the
Best Buy portfolio and you essentially got back part for it and now you're returning that capital. So can you help me
understand the economic value creation element of that? And then I have one follow-up.
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Sure, Bill, it's Gary. And the premium that we paid for the HSBC business of just over 8% was
across the entire business. We, obviously, ascribed different parts of that premium based on the value that we thought
existed in various parts of that portfolio. We ascribed very little value and, therefore, very little of the premium to the
Best Buy portfolio and so that's how it looks to us in terms of being able to get back to a point where we're really
creating value by returning that capital and improving performance.
<Q - William Carcache>: Okay, thanks. And the follow-up is there has been some evidence that post the payroll tax
cuts that some lower income customers have faced greater level of financial stress. Have you seen any signs among
your, certainly if not on an overall aggregate basis, maybe just within some of your lower income customers of any
kind of weakness from that subgroup?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: No, Bill, we have looked specifically actually for that effect. There are several things
going on in the broader political marketplace and we've tried to look for any evidence of actually any of those effects in
the actual performance metrics of our customers overall or within a particular segment and we have not seen that.

We'll go next to Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Kevin J. St. Pierre>: Yes, thanks for taking my question. First, Gary, all the best, good luck. On the capital
commentary, Rich, I know there is – there are a lot of investors who are going to be happy to hear what you offered.
Maybe I could ask you to just take one more step and think about capital deployment opportunities that could arise
between here and the time when Best Buy closes and whether you would or would not look at portfolio acquisitions or
any types of acquisitions.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, Kevin, first of all overall as a general comment we believe. We have plenty of
capacity to return capital to our shareholders and add attractive partnership relationships. In 2013, I think in particular
any deal would need to be an extraordinary opportunity with identifiable near-term returns to forego an opportunity to
return capital to you in 2013. I think we're really saying we're going right down this path. It's a very near term path and
we want to make sure that – it's been an important event here, and to have the Best Buy portfolio even though we
valued it at par, it's a big event when this comes out of the portfolio, and we've got a lot of capital in a sense trapped in
the company here, and we want to make sure that we get this out as fast as we can. But I don't think that that will take
away from our opportunity over time, Kevin, to get the kind of attractive partnerships that are out there and that we are
well positioned to take advantage of.
<Q - Kevin J. St. Pierre>: Great. That's clear. And then just a quick follow-up, just to clarify your outlook for
operating expense in 2014 that would be inclusive of any savings related to Best Buy?

We'll go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I had two questions, the first one being relative to the Domestic
Card business. Can you give, either Rich or Gary, any sort of metrics or sense that the strategy that you're embarking
on? And it's, obviously, a difficult macro environment to grow that business but you seem to be spending a lot of
money on marketing, the spending growth, the purchase volume growth has been fading a little bit; that could be
macro. You're still doing better than most of your peers but the lending growth has been challenging. Do you feel like
you're getting a good ROI on your investment these days on all the money you're spending on marketing and all the
television advertising? And you – Rich, you referenced the fact that these transactors, they don't tend to create balances
right away. But is there potential that some of the growth you've been putting on some of these high spending
transactors could spool off and start to add more meaningfully in later years? Any signs of success would be helpful.
And I have a follow-up as well.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes, Chris. So the – so metrics for the strategy that we're embarking on, I think the –
probably the most significant metric I would point to is in a sense the risk-adjusted margin that in our business we are
so focused on doing the equivalent of a mini stress test on every origination that we do. We have, over our long track
record, been very, very focused on what is the credit risk and what is the revenue that we have to protect that and how
does that revenue behave under stress. Now, of course, the Great Recession was kind of "Exhibit A" of that but I would
point right now, while we spend a lot of time talking about growth metrics, to the very, very strong returns that we have
in the business. And in our branded book, those returns are higher because those are blended with partnerships that are
an auction-based business and it's inherently – it's an above hurdle but lower return business than certainly the business
that we've spent all these years building here. So that – the revenue and the credit is really the heart of that thing and,
therefore, really the ability of this business to really generate returns.
Now, there's another very important thing that's going on that probably slows down our growth in what is a little bit of
a theme but I don't want to overemphasize that but that is just the – this emphasis on creating value through long-term
franchises. So the classic long-term franchise is this – the heavy spender marketplace. And these cost a lot of money to
acquire. They have the lowest attrition rates of anything that I've ever seen in the card business and that's a great thing,
too. But these things build over time and, yes, the more traction we have with that and the more other things settle out
that will continue to build success but it'll happen even more so I think on the revenue side than on the – just in terms of
balances.
Another metric related to that, though, is something that we don't – we have to sometimes give you a little color on is
what's the relationship between purchase volume growth and interchange growth. And there's also been a transition as
we've gone out with more of an emphasis on getting these new transactor relationships and more of our mix comes
from the new high-value reward cards instead of just the building of balances by the rest of our portfolio. The
interchange growth has lagged the purchase volume growth overall. And you also have to normalize for the partnership
side of that, which has as a whole different kind of economic. But anyway, long story short, the interchange growth has
now also caught up to the growth of purchase volume in our branded book. These are all things, some of it kind of
beneath the surface that you can't see, but showing the vertical things catching up with the tremendous horizontal
economics that we have.
But slowly but surely also we are continuing to build revolver customers. We just tend to shy away from the big
balance ones but, on a broad basis, we're continuing to build that business and they're generating very good returns with
high resilience. So we feel good about this. The key thing is we just – to us is we've got to make sure that we respond to

the opportunity we see in the market. Right now, the best opportunity is to really make sure that we maintain our
margin and get capital to shareholders even as we continue to build a long-term franchise and look forward to also the
run-off subsiding, which will also really get the metrics going.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: That's helpful. And I'm sure the macro and higher consumer confidence would also help. A
related second question is HSBC and I know you guys are fanatics about testing and measuring and evaluating your
own performance. Is this a transaction that you would still do again? We're struggling at this point to see the financial
benefit. Are there strategic benefits? The private label business, I think, has the potential to be something special in a
mobile world. Is this part of the strategy that private label could potentially be a growth engine for Capital One over the
next several years?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, Chris, I think that because there had been so many moving pieces it's hard for – it's
hard to really see the absolutely separable effect of HSBC but I want to show it through – I want to talk about it a little
bit as we have seen it. We initially set out to buy $30 billion of this and then – and we talked about that and arranged a
capital raise associated with a bit of a larger number. As you know by the final thing that we bought and paid for was
around $27 billion something. But since then everything about the HSBC deal has come in consistent with our own
expectations, even paradoxically our hunch that the Best Buy portfolio was something that in fact we might be able to
move out early. We valued it at par. We didn't know what the timing would be and so on but our initial hunch was this
wasn't going to be the right probably fit with us strategically. It might be great with somebody else. And so that has
even moved along in a sense consistent with expectations. So we're still very happy with this deal. I think that the
bigger story there is in the face of the challenges in the marketplace and the weakness of demand and all the building
pressures on expenses in the regulatory environment and everything else to really make sure that – our job is to drive
the real return and shareholder value that can come from the position that we have put ourselves in and now with this
deal coming on – these two deals coming on and that's what we are very, very focused on. So, yes, we still very much
like this deal.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Rich, could you actually talk about the credit card run-off over 2013 and
2014? Is that going to include the underlying loan growth that you are talking about that's already net of that? And what
are the characteristics of those loans that you're running off?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: The credit card run-off is – the size of it, it is $2 billion in – I'm looking for an
itemization of this. I don't want to just do it off the top of my – oh, you've got it, Gary?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Yeah. Well, just getting back to Moshe's point, it's $2 billion in 2013, about $1 billion in 2014,
and to your question that's a gross run-off, Moshe. That is not a forecast of what our actual balances are going to do.
That's the amount that we're going to have to build in order to stay even. Obviously as Richard said, we're looking to
build and we expect to offset some of that run-off but it's just the run-off amount. It's not an assumption about where
overall balances are going.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: And what distinguishes those loans from the rest of the HSBC portfolio?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: And again – well, as far as the HSBC loans go, Moshe, as Rich described, it is the – mostly the
less resilient of those loans that, as they pay down, we'll see them start to run off. Also included in that number is the
run-off of the very tail-end of the closed-end loans that have been accounted for as part of our Domestic Card segment
for many years.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: And in fact, Moshe, by – if you'll forgive me for possibly being only directionally
accurate, I – as I do recall of the $2 billion, we're talking about in 2013, $500 million is the installment loan portfolio.

That number goes to about $200 million in 2014. So what we have in this run-off portfolio is mostly the HSBC run-off.
And essentially just go give a little more color on that, Moshe, it is some of the highest loss in our opinion, least
resilient part of the branded book that we got from HSBC. So you add some of the really lowest margin stuff with
installment loan and some of the highest loss stuff, things like the old metrics book.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right. The – on the payment products, could you just remind us what you're doing going
forward and what the impact is going to be as those run down?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: The payment protection promotion, Moshe?
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Yes, payment protection, yes.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So, Moshe, as we announced, in the – it was actually I believe in – early a year
ago – early in the year we shut down the origination of payment protection products in our credit card business. And –
so we announced there would be – the economics of all of that is, on our existing book, we would continue the payment
protection products but it would just be a case of the math of run-off from there, forward. And, by the way, also on Best
Buy there was a similar effect that was part of the declining economics at Best Buy that Gary talked to you about. Gary,
do you happen to have the – talk to Jeff to maybe get the component of that run-off. We did give some information that
from which you could determine the kind of annual effect of this tale, Moshe. We're not in possession of it right at this
moment.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Yeah, Moshe, it's Jeff. I can get you that. I don't have it in front of me right now. The story, though,
is that it hasn't changed. Our estimates and the run rates we are observing haven't changed and what we're seeing is
consistent with what we laid out a couple of quarters ago. Next question, please.

We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Yeah, thanks. And, I'd just like to congratulate you, Gary, and wish you all the best. And I
was wondering if you guys could speak a little bit more about the operating expenses and marketing expenses, and if
you were to do a little bit better than your target, where do you think there could be some additional savings, for
example, in marketing as you do more and more customer acquisitions online, shouldn't that be less expensive than
direct mail? And where else could you save some money on expenses, do you think?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, let me start with operating expenses. Operating expenses is – this is not a program
per se. This is – what we're talking about here is a central basic way of life of running this business and there are a
number of factors that are significant macro trends that, given opportunity for continued expense opportunities beyond
the kind of forecast window we're talking about, and even in the forecast window, we're taking advantage of some of
these. But you've got the whole trend toward digital. So it happens on the – that's not only on the marketing side, but
the more and more customers that we can get into digital servicing, there's a key thing there on the retail banking side
that more and more customers that we can get to really become digital bank customers instead of such heavy users of
the branches, even the roll of things like smart ATMs that we've put all over our network, these are important trends,
but they don't happen automatically, David. They have to be actively managed to get the customer behavior changes
and then to make sure that the money drops to the bottom line.
We are also working to drive significant improvements in technology delivery and really the way that we do IT
projects; these are very complex projects and we've done a lot of process redesign of that and there's significant
opportunity there. The – one of the big, big themes around banking is complexity. Banks have inherent complexity, but
certainly with all the things that have become part of what running a bank is these days, there's a lot of leverage to
complexity reduction and we're all over this. And – but I do want to say also, again, we just bought ING Direct; that is
the leader in the way banking's going to be in the future. Now, in a few ways, they were maybe too far ahead of their
time and this is not a change that everyone is ready to sign up for right now but I think there are big opportunities there.
There are big opportunities in procurement, big institutions like our own have very big third-party expense budgets and

to really, really drive best-in-class kind of procurement capabilities, this is incredibly important as well.
So our entire – I mean we are just laser focused, because as a guy who came out of the strategy business, I want to go –
I want to say what I think, what we've always said, what is strategy? Strategy isn't about bubble charts and just about
market position. Strategy is about finding where the leverage is and driving great outcomes. The things we're talking
about here have tremendous leverage over a long period of time and we are sizing them, driving them and we want to
make sure that that can be a key way from customers to economics to the customer experience that we stay ahead in
this marketplace.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: And the same things would happen in marketing you think? Same leverage?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Oh, sorry. Just in terms of marketing, one thing I want to say is that mail has a role. Mail
is certainly declining over time, but mail has a role that is a different role than digital originations have and that is that
mail allows you to proactively target in ways that actually are not possible on the Internet, and so on. So we – look, I
mean we are a big player in digital originations, but our choices on the direct mail side, the nice thing is we have an
absolute expense, we have a response rate and we have the economics that allow us to very efficiently measure how
and how fast to drive down that cost as the world changes.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We go next to Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hi. I guess on capital return, when you think about payout ratios, should we be thinking about it
against GAAP earnings or some kind of cash earnings concept that's closer to the actual annual capital generation?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Well, Brian, I think you'd really want to mostly be thinking in terms of GAAP, obviously. Most
of the non-GAAP impacts on revenue will be completed in 2013 so all that's really left next year will be the significant
but predictable and slowly-declining impacts on operating expense. But in general terms, Rich is talking largely GAAP
but with wide enough range it would probably cover both.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: And then just on the expenses, I mean the comments you've given are definitely very helpful
and kind of show where you want to go long-term. If I just think about the card business and expense to loans, I know
it's not a perfect metric, but it's one metric, you're kind of at 9% this quarter, 8%-and-change last quarter, expense loans
and Domestic Card. And I guess historically you used to be like 5% to 6% and some of your peers are still around 5%.
Can you help us kind of dimension how much of that is temporary versus how much of that is business mix changes or
regulatory changes that have happened, just as we kind of think about where that could go long-term?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. Brian, look, we are very energetically benchmark ourselves by expenses relative to
just about every denominator that we can find out there. And I want to say a few things. First of all, there're certain
things that create near-term pressure on expenses that – and ratios, like Best Buy coming out and certain things like
integration costs and other things, that – a little bit more on the temporary thing. One thing I do want to say is that I
think our expense ratio to loans is inherently higher than other players, because of our strategy of pursuing – of kind of
avoiding the higher-balance accounts and so expenses – loans don't actually drive expenses. They drive charge-offs, but
what drives expenses is really accounts. And on a per-account basis, our metrics are much closer to some of the other
norms. But all that said, where we absolutely need to go from here is to continue to drive more and more efficiency,
and there are a lot of different levers to do it, and that's strategy with a capital S; that's where the opportunity really is.
And that will help us preserve what has been something we've treasured for a long time, is to have returns at the top of
the industry in the card business, and then helping us to have returns for our overall corporation that at the higher end
of banks. And so, again, always look at ROA again as one of the key metrics there, okay.

<Q - Martin J. Kemnec>: Hi. This is Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado. Thanks for taking my question. A question
for Gary relating to the Domestic Card business, can you help me kind of just disaggregate how much of the $5.3
billion (sic) [$5.6 billion] (1:03:47) decline in card balances was kind of seasonal and what was related to the run-off
portfolios?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Well, Martin, it's hard to pinpoint the run-off portfolios. The two things that would have been
driving the decline in loans, first, would have been – for card, would have been the move of Best Buy loans to held for
sale. So you're going to see a reduction in the held for investment loans. And then the balance is largely going to be
seasonal. So actual run-off would be hard to measure, and is almost certainly a very small portion of that. It's the
seasonal effect of going from fourth quarter to first quarter, plus the impact of moving the Best Buy portfolio to held
for sale. Remember, that was done on February 1.

growth. On international card, that business really hasn't grown in a long time. I guess card industry hasn't grown. But
does it strategy fit, Rich? Does it – I mean do you have an international strategy beyond the markets that you're
currently in, a growth strategy to move into new markets? Or does it make sense to sell those portfolios and redouble
your efforts in the U.S.?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, Bob, we are in Canada and in the U.K...
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Right.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: ...in credit cards only. And we chose those two markets, it doesn't – one didn't have to
hire McKinsey to figure that one out. I mean, in a sense, they are – they're the markets that are most similar to the way
the marketplace works, the availability of data, and a lot of things. It was kind of a natural to go there and it helped that
they spoke our language. But beyond – all jokes aside, we are not at this point – we're very focused on the agenda that
we've talked about here. Those two businesses, I think – the Canadian business has been a good earner for a long period
of time. The U.K. has had a couple of challenges along the way.
Certainly the amazing whack the whole industry has taken on some of the payment protection thing has led to some
charges and so on. But we think we're well-positioned in both markets and while geographically they look far away,
synergistically it's just like another part of our card business. We transfer talent across. We use them as training
grounds for talent. New insights come out of those two marketplaces that we adopt here. It is synergistic. It makes
money and I think it's an appropriate thing to continue in our portfolio even as we're not pushing out farther in the
geographical expansion.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Okay, thank you. And then, I guess the payments industry is more dynamic today than ever
and it seems like maybe Capital One who has always had a really good credit card business might be at a little bit of a
competitive disadvantage versus some of the dynamics going on in the industry. Many of your big competitors are
either closed loop or own merchant acquirers, which with the JPMorgan Chase Paymentech with Visa strategy, does –
with the capital that you have, is there – are there any thoughts of investing further in, say, buying a merchant acquirer
or other – investing more heavily in other areas of the payments business that could be synergistic with your U.S. card
business, such just prepaid, or...?

<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Bob, we – Chase, of course, just announced this little opportunity; they're working with
Visa. That – I think pretty much all the card players in the industry jumped to attention on that thing and we – look, I
don't think we know much about that. I think that it's a divergence from Visa's normal, more level playing field, the
treatment of the industry here. But we're all over kind of paying attention to that. It would be – the answer is, no, we're
not out looking to go deeply into the merchant acquiring business. Probably like any bank, there's some areas that we
have disadvantages. But look, I think the – I really like the positioning we have. We are not looking to significantly
change the bone structure we have. What I really want to do is capitalize on the opportunities to create value with the
bone structure that we have worked for years to get and I think we're particularly well-positioned.

We'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thanks. Good evening. And let me add a fond farewell to Gary. Thank you for all the help over
the years. My first question relates specifically to revenue margin, probably my favorite topic for Capital One. And I'm
hoping you might be able to provide a little bit of context around the 123 basis point lift that you're getting from the
Best Buy part of the portfolio coming out. And when you look at that, it's [ph] 1633 (1:09:54) net of the 123 basis
point. It's curiously similar to the first quarter 2012, and I just want to understand how you think that's going to migrate
over the next few quarters once the Best Buy portfolio is completely out of the numbers.
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Thanks, Ken. I'll start. It's Gary. I don't know if Rich may want to add a few things. First of all,
let me just remind you that in addition to the impact that Rich described of the Best Buy in Q1, it will have an
incrementally higher impact on Q2 because we'll have three months rather than just two months in the quarter, when
any of the reversals of finance and fee charges will not be going through revenue but they'll be going against the mark
on the loans. By and large, most of what we've seen otherwise has been kind of normal seasonal impacts. But again,
you will see some pretty big impact over the course of the year. The card business in particular when we're looking at
revenue margins because the revenue from the Best Buy portfolio will show up in the numerator of that calculation but
the denominator is just loans held for investment, so excludes that. I mean that's going to be the biggest single driver
along with the kind of normal seasonal trends, at least for the next couple of quarters.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: And then as a follow up just of the $40 million revenue lift that you pointed out from the fee
reversals, is that just that you had $265 million of revenue suppression so without that it would have been $305 million.
Am I understanding how that is running through the numbers correctly?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: More or less, yes.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Okay, thank you very much. And again, good luck with your next endeavor.
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Thanks, Ken.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good evening. A couple of questions. One was, I just wanted to follow up on the expense
side. I want to make sure I understood what you were saying regarding where you anticipated expenses to go from
2013 around $11 billion, net of the marketing expense to $10.4 billion. Is that accurate?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes, that is, Betsy.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So excluding the integration and the acquisition related costs, that essentially means a
3% decline, which seems eminently doable there on those non-marketing expenses. On the marketing expense side,
though, I guess the question is, if you're looking to replace the run-off portfolio to the degree possible, does that imply
either an increase in marketing expense to try to incent either usage or track new card accounts? And if you could also
give us some color on how progress is going on implementation of the CARD Act changes that went into place last fall
on extending line utilizations, is there – or balances per card, is there any progress there you can talk to us about and
help us understand how to get the balances up?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. Yes. So on the expense side, Betsy, you've got it right with respect to $10.4 billion
and again from the $11 billion going down to the $10.4 billion that's $100 million of acquisition related intangible
amortization, a decline in that. $160 million of integration costs that we have to manage to come out but we're dropping
that to the bottom line and then all the rest is just other operating cost savings.
I want to give you a window into how we think of marketing. We're really not out on a quest to replace the run-off
portfolio. I mean to me the run-off portfolio is just a thing that is running its course and in many ways it is irrelevant to
– not in many ways, it's just flat out irrelevant to our marketing decisions and our growth choices net of that. It's very
relevant when it comes to things like capital distribution. It's very relevant that we make sure that we manage our
economics, working backwards from what comes with the territory with these portfolios running off. But underneath it
all, it's the same way we make choices all the time and we look at opportunities and we model them under stress and
we pursue all the opportunities that really look good in that context. And the marketing is really, the marketing choices
are dependent on that and I think that however you've seen our marketing over the many years, this is really the same
whole methodology there.
I'm glad you asked about the CARD Act thing because one other factor, and we have mentioned it in other
conversations but we did not today, one other moderate factor that has held back our loan growth has been the –
adapting to the regulatory requirements with respect to credit line increases, and let me just talk just a little bit about
this. Coming out of the CARD Act and the downturn, the regulators understandably have heightened expectations
regarding credit line increase programs and they put in place new requirements regarding the use of modeled income to
demonstrate a customer's ability to pay. And so they essentially increased the requirement in terms of validating an
assumed income before one could give a line increase.
And of course, as you can imagine, we have built very sophisticated models associated with line increases and we have
a very dynamic and ongoing and important line increase strategy with respect to our customers. So starting really in
2012, we worked to retool to create a line increase program that met these various conditions. And we're going to be
pretty much back, pretty close to our run rate later this year. So that will give an extra boost. But it's not game changing
but it's something that we're – it's important that we get back to.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And your final question this evening will come from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Good evening. First of all, after the Best Buy news hit, I went back to your April or you
mid-2011 filings and looked at the Kohl's portfolio, and that was $3.7 billion portfolio and it look like your purchase
credit card receivable intangible only went up by $13 million which is something like 35 basis points. So this led me to
think, I mean here we have two cases of these partner cards, and you seem to never ascribe any value to them. And so
why is it a good business if we never seem to ascribe value to these? I mean do you give out just too much of the
economics with the partners?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: Let me just answer your accounting question, Chris. So we're typically going to see more value,
more PPCR-type value. The whatever premium is paid has to be attributed to the various sources of value and the credit
card relationships because they are direct between us and the borrower in general purpose credit cards because those

accounts will often remain over many, many years. You'll just see more of whatever is paid associated with PCCR in
branded books. So that's what you're going to see there. And if you go back to the Kohl's portfolio, remember the
nature of that business, it's very particular. It's a wonderful partnership. It's a high performing and they are a great
partner, but also remember that there's a very heavy cost and revenue sharing aspect to that business, which is also
going to affect the economics there.
So that's what would pretty account for what you've seen in those two particular portfolios when it comes to PCCR.
Remember value can be ascribed to businesses that's going be showing up in places other than in PCCR.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Is that kind of typical for a partner card that it's that low?
<A - Gary L. Perlin>: For partner cards, again, there is no single representative situation, Chris. You've got to take a
look at the partner, their history, the nature of the contract, and what is being paid. But it's going to be different for each
one. It's not surprising that we saw what was in there.
Also, remember that with these partnership transactions, there is typically an expiration date on the contract. There is
no expiration date on our account relationship in the general purpose business. So with Best Buy, for example, because
the contract was coming due in 2014 as we said earlier this year, all we did was to kind of end that a little bit earlier,
that's going to have a huge impact on what's there. So, just because there is a fixed term to partnerships, that's going to
affect the accounting as well, but I wouldn't read too much into the accounting as a measure of long-term value creation
potential, as Rich has said. We're looking for good partnerships that will deliver that over the long-term.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Chris, let me just talk strategically about partnerships. We have had an interest in
partnerships for many years, because it's an alternative way to get access to customers and in some ways actually
advantaged access to customers, because there are people who do certain things, and they choose to do it with a retailer,
and that can be a good thing. And plus you have retailers who subsidize the activity, and so that can be an economically
good thing.
Now, it's also been very attractive to us, because as a huge player in the card business, this not only represents a
significant additional source of volume, but the skills required are right down the plate in terms of how we operate the
business and headlining it is credit skills. And also in some of these partnerships the ability to do credit across a variety
of different customer profiles is also a very important thing to retailers, and we have pretty big skill experience at that.
So credit and information based strategies a very important part of that.
Now, also very important is expenses, and as you – if you look at the Best Buy economics, it'll show you something
that you probably already knew about the business, and we know, which is that this is a scale-driven business. So the
marginal economics of a partnership, whether it's in unloading Best Buy or whether it's in getting another one are
particularly attractive because there's a lot of fixed cost in the business. This is a scale-driven business, and if you look
at the private label business you'll find this is not an all-comers kind of thing. Capital One is third in a business with
three big – frankly with three big players because it is a scale-driven business.
So we have seen some companies get themselves into trouble in this business and I believe what happened is in the
quest for scale, there might have been some indiscriminants with respect to what customers are being booked or what's
happening at auction.
So the other thing I want to say about this business is and why it is inherently less profitable than the regular old
branded card business is it is auction-based, it does have periodic auctions. And that is something that makes it hard to
generalize – this is why things are so situation specific.
So while scale matters, what we have said is we want to selectively grow this business, going after great retailers with
strong brands, retailers that view the credit card program as a strategic opportunity to build a franchise rather than just a
way to make more money and a contract – and this is an incredibly important point, a contract that aligns the parties
interest and has the right market clearing price to it. For that reason, we stayed out for a bunch of years [ph] out of
(1:24:03) the business. We also stayed out because we didn't have the scale to really get in all that effectively.

Now we have the scale, we're in a great position. I think there are relationship benefits to the incumbent that can help
you in auction time if they like how you're servicing h. But bottom line, this is never going to scare the branded card
business in terms of its returns, but relative to the opportunities that we see in banking and across Capital One's
portfolio I think it offers well above hurtle rate returns but it has to be managed selectively and that selectivity is both
in choosing new partners and also being willing to sometimes move on from some of the ones we have.
