R. Scott Blackley
Thanks, Jeff. Let me begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned $791 million or $1.45 per share in the fourth
quarter. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher
marketing and operating expenses, driven by seasonal and growth related costs. Non-interest income in the quarter was
negatively impacted by $42 million of accounting hedge ineffectiveness, driven by the magnitude and shape of the rate
changes in the quarter. Provision for credit losses increased as the smaller allowance build compared to the third
quarter was more than offset by higher charge-offs.
Notable items in the quarter included the following: a build in our UK Payment Protection Insurance customer refund
reserve of $44 million or $0.09 a share; an impairment charge associated with certain acquired intangibles and software
assets of $28 million or $0.04 a share; and an allowance build in our Auto business, reflecting the change in accounting
estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt borrowers of $62 million or $0.08 per share.
Turning to full year 2016 results, Capital One earned $3.8 billion or $6.89 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $11.9
billion were up 15% year-over-year as higher revenues were partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Net income
for 2016 was down 7% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision for credit losses.
Full-year efficiency ratio was 52.7%, excluding adjusting items, down from 54.3% in 2015. As you can see on slide 4,
reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.85%, in line with the prior-year increase
and primarily driven by higher card deals.
Turning to slide 5, as of the end of 2016, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was
10.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 9.9%. We reduced our net share
count by 9 million shares in the quarter or 2%. Full-year 2016 share count came down 9%. As you know, we had an
authorization to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of common stock. We've now completed 80% of our authorization at an
average price of under $72 per share.
With that, let me turn the call over to Rich. Rich?
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Scott. I'll begin tonight on slide 8 with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth
remained strong. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.2 billion, or about 10%.
Average loans were up $8.9 billion, or about 11%. Fourth quarter purchase volume increased about 10% from the prior
year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking.

Revenue for the quarter increased 9% from the prior year, slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive
margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year, as expected, with our exit of the back
book of Payment Protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the fourth quarter was 16.8%.
Domestic Card purchase volume grew 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter net interchange
revenue for the total company was flat versus the year-ago quarter. As we've discussed, there's considerable quarterly
volatility in the relationship between these two metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange
growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth and we'd expect that to continue.
Non-interest expense increased just 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to
gain scale and improve efficiency. As we've discussed for several quarters, the dominant driver of year-over-year
charge-off rate trends is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan
balances in our front book season has become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and
highly seasoned back book.
In the fourth quarter, growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year. Seasonality and
growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter. For the full year 2016, charge-off rate
was 4.16%, in line with our guidance.
We continue to expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate to be in the mid 4s, with quarterly variability. Growth math
remains the largest driver of expected trends in the 2017 charge-off rate. Growth math began to impact charge-off rates
in 2015. In terms of contribution to year-over-year change in the charge-off rate, the peak impact of growth math was
in 2016. We expect the impact to moderate in 2017, especially in the second half of the year. Beyond 2017, we expect
growth math will have only a modest effect.
As an update on our Cabela's transaction, we do not expect to receive regulatory approval prior to October 3, 2017.
This is the date when any of the parties involved in either the retailer deal or the bank deal can choose to terminate the
transaction. Within the next week or so, we expect to either withdraw our Bank Merger Application or have our
application denied by the OCC. Ordinarily, a bank would withdraw its application before receiving a denial. But in this
case, our bank deal is tied up with the retailer deal, which requires us to get consent from Cabela's in order to withdraw.
In either case, whether we withdrawal our application or it is denied, we will not be in a position to re-file our
application until after we have completed our work under the AML consent order. We remain committed to this deal
and we will continue to work with Cabela's and Bass Pro towards completing the transaction.
Pulling up, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. But the marketplace is
moving. Competitive intensity across the card business remains high and revolving credit has been growing at about
7% year-over-year, meaningfully faster than household income growth.
As these trends continue, we believe the Domestic Card industry has moved into the more intense part of the
competitive cycle. Now, against this backdrop, we continue to monitor the marketplace vigilantly and we continue to
dynamically manage our origination and underwriting in anticipation. We believe the growth window of opportunity
remains open, but it's clear that this opportunity won't last forever.
Slide 9 summarizes fourth quarter results from our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 4%
compared to the prior year. Growth in Auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits
were up about 5% versus the prior year.
Fourth quarter Auto originations were $6.5 billion with strong growth in prime, near-prime, and subprime. Some of the
aggressive competitor practices have moderated somewhat. While we see opportunities for continuing growth, the auto
market and competitor practices remain dynamic and we will be very vigilant.
Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the Auto business that we're
booking. Our underwriting assumptions include a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient
originations and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-off as the cycle
plays out. We also expect upward pressure on the Auto charge-off rate as a result of the accounting treatment of

bankrupt accounts that Scott discussed.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue
from growth in Auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in Auto and planned
runoff of mortgage balances.
Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in Auto loans
and an increase in retail deposit marketing. For the full year, we recognized about $160 million in branch optimization
costs, in line with our expectations. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Banking
segment.
Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year primarily as the result of charge-offs in addition to
the allowance for loan losses for the Auto portfolio. We expect that several factors will continue to negatively affect
Consumer Banking financial results. In the home loan business, planned mortgage runoff continues. And in auto
finance, we expected margins will continue to decrease modestly and that charge-off rates will rise.
Moving to slide 10, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances increased 6%
year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialty. Average loans increased 16% year-over-year. Average
loan growth resulted primarily from the acquisition of the GE Healthcare business in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Revenue grew 18% from the fourth quarter of 2015 and non-interest expense was up 15%, consistent with the growth
in average loans. Provision for credit losses declined $52 million from the fourth quarter of last year, as allowance
release driven by the impact of higher oil and gas prices was partially offset by higher charge-offs.
Fourth quarter charge-offs were primarily driven by continuing pressure in our taxi medallion portfolio. The charge-off
rate for the quarter was 47 basis points. Criticized and non-performing loans rate were stable in the quarter. The
commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate
was 1.5%.
Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of
loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on slides 14 and 15.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on fourth quarter results and our outlook as we head into 2017. We posted another
quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes as well as growth in Auto and
Commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and
provision for credit loss. We've been working hard to improve efficiency by growing revenues, realizing analog cost
savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company, and tightly managing costs across the
enterprise. Our efforts are paying off.
Our efficiency ratio for the full year 2016 was 52.7% net of adjusting items, an improvement of 164 basis points from
2015. We continue to expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items, will be in the 52s,
plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we should be able to
achieve gradual efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains.
Pulling up, our strong growth over the last two years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017 assuming
no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycle. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive
growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from growth math on the allowance for loan
losses will moderate and we're reducing share count. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth
and returns as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.
Now, Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions.

Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with
KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thanks. Rich, you mentioned the domestic credit market is in the intense part of the
competitive cycle, I guess. When we think about how that impacts the growth trajectory looking out 2017, should we
expect the growth rate to moderate because of that?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I think that – yes. I mean, I think that it will contribute to a – I think this window is still
open. But as I've been saying kind of every consecutive quarter, this thing won't stay open forever. So I'd leave you
with two points. One, we're still all-in in pursuing the window, but I think that – but let me comment for a bit just about
the kind of natural physics that go along with what's happening on the supply side.
First of all, just to comment on the supply side. After a number of years post the Great Recession where the growth of
revolving debt was near zero or even negative, it has crept up in the last couple of years and now it is running at a 7%
year-over-year rate. And obviously, that's a faster growth rate than the economy is doing. And if you look at this
growth, it is broad-based, although subprime growth has picked up and is now growing faster than prime.
So, currently if you exclude Capital One's impact on the metric, about 34% of the industry's growth is in subprime. And
subprime card loans are growing 13% year-over-year versus prime, which is growing about 6% year-over-year. Now I
really want to stress, this is off, and particularly in the subprime side, off of a much lower base following the Great
Recession. So let's just ground that a little bit.
We went back and looked at the data here. Prime loans decreased 12% from pre-recession levels and they began
growing again in 2011. Subprime loans decreased 43% from pre-recession levels and didn't start growing until 2014.
So, subprime industry outstandings right now are at 74% of pre-recession levels and prime industry outstandings are
basically right at pre-recession levels.
So clearly, the subprime growth happened later and it's off of a lower base. But the growth has physics, and that's what
I'm always focused on because when you have consumers taking on debt and competitors supplying more debt, that can
affect both the volume and the selection quality of new originations as well as, of course, impacting existing customers
who along the way can take on more debt. So what we do when we see this is we just – we try to manage, Sanjay, in
anticipation of this because we view it as physics. And we are very – we've always said we can't predict the economic
cycle, but we really can watch and react to the credit cycle, which isn't the same thing as the economic cycle.
So we are very focused on resilience, we try to anticipate how supply changes end up making their way into the credit
performance of who we might originate. And if I pull way up on all of that, we can continue to make very conservative
assumptions in our underwriting. We manage to a belief that we are now in the kind of intense part of the cycle. But
even with all of that considered, we still see an important growth opportunity available for us. It's a window of
opportunity and we will continue to pursue it, obviously, with our eyes very wide open.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. My follow-up question is on the Cabela's portfolio. So when we think about that
deal, can that deal be consummated without the bank merger occurring? So could you buy the portfolio without doing
the bank deal or is that a nonstarter for Cabela's? And, I guess, when we think about the partner that you have in on that
deal, are they willing to be patient and wait for you to sort out the AML stuff?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, if we are to buy this, it requires a Bank Merger [ph] Act (22:09) Application and
approval. Now, we and Cabela's, all the parties in this transaction are working incredibly hard to make this happen, and
obviously with respect to our own AML order, which is the thing that needs to get to – for the approval to happen here,
we're all in working incredibly hard. We're working with Cabela's. We are very committed to this transaction and we
believe this can be a great deal for us and for Cabela's, for Bass Pro.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Thank you. We'll next move to Don Fandetti with Citi.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes. Scott, just wanted to clarify. The $42 million hedge amount, I guess, that's why the other
segment had a negative and in theory, I guess, we add that to the adjusted revs of $6.593 billion. Am I thinking about
that right?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah. I think we experienced what I think a lot of other banks experienced where the shape
of the curve moved. That does go to other and it is an offset to non-interest income.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Got it. And then, Rich, real quick. On the 2016 card vintage, Domestic Cards, I was curious if
you had any update on how that's trending?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: We still see 2016 as coming in better than 2015. So, our prior statements, we still are
viewing that the same way.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Next question come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David Ho>: Hi. I just wanted to parse out the rate of increase in 2017 for the credit card charge-off rate in the mid
4s. You did mention that the growth math would slow. At what point do you think the credit normalization impact
would slow or do you?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: What are you defining as the credit – the credit normalization impact meaning growth
math?
<Q - David Ho>: Well, no. Just the natural re-levering of the consumer, some of the leverage impacts you're seeing on
the margin, just getting back from historically low levels aside from growth math?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. Look, what we have tried to describe to help our investors think about the credit
card growth, the trajectory of credit card charge-offs is to divide it into two very different things. One is what we call
growth math, which is the impact on the charge-off rate of the seasoning from an acceleration in origination. And the
other is the general, probably industry-wide effects that relate to the consumer, the amount of debt they're taking on,
and probably where things are in the economic cycle.
I think we've said for some time now that our numbers are going to be dominated by growth math and we're still saying
that. But I'm also saying that we should just all understand we are kind of at that part of the cycle where the industry I
think is off the bottom with respect to the just exceptionally low levels of charge-offs that we've seen from the very,
very seasoned portfolios all across the industry. And so, over the longer run, our portfolio, like all the card players, is
going to be – our performance is really going to be driven by this industry and consumer effect. But for now, still the
big story at Capital One is the seasoning of our front book and the math of how that plays out over – particularly over –
as it played out in 2016 and now in 2017.
<Q - David Ho>: And in terms of...
<A - Jeff Norris>: I'm sorry. Go ahead, David.
<Q - David Ho>: Sorry. Just one more question. I was fascinated by – you bring up a very good point about leverage
kind of rising above income. Do you think that that in isolation could create an environment where consumer credit in
that space continues to exhibit some of the loss attributes that you just called out, in absence of any kind of shock to
rates, gas prices or employment?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I mean, I think we have to take the holistic picture here. I mean, I think it is – the card
business has been benefited by a number of years of having relatively low growth, and particularly on the sub-prime

side a big shrinkage and a delayed growth. So I think this all has to be evaluated in the context of from where it started
and for how long it's been going and where it's headed. So our primary point has been, look, in the end, this is physics.
The year-after-year just amazingly low losses, it is – as we've said some quarters ago, this has to be the bottom. Things
are going up from here.
All of that said, I think that – I mean, we are still – we are pursuing growth opportunities and continue to be optimistic
about the originations that we can generate. So, again, we try to adjust based on an assumption that, over time, things
will just gradually normalize. We try to get in front of that, anticipate that, make our origination choices in the context
of that, and this view that we carry around internally, we just share that with our investors.
So I think we're still pretty bullish about the opportunity. But I've said – probably a year ago I said that when I
cross-calibrate all the businesses, especially the parts of Commercial, the Auto business and the Card business that the
Card business was in the most benign and competitively benign part of the cycle and that Auto and Commercial were
farther along in the competitive and credit intensity.
I would say the card business has certainly I think caught up to the others. The others, interestingly, have had a little bit
of almost a lull, if you will, and some stability there. But all the businesses and pulling way our banking in general is
still moving along toward the more intense part of the credit cycle. But I think card has caught up.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Great. Rich, following up on that last answer, how should we think about the things like
marketing and rewards cost growth into 2017, given that commentary? Is there going to be any reduction there? And
how do you think about Capital One's kind of role in that kind of competitive dynamic?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I want to separate in a sense the intensity of competition around the heavy spender from
the commentary I gave about lending and it's really in a sense two different business: the spending business and the
lending business. And both are competitive, both have become more competitive. But my commentary was really about
the lending business because of the interaction between supply and ultimately the performance and things that make
their way into consumers and credit performance and things over time in what I call kind of the physics of how cycles
work.
The spender business is one that when I get concerned about supply and the intensity of competition, it's not a concern
that is going to ripple into credit performance. It's all a matter of the level of competition, how much it costs to get
accounts, how we go out and market to get those accounts, what is the prevailing level of rewards that people are
offering, and in the end, what choices should we be making.
So, let me now comment about that business. That has also – and it will be a surprise to that no one that I say this – that
has also become more competitively intense. You have seen some players on the cash back side kind of raise their
offers up to a level higher than they were before and more consistent with some of the industry leaders there. You've
seen on the – probably the most intensity has come at the very top of the market going right after the very heavy
spenders, and that's a very [ph] prized (32:58) customer segment. It's also very tough to prevail in that space, and that's
very competitive.
So we have said all along this market – I can't remember the last time I said that this market is not that competitive. I
think it is very, very competitive, and it is particularly competitive at this moment. Now when we look at this – and you
made a comment about our role in this whole thing. I mean, there are a few players who I think have gone very heavy
into the spender business, and we are one of them. And all of us are contributing to that competitive intensity.
But one thing I have found over the years – and I believe so strongly about this business – this is a business that's about
sustained commitment and building of a brand, building of a customer experience that is at the very high-end a digital

experience now that becomes very, very important in this thing. It's about the building of brand, the marketing
capabilities, and also product offer.
Now, it is not our view to just go rush out and just keep changing product offers constantly. It is our view that we need
a very good offer, which I think we have across our businesses, and then the leverage is in really being great across the
dimensions that I mentioned.
With all of that said, while the competition is intense, we continue to grow that business significantly. We continue to
really like what is happening to our customers when we get them and their balances, their utilization, the percentage
that are first-in-wallet and a lot of characteristics that are key to the success of the program.
So this is going to be competitive. I don't see a real course correction for Capital One here. I think that we are
continuing to be one of the players that's going hard at this space, and I think that we continue to see everything that we
see as consistent where this is very value creating and generating of great long-term annuities.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Thanks. Just as a somewhat unrelated follow-up, on the auto bankruptcy, Scott, did you
say like what caused – what triggered this, and over what period of time it would have otherwise been reported?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah, Moshe. Thanks for the question. Let me just kind of run through a summary of what
we're doing. So the bankruptcy change is accelerating charge-off timing for certain bankruptcy accounts. So, starting in
2017, within 60 days of receiving a notification of bankruptcy, we're going to charge that loan down to collateral value
regardless of payment status.
The net impact of that, as you might be able to figure out, is that we'll accelerate the charge-off timing, and then we're
subsequently going to have an increase in recoveries. So we would expect that over time those things are basically
going to start to offset each other.
The change here is really an accounting shift and doesn't reflect a change in what we're seeing in the business or our
expectations of recoveries or cash flows. We are still working through some of the process changes to implement that,
so there's a bit of uncertainty as to when the exact impact will show up in charge-offs.
You'll see this and a few other accounting process change we're making, they're going to start impacting the Auto
charge-offs really in the first half of 2017. You're going to see kind of a one-time larger impact as we process our
current portfolio of [ph] BK (37:00) loans. That'll show up in the monthly metrics. We're going to put a marker on that
so that you can see it.
And then in terms of why, really this is something where I think our past practice has been pretty much where others
have been in the industry. We're moving to a more conservative practice. I think that's really consistent with how
regulators prefer big banks like us to manage things.

Next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey. Good evening, guys. Rich, in the past, you used a phrase, uncoiling the spring. I'm not sure
if you referenced solid EPS growth on the call. But I was wondering do you still feel confident that we could see an
acceleration in EPS growth or do you feel like the competitive pressures that you talked about from either the window
closening or too much supply coming to the market are going to prevent us from inevitably seeing that?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I feel great about our prospects for generating earnings power from the coiled spring of
growth that really three years of growth in the card business where we have gone all in to seize the opportunity when
we really like this opportunity and you have watched the pretty breathtaking upfront costs of doing that, particularly in
terms of – on the credit side, both to the front loaded – the front loaded nature of credit costs in what we originate, but

then, of course, that even being more front loaded by the allowance builds that precede that.
So that creates quite a coiled spring of earnings power. And while it is true that the industry dynamics always are at
play here, I think there's a lot of coiled earnings power here and while the precise levels of exactly how it delivers itself
always depends on industry things, too. This is a pretty big effect and I do look forward to having, in a sense, the
potential energy that's been stored up in this spring to turn into the kinetic energy of earnings.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. Maybe just one follow-up. Rich, you talked about all the progress that you made on
efficiency this year with over 160 basis points. When I think about the outlook today versus the last time we heard you
speak, we've obviously seen the outlook for interest rates improve a lot, which I know historically was a headwind to
efficiency gains in prior years. You talked about $160 million of branch optimization costs, which I would assume
likely won't repeat. Can you just give us a sense of what are the incremental investments that you're being forced to
make that are preventing you from making further efficiency gains this year relative to what you did in 2016? Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So I don't feel we're being forced to make a lot of incremental investments. We are
certainly continuing to invest. Important places we're investing is, as we talked many, many times, is on the digital side
and, as I've said for a long time, the digital transformation of us really into – to operating like a technology company,
that's not a one or two or three years' thing. That is a transformation that in many ways is a lifetime transformation
because the world will continue to change. What I do want to say about that, though, is while we continue to invest in
that business, the very visible – well, there are many benefits including growth and customer experience and ability to
have an increasingly well-controlled environment and compliance, the associate experience and all the stuff there are
many benefits.
The meter, if you will, of visible cost benefits that we're able to achieve directly as a result of the digital investments,
that meter is also growing, too. So we don't have any change to share with you in terms of our outlook in the near-term
relative to efficiency ratio. But what we see even as we continue to invest in digital, the growing benefit that, one of
which is on the cost side, I think it is going to be a good guide that's going to help us over the long term continue to
achieve increased efficiency in the company, even as we also go out and capitalize on the enormous benefit that come
from this digital transformation.

Next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good evening.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Good evening, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey, a question just on the efficiency topic you were talking about. Expectation is
that it remains around 52%, which, what I hear in that is that you're expecting any expense build is going to be in line
with revenues, or is it the other way around? I mean, with marketing in particular, do you anticipate maybe a near-term
continuation of an uplift driving revenues and then feeding the revenue growth behind it to hit that 52%?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: First of all, I want to say the guidance is in the 52s, plus or minus a reasonable variance
of uncertainty there. So we do believe that we are continuing to capitalize on the growth window. I think our marketing
investment is going to be still pretty significant when you look at the competitive levels on the one hand, but also the
opportunity on the other hand. I think marketing investment is certainly going to be there and I've commented on some
of the other investments. But I think when you pull up on all of it, which is a growth agenda, an investment agenda, and
a whole bunch of savings that are also happening in the mix-master, it nets out to an expectation of efficiency ratio in
the 52s over the near-term.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then on the provision side, you talked about Domestic Card 4.5%-ish, in that
range. Is that – we get typical seasonality throughout the year, I would expect, but is there anything else that would

drive how that NCO is likely to traject throughout the year besides just seasonality?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So, the two things – so seasonality, we would expect to be the typical seasonality
effect. We have talked about growth math on an annual basis that growth math being the upward pressure on
charge-offs that comes from the seasoning of this front book of substantial originations. So we've described its biggest
effect is in 2016. It still has an important effect in 2017 and then it becomes pretty modest after that. That's speaking
one year at a time. If you look within a year, it tends to move – that it's a bigger effect in the first part of this year than
it is in the latter part of the year just not as a seasonal thing, but consistent with the fact that this is gradually
diminishing as an effect. So that in addition to seasonality, I think it's useful to put a little slope on the growth math
effect over the course of the year.
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Hey, one thing – Betsy, this is Scott. One thing I do want to clarify. Our guidance is that
losses in 2017 are going to be in the mid 4s. I think you've put out a point that's been we've intentionally used mid 4s.

Next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of small follow-ups on Auto. Rich, you
mentioned that the competitive environment there is improving a little bit and I think you made similar commentary
last quarter. So [indiscernible] (46:22) understand in what form you're seeing that? Is that on pricing or on rate or how
is that manifesting itself?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. First of all, we should use small letters, not capital letters with respect to this
effect. And we made a pretty big deal. We spoke with some alarm really about a year ago and you may remember it
was in the year-ago quarter that our originations – I think our subprime originations dropped, and they dropped pretty
materially at that time because we were alarmed about the underwriting practices that we started to see in the
marketplace, not by most players, but on a more isolated but important basis we saw in one or two cases – one or two
competitors. That was more of a subprime phenomenon. It related to the amount of documentation and data that was
going to be required to underwrite a loan and willingness to do it on a more low-doc basis, which we didn't want to go
there.
That has not disappeared. That has mitigated, if you will, so that we see the effect, but it is not as rampant as it was a
year ago. So that is improving with a small i, if you will, okay? But we certainly don't – and then the other thing that's
going on I think in the prime part of the marketplace, which has been very competitive, in many ways probably a little
bit more competitive than cycle average, if you look at some of the effects on the margin side. I think there might be
just a tiny bit of easing, maybe about related to – and I'm speculating here with respect to maybe certain capital
requirements for players and the attractiveness of prime auto relative to that.
This is, again, a relatively small effect, but certainly I would say the kind of steadily increasing pressure competitively
on the prime side has lightened up a little bit. But it's not a big effect, but it was enough that we who – especially when
we talk about the Auto business, we take what the market will give us and we don't take anything more than it will give
us, and in the context of that, we've just found that this year it's got a little bit more to give us.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks for that. And just on the – backing out the bankruptcy effect from this change
in recognition, is there any change in your underlying view on credit evolution?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: No. So if you separate that effect, we have said even – obviously, the bankruptcy
accounting effect raises the expected number for next year. If you take that effect out, we do still expect that our
charge-offs will be higher next year than this year. This is actually just a continuation of the kind of normalizing effect
that's been going on for a number of years. And as we've mentioned over the years, we have seen probably over the last
few years just each year's successive vintage coming in just a little bit higher in terms of credit losses than the year

before. All very much consistent with very good business and all of that, and it's again the natural physics of kind of
how the marketplace works.
And the other thing on Capital One's loss rate is that we have for years our prime percentage in our portfolio has been
going up. And so that's been an offsetting factor in the loss rate. But as we've said over a number of years, there's still
this gradual normalization that's going on, and we still feel very good about the opportunity in the business.

<A - R. Scott Blackley>: I just want to pile on. I mentioned this earlier, but I just want to reiterate that the change that
we made in accounting really was not associated with a new or different view about recoveries or how we look at that,
and really was just moving to a more conservative process in that business.

Next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. On the net interchange growth just 1%, I understand that it
can be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I just want to make sure I'm clear here that roughly 9% growth for the
year, is that a good run rate? And can you just help us figure out or explain what drives that quarter-to-quarter
volatility? I think in the past it may have been expansion of rewards programs or tweaking rewards programs just given
the level of investor concern about rewards costs these days. Any comment there would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. So, first of all, the – and we've always said the quarterly, this thing bounces all
over the place and is – you can't draw a lot. So I want to talk a little bit about the volatility and then let's talk about sort
of the bigger picture, though, trends that are going on.
So quarterly, it can fluctuate because, in individual quarters, we update our rewards liability based on points earned and
redeemed, redemption mix, redemption rates. It includes partnership contractual payments, international card,
consumer bank net interchange, and so there are a lot of things that go into the quarterly number.
What we have said is this phenomenon of interchange – net interchange growth being well below purchase volume
growth I think is something that while individual quarters can bounce around, that is a real effect that's been going on
for the last couple of years, and we would expect it to continue.
We're building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers. We're
extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. Very importantly, of course, we're
originating a lot of new business with strong flagship products like Quicksilver, Venture, our Spark product for small
business that have very attractive rewards.
So, our continued investment in the business and continuing to build a franchise, that effect will continue. The other
thing that has gone on on a rolling basis over the course of the past three or four quarters is what's happened with
respect to a few – a small number of merchant deals where interchange was renegotiated downward. And there's two
ways that plays into our portfolio. One is when the interchange rate drops, obviously, we feel that effect. But there is
kind of a lasting effect too because the handful of merchants where this interchange became lower are also growing
faster than the economy, and so their growth will over time continue to roll through our numbers.
So pulling way up, we continue to be very bullish about the opportunity to grow our spender business. All of our
calculations are with our eyes wide open about the fact that net interchange growth is going to lag the pretty
eye-popping growth we've been able to get on the rewards side of the business. But when we incorporate the full
economics of our spenders – and we have years and years of experience with this and lots of tests and rollouts and
many, many things that the integrated economics for Capital One, given the franchise that we have built, I think
continues to be very attractive even in the context where there is – will be a delta between purchase volume growth and
net interchange growth, at least in the foreseeable future.

<Q - Christopher Brendler>: That's helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up on a related basis [indiscernible]
(56:16). The UK business has seen some interchange reductions. I assume that's filtering through there. But I'm
surprised international card was not broken out separately in the release. Any signaling there? And also, I'm also
surprised that the weaker pound isn't having a more dramatic effect on the outstandings in that segment just because it
would seem like the underlying growth actually is a little stronger just given how much the pound has been hit.
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Hey, Chris. This is Scott. Yeah. So, on the international, given that that component of our
total card business has just gotten and continue to be smaller and smaller, we no longer felt like it was important and
material for us to break that out separately. So, going forward, you'll see us having total card and Domestic Card. We're
not going to separately break out Canada or the UK. So you'll see that kind of working its way through our monthly
metrics and the rest of our financial reporting starting with our 10-K.

Next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Rich, I wanted to follow up on your comments around subprime growth in card. In
looking through the public filings, it doesn't seem like the larger players are increasing their sub-660 FICO exposure, so
I wondered whether you were perhaps seeing smaller players growing in subprime. Can you comment on where the
supply is coming from?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: It is coming from all of the above. It is definitely coming in some of the larger players,
and I can't speak to their back books. What I can speak to is the good, solid data we have on what is happening in the
origination marketplace, and there has been – and the data that I gave you that is excludes Capital One, therefore, by
definition is the industry.
And I think you've actually seen a player or two comment on stepping up a little bit here. I don't want to overdose with
the point. This is off a relatively small base, and it is in the context of some other players also growing probably across
the board all the way from the top of the market on – but there is a tail that is extending into the below-660 marketplace
that is real, and these are real customers picking up more debt. And we also validate this too when we look – we can
follow the industry's trends with our own customers by looking at the credit while – beyond looking at our own
customers and what are their balances, we look on collectively all of their credit bureau reports and see what's
happening there, and we see the same phenomenon that is in the industry data. It would be shocking if we didn't, but we
can see some increase – and these are relatively small effects, but some increase in indebtedness, for example, in our
own customer base.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, if I could throw in a question about
capital? If we were to stick with standardized, how much room is there for your CET1 ratio to fall below, call it, the
10% range? Obviously, some regionals are running below that, but they don't have as much exposure in cards. So I was
hoping you could share with us a little bit about how you're thinking about that?
<A - Jeff Norris>: Yeah. I don't want to front run the process on capital. I think we understand the importance of
capital return. I think we've been very creative in our process, whether it was I think the first-to-use the de minimis
exception last year, front loading stock repurchases this year at attractive valuations.
I think one of the things we're actually most pleased about is the fact that we've been able to put a lot of capital to work
organically in acquisitions, which I know this is a market that particularly in the financial services industry, good
growth has been hard to come by.
So I'll end where Rich ended his prepared comments. With the profitability that we have, we believe we can both
continue to fund growth and return a good amount of capital to our investors, and we think we can do that even though
there's still a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment with respect to the regulatory front, how CCAR's going to

Next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question. Scott, maybe just a quick one for you. In terms of the
bankruptcy change, I just want to make sure that what I think you're saying is that the reserves that you took in this
quarter are basically the entire effect that you think you'll see in terms of the provision that will be needed for the Auto
portfolio? And going forward, it's just effectively business as usual in that business other than the bankruptcy effect on
the loss rate itself. Correct?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Matt, you've got that right. And just to kind of repeat that to make sure we've got that clear.
So, the allowance build reflected kind of the change that we saw in accelerating losses into the allowance window. So I
think that's going to cover the vast majority of the effect. As I mentioned, we'll start to see recoveries come in over time
and offset that increase [indiscernible] (01:02:37). So you will see a bubble in 2017 and then you'll see that start to
settle down.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then for my follow-up just a question on the revenue margin. Obviously,
that came down about 30 basis points this year, year-versus-year because of the UK portfolio. How are you thinking
about that margin going forward? Is there going to be the same effect on revenue margin in the card business from the
UK portfolio in 2017 as we saw in 2016?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, Matt, I'm sorry. Just to clarify. Are you talking about the year-over-year decline in
the Domestic Card revenue margins?
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Yes.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, the Domestic Card revenue margin wouldn't be affected by UK's PPI?
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. My mistake. But is your outlook for that going to be basically flat or is it going
to continue to come down because of competitive pressures?
<A - Jeff Norris>: Matt, we haven't really gotten into forecasting revenue margin by line of business. I think what
we've done is kind of pulled up and look at the things that are driving margin for the company overall, in general, rate
is going to be a positive, assuming forwards play out the way that they have. That hasn't happened in the past, but I
think there's more feeling that rates could actually mature the way that the forwards are expected. I mean, if you look,
we've gotten benefits from a higher mix of card and a lower mix of mortgage, so I'll let you make your own forecast
there in terms of mix probably being a beneficiary. There have been some, as Rich mentioned, these were throughout
his comments there's also been a little bit of rate pressure on Auto and normalization there.
So it's kind of some – the story hasn't really changed over the last couple of years. We've gone out and made big
predictions about potential changes in revenue margin and ultimately they've been pretty flat, so that's made us a little
bit less bold. I think you have all of the factors that you have to think about the major things that are going to drive net
interest margin for the company.

<Q - Kenneth Matthew Bruce>: Thanks. Good evening. Appreciate all your comments and trying to tease out some
of the moving pieces here. I guess, in the context of transactors, in particular you kind of point out that the economics
of that business are still very attractive. I think many of us are concerned that they look attractive to everybody and so
there's going to continue to be this pressure on the rewards and the various incentives used to kind of acquire those
cards. Is there a way to frame in your mind kind of how that annuity looks today versus maybe five years prior to now?
Does it take you 30% longer to effectively have a positive NPV out of those cards? Can you give us some sense as to
how it's kind of the timeliness of the economics on that business?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Ken, look, I think these annuities – look, I want to go back to – this has been incredibly
intensely competitive for a long time. There's a flurry right now with respect to a few products, some breathtaking
giveaways in terms of, for a period of time, upfront miles and things like that, but the – first of all, I've just seen this
thing ebb and flow over time a lot.
The second thing I would say is, in many ways, our own – when we look at these annuities, in many ways, they are
improving every year for Capital One because of the investments that we're making to really build the business. I want
to go back to the part that I think you all see – the world see so much is what is being offered in terms of rewards and,
obviously, that has become more competitive. But the – I mean, for the last several years, we've been offering pretty
much the same rewards products and so we've already internalizing those economics.
The reason I say this is an all-in business that it doesn't work to just bounce in and bounce out is what's incredibly
important is things like how long these annuities last, what is the attrition rate, what is the first-in-wallet rate, what is
the mix, the profile of how heavy your spenders are when you're getting them, what are happening to customer metrics
on customer satisfaction, Net Promoter Scores, the digital experience. And we have had nothing but progress
year-after-year on this and our own annuities are actually getting better and better and actually more economically
attractive. It's not to say I don't worry a lot about competition and focus on that and we talk about it all the time, but this
is about franchises and people can't will themselves into franchises overnight. It's taken us a number of years to build it
and I have a lot of respect for the competitors who are going after this space. And, I mean, there's some great players
that are doing this. But this is an attractive business for those who have built a franchise. And I'm as excited today
about it as I was three months ago, six months ago and one year ago.
<Q - Kenneth Matthew Bruce>: Understood. I think I get a sense of that. Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Looking
at the subprime growth in the portfolio, it's been roughly over two times the prime growth on the revolver side U.S.
card business. And I can hear the caution that you're trying to lead us to in terms of where we are in the cycle, I
appreciate that. Does, in your mind, that need to slow in order to achieve some of the lower growth math impacts that
you're talking about for 2017 and 2018?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Ken, you've known me for many, many years. I mean, we obsess in the best of times, we
obsess about everything credit because in the worst of times, it's too late to be obsessing about everything credit. So I
remember one of our – our leading investor called me Doctor Doom in the 1990s because I kept focusing on that, even
though we were in such an amazing kind of boom time. My point is, is these are all effects that play out over a course
of years. My real point has been that just people need to watch all the metrics, as I've been saying for a lot of quarters.
And we really believe there is power that you can manage. To say something I said earlier, it's hard to predict economic
cycles, but there's a lot of leverage in managing within the credit cycle.
And so I give you a calibration of where we see the marketplace is. It means that we add probably even an extra layer
of caution in our own originations and in our choices. To the earlier question, does that impact growth? I mean, in some
sense, all other things being equal, it slows down growth a bit. But with all of that going on, we've been talking about
this and anticipating this in our interactions for a long period of time.

power and the growth math that are associated with how that plays out is a real phenomenon that I think has a lot of
value creation baked into that. And we continue to be bullish about the business and about our prospects to deliver
some nice numbers for our investors.
