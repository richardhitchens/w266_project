MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Medtronic's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead.
Ryan Weispfenning
Great. Thank you, Darla. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During
the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief
Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 28, 2017. After our
prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our
performance and outlook, as well as details related to our patient care, nutritional insufficiency and DVT divestiture to
Cardinal Health.
During this earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual
results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information
concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we

of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter
of fiscal year 2017, and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS
growth and guidance does not include any changes or gain – charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP
adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables
included with our press release.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar?
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter
revenue of $7.4 billion, representing growth of 4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12, growing at 11%.
Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our underlying businesses and the stable growth of our markets, as well as
the diversification benefit of our groups and regions. While the temporary census supply constraint and an IT disruption
affected the first quarter revenue growth, we continued to drive operating margin expansion. This margin improvement,
combined with the previously communicated tax benefit this quarter, translated into strong earnings leverage. And
looking ahead, we have now entered a period of clear acceleration in our innovation cycle, and we expect to see
increasing revenue momentum from several important new product launches over the balance of the fiscal year.
Before discussing the details of the meaningful progress we're making in each of the – in each of our growth strategies,
let me briefly cover two specific issues that affected our first quarter performance.
In our Diabetes Group, we're experiencing strong demand around the world for our new diabetes technology. This
demand is the direct result of our differentiated strategy to move toward fully closed-loop systems, which utilize our
algorithms and CGM sensors to automate insulin dosing. We launched the MiniMed 640G in international markets in
2015 and the world's first hybrid closed-loop system, the MiniMed 670G with Guardian Sensor 3 the U.S. in June.
These advancements have increased our installed base and market share, resulting in a large increase in CGM demand,
above our already high expectations.
To put it in perspective, in just the past 10 quarters since launching the 640G, our overall sensor unit demand has more
than doubled. The increased demand is largely for the new, highly accurate generation of sensors, the enhanced Enlite
in international markets, and the Guardian Sensor 3 in the U.S. and has temporarily outstripped our production
capacity.
We accelerated plans to increase sensor production capacity last year, but these lines are not expected to be ready for
commercial production until our fourth quarter; at which time, we expect to have the capacity needed to meet the
rapidly growing sensor demand. Until then, we have to prioritize sensor fulfillment toward our installed base of
customers. In the short-term, this leaves less available for higher revenue generating new patient system sales.
It's also important to note that our Priority Access Program, necessitated by the early approval of the 670G which
allowed customers to purchase a 630G and then swap it for a 670G once available for a small fee, has been very
successful with close to 32,000 enrollees, exceeding our original expectations.
However, because we only recognized a small portion of deferred revenue when exchanging the pumps, the program
currently affects both revenue and margins. We expect to complete fulfillment to our Priority Access customers later
this fall.
Toward the end of the fiscal year, we expect our Diabetes Group to be in a position to capitalize on its differentiated
innovation in the marketplace, with stronger revenue and profit growth not only from increasing sales of our leading
insulin pump technology, but also ongoing sensor annuity revenue.

Next, let me update you on the IT system disruption that occurred in June. As we communicated over the course of the
quarter publicly, including in 8-K and 10-K filings, we experienced a global disruption to an IT system on June 19 that
affected our ability to process, ship and manufacture orders globally.
During the days following, we mobilized resources as quickly as possible to not only identify the underlying issue, but
also put in corrective measures to restore the system. As a result, our system was subsequently and fully operational
later that week.
After the system had been fully restored, we engaged Ernst & Young to conduct an independent root cause analysis in
partnership with our own technology experts and our vendor partners. The independent analysis concluded that the root
cause was due to inadvertent human error, which caused a misconfiguration within certain data storage systems and
resulted in our IT system becoming inoperable.
Both our internal analysis and the independent analysis found no evidence of external actor involvement, data exposure
or compromise in this event. Based on our internal findings and that of EY, we are taking appropriate actions to prevent
this type of event from happening again including, but not limited to, improvements aimed at IT network design,
hardware and software systems enhancements, operating processes and execution and governance.
While the IT disruption did have some impact on our overall performance for the quarter, it was not material to our
quarterly revenue or earnings per share. We continued to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS
growth, in line with our long-term expectations.
This event could have had a more significant impact in the quarter, if not for the outstanding work and commitment of
our employees around the world and the understanding and the partnership of our customers. Our team rose to the
occasion to ensure product was available to customers and patients during the disruption, and then worked tirelessly to
fulfill backlog that built up during the event.
This resilience and around-the-clock commitment of our Medtronic team made all the difference and ultimately
allowed us to return to normal operations expeditiously and effectively. There is no longer any outstanding backlog
associated with this event, and our IT system is operating normally. We're pleased to put this event behind us.
Now, let's discuss each of our growth strategies: therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. In therapy
innovation, we are seeing strong adoption of our innovative new products across all of our business groups. In our
Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 6%, we're leveraging the breadth of our products and services, as well as our
strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth.
In the first quarter, transcatheter valves, AF ablation, LVADs, transcatheter pacing systems, insertable diagnostics,
atherectomy and drug-coated balloons, all contributed to CVG's strong performance.
In TAVR, we delivered growth in the high-30s in both the U.S. and international markets. And looking ahead, we
expect our recent U.S. FDA approval for intermediate risk and global rollout of our Evolut PRO valve to drive
continued TAVR growth.
In Coronary, we gained drug-eluting stent share with our recently-approved Resolute Onyx in both the U.S. and Japan,
and we expect this product to increasingly drive meaningful Coronary growth as we go through the fiscal year.
Next, our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 3%, or 5% after adjusting for the divested businesses that will no
longer be part of our reported results starting in the second quarter with mid-single digit growth in our Surgical
Solutions division driven by new products in Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling.
In Advanced Energy, we continue to roll out the new LigaSure instruments in our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In
Advanced Stapling, our endo stapling specialty reloads with the Tri-Staple technology, are driving growth. We also
continue to roll out Signia, our new single-handed powered surgical stapling system that provide surgeons with
real-time feedback during surgery. These innovations are providing momentum to the transition from open surgical
procedures to minimally invasive procedures, or MIS, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.

At the end of this fiscal year, we intend to further our goal of moving procedures from open to MIS with the first
in-human use of our surgical robot platform. We look forward to bringing a more comprehensive value proposition to
our customers across all key surgical areas: open surgery, traditional MIS, robotic surgery, and services.
Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 2% this quarter. And within RTG, our Spine division grew 1%. We estimate
that both the U.S. and global spine markets have slowed modestly. However, we continue to gain market share, which
we attribute to the success of our Speed-to-Scale new product launch initiative. We also continue to gain market
traction with our Surgical Synergy strategy, growing the number of customer contracts that combine our spine implants
with capital equipment for imaging, navigation and powered surgical instrumentation sold by Neurosurgery business.
Our Brain Therapies division grew 7%, driven by high-teens growth in Neurovascular and high-single digit growth in
Neurosurgery. Brain Therapies continues to see traction from our recently launched StealthStation S8 surgical
navigation system and strong low-30s growth of our Solitaire family of revascularization devices for acute ischemic
stroke.
Turning to Diabetes. While revenue growth declined 1% given the reasons mentioned earlier, we gained global durable
pump and consumable share, driven by significant clinician and customer demand for our 6-series pumps. CGM
revenue grew in the low-20s, including growth of nearly 50% in international markets driven by demand for our
sensor-augmented pumps and improved sensors.
The Guardian Sensor 3s coming off our production line consistently demonstrate a MARD, which is a measure of
sensor accuracy, of 10.4% in a real-world setting in line with the performance we saw in the pivotal studies, but with a
much larger sample size.
Next, let's turn to our globalization growth strategy. Emerging markets grew 12%, in line with our long-term
double-digit growth expectations, as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. Our
consistent emerging markets performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification with strong results
across the globe.
Latin America grew 16%, with double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. We had continued strong
results in China, growing above the market with 12% growth as we continue to consistently perform in a complex
environment that we believe will become one of our largest markets. Southeast Asia delivered 12% growth with
Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand all delivering robust results. In the Middle East, we grew 12%, as we begin to see
recovery in the region. In particular, Saudi Arabia grew in the mid-30s, our first quarter of growth in six quarters, as
customer inventory levels appeared to have normalized and hospitals have begun to purchase again.
Let's turn now to our third growth strategy, economic value. We've continued to see success in our Hospital Solutions
business, which grew double digits as we are now managing cath labs and operating rooms for nearly 140 customers
around the world, including our first in Mexico.
We're also seeing strong growth in our TYRX value-based program for infection control in implantable devices, more
than doubling the accounts under contract in the quarter to 325. Now, approximately 10% of our U.S. CRHF
implantables revenue is covered under a TYRX-related value-based healthcare risk sharing arrangement.
In Diabetes, we were pleased to announce a new outcomes-based agreement with Aetna, where a component of our
pump reimbursement will now be successfully meeting clinical-improvement thresholds. We're aggressively
developing other unique value-based healthcare solutions across each of our groups. While we are still early in this
journey, we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improve patient
outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients and healthcare systems as well
as our shareholders.
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to highlight that we closed our transaction with Cardinal Health in the
beginning of the second fiscal quarter, divesting a portion of our Patient Monitoring & Recovery division. We expect
this transaction to have a positive impact on our revenue growth rates and margins with modest near-term earnings
dilution. We remain committed to the disciplined portfolio management and capital deployment that balances return to

shareholders with reinvestment in internal and external opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategies and are
expected to drive strong financial returns.
With that, let me ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials and outlook for the
remainder of the fiscal year. Karen?
Karen L. Parkhill
Thank you, Omar. As Omar mentioned, our first quarter revenue of $7.39 billion represented an approximate [audio
gap] (15:25) reported and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a negative $33 million
impact on first quarter revenue, and tuck-in acquisitions completed almost a year ago contributed approximately 140
basis points to revenue growth, driven in part by the benefit gained from Medtronic ownership.
Our revenue fell just shy of 4% growth by approximately $30 million on a total of $7.4 billion. When we updated our
guidance in July, we expected our revenue would be slightly higher, but the IT disruption caused a unique dynamic,
affecting our visibility through quarter-end as we worked to clear the order backlog, including higher-than-expected
sensor demand in Diabetes. And as you know, given the buying patterns of our customers, we tend to have a larger
amount of sales in the last few weeks of every quarter in some of our businesses.
Importantly, as Omar mentioned, the IT system disruption is behind us, and we are seeing strong demand for our new
technologies, giving us confidence in our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year.
In the quarter, we delivered continued operating margin expansion and strong EPS leverage. GAAP diluted earnings
per share were $0.74. Non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.02 negative impact from foreign currency,
non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 11%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 26.9% on a constant currency basis,
representing a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points. With the impact of currency included, our first quarter
non-GAAP operating margin also improved, increasing 10 basis points year-over-year.
Taking into account currency and the acquisitions that we have done in the past year, our operating margin
improvement on an organic basis was approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. The operating margin improvement
was driven by efficiencies, as we continue to deliver on our Covidien synergies. This was partially offset by purposeful
investments we are making in sales and marketing in the first half of the fiscal year to support new product launches.
Net other expense, which is included in our operating margin, was $66 million compared to $39 million in the prior
year and negatively affected our operating margin improvement by 30 basis points. The increase in net other expense
was due in part to foreign exchange re-measurement and our hedging program, which combined were a $5-million loss
in the quarter versus the $4-million gain in the prior year.
Looking ahead, we expect net other expense to be approximately $110 million per quarter and slightly higher than that
in the second quarter. This includes approximately $30 million to $40 million per quarter of hedging expense based on
recent exchange rates. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $194 million, slightly less than our
original expectations as income earned on our cash investments helped to offset debt expense.
Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $180 million to $200 million a quarter. Our
non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 13% and benefited from $47 million in operational tax adjustments that became
evident and were communicated late in the quarter. Excluding these adjustments, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate
would have been 15.7%, in line with our expectation between 15.5% and 16.5% for the remainder of the year.
First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.376 billion shares. We repurchased a net $1.1
billion of our ordinary shares in the first quarter executing the annual return commitment to shareholders, including our
incremental $5 billion commitment announced in January 2016. And pulling forward some of our incremental $1
billion repurchase commitment from our divestiture to Cardinal Health given our lower stock price. We expect shares
to continue to come down in Q2 and then stay roughly flat for the remainder of the year given our tendency to purchase
shares earlier in the fiscal year.

In June, we increased our cash dividend by 7% making this our 40th consecutive year delivering a dividend increase.
Combining our share repurchase activity with the $625 million we've paid in dividends in the first quarter, our total
payout ratio was 111% on non-GAAP net income and 169% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio it is
elevated as we tend to execute the majority of our annually planned share repurchases early in the fiscal year. Before
turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual guidance and update it with the completion of our
divestiture to Cardinal Health, which occurred at the start of our second quarter.
For fiscal year 2018, we expect comparable constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%, which
removes the divested revenue from the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017 as well as the impact of
currency. On a comparable basis, the divestiture is expected to result in more than a 30-basis point improvement given
the partial year impact to our fiscal 2018 revenue growth. This translates into a full year annualized recurring growth
rate benefit of approximately 50 basis points as highlighted previously.
While we recognized the divestiture as a positive impact to our guidance range, the current supply constraint in
Diabetes will continue to impact growth in that business until later this fiscal year.
Looking at revenue growth by our business groups, for CVG quarterly growth rates have typically been between 4%
and 7% in recent years. Given the strength of its near-term pipeline and easing prior-year comparison, we now expect
CVG to grow in the upper half of its historical range for the full fiscal year. We expect CVG's growth to be strong in
the second and third quarters before facing a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter.
MITG has typically reported growth rates between 3% and 4%, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and the
divestiture is expected to increase growth by about 1 point. In fiscal 2018, given the partial year impact of the
divestiture and lower growth in the first quarter, we now expect MITG to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
For RTG, quarterly growth has typically been in the 3% to 5% range in recent years. Balancing strong growth in Brain
Therapies against competitive challenges, and Pain Therapies, and the strengthening share position in a relatively flat
spine market, we now expect full year – full fiscal year growth for RTG to be at the low end of this historical range.
Finally, in our Diabetes Group, historical growth before the recent market disruption was typically in the high single
digits to low double digits. With the impact of the temporary supply constraint, we now expect Diabetes to grow in the
range of 1% to 4% this fiscal year, with improvement in the second half as we fulfill the new 670G to non-Priority
Access customers in the third quarter and increase our sensor supply in the fourth quarter. While the growth
acceleration has been delayed by a few quarters, we expect to enter fiscal year 2019 with ultimate strong double-digit
growth in Diabetes.
Looking at the second quarter, we would expect to be in the lower half of our annual revenue growth range on a
comparable constant-currency basis, with accelerating growth in CVG offset by a decline in Diabetes in the high-single
digits. Diabetes revenue is expected to temporarily decline sequentially before improving in the back half of the year
for two reasons. First, we expect less deferred revenue recognition in the second quarter from our Priority Access
Program as more pump shipments associated with this program occurred in the first quarter.
Second, while we will be able to fulfill new 670G customers after we fulfill the Priority Access customers, we
anticipate that new sales will be muted until we can ultimately fulfill sensors with pumps. Only a limited amount of
patients are likely to be willing to purchase a pump and wait for the sensors.
With regard to operating margin, we expect solid improvement in the fiscal year with greater strength in the back half.
We expect our gross margin on a comparable constant-currency basis to be flat for the year with modest pricing
pressure offset by operating improvement.
SG&A as a percent of revenue is expected to improve, particularly in the back half of the year as we continue to
execute on margin expansion opportunities and enabling functions, transition to centers of excellence and optimize our
distribution channel.
With respect to earnings, we continue to expect fiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range
of 9% to 10% on a comparable constant-currency basis.

For the second quarter, we would expect temporary year-over-year decline in our gross and operating margin, leading
to EPS growth flat to slightly up on a comparable constant-currency basis, given the continued investments we are
making to support product launches, the impact of temporary revenue declines in Diabetes, and the operational tax
benefits we received in the prior year that are not expected to repeat. However, we continue to expect EPS growth and
operating margin expansion to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year.
While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, if recent exchange rates, which
include €1.18 and ¥109, remain stable for the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by
approximately $380 million to $480 million, including an approximate $25 million to $75 million tailwind in the
second quarter. Full year EPS would be affected by approximately negative $0.03 to a positive $0.01, including a
positive impact of approximately $0.00 to $0.02 in the second quarter.
Finally, regarding free cash flow, we continue to expect it to grow in the high-single digits compounded annually from
fiscal 2016 to 2018, albeit now on a comparable basis given the divestiture. To compare, you should adjust for items
that are considered part of the divestiture net proceeds like tax and transaction costs that affect free cash flow. These
are expected to be approximately $400 million this fiscal year and $200 million next year.
In addition, you should adjust for the loss of free cash flow generated by the divested businesses, which was
approximately $100 million per quarter. Without these adjustments, free cash flow is expected to grow in the low single
digits compounded annually from fiscal year 2016 to 2018.
Now, I will turn the call back to Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Karen. And looking ahead to the remainder of our fiscal year, we have confidence in our guidance and
visibility into the acceleration in our innovation cycle as we see momentum coming from several new product launches
this fiscal year. And let me remind you of a few of them.
In CVG, we now have intermediate risk approval in TAVR and are launching our new Evolut PRO valve. We're also in
the early stages of market launch for our new Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent, our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System
and our MR-conditional quadripolar CRT pacemakers in our largest global markets.
As we enter the back half of the fiscal year, we expect to launch HVAD destination therapy and our next-generation
Azure wireless pacemaker family in the U.S., as well as the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon in Japan.
In MITG, as I mentioned earlier, we're launching our Signia-powered surgical stapling system and gearing up to release
our surgical robot platform later this year. In RTG, our product refresh in Spine continues, and we're preparing to
launch our SOLERA VOYAGER 5.5/6.0 Fixation System. We're also seeing great traction with our StealthStation S8
navigation system and our continued partnership with Mazor and their Mazor X system.
And in our Diabetes group, in addition to ramping up the 670G hybrid closed-loop launch, we are also preparing to
launch our stand-alone CGM system, Guardian Connect, in the U.S. later this year which will be combined with our
Sugar.IQ app that utilizes IBM Watson cognitive computing.
Let's now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan
Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes group,
to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one
question and, if necessary, a related follow up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor
Relations team after the call.

Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you, guys, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with two questions. So,
first, there appear to be somewhat conflicting statements, and I understand part of it is legality, on the impact of the
computer outage. So could you try and quantify it, because obviously there's a comment in your prepared remarks as
well as the press release that says that it was not material. So can you try and quantify what the impact was this quarter?
And then, second, obviously there's going to be a lot of focus on the Diabetes business in the step-down to the outlook
for the year. So can you just spend a little bit more time on what's going on with the sensors and why now we're
looking at a – effectively a backlog all the way out to the fiscal fourth quarter versus previously fall? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. Let me quickly address the Diabetes one, and then I'll let Karen address the IT system
question. From Diabetes, look, what happened is our success rate with our products, which all have now sensor
management, has actually been very high, not only with the 670G here in the U.S., but also with the 640G which we
launched in Europe roughly two years ago. And that, plus the Guardian Connect in Europe has really gained traction.
And what happened is, the demand for the sensor really grows by multiple factors compared to just pump revenue.
Because for every pump, you need to supply sensors for the whole year and on an ongoing basis. And so, when you do
that demand equation, that number comes to be a very large number. And although we're accelerating the plans to add a
new line, it just takes a little longer than one would want.
I think that's all I can say, that the attachment rates are much higher than previously envisaged, that even a short while
ago we were planning. The number of customers who want the Priority Access for 670G is also significantly higher
than we were expecting. All of this leads to a multiplication of the number of sensors that are required. And when you
do the math, it just comes to a very large number, which we just couldn't fulfill immediately.
But having said that, these are all things that are in our control and we are pretty confident that by the end of the year,
we'll be – Diabetes will have – we'll be able to take advantage of these new products which actually we've been driving
to and are pretty revolutionary in their own right.
So, Karen, you want to say something on the IT?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yes. On the IT outage, very difficult to separate and quantify the impact related to the
outage. We did say that it is not material to the first quarter revenue or earnings per share. So very difficult to quantify
beyond that
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. All right, so just two follow-ups. So, one, on the sensor side, it appears part of the
problem is that as you're moving to a lower MARD, it's harder to manufacture the sensors. We all are aware of that. But
it sounds like the yields aren't as good and that the reliability in terms of the life of the sensors isn't as good, so you're
having to include an extra sensor in the packets that you're shipping out. So can you comment on that?
And then, just the other follow-up is the change in the MITG guidance. The increase was less than we were expecting,
post the divestiture. And that part looks like to a weaker performance in general surgery this quarter. So could you just
comment on the MITG business, in effect I'm saying why didn't guidance move up more there given the divestiture?
And why was general surgery weak? Thanks, and I'll let others jump in.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. First of all, with the Diabetes, it is not an issue of yield at all. The yield is perfectly
good and in line with our expectations. And the number of sensors that are required are the standard number of sensors
that we expect for patients to cycle through. So that is really not the issue at all.
We're extremely confident in our manufacturing, the process, the yields, resulting in much more accurate sensor
performance. And this is purely an issue of acquiring capital equipment that needs to be approved by the FDA and put
in place. And when that happens, we will release sensor capacity. This has got nothing to do with any yield differential
of any sort or a need for cycle the sensors any quicker than is normally expected.

<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Yeah. Mike, the only thing I would just add to that, if you really take a look at what Omar
mentioned with respect to the dynamics, this is purely a function of increased demand, not manufacturing output or
manufacturing performance.
And maybe two statistics to keep in mind. You heard in the commentary our installed base demand for sensors in
Europe was 50%, 5-0%. We were expecting growth in Europe, but 50% was more center utilization than what we were
expecting. The second that you heard from the commentary is that there were 32,000 Priority Access patients that
signed up. That was a 30% increase versus what we expected. So this is purely a function of increased demand not, as
Omar pointed out, of anything to do with yields or lower MARD. Our MARDs are great, our yields are totally in line
with expectation; it's just our ability to meet demand, and this is a temporary thing.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Keep in mind that our diabetes patients on the 640G do not need to use the sensor attached,
but they are choosing to use it more and more often because of the accuracy with that sensor. And that is one of the
reasons that the demand was higher than we originally anticipated.
In regard to MITG, we do expect revenue growth for the year now to be 3.5% to 4.5% and that does include the
positive impact of the divestiture for the partial year of about 30 basis points. On a full year basis, we would expect that
to be about 50 basis points. So we are increasing our guidance in that business line.

It's from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Just a couple questions for me. First for Geoff and then maybe one for
Omar. Geoff, I just want to talk about just RTG kind of broadly for a second. Sort of a tale of two cities. The Core
Spine numbers to us looked better actually. I wonder if you could talk about your share momentum in Core Spine
relative to what we've seen which is industry weakness amongst to your peers in Spine. And then of course offsetting
that is SCS and DBS businesses. Just based on product cycle innovation are not doing as well, and when do you think
those businesses can begin to stabilize and why? Then I have a quick follow-up.
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: In the Spine market, we have seen a little bit of softness this last quarter. We had the
spine market growing like 1% to 2% historically. In the last two quarters Q3 and Q4 for us, we Medtronic, we were at
3% overall growth. We had a spine market that's hard for us that we're triangulating it. We don't get market data for a
couple more weeks, but based on what we can see, we have the market at relatively flat, maybe 0.5% growth. So that
definitely had an impact on us this quarter but we are still gaining share and we think it's on the strength of one, our
product releases and this whole methodology of launching them around speed to scale. And then our surgical synergies
deals, which I think will build momentum as we get – continue to expand our partnership with Mazor.
But right now, over 5.5% in the U.S. of our Core Spine volume is tied in with these capital deals and that's a growing
number. So the two factors that are driving the business, one is these product releases and we'll see that continue
throughout the year. At second half, we have a couple of new product releases coming and then launching to speed to
scale manner and then combining them with the capital equipment. And that is – obviously, when you look at it
vis-à-vis the other multi-nationals, we're performing quite a bit better. And on the pure plays, I mean, the gap has
narrowed dramatically. And as we move forward with introducing robotics into the portfolio with Mazor, I see us – and
plus our continued product launches in Core Spine, I feel good about where we are. I see positive momentum
But you're right, that's been offset by Pain Stim and DBS. And Pain Stim has been declining in that mid-single digits
even a little higher over the last couple of quarters, and the catalyst for change there is going to be INTELLIS, which
we will launch in the back half of the – in the back half of the calendar year. INTELLIS will be the smallest
implantable rechargeable system on the market, 40% smaller than our current one with the state-of-the-art programmer.

I've mentioned it's rechargeable, and it will be a faster recharge, like 75% faster than our current. And it's upgradable
and you're also able to download novel stim patterns and algorithms, which we are investing in. And you combine that
with our Evolut workflow that we launched a few quarters ago, which is definitely helping us, I think that'll stabilize
that business. And, again, we're continuing to invest in novel stim patterns, which this INTELLIS platform we'll be able
to handle.
And then, DBS, that's going to take a little bit longer. I mean, we are funding that business in terms of our R&D, but it
will be probably several quarters, over a year before some of these new innovations come to market that we've talked
about in terms of our new steerable lead, our new PC+S system, and then a very novel cranial-mounted rechargeable
system.
So, DBS is a little bit further out. And then, we see Pain Stim when that was launched. And the dynamic that shifted, as
Spine has gone up and Pain Stim has gone down, DBS was still performing. And this past quarter, it started to shrink a
little bit as Boston got on the market in Europe with their MR-compatible system.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. Thanks, Geoff. My two follow ups, one for Bryan. I don't know if I caught the
specific answer in MITG. It did look on the margin there was a little core softness in MITG across some of the major
segments. I don't know if there's anything you'd be willing to call out there.
And then for Omar, now that you've closed the divestiture, can you just kind of level set us in terms of where we should
be thinking about priorities of future free cash and the broader balance sheet, and most specifically as it relates to
buyback after you complete the $5-billion program? And then, just M&A, how investors should be thinking about your
priorities here mid-tier, larger acquisitions, or a more smaller growth innovative deals? Thanks so much.
<A - Bryan C. Hanson>: Yeah. From a margin perspective in our business, I don't see anything – it was probably still
a bit of mix in the quarter. I don't see anything that would continue there. And just real quick too on general surgery
and the question that was asked previously, it was a little lighter in the quarter likely due to surgical volumes. It reacts
more to surgical volumes than our Advanced Energy business and our Advanced business overall, and so that's why we
saw a little bit of weakness in general surgery versus what we've seen in the past. It's almost directly impacted by these
surgical volumes, and that was the reason for the softness
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And with respect to the questions for me, let me start with the acquisition strategy. Look, we
remain focused on tuck-in acquisitions today and they work for us. We've converted them into the ones that we've
done. We're converting them quite smoothly into organic growth drivers for us over time. We're not really focused
today on transformative M&A.
Remember, we're still in the last year of integration of Covidien. We just did a divestiture, the separation agreements
that we've got to follow through, so we're focused on executing these big sort of bets in many ways that we may. And
we continue to have a very disciplined approach to pursuing tuck-in acquisitions, and we intend to continue that
approach.
Over the long term, we'll continue to build value for shareholders, and we look at opportunities that are accretive to
margins and growth trajectory that support our strategic priorities. I think Karen can comment a little bit on the capital
allocation, perhaps on the buyback as well?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yeah, David. Sure. As you've heard us talk about in that past, we're focused on paying back
to our shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases, and that won't change. We're also focused on
balancing that payback with continued reinvestment in our own business so that we can continue to grow that long-term
value of Medtronic.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Thank you, David.

It from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: I just wanted to ask two questions that really sort of clarify the guidance maybe. And Karen,
to start out, this is pretty simple math, but just to confirm, the new EPS guidance for fiscal 2018 including Cardinal, by
my math based on your disclosures sums to about $4.75 to $4.80. Is that correct?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yeah, we don't comment directly on exact EPS guidance, but we do expect – continue to
expect 9% to 10% growth on the base of last year. So hopefully that's helpful.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Well, I'm just saying like you give all the moving pieces in your disclosures, and I just wanted
to make sure that we had that right. But I guess we'll – we can follow-up offline on that. But by our math, I'm around
$4.75 to $4.80.
And I guess the other EPS clarifying question that I had was that I'm just trying to reconcile the old guidance to the new
guidance and understand maybe what has changed. And I know you're now giving your growth targets off of pro forma
numbers, but I mean, your old guidance called for 9% to 10% underlying EPS growth on legacy Medtronic, and then a
$0.05 to $0.10 hit, and then you said Cardinal would be dilutive by $0.18. Those are the three sort of big pieces to your
old guidance.
And I'm just curious, could you help us understand what's changed with this new guidance? Obviously we can see that
FX has gotten better, but as I sum through all the math, it seems like something must've gotten a little bit worse, either
the Cardinal dilution or maybe the base business due to other income or Diabetes. I'm just trying to understand what's
changed relative to the old guidance and the way you used to give it.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Sure, sure. I would say that the biggest thing that's changed is in our Diabetes business and
the impact of the lower revenue growth until the end of the fiscal year given the demand and the supply constraint. And
that guidance does ultimately have an impact through the P&L, and so that does also affect the bottom line.
Beyond that, we do expect that to be offset by some better guidance in CVG than initially given, given the strength of
that new pipeline. And on an EPS perspective, we do expect that the dilutive impact of the transaction is still at $0.18
on a net basis after taking into account the use of proceeds. On a gross basis, when you're looking at the numbers that
we provide to reset your base on a gross basis, that would translate into about $0.23 dilutive before taking into account
the use of proceeds.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: And do you have a number that quantifies the impact of the Diabetes changing guidance for
this particular quarter what the impact was on organic growth?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yes, I would say that, again, difficult to give you an exact dollar amount of the impact to the
quarter of the demand and supply equation. But clearly, it did impact those to perform under what we had initially
guided for the Diabetes business last quarter.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thank you, Bob. Next question, Darla, please.

<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Hi, guys. How are you?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good. Good, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: I've missed you all. I guess I have just a couple more strategic questions. And I just want to
clarify just on Diabetes, it sounds like it's – the demand is just more overwhelmingly positive. So has this changed your
mind from a strategic perspective as far as the background just in terms of wanting to change your thoughts on going
more from a consumer level? Because if you have 30% more demand for like using the 640G with the sensors, why not
think about going more just to a consumer basis and not going more the professional route?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: This is for the sensor only? Yeah.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Yes. So, Kristin, hi. This is Hooman. It's nice to hear your voice.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Hi.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: The – let me just touch on that. First of all, it is, as we talked about, purely a demand
equation. And as you rightly pointed out, we have our Enlite 1 sensor, our Enlite enhanced sensor, our Guardian Sensor
3, all of those are experiencing strong demand, which as Omar and Karen mentioned, we are working to fill the
capacity in order to meet that demand. It doesn't change our strategy overall...
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Right.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: ... number one. So strategically, actually this increased demand means the strategy is
working...
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Yes.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: ...with respect to sensor augmented systems.
And then as far as personal versus professional CGM, I would say two things. One, as Karen and Omar alluded to in
the commentary, we are still working with the FDA for the launch of our own personal CGM, which hopefully happen
this year, the Guardian Connect sensor with Sugar.IQ. That's number one. And on top of that, we continue to go down
the path within our non-intensive type 2 business to drive professional CGM more aggressively through primary care
physicians. So we're pursuing all three of these angles, and that's been the strategy and we will continue to drive that
strategy.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay, of course. Awesome great. Awesome. And so with the FDA getting just getting new
lines up, that's just what's causing more of the delay and causing the backup in demand; not the – I think you were
pretty strong in saying, Omar, it's not the yields.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: It's not the yield.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: That's correct.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: It's capacity to meet the demand.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: It's not throwing away product and just...
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Yes.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: The demands and getting more lines cleared by the FDA. Okay. Perfect. That's clear. Okay.
And then Omar, I'm just curious on your thoughts of the recent FDA decision to kind of pull back on some of the
bundled payments. In terms of thinking going forward about the health care system and the direction of care, I mean to
me, it doesn't really change I think the longer-term picture of where care is going and the need to reduce care.

But I'm just curious on your thinking on whether this changes ultimately strategy and how you think about things going
forward? And then also just comment strategically on, there's been more consolidation in the industry. Your thoughts
competitively where you're stacking up and especially in light of the divestiture, too. Just kind of thoughts of the
evolution of Medtronic and where you're positioned now.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay, thanks, Kristen. First of all, the CMS you meant with the payment changes. The change
is really that it's not mandatory anymore. I think there's general encouragement to move more towards value-based
payments. And I think it's not only CMS but the commercial payers are also looking in that dimension.
At the end of the day, value-based health care is around improving outcomes at a lower cost. And I think that trajectory
is not going to change. I think there's good realization of that. I think operationalizing this requires granular work. And
we're in the middle of that and we are driving that, partnering with both providers and payers and CMS in doing so, as
we come up with the right models.
So I would say that the change from the mandatory version is just that, it is not mandatory anymore. There's no real –
the change of philosophy about the value of bundled payments and the importance of outcomes measurements.
I think with respect to the industry, look, value-based care is where the industry's got to move to. Consolidation gives
you a capability to have a seat at the table, it gives you more assets to use to deliver value-based health care because
you probably need a variety of capabilities to do so. But at the end of the day, innovation in this industry that's relevant
for patients is never going to go away.
And let's not confuse getting broader in some ways with the lack of focus in specific physician partnerships and,
therefore, driving innovation, which will then result in higher value. That's what med-tech does, and that is not going to
go away. I think [indiscernible] (52:59).
Okay. Thank you, Kristen.

Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me just follow up on a question
that was asked earlier about weak U.S. surgical volumes and the spine market. Overall, calendar Q2 was pretty mixed
for the large-cap med-tech companies and with growth slowing. So I wanted to see if you guys could talk about why
you think U.S. surgical volumes might've been weak; maybe any insight on trends in July and August and why you
think the spine market might be a little soft? And then, I had a follow-up. Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. I think just two things on that. First of all, always remember that the U.S. market is
driven by innovation cycles. And as we go through our innovation cycles the underlying market is really dominated by
these growth spikes that we get. And as we move into an accelerating phase of innovation, you will see our U.S.
performance go up across the board.
With respect to the underlying market, there's only a slight change which is in the range of changes that have happened
in the past. And you are right that surgical volumes overall have been a little softer, as have Spinal volumes. A lot of
this has to do with elective procedures, people backing away from those. And I think that's the best that we've seen.
There's been an intentional sort of conservatism, if you like, maybe a caution about elective procedures right now in the
middle of the year, but again it's within the range of movement of these markets over time. So it's not anything beyond
that. And I do think that innovation cycles are the ones that really move these markets much more dramatically. And I
think as we go through this period of accelerating innovation, you're going to see that.

<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: And any commentary on the spine softness? Is that also procedure related? And just for my
follow-up maybe, Mike, there's a couple of presentations coming up at ESC that could impact your Afib business,
CASTLE-AF, as well as renal denervation, the SPYRAL OFF MED trial. Could you talk about the significance of
those trials and any other color you might be able to add before the data? Thanks.
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: Larry, on the spine market, I do attribute it to what Omar was talking about. There's
broader themes around elective procedures. A little more specifics, we can rule out a few things. I mean, we do have
some visibility in the payers and we haven't seen any increased pushback from payers. Any increase, like declines of
procedures because we do have a view – some insight into that. We haven't seen that.
And then, just talking to physicians, we haven't seen any other significant catalysts. They still seem pretty positive
about the market. And so, at this point, again, like I mentioned earlier, we'll get more procedural insight in a couple of
weeks because the market data is delayed a little bit, the data that we get. But at this point, we're attributing it to the
broader elective procedure dynamics that Omar mentioned.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: And then, Larry, on the questions about the clinical trials to come up here at ESC for
late-breaking clinical trials, I don't have much to say on the CASTLE-AF study until we actually see the results there.
Obviously, our franchises are doing very well in that particular area, both therapeutically with the cryoablation and the
continuing benefits from the Fire and Ice study, as well as obviously continued growth in the insertable loop recorder
market, where frankly most of the growth that we see there is being dominated by its use in cryptogenic stroke and
syncope. So we don't expect those to be particularly impacted, but we'll obviously wait and see what those data are.
As it relates to the renal denervation, obviously, we've been working now for the better part of three years to basically
look at the application of that therapy. We've changed the device obviously to the SPYRAL device. We have changed
where we are doing the application of energy to go more distal into the renal artery. We have changed the patient
population that we are studying based on the evidence that we saw of who responded and who didn't in the original
HTN-3 study.
And we also have obviously now executed on a randomized clinical trial, sham-controlled for the both ON MED and
OFF MED arms. And what's going to be presented at ESC next week is the OFF MED patient cohort there. So we think
that's probably the purest look at the therapeutic value of renal denervation. There'll be simultaneous publication for
that, and we'll discuss those results after they're actually presented at ESC.

It's from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just want to ask one more question on surgical volumes. So we
get it, Spine volumes in the U.S. were slower in 2Q and there were some softness in general surgical trends in 2Q. But
can you give us your expectations for the second half of this calendar year? And the reason I'm asking is, because one
of the things we've heard is that these higher – lower-premium, higher-deductible plans are starting to push more and
more cases into the fourth quarter similar to what we see in knees and hips.
So is that a possible explanation as to why we saw some softness in 2Q? And is that a reason for volumes to get
stronger in the back end? So I'm just wanting your thoughts on that. And then, I just had a follow-up question for Mike
Coyle.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Bryan, why don't you have it?
<A - Bryan C. Hanson>: So what I would tell you is that thinking, in Q2, we get it's not a perfect science, by the way.
And so, if you look at the variables that would drive the lower surgical volumes in a quarter, it's very difficult to say

what variable actually had the biggest impact. So I don't want to draw any conclusions there. What I know is that, from
our own field sales organization, from some of our key competitors that play in the space in their general surgery-type
products, there was softness in the quarter.
I don't want to read too much into that though because it's one quarter. We have quarters that are up, quarters that are
down. So I'm not calling this a trend at all at this point. And I certainly wouldn't want to draw any conclusions to any
strength that could be happening in the fourth quarter as a result of this.
One other thing I would mention, in our advanced surgical business, though, we always look at surgical volumes, one
of the key things we concentrate on is moving current procedures from open to MIS, and that drives a lot of our growth.
So, we're dependent on surgical volumes, but not completely dependent on surgical volumes in that business.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. And then, Mike, just two cardio questions. One, maybe a little bit more color on
what you're seeing in your core pacing business today given Abbott has now launched an MRI-safe pacer. And then,
you're bullish on your stent outlook over the next couple of quarters with the Onyx launch. But maybe talk about what's
truly different about Onyx that could allow you to gain share in the stent market over the next, I don't know, 6 to 12
months. Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. So, on the pacing side, the market is very stable. We're seeing low-single digit to
actually mid-single digit unit growth for initial implants. And obviously, the – we've seen some modest share loss to
competitors as they've entered with MRI. But as – now we have brought out Micra both in the U.S. and Europe and will
be coming to Japan this quarter, we are obviously seeing recapture of especially the single chamber unit share at much
higher prices, obviously, with the Micra product.
And as we head into the second half of this year, we will be releasing our next generation of pacing family, the AZURE
wireless pacer family both in Europe and in the United States. It's actually just been released in Europe and will be
coming to the United States in the second half, so we think we will actually get back into a share capture mode with
that particular product.
And then, as it relates to the Onyx product, the feedback we've received from Europe and its early release here in the
U.S. and also in Japan is that it's the most deliverable stent in the market, that it has the widest range of sizes and width
of any product that it basically can go anywhere and has great visibility. And we have seen it drive market share for us
meaningfully in Europe to the point where we essentially recovered everything that had been given up as competitors
have come in with their products.
So, we are looking for a similar dynamic here in the U.S. and in Japan. And so, we think we've obviously begun to see
that. We're seeking a price premium for the product, which makes it a little slower in its ramp in terms of having to get
approvals from committees to go on contract, but we are very encouraged with the feedback that we're receiving and
we expect it to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Okay. Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please?

It's from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, since it's the biggest change here, I just wanted
to ask one follow-up on Diabetes. As you're moving toward getting this new line up and running and adding that
capacity, I guess, can you help us understand what the gating factors are in terms of predicting that timing or what the
bottlenecks could be with setting up that new line and what could push that time line back or forward, if there's some
conservatism in that guidance?

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. I think, look, the major variable here is just the FDA approval that we need for the capital
equipment that's needed for the line. The rest of it is pretty straightforward. We're replicating a line that – a process that
we know how to do. And then, there's some level of things out of our control – is the FDA time cycle for approval. It's
not anything that's different from what we've got approved in the past, and we expect this to go okay. But it is
something that's out of our control, and I think that's the major factor in getting the line up.
Is there anything else, Hooman...
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: No, that's exactly right. We know the equipment. We know the process. So, bringing the
equipment in, doing all of the qualifications, that's something we feel very comfortable with. Then, there's obviously
the variable of turning all of that over to the FDA and seeking their approval. So, as Omar pointed out, that's the single
biggest variable in this that has uncertainty around it. The other elements, we feel very good about.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And just to make it clear, we have gotten approval for this kind of stuff from the FDA in the
past without any issues. So, there's nothing that's any different, but it is something that needs approval.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Okay. Thanks. And just to follow up on the presentation. I noticed that CRT-D has actually
declined low-double digits this quarter. So, I was curious if you could give us some color on that. I was a little
surprised by the magnitude of that decline and if anything could change there going forward to improve that.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yes. The decline that you're seeing in the CRT-D is basically being driven by the U.S. And it
is basically we are seeing low-single digit declines in initial implants for CRT-D. We're actually taking market share in
the initial implants, but we are also now seeing, sort of, low-double digit declines in replacements. This is something
we talked about a year ago in Q1 and Q2, as a competitor had a major recall at the end of our Q2 and into Q3 and Q4.
That obviously drove competitive replacements for us which maps, if you will, that decline that's really being driven by
the extending of battery life in the CRT-D space, and that's what you're seeing sort of reflected in the numbers.
The other major driver for that, which is temporary to the Q1 results, is that we saw a fairly significant destocking of
hospital-held inventory in the United States in Q1, where essentially the hospitals are looking not to hold as much
inventory of product. And if they want to take it, they want significant discounts to restock that, which we've opted not
to do. So, that is more of a temporary issue that we think we'll not see this big of a magnitude of it going forward.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great. And thanks a lot for the color. Thank you.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Next question, please, Darla?

It's from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can we shift a little bit to the land of
robotics? You have a new surgical robotics expected outside United States this year and you mentioned Mazor in your
comments. Could you please give us an update on your thinking about those two aspects of your portfolio?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll let Bryan...
<A - Bryan C. Hanson>: For surgical robotics...
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go first and then let Geoff talk about Mazor.
<A - Bryan C. Hanson>: I just – I couldn't hear you very well. What was the question on the surgical robotics
business?
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Well, just an update on how you're thinking about that launch, applications and
differentiations and anything else that you could add to the color of as we all look towards it?

<A - Bryan C. Hanson>: Well, obviously, we're pretty excited that we're in the fiscal year that we're going to get at
first human use. So, that's a positive. We're in the what I would define as the pilot phase build right now, and we're
obviously working very diligently for verification and validation and also [audio gap] (01:07:25) anything that we need
to put together for regulatory submissions. So, we're heading down the path. We feel confident with what we have
today.
Obviously, with this complex of a product, a lot can happen in the V&V process. but we're feeling good about where
we stand today. And the strategy holds. It's the same that I've mentioned before [audio gap] (01:07:45) organization
from a mission perspective is to move our patients from open surgery to MIS. This is another tool to ensure that we can
do that. And we feel confident that, once we launch this, we're going to be in a unique position to bring more value than
any other company in the world. We'll be able to fully service open surgical procedures, traditional MIS procedures and
robotics surgery, as well as provide operational efficiency services within the operating room. So, we remain very
confident in the product and we remain confident in the overall strategy.
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: And then – this is Geoff. On Mazor, as I think most people know, it's been – it's
public, it's out there. Our relationship with them has a continuum, if you will, and we're in this phase of the relationship
that is lead sharing. And if we hit certain milestones and they hit certain milestones, we move to more of a distribution.
And the initial phase has gone very well. It's tested the hypothesis that we believe robotics has a strong place in spine
surgery, and it works well with our broader solutions around intra-operative imaging and navigation.
And so, we're very pleased with where the relationship is going, and I think we can talk more about this in the next
quarter here in terms of moving towards distribution. In addition to that, a go-forward look on tighter product
integration with our navigation and intra-operative imaging systems, as well as our spine implant business, how this
impacts their product roadmap as well. But the relationship continues to go well, and it's growing. Our customers see a
lot of value in not just the robot, but the robot – the Mazor X robot used in conjunction with our intra-operative
imaging system, the O-arm O2; as well as our navigation platform, the StealthStation.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Okay. Most of my other questions have been answered. Thank you very much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Great. Thank you, Joanne. We'll take one more question, please, Darla.

And your final question will be from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Thanks for fitting me in, guys. Appreciate it. Wanted to spend a minute talking about the nature of
your relationship with hospitals. There are a couple of items here that has been brought upon that I thought are
interesting. One was just the nature of surgical procedures. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any impact from the
increase in prior authorization required by hospitals and payers before scheduling procedures, whether that's having an
impact on volumes in spine and elsewhere in your business.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, we don't have any direct insight into that. We don't hear of that as a specific reason. And
like I said, this range is within a fluctuation range that we've seen before. So, we're taking it in that light. And like we
mentioned earlier, elective procedures probably are down a little bit, but again in the range we've seen before. And
again, let me emphasize that product innovation in this market is what really strengthens markets. And we do think that,
for the right procedures where there's real value that the patient can see and the physicians can see, the procedures do
happen and they will grow when new innovation comes along. And we're in a period of accelerating that innovation, so
we do expect our U.S. growth numbers to go up in the coming quarters, offset a little bit by the Diabetes slowdown in
the next quarter or so because that's mostly – almost all U.S. But really, the surgical procedures themselves, I think,
again are in the range of history – of historical trends, and we expect our product innovation to positively impact those
markets.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Okay. It's helpful. Maybe just from another direction. I think there was an earlier comment on the
CRT-D business with regards to hospital inventory. Are you seeing at a higher level any change in the way hospitals

manage their inventory for your products? I mean, it seems like, again, that customer group is a little bit stretched in
terms of their financial health. And so, just understanding how they're managing their cash flow and how that impacts
you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, I think their methodology for managing is more or less the same as it's always been and
you go through these cycles, again, in the range that we've seen before. And look, I hear too from hospitals just in
general that they're concerned about their business flow. But again, it's nothing that's more than what we've seen before
and in that range. And for the right thing, they will do it. But the buying patterns are in line with what we've seen.
Nothing dramatically different.

<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thank you, Isaac.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. So, with that, let me thank you, all, for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to
thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our
progress on our second quarter earnings call, which we now anticipate holding on November 28, which is a week later
than normal, given the closing time needed as a result of the divestiture to Cardinal Health. Thank you, all, and have a
good day. Thanks.
