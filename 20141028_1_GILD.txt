recent press releases.
In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I will now turn the call over to John Martin.
John C. Martin, Ph.D.
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today.
The third quarter was highlighted by continued strong financial performance as well as scientific, clinical and
regulatory progress that we believe will benefit the patients and communities Gilead serves over the near and
longer-term.
During the quarter, we generated a total of $6.0 billion. This perform – revenues of $6.0 billion. This performance
coincided with advancing numerous clinical programs across core therapeutic areas. I will touch on the significant
milestones that occurred in the last few months.
In the HIV therapeutic area, the first TAF-based single-tablet regimen elvitegravir, cobicistat, FTC and TAF, or
E/C/F/TAF, met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints in two Phase III studies in treatment naïve patients. The
results show that E/C/F/TAF was non-inferior to Stribild with regard to the proportion of HIV-infected patients with
viral load of less than 50 copies per mil and demonstrated statistically significant fewer renal abnormalities and also
lower decreases in bone mineral density.
Additional Phase III studies evaluating E/C/F/TAF in multiple HIV patient populations are ongoing, including patients
who switched to E/C/F/TAF from Truvada-containing regimens, patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and
treatment naïve HIV-positive adolescents. Submissions for regulatory approval of the E/C/F/TAF regimen will occur in
both the United States and Europe by the end of the year.
In addition, TAF as a single agent is being studied for the treatment of HPV infection. Two Phase III studies with
48-week primary endpoints should complete enrollment by the end of the year.
Moving to HCV, Harvoni, which was approved by the U.S. FDA on October 10, is the first single-tablet regimen for
patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, the most prevalent genotype worldwide. We also received approval in Canada
earlier this month, a positive recommendation for approval in Europe in late September, and we filed for approval in
Japan, also in September.
Harvoni is a major medical advance in the treatment of HCV. It's simple – one tablet taken once a day it eliminates the
need for both interferon and ribavirin, which cause difficult side effects, and it results in high cure rates, with treatment
durations as few as eight weeks. Harvoni builds on the progress of the past year during which time approximately
100,000 patients have been treated with Sovaldi in the United States and approximately 17,000 in Europe. This
represents a fraction of the estimated 185 million people in the world suffering from HCV who have the potential to
benefit from sofosbuvir-based regimens.

The rapid adoption of Sovaldi continues to reflect recognition within the medical community of the substantial benefits
the drug offers patients, particularly when compared to prior treatment options. The goal of Gilead's development
program is a pan-genotypic single-tablet regimen. To this end, enrollment of four Phase III studies has begun for the
pan-genotypic combination of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir. We anticipate being in position to share data in the second half
of 2015.
In two weeks, the annual AASLD meeting will take place from November 7 to 11 in Boston. Over 90 abstracts by
Gilead or by Gilead collaborators will highlight our various disease programs in Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and liver
fibrosis. 65 abstracts deal with the use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens in various populations across various
genotypes. In particular, an oral abstract will describe the use of Harvoni in genotype 6 and Harvoni in combination
with ribavirin in genotype 3 Hepatitis C-infected individuals.
Another presentation will describe a real-world experience of Harvoni in combination with ribavirin in cirrhotic
patients who have previously failed a PI, peg-interferon, ribavirin-containing regimen, and three other abstracts will
provide safety and efficacy of Harvoni in 500 patients with compensated cirrhosis and in a combination with ribavirin
in 300 pre- and post-liver transplant patients.
These existing and accumulating data continue to demonstrate that sofosbuvir-based regimens provide savings to
payers, providers, patients, and our entire healthcare system over the long term, given high cure rates and subsequent
reduction of costs associated with managing HCV over patients' lifetimes.
Now let me touch briefly on Zydelig and Letairis. Zydelig is a first-in-class oral PI3K delta inhibitor. It was approved
both in the U.S. and Europe in combination with rituximab for the treatment of certain patients with CLL and certain
patients with NHL. Zydelig is the first of what we hope will be many therapies Gilead develops to improve treatment
for a range of cancers.
The Letairis AMBITION study has demonstrated the potential for a new standard of care in Pulmonary Arterial
Hypertension, or PAH. Data from this study were presented at the annual meeting of the European Respiratory Society
in September with an additional analysis from AMBITION presented during a late-breaker session at the CHEST
meeting earlier today. The study was conducted in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly and was a
randomized double-blind multi-center study comparing first-line combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil to
monotherapy with either ambrisentan or tadalafil alone in patients with PAH.
The studies showed that the combination of these therapies reduced the risk of clinical failure by 50% compared to the
pooled ambrisentan and tadalafil monotherapy arms. The combination was also statistically significant versus the two
individual ambrisentan and tadalafil monotherapy arms for the primary endpoint. Based on these data, submission of
the supplemental NDA for Letairis to FDA is planned before year end.
As we continue to advance treatment options across a range of therapeutic areas, we are working to enable access of
our drugs for people who need them across the world. During the quarter, we signed non-exclusive licensing
agreements with seven India-based generic companies to manufacture Sovaldi and Harvoni for distribution in 91
developing countries. In those countries, more than 100 million people are estimated to be infected with HCV, which
translates to 54% of the total number of people affected by HCV worldwide.
We also announced an agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, MPP, under which MPP can sub-license TAF to
generic companies in India and China for manufacturing and distribution in 112 developing countries. Many initiatives
are in place to expand access for patients in both the U.S. and around the world and represent a continuing effort that
our entire organization is committed to and of which we are very proud.
I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial update.

Gilead's total net product revenue in the third quarter increased to $6 billion, representing growth of 120% over the
same period last year. U.S. sales grew to $4.2 billion, and we had $1.4 billion of sales in Europe. There were a number
of factors underlying our sales growth during the quarter. The primary driver was Sovaldi, and we also experienced
healthy demand in our HIV business.
Beginning with Hepatitis C, we generated Sovaldi sales of $2.8 billion during the quarter, including $2.2 billion in U.S.
sales with most of the remainder coming from France and Germany. Sovaldi is now available in 40 countries around
the world. The 20% reduction in Sovaldi revenues, compared with the second quarter is related to physicians delaying
the initiation of treatment in the U.S. in anticipation of Harvoni's approval.
As we expected, the third quarter also saw a reduction of our Sovaldi inventory across the channel, consistent with
demand and in line with our normal contractual ranges. Since launch, nearly 100,000 patients in the U.S. have been
treated with Sovaldi. According to data available as of the end of the second quarter, approximately 2/3 are genotype 1,
20% are genotype 2, 10% are genotype 3, and the rest are genotypes four, five, and six, combined. Approximately 95%
of U.S. patients starting therapy in 2014 received Sovaldi. We estimate that 80% of these patients were treatment-naïve,
and 20% were treatment-experienced.
In the third quarter, we saw an increase in non-retail use as a percentage of the U.S. total sales. At this point, only two
state Medicaid programs have yet to allow access to Sovaldi. In Europe, approximately 17,000 patients have been
treated with Sovaldi.
In the U.K., the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, issued further draft guidance
recommending Sovaldi as a treatment option for certain patient subgroups. We were very pleased to have NICE's
endorsements of Sovaldi as a clinically and cost-effective treatment and look forward to working with officials in the
U.K. to ensure maximum patient access to this drug.
We have now reached agreements on reimbursement in many countries of Western Europe. The fact that many of these
agreements are progressing faster than would typically be the case following standard timelines is a testament to the
unmet medical need that Sovaldi addresses and the value it brings.
Let me now turn to Harvoni. As John mentioned, earlier in the month we received FDA approval for Harvoni, a simple,
safe, and highly-effective oral single-tablet regimen for Hepatitis C. The 12-week regimen price for Harvoni is
$94,500, which is in line with the regimen cost of the previous standard of care as in 12 weeks of Sovaldi plus
pegylated interferon and Ribavirin. We expect over time that up to half of genotype 1 patients may benefit from just
eight weeks of therapy, meaning that the cost will be reduced by one-third for many patients. We are supporting the
launch through a targeted promotional effort designed to build awareness amongst the specialist communities who are
already familiar with Sovaldi, including hepatologists, gastroenterologist and infectious disease physicians.
Moving now to HIV. Prescription growth continued to grow for us for all of our products in the U.S. as nine out of ten
HIV patients new to treatment were prescribed a Gilead medicine. Seven out of ten received one of Gilead's
Truvada-based single-tablet regimens. Stribild continues to be the leading HIV regimen for patients who are beginning
therapy, capturing three out of ten starts, and Stribild has also become the number two regimen across all treated
patients in the U.S. behind Atripla.
Gilead's Truvada-based single-tablet regimens, including Stribild, Complera, and Atripla, grew 29% year-over-year.
The new single-tablet regimens remained on a strong growth trend, with Stribild up 22% sequentially to $279 million
and Complera up 19% sequentially to $183 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we saw inventory levels for our
HIV products finish at the upper end of the contractual range.
Moving to Europe, revenues for Truvada-based single-tablet regimens have grown 17% year-over-year. Truvada-based
single tablet regimens continue to lead the market, with Eviplera remaining the most prescribed regimen in both naïve
and switch patients and Stribild strengthening its position as the second most prescribed regimen for switch and it's the
fourth most prescribed regimen for treatment-naïve patients. By the end of the third quarter, we had sales from Stribild
in 20 countries across Europe. This includes all E.U. Big Five markets with notably the biggest HIV market in Europe

being France, where Stribild was launched in late March.
We are engaged with public and private payers around the world to help them understand the significant unmet medical
needs we're working to address and the positive impact we believe our product can have on healthcare systems over the
long term. In the U.S., our comprehensive patient assistance program continues to help make Gilead therapies
accessible for patients who need financial assistance. We are always looking at how we can partner with countries in
need to enable access to our therapies. This has been and will continue to be a top priority.
In closing, we are extremely pleased to have taken so many important steps forward with our business during the
quarter.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Robin.
Robin L. Washington
Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with total revenues of $6 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS of
$1.84 per share, which includes a cumulative catch-up of $0.21 per diluted share related to the Branded Prescription
Drug Fees for the final regulations in the Affordable Care Act issued during the quarter. Excluding this one-time
adjustment, EPS for the quarter would have been $2.05 per share.
Worldwide product sales growth of 120% year-over-year was driven by strength across Gilead's product portfolio,
including continued uptake of Sovaldi coupled with the growth of our HIV single tablet regimen, Stribild and
Complera/Eviplera across geographies.
Sequentially, product sales excluding Sovaldi increased by 8% with steady growth in our HIV franchise. Sovaldi
product sales were robust at $2.8 billion for the third quarter, but decreased compared with the second quarter, which
likely resulted from physicians holding off initiation of treatment in anticipation of Harvoni. In Europe, Sovaldi product
sales increased 31% sequentially as more patients initiated therapy during the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were up $609 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $98 million
year-over-year, reflecting increases in head count and infrastructure costs related to the growth of our R&D portfolio
and progression of oncology and liver diseases clinical studies.
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were up $511 million year-over-year, driven by the Branded Prescription Drug Fee. As
mentioned earlier, the IRS issued final regulations which required manufacturers to recognize an additional year of
expense which resulted in a non-tax-deductible cumulative catch-up of $337 million within the quarter. Non-GAAP
SG&A expenses also increased due to product launch expenses for liver diseases and oncology, patient support
programs, head count growth and investments in our infrastructure and geographic expansion.
Our cash flow from operations was $4 billion for the quarter. We continue to focus on shareholder return and
accelerated our level of share repurchases to 19.1 million shares at an average price of $89.10 per share, utilizing $1.7
billion in cash during the third quarter. This completed the January 2011 share repurchase plan, where we repurchased
a total of 92.9 million shares at an average repurchase price of $53.83 per share for a total spend of $5 billion.
This month, we began utilizing the May 2014 $5 billion share repurchase plan and expect cash allocated in the fourth
quarter to share repurchases to be similar to the third quarter. During the quarter, we also paid $4.1 billion in cash to
settle the warrants related to the May 2014 convertible debt, which reduced diluted shares by 10 million for the current
quarter.
Turning briefly to taxes, as many of you are aware, the Irish Finance Minister announced a proposed 2015 budget for
Ireland, which included a number of changes to their residency rules. We are still evaluating the proposed changes and
the related impact to Gilead, if any. The proposed changes include a six-year grandfather period through 2020. If we
determine that the final rules will impact Gilead, we believe that our worldwide revenue base and operations in Ireland

will provide us with options for structuring alternatives in the future.
Finally, we are updating full-year 2014 guidance, which includes HCV product sales and is outlined on slide 44. The
changes are as follows: net product revenue guidance is now $22 billion to $23 billion. Gross margin guidance is now
86% to 88%. Tax rate guidance is now 17.5% to 19.5%. We are raising SG&A expense guidance to $2.7 million to
$2.8 million. This increase is fully attributable to the impact of the IRS regulations related to the change in accounting
of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which represents approximately 20% to 21% of SG&A expense in 2014. All
other components of our 2014 guidance remain unchanged.
Overall, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. We
look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
At this point, we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question. And congratulations on all the progress and
the results. Could I just ask a related question on HCV? Could you give us a sense of how Harvoni is going? I mean,
you have more visibility than we do in terms of comparing it to the Sovaldi lunch. Do you get the sense that it's tapping
into that warehouse group of patients?
And just related to that, could you give us some color, Paul, on what proportion of patients that are being treated are F3,
F4 in the U.S., and whether you expect that to become more or less de facto reimbursement standard as we get into
2015 for HCV reimbursement? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yes, Geoff, so two questions there, actually, but I can give you little bit of feedback on
Harvoni's launch. As you pointed out, we only have one kind of data point, like you do, but I can tell you a little bit
more what we're hearing.
First of all, the data point of prescriptions last week was for prescriptions that are actually filled. We are hearing that
many more prescriptions are being written during these first two or three weeks of launch. We have to be careful, I
think, comparing apples to apples though with the Sovaldi launch. And if you remember, Sovaldi was approved at the
beginning of December, and there was a reticence I think at that point for many physicians to write prescriptions,
starting patients off on interferon regimens just prior to the Christmas and holiday period. So there is a slight
apples-to-apples comparison I think we need to take into account.
However, we are seeing a few things. We're seeing a broader group of physicians writing scripts I think, than with
Sovaldi. Several physicians we know have written scripts that never wrote one for Sovaldi before, and I think this
reflects the simplicity of the Harvoni regimen. We're also seeing the rate of adoption, I think, a little bit faster this time,
so some physicians who took many months to write their first prescription of Sovaldi seem to appreciate, again, the
simplicity of the Harvoni regimen and are writing scripts earlier.
With regard to payers, we're feeling reasonably confident with their reaction. I think they're very pleased to see that in
GT-1 patients, up to half, we estimate, of those patients will be eligible for eight weeks of therapy in due course
because they're either treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic and with a low baseline viral load. And I think also, when they
compare the cost of the treatments of Sovaldi plus Olysio, which we saw ramping up during the course of the year, and
in fact, I think in the second quarter or possibly in the third quarter even, maybe 50% of patients were on that very
expensive regimen, costing around $150,000, that there is a sense of relief now that a large number of patients will be
able to access the eight-week regimen at substantially reduced cost. So that's very positive, I believe.

It's very early, really, to characterize access through the state payer systems and really too early to say that. I do think
it's worth pointing out that Sovaldi will continue to coexist with Harvoni, so I think in the months going forward we
should look at the overall Gilead position on Hepatitis C as Harvoni plus the Sovaldi prescriptions that we're going to
continue to see, because Sovaldi remains the best of on-label options for genotypes 2/3/6 and the various other patient
subgroups. So pretty early days, but I think – good signs.
We also just had a satellite symposium hosted last week by several Hepatitis C thought leaders, and we had 1900
healthcare providers join that symposium. So I think there's a very high level of interest, and so we're quietly confident
in the success of this launch.
I think the second question was about fibrosis scores, yes. We've seen a surprisingly large number of patients actually
treated with low fibrosis scores. I think our estimate so far in the year to date is that zero through two is about 60% of
the patients treated, so the balance would be F3s and F4s, Geoff. I think that answers the question.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Great. Thank you very much for that color.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress, as well. Just
following up on Geoff's question, I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about this potential backlog of
prescriptions for Harvoni. Do you have any sense for patient throughput on the drug relative to prescriptions written?
How quickly you might expect to see these patients get insurance authorization to start treatment? I guess I'm just
trying to understand both the initial insurance hurdles as well as how best to reconcile the prescriptions we're going to
see in the launch relative to actual patient demand. Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: That's a really hard question to answer. We really don't know. I think the apples-to-apples
comparison with Sovaldi, again, we need to take into consideration that I think insurance companies were somewhat
unprepared for the volume of patients when Sovaldi was initially launched, and certainly in the first few weeks, a lot of
prescriptions, I think, went through very quickly. This time, insurance companies are more organized and prepared
around the Harvoni launch, so there may be a slightly more – there may be some more constraints initially.
But as I said, Harvoni is an incredible step forward, the single-tablet once-a-day interferon-free, ribavirin-free regimen,
many patients able to be prescribed for just eight weeks. So I would hope that the economic benefits, even of the
eight-week potential, might expedite proceedings. But it's a bit difficult to tell. There's some swings and round-abouts
on this.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey. Thanks very much for taking my question. I appreciate it. I noticed in your slide
deck this quarter you didn't provide us the waterfall plot that you often provide for the Hepatitis C market starting with
infected patients, then going to diagnosed patients, then going to patients under the active care of a treating specialist. I
was wondering if you could update us on those numbers, if possible, especially now that we're all trying to model the
Harvoni launch?
And then just related, you said that two state Medicaids have allowed access only to Sovaldi. What's your expectation
for how that's going to roll out, how the state Medicaid situation will roll out in 2015? Thanks so much.

<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Mark, it's John Milligan. I'll start with the waterfall question. We were taking a look at
that plot and recognized that the data we have on the patients under care are at least a quarter old if not older, so we no
longer felt that we had an accurate picture of where those patients are coming from. So we don't know exactly how
many patients are under care anymore and how many of the patients that went through care would've been
characterized as part of that bucket prior to this. So we felt it was misleading to put a number out there that you would
then rely on for understanding how the dynamic is going.
We are trying to figure out where those patients are going to come from, and we will take some time, of course, to
understand how many patients came directly into care from nowhere, which was common [ph] in the CO patients
(29:33) who typically hadn't been under care suddenly seeking care and how many of those patients are still in that
bucket.
So this very dynamic process may not lend itself to a typical waterfall that we've used in the past for HIV, and we're
trying to find out a better way to convey what those numbers might look like as those patients come into care and as
those patients are driven into care by increased knowledge of the product and of course many of you have seen
awareness ads on TV already from various companies which will, of course, help drive awareness and patients into care
as well.
So it's a very dynamic process, and we will do the best we can, but I don't have a good handle on what that number is
today.
Paul, the second one was about Medicaid?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yes, I think we should anticipate, certainly for modeling, I would anticipate same sort of
timelines for Harvoni through the state Medicaid systems. Although I would emphasize, again, that the eight-week
regimen you would hope the economic benefits of the shorter treatment might expedite that process somewhat.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. So there has been a lot of debate about the
importance of short duration therapy, and I noticed for your GS-5816 program in Phase III that you are really only
looking at 12-week treatment duration. So I realize the Phase II data are mixed on eight-weeks there, but should we just
think about this combination for genotype two and three and then I guess related, can you update us where you are with
your next-gen PI and what the plans are and timelines for additional combos to get to shorter durations? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yes, Matt. Hi. It's Norbert. Matt, with regards to 5816, the way we're
thinking about this is, it would be one pill, simple regimen, 12-weeks for everybody. Now, you could make the
argument in the U.S., it's probably genotype two and three, but for instance, you look at the U.K., they have 30%
genotype threes, and in other parts of the world, it's the most prominent. The most prominent genotypes are not
genotype one. So we're looking at this really as a global solution, so to speak, for all genotypes for Hepatitis C.
With regards to shorter treatment durations, Matt, we are still pursuing shorter treatment duration. You may remember
we have presented data, actually [indiscernible] (31:58) presented data on six-weeks treatment-naive non-cirrhotics,
100% response rates with ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, 9451 – I can't remember the number, sorry.
We are now looking at what happens and with six, with eight-weeks and with six-weeks in treatment-experienced
cirrhotics. There's a presentation by Eric Lawitz at AASLD that looks at eight-weeks in treatment-experienced
cirrhotics and you will see while the response rates are still reasonably high, almost 90%, they're not as high as we
would like them to be. And we're looking at four-weeks right now in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic.

With regards to the pan-genotypic protease inhibitor, that has just entered Phase II. So we're doing dose ranging in – or

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey. Thanks. My question is in regards to some reimbursement criteria from different payers
suggesting the need for high risk Hepatitis C disease in order to get treated. Anecdotally, or do you think going
forward, do you think that that is going to be any impact or do you think that is basically going to be similar to what we
saw in Q2, where I think a lot of that criteria was trying to be implemented? And then I guess similarly to OUS, how
you see that being played out, cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotics, or in other words, high-risk versus low risk?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Hey, Michael. It's John Milligan. So your first question is just going be segmented into
high-risk HCV patients for treatment only. I think that's the way you phrased it. And I would say it's very difficult to
characterize across all the very different payer groups who respond differently to the people who, of course, are paying
the premiums. And so there's a wide range of behaviors that we're seeing out there.
There are certainly some groups who are trying to segment it more for the high-risk patients, but of course some groups
are more open-ended as to what kind of patient can come on board. So you could be high-risk by a number of criteria,
including physician judgment, based on co-morbidities. You can get therapy based on other criteria. Interesting if you
look at, for example, Medicare patients, they have quite a range of patients who are able to be treated under Medicare,
and CMS has sort of dictated currently that all patients should be allowed therapy.
I think what you'll see over time is rather than a restriction, more of a loosening of the guidelines over time, much like
we saw with HIV. I shouldn't say guidelines, but a loosening of the criteria for reimbursing, which is typically what
happens over time as more patients get treated who are on the worst end of the spectrum, there will be more capacity
and more money that will be freed up to treat people who are earlier on in their disease.
We also think the eight-week option, the cheaper option, is going to be very favorably looked at by the payers as well.
We think also that treating earlier is your best chance to save the most money for the healthcare system over time, and
so we would encourage people to think about it that way as well.
So you will see some restrictions currently, and I think, for example, in the Medicaids, which have fixed budgets,
there'll be greater restrictions than anywhere else. But I can't give you one answer. I just think it's an evolving field
which will eventually allow most patients to be treated, but I do think there will be a triage system set up over the
coming years to get to the right number of patients.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Maybe I'll answer the outside U.S...
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: How is that different than OUS, for example, that slide with the pie charts you don't have a
number for OUS?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Yes. Thanks, Michael. I'm going to turn it over to Paul Carter for the answer about the
ex-U.S. piece of this.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: So we're making very good progress in terms of reimbursement agreements with most of the
major European countries. What we have in Europe is somewhat like the state Medicaid systems, fairly inflexible
budgets for healthcare generally, and specifically in the Hepatitis C area.

Having said that, I think there's very clear recognition of the unmet medical need, and particularly in some countries the
very large number of patients that really need to be treated as soon as possible. We would expect those governments to
prioritize the patients, just because of the inflexible nature of their budget, and therefore, I think at this stage the sicker
patients clearly would be the first ones to be treated.
Having said that, ironically, as John pointed out the best way to save money per patient is to treat early and in fact treat
these less sick or less cirrhotic patients on the eight week type of therapy that will be available shortly in Europe.

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up, actually, on the ex-U.S.
launch. We recently saw on the web it looks like you've reached an agreement with Italy, and Italy expects to, I think,
treat more patients than any other Big Five nations. Is that correct? Is Italy now online, and what are your expectations
for the launch there? Similarly, in Egypt, where there's a huge patient population, what are your expectations for
revenue out of Egypt, and how could that ramp?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: So I'll take the Italy question. First of all, Italy does have the highest prevalence of any of the
major E.U. countries for sure, and they do recognize the healthcare issue staring them in the face now. So we have been
in close negotiations with the Italian government. We have signed an agreement with them, and that agreement is now
working through the Italian system. We expect the first patients in Italy hopefully to get treated next month as part of
this agreement. So Italy is moving forward, and we're very pleased about that. Do you want to talk about Egypt, John?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Yes. So with regard to Egypt, obviously we've announced that we have a program to
have a specific program for Egyptian citizens to get access to Sovaldi for genotype 4. There are some pretty high
expectations within the Egyptian government about the number of patients who can be treated. We have yet to actually
see those orders materialize. We're working with them on what the proper forecast and supply could look like, so at this
time I can't give you anything other than to say it will be very, very small for 2014 and as we get into 2015 and
approach talking about the year guidance then, perhaps if that's a significant component, we would call it out at that
point in time. But given that this is a public health initiative, obviously the revenue number is small per patient, but
with a large number of patients could be an important part of our ex-U.S., ex-European revenue line.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Just generally in places like Egypt and Italy and other places with high prevalence, do they set
up an annual budget beforehand? And do they tell you what that is? Or is there more a demand-based ordering from
those countries?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: So specifically to Egypt and Italy, there is a specific amount of money that they are
setting aside to try to treat the disease. To my knowledge, those numbers aren't public but they have put aside special
public funds because of the important health need for each of those countries, yes.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: If I can just add that certainly speaking for Italy, the budget will be a significant step up from
previous Hepatitis C budgets with the ambition of treating a lot of patients over the next few years and with the
recognition that they can't possibly treat all patients in the first year or two. This will be spread out over many years.

<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have, if you don't mind a question on inventory and
then a question on 5816. Inventory-wise for Sovaldi, it looks like about 30% of sales are outside of genotype 1. That's
going to be, obviously, the strong suit kind of going forward for Sovaldi. But you mentioned that you're within the
IMAs, sort of the contractual – usually I think you guys have been two to three weeks. So I'm trying to get a sense kind
of where do you think inventory will go and how much is going to get compensated by Harvoni next quarter? And then,
just in terms of 5816, is there any discussion internally about also doing an eight-week regimen before you actually file
for approval? Thank you.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hey, Yaron. It's Robin. I'll take the first part of your question. As we kind of outlined on
the call, we know Sovaldi inventory stayed overall for the quarter within the ranges, but it did go down commensurate
with the decline in demand that we saw in anticipation of Harvoni.
This quarter, i.e. Q4, we would expect Harvoni inventory to ramp up and Sovaldi to continue to ramp down. I can't say
exactly how that's all going to play out. I mean, overall, when we bring on a new product, we do have a few quarters to
ramp-up inventory overall. So that is something that we'll have to see how it plays out over the rest of the quarter.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yaron, currently we don't have any plans for the filing for the first NDA
filing of 5816 to include shorter than 12-week treatment arms, but we are, as I said, exploring shorter treatment
duration arms with adding a third agent and in this particular case, the pan-genotypic protease inhibitor, 9857. Those
studies are currently ongoing. We would like or we attempt for the shorter treatment duration to be applicable to all
patients, not limited to a certain non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve, low viral load segment, but it should work for
everybody. That is what we're attempting to do.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Robin, I don't know if I can maybe ask it a different way. In Q4, are you guys expecting
sales in Hep C in the U.S. to be higher than Q2? I guess that's sort of where I'm trying to get to.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: [Laughter] I understand your question. I can't necessarily project that. We've given kind
of overall guidance for the full period. As we talked about, we did expect to see some warehousing, and we would
expect to see that ramp-up. But there are a lot of uncertainties. You've still got to go through the reimbursement
process, there's a potential for a competitive launch, et cetera, Yaron. So I can't necessarily say this early whether it's
going to go up or down. But we do feel comfortable with our guidance.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Okay, great. I figured I would try. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is
open.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thank you. Just one question on sort of the sustainability of pricing in Hep C. As you and
your competitors all strive to shorten the treatment duration, I was wondering if we should assume pricing is
maintained at the current eight-week mark? Or should we assume the savings are passed on to whoever?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Until we see the product profiles, I think of these shorter week durations, I think it's absolutely
impossible to answer that question. I think that what we do have, though, with Harvoni is a really, really strong clinical
profile, and, you know, high efficacy, low side effects, one pill once a day, no interferon, no ribavirin, a great profile.
So Norbert wants to say something.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Ian, the other thing I would like to add, as far as I know, nobody has yet
shown any shortening of treatment duration with the exception of Gilead.
The other thing I would like to point out, the regulatory hurdle to get anything approved is very, very high. You may
actually want to look at the Harvoni label, how the eight-week, the ION-3 study was labeled. We had overall 96%
response rate with the eight-week treatment arm versus 98% in the 12-week treatment arm, and yet what showed up in
the label was it should be used for 12 weeks with a footnote saying that it can be considered for certain patients with an

eight-week treatment duration. I'm just telling you this is how regulatory authorities think about this. They do not trade
a two-week treatment duration if you have to pay a 2% penalty in relapse rates. That is our experience.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: But really the question was more your efforts as you're looking at a potential three-drug
combo, and that could support shorter treatment duration. Does the price naturally come down, or should we assume it
kind of stays where it is?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: I think the – this is John Milligan, Ian. So you have to think about the overall patient
populations that we're looking at right now. It will depend heavily on how we were able to drive the different treatment
durations. There are patients now who are considered for 24-weeks, and so as we drive those patients down to the lesser
durations, we'll have to take a look at the totality of the data to figure out which patient population is appropriate for
three-drug combinations, at which duration and at which price. And so we may have to make some choices in there as
to what we intend to do.
So we have – the nice thing is the multiple drug combinations we have, is we have flexibility across the regimens to do
the best thing that we can for the company and for the patient simultaneously.

Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Robin, I know you've toyed with
dividends and thinking about capital allocation. What are the next things that have to happen to make a decision on
whether that is a choice you would make or not?
And then regarding patient flow, I know initially you'd said that with the Sovaldi launch that you're seeing doctors
prescribe much quicker than you thought day one. What are you seeing with Harvoni that might surprise you, and what
are your thoughts around patient flow? Thanks.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hi, Robyn. Just to answer the first part, we continue to keep our consistent capital
structure focus in place, and that's focusing on the reinvestment of our pipeline, M&A, and returning excess value, and
we think right now, given our current valuation, share repurchases is the most optimal way for us to return value to
shareholders.
We continue to look at our future cash flow, to your point how we think about it going forward, this is something that
we're discussing with management and the board as to whether there are other vehicles that we might want to consider.
I think most importantly, we're kind of looking at our return relative to free cash flow going forward. So there are
various vehicles that we might choose to optimize in the future, but right now share repurchases is our area of focus.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Robyn, I couldn't actually hear very clearly the second part of the question. Would you mind
repeating it?
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Sure. You were mentioning when Sovaldi launched that you saw doctors prescribe
immediately all at once, so I was asking more about patient flows for Harvoni. Like, what are you thinking about – do
you still expect even patient flow, is anything surprising you to start, how many patients are coming in for treatment,
how many doctors are prescribing?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Well, again, it's very, very early days on Harvoni specifically. We're not seeing anything sort of
really unexpected. We knew there was quite a lot of patients warehoused. We saw the prescription – new prescriptions,
let's say, to Sovaldi reduce between quarter two and quarter three by about 20%. And you can assume that those were
the warehouse patients. Other than that, I think we're assuming that there's still plenty of patients under care, there's
plenty of diagnosed patients, and it will take years to work through those.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thanks for taking my questions as well. First of all, I know you guys are still very much in the
process of securing reimbursement and pricing in Europe, but when shall we expect a significant pickup in European
revenues beyond just France and Germany?
And then secondly, Sovaldi has been in the market for three, four quarters now. Do you think you have reached a
steady growth from that adjustment, and what is it right now in 3Q?
And lastly, I guess, Norbert, you mentioned that the regulators such as FDA will not sacrifice even 2% SVR for a
shorter duration. So it sounds like we could assume that maybe a fall in duration is not critical commercially? Thank
you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Wow. That's three questions in there. Let me just quickly deal with the first one, though, which
is we have made good progress with reimbursement in Europe. Several of those countries, notably Spain, Italy,
Netherlands, Belgium, we've signed agreements with, but those patients haven't really started yet. We're expecting
those over the next month, or two, or three. France, we are still working with the pricing committee there, we're close,
we believe, to having an agreement, and as I mentioned earlier, about NICE in the U.K., where we have their
endorsement, but we still don't have full access from NHS in England, but that, we hope is close.
We can anticipate over the next month, the European sales of Sovaldi are beginning to ramp up. Having said that, the
European sales of Sovaldi to date, I think, are pretty impressive given the limited access that we've had so far.
I'll hand over to Robin for the next part.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Ying, in regards to your second question about steady-state for growth to net, as we've
been saying, we have had four non-retail customers and payers come on board, state Medicaid, [ph] NBA (50:52), as of
Q2 and Q3. I'm a little hesitant to give a steady-state, because just as we started to get there with Sovaldi, we have now
launched Harvoni. So I think it's going to take us a couple of more quarters to get to the right mix between Sovaldi and
Harvoni, and what that gross to net to be particularly since we may have more patients on different periods of treatment
over time. So I would probably say Q2 or Q3 of next year, we will have a better idea of what steady-state is as we get
through the second product launch and get Harvoni on the dockets relative to reimbursements.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: And Ying, your last question, my comment had to do with that hurdle bar is
really high for sure treatment durations. And as I said, regulatory authorities do not consider price when they think
about this. And they would, with Harvoni, a drug that is so safe and well-tolerated with no identifiable side effects,
there is not much of a willingness to save four weeks of treatment duration if you have to increase, or decrease the
response rates by a few percentages. Again, I would urge you to look at our ION-3 study and how it is labeled. And I
agree with this, by the way from a scientific point of view. Of course the payers may have a slightly different opinion
on this shortened treatment duration.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Norbert, I think one of the questions was is it commercially competitive? These things,
if somebody else has a shorter duration than you do with all the activities, then that becomes a competitive advantage.
So that's why we're continuing to innovate across our portfolio to try to drive things to the simplest, safest, shortest
duration, and that's why you'll continue to see Norbert and his group try to innovate with other three drug combinations
in the future.

<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. A question on what you're seeing on treatment duration in the real world
with Harvoni, probably for Paul. As Norbert mentioned earlier, that the label recommends 12-weeks for all
treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients, but recommend eight weeks for those with low viral load. I'm sorry, say the low
viral load can be considered for eight weeks. Some physicians we talked to say that they intend to give 12-weeks to
everyone with treatment-naïve, with non-cirrhotic, with no cirrhosis in absence of payer requiring it for the duration. I
guess my question is how widespread is this approach among physicians and how are payers handling this? Are they
mandating eight weeks for those able to get eight weeks?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: So, Howard, the latter question, I don't know how widespread it is. But the
few folks I've talked to, they told me the same thing. These are obviously the well-known academic thought leaders.
They said, why do you want to treat for eight weeks if there's a slight chance you might have more relapse or so just
treat for 12 weeks. There is no medical or adverse event price to be paid. But those same people then said in the next
sentence that they are probably not the ones making this decision anyway, but it's probably the payers.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yes. It's far too early for us to know whether what kind of patients are being treated. I think it's
instructive to look, though, into the third quarter, where we did see very high usage of interferon-free Sovaldi plus
Olysio at this very high premium price of around $150,000. I think that will end with the arrival of Harvoni. But it will
be interesting to see how long it takes to kind of get to a steady state when the usage of the eight-week regimen reflects
the epidemiology of GT-1 patients across the U.S. and indeed Europe in due course.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Yes. And, Howard, I would just add we are going to make sure our sales reps are on
label with this, that eight weeks is the right duration for patients who are below 6 million international units at baseline.
There is no evidence that more is better in any of these patients, and that is the data that we'll emphasize as we go out
and educate about the value of eight weeks. And so I think at the end of the day, it's very clear-cut that eight weeks is a
better thing for patients, and over-prescribing is not a good thing in this world.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thanks for taking my question. And a little bit of a left field question on ambrisentan, given
that John flagged the AMBITION study results in his opening remarks. How do you see those results changing your
marketing message in the PAH market, given the changing message for your competitors, which themselves have
moved to a mortality morbidity message? I guess I'm asking whether you see PAH franchise as a legacy line or an
opportunity for growth, which gives you an opportunity to talk about 4997. Thank you.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Ravi, it's John Milligan. When you look at the timeline for the AMBITION data that
we put on the label, we'll file this before the end of year, but that means it won't be until the latter part of next year that
we would be allowed to talk about this with physicians. So we are anxious to be able to do so. It is clear that it has had
an impact with the top KOLs with regard to how they think about what the best thing is to do.
I can't tell you it's changed prescribing habits, I don't know that. But I do know that it's becoming clear in their mind
that this is the new standard of care. And what we hope is there will be further discussions and potentially guideline
changes that would allow people to have access to this very important combination. And the data, we're very crystal
clear, because we were better than either the individual treatment arms, not just placebos. So this was an important
difference that hasn't been seen in pulmonary arterial hypertension before. And we think this will be an important part
of the armamentarium for doctors.
I think your last part of the question is does this do anything to our franchise? Certainly we're very interested in PAH
and we're continuing to look through our own portfolio to see if other products that we have could also be useful in the
field of PAH. And so we'll see how things progress, but there are some options for us to do things organically that
could be quite interesting.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess diving down a little more into the Harvoni
label, can you kind of walk us through in your conversations with the FDA how they segregated the label? I hear the
point that they have a very high hurdle at this point. But looking at how they evaluate it, is there a point estimate in
their mind that they think is necessary at this point? Or is it just based on looking at subgroups that there's a specific
delta at which point they are uncomfortable with the specific duration, one over the other?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: So, Brian, obviously this was a long process, and it was a collaborative
process. We did analysis. FDA did analysis. The one thing you might notice in the label, the ribavirin arms aren't even
in there. And that was a decision that was made early because consistently across all three Phase III studies additional
ribavirin didn't make any difference, to non-ribavirin arms.
And then, you know it just proceeded, then you look at relapsers, what is the relapse rate in the eight-week arms
compared to the 12-week arms, they were 5% to 1% even though the numbers are fairly small. And things evolved
from there. Sometimes there was a statistically significant difference when arms were pooled, sometimes there wasn't,
but we ended up in this mutually acceptable situation that we are conservative, we err on the longer treatment duration
arm if there is a chance that you jeopardize response rates. That kind of was the summary of it. And a similar thing is,
by the way, the case in Europe.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Great. And just real quick, any idea on the mix between CLL and NHL for Zydelig?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: The prescriptions?
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Yes. In terms of, do you have any idea in terms of the patients you're seeing, are they
primarily refractory NHL patients or CLL patients?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Too early to tell you that, Brian, I don't know.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Very early days.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two parts: you mentioned something on HIV
being near the high end of the range. Are you expecting some inventory to come out of the channel in the next quarter?
And then just separately on patient share, I think in HCV, you said that 80% of the patients you treat are naïve, and I'm
just wondering if you could walk through that versus I think you've talked about sort of 45% potential using the
eight-week duration with Harvoni. So maybe you could just help us think about what percentage of those naïves were
cirrhotic? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Okay. Do you want...
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Go ahead.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I was going to mention the inventory. I think one of the features of the HIV inventory build
slightly this quarter was because the quarter ended on a Tuesday, which is a day typically where we get our three main
orders in the week whereas the previous quarter ended on a day – I can't remember which day it was – but a slower day,
so we did have slight build. I think specifically for quarter four, we should anticipate neither a build nor a flattening out

of inventory, probably.
The second question was on the naïve patients.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: The treatment-naïve being 80% of those patients. So I guess the best way to think
about this and the way we've been talking about it is that of the patients we look across who are treatment-naïve and
non-cirrhotic, that comes to about 45% of patients. So in looking at that 80% of patients, slightly more than half of
those who would come aboard, should be eligible for that eight weeks of therapy based on just the math that we have
seen across large data sets. We're not 100% certain if those patients are representative, so those that we're describing in
this pie chart on slide 24 are representative of the overall data set that we've looked at when we've looked at larger sets
of patients out there.
So I don't know that we can compare those apples to apples, but over time, we would expect it to be about 45% of
patients. We don't know if there will be a bias early on towards longer duration and more cirrhotic patients or not. But
it seems to us that it should even out over time at 45%.

Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks. Just a question on how you think about long-term HIV sales now that you have the
TAF data in hand. When we look beyond 2017 and into 2020, do you think your HIV sales will be lower than, similar
to, higher relative to, the pre-Viread patent expiration year?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Well, we've started off with great data on TAF and we anticipate more data coming through the
next months. So that is a very good place for us to begin the process now of thinking through our HIV portfolio. The
big bucket of patients, of course, is the patients who are already on treatment and will switch. What we've seen
historically is when you have a conversion situation, which is really the way that we're thinking about this, from
tenofovir-based single-tablet regimens to TAF-based single tablet regimens, we intend to ensure that that happens. It
won't happen by itself, but that is our clear intention.

And, Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question from the line of Jason Kolbert with Maxim. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason H. Kolbert>: Hi guys, thank you so much. Given the success of Sovaldi and given what is happening in
the dynamic with the combination product, Harvoni, how does that influence the decision to launch Sovaldi,
particularly in a country like Japan where you haven't really launched yet? So can you just help us understand? And
also where is the Japanese infrastructure at the state?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yes. I'll quickly talk about the launch. So as you know, we filed Sovaldi for
genotype two only, which is about a quarter of the Japanese population, and that is in combination with ribavirin, we
got very high response rates, and we filed Harvoni for the remainder, mostly genotype 1b patients, again we had fairly
high response rates, so Japan is very bifurcated so Sovaldi with ribavirin is for genotype two, Harvoni is for genotype
1b.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yes. The second part is about our infrastructure build out in Japan, which we are very, very
happy about. We've got over 200 Gilead employees now in Japan and getting ready for launches as and when we get
approval, which we hope will be in the first half of next year for both products.
<Q - Jason H. Kolbert>: That's awesome. Thank you so much, guys. Congratulations.
