MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. This call is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time I would
like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer,
Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you. Morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the presentation which is available on our website.
Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
So if you turn to page 1, a very strong start to the year with record net income of $6.5 billion for the first quarter and
record EPS of $1.59 a share, on revenue of $25.8 billion and return on tangible common equity of 17% for the quarter.
You can see on page 1 we've highlighted up front two significant items: a $650 million reserve release in mortgage and
a $500 million reserve release in card. And as I go through the presentation, I'll also be highlighting for you a number
of smaller items, some positive and some negative.
We continue to maintain the leadership positions we highlighted at Investor Day: number one ATM network, number
two branch network, number two mortgage originator, number one credit card issuer in the U.S. and number one
ranking in global IB fees. And we're on track to deliver against our expense targets for the year.

On a reported basis, total loans for the company were up 1% with core loan growth, excluding run-off, up 5%.
Favorable credit performance continued in our wholesale and core consumer portfolios with low levels of
delinquencies and charge-offs. As the housing market recovers, losses in the real estate portfolio continue to improve
and this quarter we saw 30-plus delinquencies decline by 14% and severities improved.
So if you turn to page 3 for a brief capital update, we ended the quarter with Basel I and Basel III Tier 1 Common of
$143 billion and $146 billion respectively, both up from last quarter. Our Basel I ratio was 10.2%, which reflects the
impact of new market risk rules that went into effect in January and the 10.2% compares to a ratio of 9.9% the last
quarter as measured on the same basis. Our Basel III ratio of 8.9% is up from 8.7% last quarter and reflects the full
impact of the rules, as we understand them. And as you know, we don't pull forward the impact of passive run-off or
model enhancements, which we expect to deliver around 100 basis points of benefit this year and next.
And we still expect to reach our Basel III Tier 1 Common target of 9.5% by the end of this year, including the capacity
to continue share repurchases. And we've also made progress this quarter and are on track for full LCR compliance this
year. So in the bullets at the bottom of the page, the Board intends to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share
effective in the second quarter and we repurchased $2.6 billion of common equity in the first quarter with authorization
to repurchase an additional $6 billion over the next four quarters.
So turning to the businesses, on page 4 we have Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer
businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.6 billion of revenue with an ROE of 23% on new
allocated capital. And as we go through the presentation, all of the current quarter ROEs are calculated based upon the
new allocated capital numbers that we showed you at Investor Day.
Overall, revenue was down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, driven by Mortgage Banking. Quarter-on-quarter, the
reduction reflects the continuation of production margin compression. Credit costs reflect the releases in both mortgage
banking and cards that we referred to on page 1 and core expenses were flattish both year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter, normalizing prior period.
We remain on track to deliver on our expense guidance and head count in the Consumer Bank and Mortgage business
was down over 3,000 heads this quarter, a function of the evolution in the branch operating model and the completion
of the IFR work. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches and close to 19,000 ATMs, and as of today we have
over 1,400 Chase Private Client locations.
On page 5, Consumer and Business Banking, net income of $641 million and an ROE of 24% on net revenue of $4.2
billion, down 2% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline is due to fewer days in the quarter for net
interest income and seasonality in non-interest revenue. We continue to see pressure on deposit margins, 8 basis points
down in the quarter and 32 basis points year-over-year, but this continues to be largely offset by deposit growth of 11%
year-over-year, which we believe is significantly faster than the industry.
And this quarter we had the lowest customer attrition on record, which reflects the great progress that we're making on
the customer experience. And we were just named winner of four TNS Choice Awards, recognizing superior
performance in customer acquisition, retention, satisfaction and market share with consumer and affluent banking
customers, which is more than any financial institution has earned in any year.
Average Business Banking loan balances of $18.7 billion are flattish quarter-over-quarter, and in the drivers you can
see loan production decreased this quarter due to softer demand and higher competitive intensity. However, the pipeline
in second quarter is looking stronger. We had record investment sales of over $9 billion, up 40% year-on-year, and
client investment assets up 15%, which shows that we're penetrating our customers more deeply with 70% of those
sales up from 50% last year being managed money, driving strong recurring revenues.
Finally on this page, expenses are up year-over-year, reflecting the investments we are making in the business,
including new branch builds and a one-time cost related to a contract renegotiation.
Turning to page 6 and Mortgage Banking, overall net income of $673 million and an ROE of 14%. If you look at the
top of the table in the first blue highlighted item, production pre-tax income was $427 million, down year-over-year

and sequentially driven by continued margin compression. As we expected and as we talked about last quarter, gain on
sale margins continued to come down this quarter and reached levels of around 100 basis points on a pre-tax basis
which compares to a normalized pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter of last year of around 180 basis points and was
driven by a significant tightening in primary and secondary spreads as well as pricing pressure reflecting increased
capacity in the market.
Strong originations of $53 billion were up 37% year-on-year and 3% sequentially while applications were actually
down 8% from last quarter but we continue to expect high levels of refinancing and closed loan volumes in the next
quarter to remain solid.
Production expense increased year-on-year on higher volumes and net repurchase offers of $81 million in the quarter
reflects a reduction in realized losses partially offset by reserve releases. We continue to believe we are adequately
reserved and we do expect reserve releases to broadly offset losses over time.
Moving down to Servicing, revenue of $778 million increased sequentially, primarily due to one-time gains associated
with buying, curing and reselling certain delinquent loans out of securities. Servicing expenses of $737 million
included a small amount of final IFR costs as we wound down the work this quarter and also some severance and if you
back those costs out, Servicing expenses were slightly lower than the $725 million normalized run rate we talked about
last quarter. IFR costs are now out of our run rate and we continue to expect servicing costs to reduce to $600 million
by the fourth quarter of this year.
MSR risk management was a modest loss, $142 million. The driver of the net loss is an increase in our expectations for
home price appreciation this year, which is a great thing, but drove an appropriate – an approximate negative $400
million within the model update line in the supplement given higher prepayments. And although there's an upfront
negative in the mark of the servicing assets, improvements in home prices will drive lower credit losses over time that
will more than outweigh this mark.
Finally on this page, Real Estate Portfolio showed pre-tax income of $784 million, which includes net charge-offs of
around $450 million this quarter and compared to a normalized fourth quarter number of $520 million. This reflects
lower delinquencies as well as lower severities as home prices improve and led us to release reserves of $650 million
this quarter.
As you've seen, charge-offs have been steadily declining and we do expect that to continue but at a more moderated
pace. And we've updated our guidance for you to expect quarterly net charge-offs to be at or below $400 million.
If you turn to page 7, Card, Merchant Services & Auto, net income of $1.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year or up 33% if
you exclude the change of loan-loss reserves and ROE of 33%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was flat year-on-year but down
quarter-on-quarter with quarter one having seasonally lower loan balances, sales volumes and merchant processing
volumes.
Expenses are down both year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by non-core expense items in the
comparable periods. Net charge-offs continue to be low and we released $500 million of loan-loss reserves this quarter
reflecting the continued improvement in early stage roll rates. The net charge-off rate is 3.55% while down over 80
basis points year-over-year was up slightly quarter-on-quarter on lower loan balances. And consistent with Investor
Day you should expect up to $1 billion of card reserve releases in the full year of 2013, including the $500 million
reflected this quarter.
Year-on-year growth in sales volume was strong at 9% and the revenue rate of 12.83% reflects strong interchange
revenue and merchant processing fees with merchant processing volumes up 15% year-on-year. And moving on to
Auto, originations were up 12% year-on-year and 18% quarter-on-quarter and the way the first quarter is seasonally
stronger, this growth outpaced the normal seasonal pattern. We gained share in the quarter, through increased
competitive positioning of prime and also saw strong growth with our private-label manufacturing partners.
Moving on to slides 8 and 9 and the Corporate Investment Bank. Very strong first quarter results and the results this
quarter included a small DVA gain of $126 million, versus a loss in the same quarter of last year of $900 million both

of which you'll see in the credit adjustments line item in the table.
So if we focus on the numbers excluding DVA, $2.5 billion of net income on $10 billion of revenue, down 2%
year-on-year but up 22% quarter-on-quarter and with an ROE of 18%. Total banking revenue of $3 billion, up 12%
year-on-year, driven by higher IB fees of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year with record bond underwriting
and lending related revenue of $500 million, primarily core NII and fees on retained loans and commitments and to a
lesser extent, gains on positions received in loan restructurings.
Total Markets & Investor Services revenue of $7 billion, down 7% year-on-year driven by Fixed Income markets of
$4.8 billion, down 5% year-on-year coming off of a very strong first quarter last year and up 50% quarter-on-quarter on
seasonality with continued strength in the client franchise. The P&L impact from the remaining Synthetic Credit
Portfolio included here was insignificant this quarter but positive.
Equity markets of $1.3 billion, down 6% year-on-year but up 50% quarter-on-quarter and the sequential change reflects
seasonally strong equity derivatives results.
Security services revenues of $974 million were flat year-on-year and down slightly quarter-on-quarter and while a
portion of this reflects the depository receipts business which is seasonally down, the portion that reflects our custody
business has grown in line with assets under custody which were at $19.3 trillion, up 8% year-on-year. And we're
seeing positive expense trends year-on-year a net reduction of 2% driven by lower compensation and efficiency
initiatives substantially offset this quarter by litigation expenses. If you take the DVA and the restructuring gains I
mentioned as well as the litigation expense, they net out.
Comp to revenue ratio ex-DVA of 34% is in line with our guidance and at the bottom of the drivers section you can see
that our average CIB VaR continued to decline this quarter to $62 million reflecting lower levels of risk including the
continued de-risking of the synthetic credit portfolio but also reflecting very low levels of volatility across multiple
asset classes.
On page 9, before I skip over this page, you can see that we continue to make progress growing our international loans
and deposits. Our international loan balances were up 9% since the end of 2012 with particular strength across Asia and
EMEA.
Moving on to page 10, in the Commercial Bank this quarter saw net income of nearly $600 million on $1.7 billion of
revenue, flat year-over-year, with a return on equity of 18%. Underlying loan growth of 11% year-on-year includes our
C&I portfolio, which grew 12%, in line with the industry, and our Commercial Real Estate book, which grew 10%
year-over-year, significantly above the industry, driven by Commercial Term Lending.
Quarter-over-quarter loan balances were generally flat, consistent with the industry, partly reflecting the fact that some
demand was pulled forward into the fourth quarter but also reflecting lower levels of demand and increased
competition. Loan spreads held up well this quarter and remain stable to last quarter and credit quality continued to be
very strong.
Lastly here, expenses up 8% year-over-year on the continued investment in the business and increased operating
expenses for Commercial Card.
Turning to page 11 our Asset Management business had record net income for a first quarter of $487 million, up 26%
year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, with an ROE of 22%. 12% year-on-year revenue growth reflects an increase in
management fees driven by strong long-term net inflows including a record $31 billion this quarter, marking the 16th
consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows.
We also had higher equity and fixed income markets, up 9% based on our business mix and saw higher performance
fees driven by strong fund returns in 2012. We had record loan balances up over $20 billion driven by increases in U.S.
mortgage and international loan growth. Total AUM was close to $1.5 trillion with over $1 trillion in long-term AUM.
And lastly, higher head count expenses and performance related comp contributed to a 9% year-over-year expense
growth but the pre-tax margin of 29% also increased from 26% last year reflecting an improvement in operating

leverage.
Moving on to page 12, Corporate and Private Equity. So the net income of $250 million for the quarter and reflected a
private equity net loss of $182 million including nearly $300 million of unrealized losses related to specific positions.
Treasury and CIO net income was $24 million and included about $500 million of net securities gains offset by about
$470 million of negative NII due to low rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. Both the Private Equity losses
and the securities gains were more significant this quarter than usual and netted to positive $200 million pre-tax.
Finally, Other Corporate net income of just over $400 million includes $230 million of prior period tax adjustments.
And finishing on guidance in CIO, Treasury our guidance remains a net loss of $300 million plus or minus and in Other
Corporate our guidance remains $100 million plus or minus of net income with both numbers able to vary
quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to page 13 and net interest margin. Firm-wide NIM declined three basis points and core NIM two basis points
quarter-on-quarter. A number of items affected our NIM. First, the negatives: the low rate environment continues to
affect our reinvestment opportunities and also competitive pressures continue to impact loan yields. On the positive
side: investment securities yields increased from higher mortgage-backed securities income driven by slower
prepayments and reduced secured financing and lower long-term debt costs reflected a change in mix.
Lastly, our outlook on page 14. We've covered most of these items already but you'll see that we've changed our NIM
and NII guidance to put it all together in one place and on a consistent basis. All numbers shown are pre-tax and are
estimates of net NII reflecting both rate compression and volume growth. So you should expect modest NIM
compression during the year with absolute levels of NII very strongly supported by growth in interest-earning assets
but overall NII expected to be down about 1% this year.
Lastly, you may have seen we will redeem about $5 billion of outstanding trust preferreds in the second quarter and as
a heads up, this will lead to a modest one-time loss in the second quarter but also a lower cost of debt over time.
Wrapping up we had a record quarter with high-quality earnings and strong underlying business performance seeing
positive momentum across our businesses. So thank you for joining us.

Our first question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning, Marianne. Just on the last point about the NII outlook, what's the
drivers of the strong growth that you're starting at...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sorry, John, we can't hear you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Turn it up.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Apologies, John. We didn't hear the question.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Can you hear me?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, we can.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Sorry about that. Can you tell me on the NII outlook, what are the drivers of the
strong growth in earning assets you expect that you just mentioned on the NII page?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so we're growing – as you've probably seen, we showed you at Investor Day and while
there was a little bit of lower growth this quarter, we do expect to grow loans in our Commercial Bank, loans in Assets
Management, wholesale loans, Mortgage Banking and we're growing our deposits very strongly, so it's really just the
underlying business driver growth that we've been seeing and expect to continue.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And on the expense outlook you mentioned for the adjusted expenses to be
down about $1 billion. What's the base that we should look at for you to be down from? Do you have that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so, John, if I refer you back and I'll – actually I'll do it for you – but if refer you back to
Investor Day, it's based upon our adjusted expenses which are defined as our expenses excluding corporate litigation
and foreclosure related matters which in 2012 was $60 billion plus or minus I think $60.1 and we're expecting to be
$59 billion this year and that's what we're on track to deliver.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And what was it in the first quarter?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A little higher than that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: A little higher than that in the first quarter but the first quarter is seasonally high.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah, okay. Got it. And then can you just repeat your outlook on the default servicing
expense line? That came down a lot this quarter nicely and you mentioned a target for the end of the year.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So the fourth quarter normalized run rate was $725 million. This quarter it's down a little
off that, as you would expect given the IFR completion. We said that we expected the fourth quarter to be running at
$600 million. We said that at Investor Day and we're still on track to do that. And we've also said that the long-term run
rate for that part of the business would be about $325 million a quarter and that would be over the next couple of years.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then the litigation dropped significantly this quarter, you said – I think you
said it was kind of immaterial this quarter on the litigation provision, is that right?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, the litigation drop quarter-over-quarter, clearly we had a large number last quarter on the
back of IFR and we did have litigation expenses this quarter. You'll see in the supplement they were just over $300
million.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And the last thing is on the buybacks, you did a healthy buyback this quarter
but the share count didn't shrink that much. Is the first quarter heavier than usual in terms of your issuance? And the
question is getting at would $2.6 billion of buybacks in other quarters be expected to shrink the share count in quarters
when it's not the first quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. That's right, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So your issuance is more weighted towards the first, is that right?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, but also remember we didn't buy back shares in the fourth quarter or the third quarter so
there was an overall net $2.6 billion, but those $2.6 billion net of employee issuance.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: I'm just getting at how that translates to reduction in the share count. It's kind of offset
by what you do on issuance, right, each quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And was this a normal quarter of issuance, so kind of a $2.6 billion buyback keeps the
share count flat, is that the kind of ratio we might expect?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. I think the issuance number is fairly level and consistent quarter by quarter because it's really
based upon amortization of restricted stock and all that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the buyback, the $2.6 billion, remember that's – that was over the course of the quarter so it
averaged out to half of that for the quarter so we can give you more detail on that a little bit later, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. But it's steady throughout the year, that's what I was getting at.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The $6 billion will offset how much average amortization over the same 12-month period, like
$2 billion.
<A - Marianne Lake>: $2 billion. Yes. So, John, that's a good way of looking at it. The $6 billion we're authorized to
repurchase relates to employee issuance over the same period of just a little bit over $2 billion.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: For accounting purposes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Two billion for the year and $6 billion for the year, okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Nomura.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello, there. First one, the first deadline for compliance with Central Clearing came and went
and it clearly didn't have much of an impact on your first quarter FICC results. So I'm curious, I hear commentary in
the market that a lot of clients might not be ready for either the second or the third deadlines later this year. Curious
what you're expecting and if you do think it could produce any hiccup in activity levels?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The second one is the big one. That's June 11.
<A - Marianne Lake>: June 11, yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Something like that and that's where you have a lot of asset manager – I mean a lot of bigger
client stuff like that. People are still getting used to it so we think, I think we've got 30% to 40% lined up to do it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yep.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: They're still reading documents. They have to sign new documents and so hopefully it will go
smoothly. It's unlikely to go smoothly the first round. The first round were really, really large participants and swap
deals, et cetera, so we'll have to just wait and see.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: And even on the wait-and-see if some aren't ready, do you think of that as a temporary and just
literally a function of processing, not maybe we don't need insurance anymore because it's too expensive?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I don't. We really don't know. I would say temporary but probably still down a little bit because
of the reason you gave. Some people will just say we don't need to do this anymore. And we also know all the final
rules, by the way, and how the SEFs are going to work and bidding.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Right. Okay. Marianne, on the RWA front, a bunch of little things in here but Basel I RWAs
were up 11% quarter-on-quarter but Basel III were pretty much flat. I know that has something to do with 2.5 being –
starting in the first quarter but if you can help us?

<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. If you take – our Basel I RWA went up about a couple hundred billion dollars, that's all
about the implementation of new market risk rules in Basel 2.5 which is also why you saw our ratio go down from a
reported 11% last quarter. So it's really all explained by that and our Basel III RWA was flattish quarter-over-quarter
with some pluses and some minuses.

and model enhancements are not pulled forward in your results and I think you said it could be about 100 basis points.
Is there a dollar amount of RWA natural runoff that we should be thinking about? Because obviously capital's building.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. Recollection, and again, Glenn, at the forgive me if I get this wrong it's on the slides from
the firm's overview at Investor Day but I think about 100 basis points equates to about $180 billion of RWA over the
next two years. But remember the passive runoff will take place over time not completely linearly but over time and the
model enhancements can be a little bit lumpier and a little bit more back ended, so we'll just have to see how that plays
out. But yes, we're still expecting for those things to happen, for us to get 100 basis points of benefit from that and
that's without the active mitigation. That's going to happen over the course of time.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Last one...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Just check that slide for me, Glenn, when you get a chance.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Will do. Last one. Jamie, I know you addressed some of this in your shareholder letter but
between everything related to Basel III, stress tests, Dodd-Frank in place already and then OLA and living wills coming
online, it feels like we're going down the path on containing too big to fail but yet there's a steady drumbeat, including
Brown-Vitter, to change things. Just curious on where we're headed in this and what will stop the drumbeat? When is
enough, enough?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, Glenn, I actually think you all on the line should be dealing with this issue a little bit
because the reason you have companies is because they serve clients well at a good cost. There's a reason our numbers
are good, it's because we have cross sell and clients come to us. And there's reasons for global banks just like there's
reasons for community banks.
I think that the real issue, again, and you guys do the numbers, is the banking system has gotten so much stronger in the
United States and it's not just capital but it's capital, liquidity, oversight, certain activities that people didn't like are no
longer being done. Derivatives going to clearing houses and the initial wave of OLA and living wills, et cetera – those
things should all work. I hope at one point we declare victory and just stop eating our young at this thing.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Hey.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple of follow-ups on RWA. How much of the passive mitigation was embedded
within the RWA results for Basel III this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Betsy, there was a little bit of passive mitigation, there was a little bit of runoff and there
was also some declines as we purchased back some AFS securities and those were offset by some other things. So it

wasn't a very big number because, as I say, that will bleed in over time and the model enhancements which are about a
half of the 100 basis point benefit will be a bit back-ended.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. So really that's going to come later this year is what you're saying?
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's right. Yeah, some of it later this year, some of it next.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And then on the NIM and the LCR there's obviously an interplay there and could you
just give us an update on where you are with the LCR this quarter because your NIM decline this quarter actually was a
lot lighter than what we were expecting?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so we showed you at Investor Day that we had a gap to be fully compliant – we're going
to be compliant by the end of the year...
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We did close that gap this quarter, not completely, by about a-third. Obviously we also
disclosed on the slides, you'll see our HQLA, our high-quality liquid assets, which has a relationship has gone up, but
that's the numerator and the denominator changes too. So think about it as we've made good progress. We've closed the
gap by about a third and we're on the road to compliance.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think it's in – when Marianne gave you the forecast going forward for NIM...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That includes changing how we create more LCR.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right. Okay. And then lastly, just on the CCAR conditional approval, can you just give
us a sense – because I think people were a little bit surprised to see that you had the conditional approval results and yet
you were able to do the buyback and the dividend hike that you asked for. So I guess the underlying question is, what
can you speak to with regard to what's being asked and what kind of timeframe do you think you have for satisfying the
regulatory requirements here?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So let me just – on the quantitative stuff we passed and that's why we've got the capital plan.
Their criticisms were around qualitative and from what we know now and we're still doing work and give you more
they want more granular type of forecasting, they want more idiosyncratic type of forecasting and so we're having
conversations with them. Marianne has formed a CCAR department, which is going to become experts in CCAR.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And, Betsy, in terms of the timeline, we're resubmitting as requested in the third quarter and
we're doing everything between now and then to remediate and improve our processes following their feedback so
we're committed to being successful.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So just a follow up on the question on litigation, that dropped to the $0.3 billion. Is that
potentially – are we now adjusting to a lower level? Or was that just noise in what is an extremely volatile number
bouncing around a little?

<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Brennan, I think it's very hard to predict and you're right that it bounces around and it can
be noisy. We had a higher level of litigation reserves in the first quarter of last year and we hope that the number will
remain low but we can't predict them for you, I'm afraid.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure. Okay. But I guess said another way, you guys don't see anything changing in the
environment that would lead you to believe or be comfortable with a lower level of assumption of litigation expenses
when we think about...?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's always going to be lumpy because we have to deal with these things in due course. I think in
the prior years we put away a lot, we always kept the same predominantly mortgage, largely mortgage, et cetera.
Obviously the fact we're not doing more means we think we've gotten there, we did a lot of work on that, it could
always change but we've done thorough analyses, as a lot of you all did, by the way, so we did it at the tranche level
almost. So could it be permanently lower? Yes, it could be permanently lower, it doesn't have to go higher but
obviously there are a lot of things coming our way and we'll have to reserve for them appropriately as they come in.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah, let's hope so. Okay and then the spread in mortgage compression was kind of
meaningful here this quarter. What inning do you think we're in there, ballpark? I know it's kind of tough to predict as
well.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's tough to predict but maybe the thing you could look at it is if you take our pre-tax spread
right now of 100 basis points that compares to a longer-term, sort of average run rate of 65 basis points before the
crisis. So we've been stepping down from a very, very high level at the beginning of 2012 and we're back to a level
where frankly, we're not that far away from the longer-term run rate and it's driven by the primary secondary spread
which came in about 20 basis points in the quarter back to levels that, again, feel more normal, so I don't know if I
could say what inning we're in, I'm not a sports person but it doesn't feel like we have another big step change to go.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We expect it might be up a little bit next quarter, not down for a variety of reasons.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, there's really volatility quarter-on-quarter but for this year we think we're in and around
this range.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. So this is the right way to think about it. Cool, that helps. And then last one for me,
when you think about your cap markets business and the pending change, you guys chatted a little bit about it with
Glenn on the swap clearing, June seems like the bigger date and Basel and all of the subsequent changes to the
competitive environment, competitors adjusting the size of their business and what have you, how do you feel about
your business there particularly on the FICC side, more capital-intensive businesses? Do you think that there is this
presents an opportunity to maybe go through a review and right-size maybe increase the efficiency measures there? Or
do you feel comfortable keeping your business where it is roughly?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A lot of that business is, we call it flow business so if you look at credit, emerging markets, rates,
FX. With clients – we deal with clients all around the world and they need those services and obviously we're always
trying to become more efficient. So if you look at FX, I'm going to say 80% is electronic. If you look at rates, the
electronic number is going to go up and so we're going to drive efficiency but we still think clients are going to need it,
there will be spreads to pay for it and obviously everybody's going to be adjusting to Basel III. But as you pointed out,
some people are leaving the business, some are getting in the business, we think it has a good future. We don't think it's
going to go away.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America.

buyback and $6 billion this year. I guess what does the Fed need to see – and you're building capital clearly, what do
you think the Fed needs to see from you in terms of the qualitative issues to get back to the kind of capital return that
they clearly in 2012 they thought you had plenty of capacity to pay out?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think you're confusing two different things, I really think it's about quality. They are going to
give us more feedback on where they say we fell short on quality I mentioned them idiosyncratic, more level detail,
more enterprise-wide type of forecasting, et cetera. That's one issue. The second is the actual dollar amount. The Fed
has made it very clear they want people to get their Basel III targets, ours is at least 9.5%. They – Ben Bernanke said on
a speech he gave, that the banks that they did the stress tests on, have more capital after extreme stress than they started
with in the crisis. So the Fed I think is getting more and more comfortable, not just individual banks but the system as a
whole and we reduced the 15 down to 6 because we wanted to get to our 9.5% target faster. That's why we did it.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We just changed our mind, we want to get 9.5% this year, we want to get to LCR this year and
obviously they may change the stress test next year and we assume we're going to have a conservation buffer coming in
and we don't know how the interplay of those two things will work.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Okay. And given what you just mentioned is it too optimistic to assume for next year a
buyback in the $12 to $15 billion range?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think it's too early.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, it's too early for us to tell that.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And remember all that is going to relate to how fast you grow and other requests from regulators
so we'll take that when we get there.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Erica, we do expect that we will be continuing to grow capital just through this 100 basis
points of passive run-off and mitigation so certainly our capital levels will be strong and we're just going to have to see
how things play out.

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Good morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Loan growth is a little bit softer and I think you mentioned there was some push forward to the
fourth quarter but you also mention more competition and lower levels of demand if I heard you correctly. So my
question is how much of the softer loan growth is due to JPMorgan perhaps pulling back? And how much is due to the
economy?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's a little difficult to size it for you but we did see a lot of deals pull forward to the fourth
quarter just given the year-end issues that people were concerned about and so that has had an impact. I think it's
slightly less of an impact than in terms of the competitive landscape and there are deals being done with terms and
conditions and pricing that we're not comfortable with at the moment and we're just remaining very disciplined so that
has had an impact for us.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So really on the lower level of demand, what was your loan utilization in the first quarter versus
the fourth quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Broadly flat, broadly flat around 32%.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I'm sorry.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Broadly flat at around 32%.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: 32%?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And so what's that? Kind of flat or down a little bit.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Broadly flat, flat.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Flat. And is that just – why aren't people borrowing more?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We saw declines in deposits so they're using their cash, they're waiting it out.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then a separate question looking at the annual report, page 4 of the Chairman's letter
says – refers to regulation and some of the issues that you faced and said we will see more of these, I'm sorry, so when
you say we will see more of these, Jamie, what are you talking about, because people's imaginations can go in a lot of
different directions. Are we talking Department of Justice, SEC, FBI were you thinking of anything in particular or
general or a timeframe and really what I'm asking you to address is the regulatory tail risk of we don't know what we
don't know in terms of potential government moves as it relates to JPMorgan?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, hey, Mike, it's Marianne. So we're in constant dialogue with our regulators and so we know
that we should be expecting some more consent orders but to clarify for you, they relate to issues that we've been
working on over the course of the last several years so these are not new breaking issues that will surprise you in any
material way.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And was there anything new as part of the Levin hearings that would change the way you
would think about the London whale incident? Because there is some pretty damning information, some unknowns, at
least to those of us who follow the company, but from your perspective is there anything else that you need to do as a
result of the information from those hearings?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Mike, we can't really go into the details of the report in specifics but we obviously respect
the work of the subcommittee, we respect the findings they had and we're working very hard to fix our issues and as it
relates to the proposal and the recommendation to require documentation associated with portfolio hedging, identifying
the specific risks that the hedge is designed to mitigate and then monitoring it over time, we tend to agree that, that
makes a lot of sense in the context of what we faced.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, when you talk about some additional changes that need to take place, and I
think some of these are organizational, is there anything major new that you did not cover at the Investor Day recently?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, and actually there is a couple of things I would say, first, that we're organizing ourselves
around the control and regulatory agenda because it's a high priority for us and we're getting ourselves organized in the
same way as we would around a merger or an acquisition and in doing that we are prioritizing our work but we're not
changing our overall strategy, we're not going to change the way we treat our customers, how we think about growing
our businesses, but at the margin we're going to refocus our energies on making sure that we execute on the
commitments to improve the control and regulatory environment.

Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Matt.
Operator
Mr. Burnell, your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Sorry. Can you hear me now?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the mortgage side of things,
mortgage originations were a little bit stronger than we expected, up about 3%. Applications were down about 8%. You
suggested that you thought the gain on sale margins might be relatively flattish going through the next couple of
quarters. I guess I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are in terms of the mortgage origination market away from
the gain on sale issues that you've been facing.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So applications actually have come back up, rates have come down a little in the second
quarter and for us in particular starting there, we're expecting refi volumes to stay high. We did see a little bit of an
increase in purchase volumes in the applications in the first quarter, albeit from a smaller base and also we did the
MetLife transaction so we have the opportunity to be working that portfolio.
So our view on volumes for the year is that they're going to remain solid although there'll be some volatility really on
the back of continued strength in refinancing, and you saw the HARP extension so more broadly for the market I think
refi including HARP will be a level of support for volumes this year.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And then, Marianne, a question on NIM, clearly your moves on the LCR had some effect on
NIM over the last quarter or two. Can you separate what you think the net interest margin movements will be for
JPMorgan, ex-your – excluding your moves for the LCR? Or is it just so intertwined that you really can't do that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I mean, it's really – honestly it's really all part of how we think about positioning the
organization and being compliant with LCR as part of our new reality, so it's just a part of – we've embedded into just
how we're thinking about the overall positioning of the firm so it's not something we're separating out for you.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just finally we saw a fairly sizable decline in value at risk both in the CIB and
overall. Can you give us a little more color as to what's going on there and what we might be able to expect in the
second quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, it's hard for me to predict the second quarter. It is a real reduction in risk across the
portfolio including and not driven by but including the Synthetic Credit Portfolio which we continue to de-risk but it is
important to note if you look across the asset classes there's been a very significant decline in the levels of volatility
that affect the time period for our look back series so that necessarily so bad days rolled off and better days rolled on
and so when we compute our VaR it's pushing the VaR down lower so as long as volatility remains low and we
continue to de-risk there's reasons to believe it will be at or around this level but it is going to be subject to changes in
volatility as and when they happen.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. A couple of cleanup things. When you are looking at the – getting to the
9.5% did you kind of factor in that 100 basis points? Or is that something that would be on top of that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Factored in.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Factored in.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's factored in.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's an all-in number for us, so to the degree that we expect that to happen by the year end it's
all part of the number including some capacity to buy shares, the whole thing.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got it. Okay. And kind of talking qualitatively about the CCAR process also there was a
pretty large impact on PPNR [Pre-Provision Net Revenue] which seems to be the Fed's looking at pretty harsh I guess a
pretty harsh look at trading losses, do you have a – I mean have you had any kind of clarity from them about whether
they're looking at that revenue stream differently than other banking revenue streams?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, I'll take the two things separately, the PPNR separate from the trading losses. So on the
trading losses obviously there's a number of different stresses that we do and while our number was different I don't
think we feel like there's anything about our processes that is materially going to change but as it relates to PPNR we
did get feedback that we need to look at that in our revenue models and we need to look at them more centrally and as
Jamie said with a slightly more negative view idiosyncratically and we're going to do that.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. And then lastly, on the Mortgage business it looked like in the core production – the
expense reduction was about half of the revenue decline. How do you think about – as that business continues to
normalize, as you said it's probably mostly normalized from a gain on sale perspective although you probably have
some volume issues as we go through the rest of the year. How do you think about the cost structure of that business as
you go forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So a couple of things. One more is we are expecting to and hoping to – we set a target for
ourselves to gain share. We do expect volume to be supported by refinancing this year, so that is our expectation. It
could change of course.
And then as it relates to the cost structure obviously that comes down a little bit more slowly over time but we're
making progress and we talked about the fact that we expect that to be down at $600 million run rate for the fourth
quarter and down to $325 sometime over the next couple of years. And we're actively working on optimizing our
servicing business, both the core performance servicing and you saw that obviously with the MetLife deal but also were
it would make sense we would be open to doing sales on sub servicing of delinquent loans and we're working through
all those things to try and get the cost structure to the best place it can be.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: Private equity, we've always told you it's lumpy. It was just markdowns and write-downs of
existing positions so – and we don't go through the specific names. Obviously we hope it'll earn a profit so it just wasn't
a pretty good quarter for private equity. And the private equity legally can survive Volcker and all those things. So we
like the business, we like the people and we just have to do it in a different basis, that's all.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Is there any seasonality in terms of getting – I don't know, year-end or mid-year statements
on the private portfolios...?

Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. First thing I wanted to ask was if we could dig in a little bit on the repurchase
losses within mortgage servicing. Such a big swing versus the fourth quarter, an $81 million – sounds like a reserve
build because I think I heard you say that your actual realized losses were not significant and yet the guidance remains
that it should be a net zero. So it just seemed like there was a lot of moving parts there. I was hoping maybe you could
give us a little sense for why you have the $81 million hit?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, no, absolutely. So, Guy, it's a big change from the fourth quarter off of a small number
so not to diminish the size of the numbers but positive 50, negative 80 plus or minus around the zero level and what
that is a factor of, Guy, is that the reserve release is based upon our model and realized losses is based upon agency
activity and so the timing isn't exactly perfect. So realized offers came down from about $200 million to $180 million
and we didn't build reserves, we released them, just not at the same order of magnitude. And it's really to do with
timing, which is why we say that we do expect over time they'll net to zero. Last quarter it was a small positive, this
quarter it's a small negative. Nothing to read into it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Thanks for that. With regard to the CCAR process and some of the changes that the
Fed is asking you to make, first of all just qualitatively, can you give us a sense for the amount of dialogue that you
have with the Fed as you work towards satisfying their request so that you really know exactly where they thought the
deficiencies were or is there a lot of guess work for you on that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, we're in constant dialogue with the regulators. We obviously can't comment on the
specifics of our conversations with them. We've had some very constructive conversations as we came out of the 2013
CCAR process and on the basis of those we're actively working to make the improvements they want us to make. We're
also expecting to continue to get more and more detailed feedback and actually hope to get some industry best practice
information too. So we're going to be working in partnership with them, in constant dialogue all the way through this
year so that we can be clear on what success looks like.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just if I can follow-up on – I think it was Moshe's question about the PPNR. It sounded
like you're saying that many of the deficiencies that they were focusing on were in the inputs to the calculation of the
stress PPNR specifically. Did I understand that right?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We haven't got a lot of feedback yet, so there'll be more to come but we're going to be geared up
to do it. And I think we want to be best in class in CCAR. The answer is absolutely part of it was in PPNR. I mentioned
just one: idiosyncratic exposure and risk in PPNR. So when you go through a stress test, you can assume that your
company is just dealing with all those macroeconomic factors, which you forecast. You can assume your company is

going through those macroeconomic forecasts, plus you're under some other kind of stress and you can you lose market
shares. Obviously that would change your PPNR. So we'll be having more dialogue and trying to figure out and make
sure we do the right thing here.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. I hope this doesn't sound too crazy but just to think about
it the other way, is there any chance that after the resubmission or as part of the resubmission, given how close you are
to your Basel III targets and with some of that 100 basis points coming in, is there any chance that you would ask for
and could get an increase for this year?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. This is just a resubmission of the progress program and they'd like to see qualitative
improvements. This is not a change of request all. This is the one that Marianne referred to that'll be in the third quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was talking about.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We'll obviously do another CCAR in January.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And then final question, you mentioned, Jamie, in the shareholder letter that just
because you don't have big fancily-named cost cutting programs doesn't mean you're not very focused on cost
reduction. Is that what we're seeing in the fact that if you look at the CIB, your comp was down 7% versus your
revenue being plus or is it that you did something different in the way you think about through the year accruals?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. It's – through the year accruals is almost exactly the same. It's based upon – there is a lot of
stuff that goes in that number, but that really hasn't changed that much.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, and I see – you've got to normalize out for DVA, which was a large loss last quarter. If
you normalize that out, revenues are down so it's not comp down, revenues up.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: That's fair.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I was referring to that we're constantly putting in new operational, new systems to reduce
overhead. Marianne already mentioned a bunch of things we're doing in mortgage. You're seeing similar efforts in
consumer, that's a constant effort. We do have names for some of them, by the way, I'm just not mentioning them here.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. But there's nothing different, like you said, in terms of the way you accrue for bonuses
within the investment bank?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning. I had some questions on the Commercial Banking line of
business. You had a nice increase in the real estate lending area in the first quarter, looked like it was about $9 billion
after four quarters of essentially flat to down real estate loans. Can you give us some color on where the growth was?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think you're referring to the CTL, the Commercial Term Lending, which is lending against
multifamily and we have seen growth in it. Remember that stuff is like 65% LTV. It did great through this last
downturn, so we're very comfortable with that kind of lending.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Are you guys finding greater demand? Or are you just more comfortable with it now than
you were maybe a year ago?

<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would say little of both.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Following up on your guys' answer about corporate deposits dropping in the quarter, which
obviously is a good sign if companies are using this for capital improvements, what's your outlook – do you expect that
to continue? Should we see that as a continued positive trend?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Are you talking about the Commercial Bank or the total company?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Commercial Bank.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, I think it – we would expect it to be flat to down a little bit as companies use their – I mean
they have lot of deposits so I think we had at Investor Day and earlier told people they were kind of really high and we
expect they'll come down, particularly before people start using their revolvers. So they do relate to each other.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: I agree. Are your guys on the front line hearing that from your customers that they expect to
use more of them for the remainder of the year do you think?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I don't know the answer to that.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Coming back to loan-loss reserves, obviously you've got a great capital position, you
pointed out that Bernanke has indicated that the banking system is super strong going through the stress test. With the
current level of loans of about $729 billion, what would be a normal reserve level in normal times compared to where
you are today?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We did a whole page for you on where we thought the through-the-cycle reserve levels should
be by business and there were some businesses, mortgage most obviously, that still have a way to go and there are other
businesses in the wholesale space and the Commercial Bank that are below their through-the-cycle. I would refer you
back to that page. If you do the numbers from recollection, on an annualized basis our charge-offs would be more like
$7 or $8 billion which while that is not dissimilar to charge-offs we've seen, it's for different reasons. So I would take a
look at that page.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's mostly mortgages that will come down. Think of everything else as close to normal.
Mortgage, which in total is $9 billion, will eventually be a lot lower than that but that could take a couple of years.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. I know a lot of my questions have been answered but we saw
yesterday that they extended the HARP out another two years and there's also some discussion coming out of some of
the – out of the White House really, that they could put some type of PR plan behind HARP to try to get more people to
HARP. Do you think this will have any impact at all in getting more people off the sidelines and refinancing through
the HARP programs?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Let's – just to talk for us specifically, as you probably know, we've been very successful and
proactive as it's relating to the HARP in our own book and by the end of this year we fully expect it to have been as
successful and mined that as far as possible, although we'll carry on.
That's not the case in the industry so it's great news that HARP was extended out to the end of 2015 and it will allow
for other services to get their ducks in a row, potentially to have cross-service at HARP which in turn should be good in
terms of volumes although I don't think it will be a step change. And for us, we're not expecting it to be a significant
difference in our production or in our MSR value.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: How much – I mean I don't know if you can disclose this or not but how much do think that you
have HARP eligible? And how many of those HARP-eligible loans did you do on a percentage basis? Do you think
you've touched most of them already?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We talked about – we peaked in our HARP volumes in about the second quarter of last year. I
think overall the first half of last year was high, it came down slightly, overall 15% last year. We talked at Investor Day
that we thought that would go down to a high single digit this year and it is, in terms of our percentage of our
production. And we are very, very active and have been very proactive in mailing our HARP population and expected
it to have completed the program by the end of the year. So we were on track and this doesn't change our expectations.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: If you take all mortgages, I think the numbers are four million could be HARP-able today if they
went to it and I was somewhat surprised that more people don't do it, to tell you the truth. Anything the government can
do either PR, or I think that cross servicing is probably a bigger one, will make this slightly better. It's just things are
slightly better, it's not going to dramatically change mortgage.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. I think a lot of companies have told us that they think that they've got through most of the
low-hanging fruit with HARP and that the people that aren't HARP-ing, they doubt they will ever HARP. So I'm just
wondering if there's a big PR push, if some of those guys will wake up and say oh, maybe I need to look at this
program?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We hope so. We don't know any better than you.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. A quick question sort of back to the Brown-Vitter stuff that's kind of
hanging around out there, I'm reading what everybody else is that they're looking at sort of a 10% capital ratio with the
possibility of another 5% buffer on top of that and basically throwing away the concept of risk-weighted assets and
more or less eviscerating Basel III as far as I can see. I mean do you guys have any sense where this sort of 10%, 5%
number comes from? Is there some sort of empirical evidence? Or is this just sort of a backdoor way to try to get the
biggest banks to break up.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You'll really have to ask them and we'll leave this to them and the regulators. Okay?
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Well, is there – do you have a sense where the numbers are coming from? What that 10%
capital ratio where it comes from.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You've got to ask them.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: All right.
