Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Thanks, John.
Today we're pleased to report strong third quarter results with ongoing earnings per share up more than 14%, at the
high end of our outlook for the quarter. We delivered these results while taking action to enhance our long-term
growth, particularly in emerging markets and with our pharmaceutical pipeline. This includes the closing of the Piramal
Healthcare Solutions acquisition establishing Abbott as the market share leader in the fast-growing Indian
pharmaceutical market. We also completed the integration planning for the Solvay acquisition and are on track to
achieve the significant accretion profile we've outlined for that transaction.
We continued our efforts to enhance our pharmaceutical pipeline with the addition of another attractive late-stage asset,
Bardoxolone, for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. This follows the addition of several novel compounds that we
added earlier this year for MS, oncology and women's health. The strategic actions we've taken position us well in
high-growth markets, as well as promising new therapeutic areas.
In the quarter, we delivered double-digit sales growth and we reported ongoing EPS of $1.05, up 14.1% from 2009 and
at the high end of our previous guidance range. Sales growth in the quarter was 11.8%, including an unfavorable 1%
impact from foreign exchange rates. Sales included the contribution from the Solvay acquisition adding roughly $900
million in sales for the quarter. The Piramal acquisition closed at the end of the third quarter, and while we recorded the
purchase on the balance seat there were no sales from Piramal reflected in our third quarter results.
Sales growth was negatively impacted by higher rebates required under U.S. healthcare reform, an approximate $1
million impact of nutritional product recall and sales returns associated with the withdrawal of sibutramine. Despite
these headwinds we delivered a strong overall sales and EPS growth, as well as gross margin expansion. Excluding the
impact of the recall that was communicated in September, sales growth would have exceeded 13%, in line with our
guidance for the quarter of low-teens sales growth.
The adjusted gross margin ratio for the quarter was 61.6%, more than 100 basis points ahead of our forecast and
significantly up from 2009 driven by strong performance across several businesses, including vascular,
pharmaceuticals, diabetes care and diagnostics, as well as a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. This gross
margin improvement occurred despite the high fall-through impact of the recall.
We also had strong double-digit growth in investment spending in the quarter, including the contribution from the
Solvay acquisition. Ongoing R&D investment was 10.6% of sales reflecting continued progress in our broad-based
pipeline. This includes programs in biologics and vascular, as well as promising clinical programs on HCV, oncology
and neuroscience.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2010, we're raising the lower end of our previous guidance range by 3 cents. As
a result, our full year 2010 guidance range is now $4.16 to $4.18, which excluded specified items. The midpoint of this
guidance range reflects growth of more than 12% over 2009. We continue to expect strong double-digit sales growth,
including the incremental sales from the Solvay Pharmaceuticals acquisition.

For the full year we're forecasting foreign exchange rates to have a favorable be impact of sales growth of
approximately 1%. This reflects the year-to-date impact and our fourth quarter forecast of a negative impact from
exchange on sales of around 1%.
We expect a significant improvement in the full year adjusted gross margin ratio over last year with the 2010 ratio at
around 60%. This reflects the favorable impacts of improved product mix and efficiency initiatives, as well as the
additional of Solvay Pharmaceuticals.
Also for the full year, we're forecasting continued investment in research and development programs to drive future
growth with R&D of approximately 9.5 to 10% of sales.
As you know, we added Solvay to the expense base this year which has a higher SG&A to sales ratio than Abbott. This
is expected to result SG&A as a percentage of sales for the full year of more than 27%.
During the quarter we completed the integration planning for the Solvay acquisition and announced the one-time costs
of the associated restructuring and integration in line with our expectations.
For the first time we're providing fourth quarter ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.29 to $1.31. We're
forecasting low to mid-teens sales growth in the fourth quarter, including the 1% negative impact from exchange
previously mentioned. We expect an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 61%, R&D as a percentage of sales
around 9.5%, SG&A as a percentage of sales somewhat above 26%.
In summary, we had strong performance in the third quarter that exceeded our previous targets and confirmed our
outlook for 2010 while raising the lower end of our full year ongoing EPS guidance range. We also advanced our
broad-based strategy through the addition of new growth drivers and through geographic expansion to capture new
opportunities in the years ahead.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry and John for the business operating highlights beginning with Larry and
pharmaceuticals.
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President for Investor Relations
Thanks tom. In our global pharmaceuticals business, the worldwide reported sales increased nearly 22% driven by
strong growth of nearly 30% in our international pharmaceuticals business and 13.5% in our U.S. business. Sales
included the contribution from the Solvay acquisition which closed in February.
In our proprietary pharmaceuticals business in immunology global HUMIRA operational sales increased more than
16%. Performance was driven by strong international operational sales growth of more than 23%, including a modest
impact from austerity measures in some European countries. HUMIRA sales in the U.S. grew more than 8%, including
the impact of healthcare reform in line with underlying trends for the product. Demand for HUMIRA continues to
outpace the global market and new competitive entrants continue to track in line with our modest expectations for these
products.
Internationally, strong double-digit market growth continues in the major European countries where HUMIRA holds
the number one share position. We anticipate that HUMIRA will eventually become the number one anti-TNF
worldwide surpassing the current global market share leader.
We continue to launch HUMIRA indications into new countries around the world. Earlier this year, HUMIRA was the
first biologic approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in Japan and we're on track for approval of
our ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease indications in Japan by year-end. Additionally, we launched our first
indication in China during the quarter.
HUMIRA clinical data continues to compare favorably versus existing agents or potential new competitors. In fact, at
the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting, we'll present data across the rheumatology indications,
including data demonstrating radiographic inhibition with HUMIRA out to eight years in RA and five years in early

RA. HUMIRA is the only biologic to demonstrate radiographic inhibition for this length of time.
Based on outstanding clinical data across our full range of indications and more than 13 years of clinical experience we
continue to be well-positioned for success in this efficacy driven market. We continue to expect global reported sales
growth approaching 20% for HUMIRA in 2010.
Moving on to our lipid franchise, where global TRILIPIX/TriCor sales increased more than 22%, including the
international contribution from Solvay. In the U.S., sales increased more than 3%.
Regarding the U.S. approval process for Certriad, the fixed dose combination of CRESTOR and TRILIPX, we continue
our work to address FDA's questions on the submission and expect to meet with the agency within the next few
months.
Sales of Niaspan, our HDL raising therapy, were up nearly 5% in the quarter, outpacing the growth of the overall lipid
market. There are currently more than 1 million patients on Niaspan and during the quarter Niaspan's share of the total
lipid market reached an all-time high. Continued momentum from the ARBITER – HALTS data, as well as an ongoing
consumer awareness campaign, are driving positive trends for Niaspan.
During the quarter we received FDA approval for two new dosage strengths of SIMCOR that include 40-milligrams of
simvastatin. These new dosage strengths provide additional flexibility for physicians, as almost half of simvastatin
prescriptions are written for the 40-milligram dose.
U.S. sales of two key products from Solvay, AndroGel and CREON, were approximately $190 million and $80 million,
respectively, in the quarter. AndroGel holds the number one share position in the testosterone replacement market, an
attractive category that continues to grow double-digits due to the growing diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone.
CREON also maintains the leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market and prescription volume reached an
all-time high during the quarter.
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit reported sales growth in both our U.S. and international
pharmaceuticals businesses, including Solvay.
Moving on to our pharmaceutical pipeline, where we have continued to augment our late-stage portfolio with
promising new assets, we have a number of unique compounds in development for oncology, immunology, HCV,
neuroscience, and pain management, and other areas of high unmet need.
As Tom mentioned, during the quarter we entered into a collaboration agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals to
develop and commercialize Bardoxolone, a promising late-stage compound for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.
The agreement gives Abbott exclusive rights to develop Bardoxolone outside the United States, excluding certain Asian
markets.
Bardoxolone is an oral first in class compound that works by increasing filtration in the kidneys. Early clinical studies
suggest Bardoxolone could be a significant improvement to the current standard of care and possibly preventing
patients from progressing to the later stages of the disease, and dialysis. A Phase IIb study was recently completed, and
the late-breaking data from this study will likely be presented at the upcoming American Society of Nephrology
meeting in November. Discussions with regulatory authorities are underway regarding phase three study design.
We also recently entered into a collaboration with Neurocrine to develop Elagolix, a first-in-class oral compound for
endometriosis-related pain and uterine fibroids. A Phase II study was recently completed in endometriosis, and we're
working with regulatory agencies to determine next steps for development, including the Phase III clinical program.
In immunology, we're leveraging our experience with HUMIRA to identify new mechanisms with the potential to treat
an array of autoimmune diseases. Our pipeline includes early stage work in oral DMARD therapies, as well as a
number of biologic candidates. This includes ABT-874, our anti-IL 12 and 23 for psoriasis, which we recently
submitted for regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this month we presented data from the four pivotal trials which showed patients treated with ABT-874 achieved
superior skin clearance rates than those treated with Enbrel, methotrexate, or a placebo.
In oncology, we're working to advance a number of novel compounds targeting more than 15 different cancers and
tumor types. ABT-888, our PARP-inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in a
number of cancer types, and we plan to initiate a phase three study of ABT-888 in breast cancer early next year.
ABT-869, our multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, has already generated early data in liver, lung, and kidney cancer. It's
currently in Phase III for liver cancer, and in Phase II for additional cancer types.
ABT-263, our Bcl-2 family inhibitor, is in Phase II for CLL and other cancers and in Phase I for a number of solid
tumors.
Additionally, our acquisition of Facet Biotech included several oncology collaborations, including elotuzumab, which
is currently in Phase II for multiple myeloma.
We're also evaluating a number of promising mechanisms in our preclinical oncology pipeline, including work on an
early stage cMET-antibody, and an EGFR-inhibitor that is on track to begin Phase I by the end of the year.
In HCV, our goal is to transform current treatment practices by shortening the duration of therapy, improving
tolerability, and increasing cure rates. We recently advanced a new mechanism of action, NS5A, into the clinic, and
we'll be presenting late-breaking Phase II data on ABT-450, our protease-inhibitor, at the upcoming meeting of the
American Association for the Study of Liver Disease.
In neuroscience, we're developing compounds to address conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, pain,
and MS. We currently have three compounds in Phase II development for Alzheimer's, two of which are also being
evaluated in schizophrenia. And a Phase III study of daclizumab, a next-generation biologic being evaluated in MS, is
currently underway.
So with that, I'll turn it over to John for a review of our medical devices, diagnostics and global nutritional businesses.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Thanks, Larry.
Our vascular business in the quarter delivered strong performance once again. Worldwide reported sales increased
more than 18%. International vascular sales growth of nearly 40% in the quarter was driven by the continued success of
XIENCE, as well as our next-generation XIENCE PRIME. Global DES [Drug-eluting Stent] franchise sales this
quarter were in excess of $450 million, and that's up more than 37% year-over-year. XIENCE remains the market share
leader in Europe and other international markets. Since the XIENCE PRIME launch in Europe, we've seen mid to high
single-digit share point gains for the XIENCE franchise.
Based on the results presented yesterday by other DES manufacturers, we estimate our revenue share in Europe has
grown by two share points sequentially over the last quarter and seven share points since the third quarter of 2009.
XIENCE also continues to maintain its leadership position in Japan with total XIENCE platform share exceeding 70%.
The RESET trial enrollment completed in July and we continue to maintain our leading sharing for XIENCE. Japan, as
you know, is the second largest DES market with market sales of 500 to $600 million annually. In the U.S. the total
XIENCE platform which, of course, includes PROMUS, maintained market leadership with approximately 60% share
this quarter.
Strong top-line growth and our expanding worldwide DES market share have led to continued improvements in the
operating margin for our vascular business. Abbott vascular continues to experience growth in DES market share in key
markets around the world. In fact, Abbott's worldwide DES share has increased two points sequentially from the
second quarter and 13 points versus the same quarter last year driven by the launch of XIENCE in Japan and China, as

well as continued share growth in Europe, Australia, as well as the United States.
In the U.S., PCI volume was largely flat versus the prior year. DES penetration, we estimate was approximately 79%
this quarter which signals unit growth in the DES category. At the recent TCT meeting we announced compelling
long-term data from our SPIRIT III, as well as SPIRIT IV trials which add to the strong body of clinical evidence for
XIENCE.
The SPIRIT data, as well as two-year results from the investigator initiated COMPARE trial showed XIENCE
significantly outperformed Boston Scientific's TAXUS Express and Liberte drug-eluting stents, respectively, on both
efficacy and safety endpoints. Two-year data for SPIRIT IV demonstrates that Abbott XIENCE continues to
outperform the leading product. In the trial's composite endpoint, XIENCE demonstrated a 30% risk reduction in target
lesion failure, compared to TAXUS. In addition, XIENCE had an impressive low rate of stent thrombosis at two years.
In SPIRIT IV, XIENCE also showed low event rates in complex patients, those with diabetes, small vessels,
multi-vessel disease and long lesions. SPIRIT III showed continued benefit with XIENCE carried to TAXUS Express
out to four years.
And finally, data from the 1800-patient COMPARE trial demonstrated statistically significant better outcomes for
XIENCE in key safety and efficacy measures, compared to TAXUS Liberte, Boston's newer stent. Patients receiving
XIENCE had a 77% lower rate of stent thrombosis than TAXUS at two years.
So, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter in our global vascular business, we expect mid-teens reported sales growth
supported by one of the broadest platforms and portfolios in the business.
Turning to our global diabetes business, worldwide reported sales this quarter were flat. U.S. revenue was up nearly 8%
as we launched our next-generation FreeStyle and FreeStyle Lite test strips. These strips feature a new easier-to-use
design for faster blood application that reduces the number of error messages and wasted strips. In the fourth quarter,
for our global diabetes business, we expect low single-digit reported revenue growth.
Moving on to vision care and AMO where worldwide reported sales were $250 million U.S. sales were up more than
8% as we continued to gain momentum with our TECNIS Multifocal 1-Piece IOL.
Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the world and AMO holds the number two position in this
segment. We're expanding our premium cataract product portfolio in Europe following the CE mark of our TECNIS
Toric IOL, which is designed to correct astigmatism and our first entry into this segment.
During the quarter we introduced our newest contact lens solution, Complete RevitaLens Ocutec, in the U.S. This new
product delivers high-quality disinfection and comfort with the convenience of a one-bottle multipurpose solution.
In the fourth quarter looking ahead we expect low single-digit reported sales growth for AMO.
In worldwide diagnostics reported global sales were up modestly this quarter with U.S. diagnostic sales up more than
8%. In core laboratory diagnostics, which includes immunochemistry and hematology, reported global sales were flat
operationally and up nearly 3% in the U.S. Sales in China were up double-digits as we continue to strengthen our
presence in this important growing market.
The diagnostic division continues to make progress in its ongoing effort to increase profitability and cash flow as we've
discussed in the past. Also in the quarter, PRISM sales increased double-digits with its HIV assay driving growth in the
U.S. ARCHITECT sales also grew double-digits driven by the success of our new c4000 chemistry analyzer for
midsize labs.
In our molecular business, sales were up 16% driven by our m2000 platform and its expanding test menu. We recently
received FDA approval for the Abbott RealTime HBV assay for measuring the amount of hepatitis B virus in a patient's
blood. The assay runs on our m2000 system and is intended to help manage care for patients with chronic HBV
infection undergoing anti-viral therapy.

In our point of care business sales were also up double-digits driven by the continued success of our CHEM 8 test and
cardiac menu.
So as we look ahead to the fourth quarter in our worldwide diagnostic business we expect low single-digit reported
sales growth.
Turning to our worldwide nutritional business sales decreased 1.5%, including a favorable 0.8% impact from exchange.
International nutritional sales growth versus the prior year was adversely impacted by new product launches that
occurred in the year-ago quarter in many international markets. We expect a return to stronger reported growth in the
fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in our international nutrition business.
In the United States, Abbott Nutrition continues to maintain its strong market position in both adult and infant formula
nutritionals. As expected growth in the U.S. during the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $100 million
due to the product recall we previously announced on September 22nd. Excluding the recall, U.S. nutritional sales
would have grown high single-digits. Since the recall announcement we've been working to ensure that our customers
have continued access to Similac, including liquid formula and other powdered products manufactured at other
facilities in the U.S.
We appreciate the patience and loyalty of our customers during this period. I can tell you today that the one affected
powder manufacturing line in the one facility has resumed operations and we've restarted the process of reshipping
Similac Advance in our popular SimplePac container. Over the coming months our target is to have our retail powder
supply back to near normal levels.
Worldwide sales for adult nutritionals in the quarter, including Ensure and Glucerna grew 8%. In the U.S. we recently
introduced two new nutrition shakes, Ensure Muscle Health and Ensure Clinical Strength that feature a proprietary
ingredient called Revigor, as well as protein to help rebuild muscle mass lost naturally with age. Launch is off to a
good start with strong double-digit sales growth for Ensure this quarter.
Also in early August we launched PediaSure SideKicks, new shakes designed for kids who are on track with growth,
but can use extra nutritionals to fill nutritional gaps.
So as we look ahead to the fourth quarter in our U.S. Nutritional business we're forecasting high single-digit decline, up
in the low single-digits excluding the recall, as a result of the impact from the product recall on fourth quarter sales and
we expect high single-digit reported sales growth in our international nutrition business.
With that let me turn to our medical products pipeline. In our vascular pipeline we expect to bring more than 10
coronary technologies to market over the next five years making our pipeline one of the industry's most robust. These
include new devices, such as XIENCE Nano small vessel DES and XIENCE PRIME in the U.S. and ultrathin DES
next-generation balloons, MitraClip, as well as our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold, or BVS, technology.
MitraClip, our minimally invasive device for the treatment of select patients with mitral regurgitation has been
submitted for regulatory review and remains under review. We continue to work toward an advisory panel for
MitraClip in the first half of 2011 subject to further discussions with the agency.
As a reminder, mitral regurgitation is the most common valve disease in the world. Currently MR is treated with
medication or open heart surgery. At TCT we shared additional MitraClip data from our U.S. pivotal trial that
continued to demonstrate the safety and sustained meaningful clinical benefits of therapy. The U.S. pivotal trial results
that were presented at ACC in March demonstrated that MitraClip met both its primary safety and efficacy endpoints,
suggesting that MitraClip may be an important treatment option for select patients with MR.
Also at TCT we shared positive nine-month results from our first 45 patients enrolled in the second stage of ABSORB,
our BVS clinical trial. At nine months Abbott's BVS ABSORB demonstrated strong results that remain consistent with
the six month data from the same 45-patient group. BVS resorbs away after treatment leaving behind a vessel that can
move similar to an untreated vessel. Abbott is the only company with long-term data on a BVS.

Additionally, in our vascular pipeline we remain on track for a 2011 U.S. approval of XIENCE Nano and a 2012 U.S.
approval of XIENCE PRIME. As a reminder, our U.S. clinical trial for XIENCE PRIME is evaluating a range of stent
sizes, including small vessels and long lengths.
We're continuing to expand our position in the coronary market, which, excluding DES, is a $2 billion global category.
Abbott holds a leadership position in guidewires and bare metal stents and our goal is to recapture the market leading
position in balloon angioplasty which accounts for nearly half of this $2 billion market.
We've already had success with our next generation balloon, TREK, which has gained several share points in Europe.
In the U.S. the TREK family will be launched in a range of sizes in sometime in the first part of next year. TREK is
also the delivery platform for Abbott's future generations of stent technology.
In addition, we recently filed for our expanded indication for our Acculink Carotid Stent System to treat patients with
carotid artery disease who are at standard risk for surgery. Our submission to the FDA included results of a pre-agreed
upon analysis of the CREST trial.
In our broad vision care pipeline we expect approximately 20 new products and technology advancements over the next
five years. This includes the launch of our recently approved Complete RevitaLens contact lens solution.
In our market leading LASIK business we're expanding our proprietary laser platform into new applications, including
cataract surgery and we're developing new diagnostic instruments and treatments to improve visual outcomes. In our
cataract business we continue to expand our premium and standard IOLs. Synchrony, our next generation IOL remains
under FDA review. Synchrony is available in Europe and continues to perform well there.
So in summary, for the third quarter of 2010 Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS
growth of more than 14%, at the high end of our previous range. We invested in the long-term growth of the business
with strong investment spending, particularly in R&D. We reported an adjusted gross margin ratio of 61.6% despite
certain headwinds. We confirmed our ongoing EPS growth outlook for the year raising the lower end of our previous
guidance range. We completed the Piramal Healthcare Solutions acquisition and finalized our integration plans for
Solvay. We added another attractive late-stage asset to our pharmaceutical pipeline which represents one of five
late-stage compounds we've added this year alone. And, as I mentioned, we released key long-term data that further
supports our market leading DES product which performed well in the quarter, including XIENCE PRIME in Europe
and XIENCE in Japan.
Our performance, and the strategic actions we've taken continue to position Abbott well with durable growth drivers, as
well as opportunities in high-growth emerging markets and attractive new therapeutic areas.
So with that, we'll turn the call over to Alana for Q&A. Tom, Larry and I will handle those together.

I apologize, we'll move on to the next question. Our next question today is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Lewis>: Tom, just real quick question here, starting with gross margins, the last three quarters, sequential
outlook, obviously has improved every quarter fairly dramatically, I actually think it's the strongest GMs we've seen
from the company sequentially in several years so I know it's early to talk about 2010 outlook, can you talk about the
underlying drivers of gross margin and perhaps the sustainability of these trends heading into '11?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, again, we're
very encouraged with the progress we've made. We've been working a number of years across all the businesses,
whether it is through cost reductions, mixed improvements, et cetera, and throughout the year we've pretty much gotten
above that 60% level and we've been able to sustain and grow that and we had a very, very strong quarter, as you
mentioned, David, at 61.6% this quarter. That was a bit ahead of our expectations. And really, it's been driven by, you
know, the improvements across all the businesses, in particular, vascular, diagnostics, diabetes care and we saw some
improvement in pharma this quarter as well.
There is some quarter-to-quarter noise from exchange that helped us a little bit this quarter and, in fact, we're expecting
a little bit lower gross margin in the fourth quarter because we're expecting a bit less exchange favorability, but I think
the key, you know, message here is we seem to be firmly above the 60% and fundamentally improving it across the
businesses and we expect that to continue into 2011. It is a little early to give precise guidance on how far that might go
next year, but I certainly believe that the trends are positive.
<Q - David Lewis>: OK. Very helpful, and then just maybe talking a little bit about OUS HUMIRA trends, Tom, in
the particular quarter and perhaps the outlook, if you could talk about maybe opportunities in other emerging markets
for penetration of HUMIRA, what you think about the existing state of penetration for HUMIRA and perhaps
competitive dynamics that you're seeing outside of the U.S.? Thank you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, we continue to
have opportunities to grow in a number of markets, I think Larry mentioned that...
<A - Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President for Investor Relations>: Yeah, Japan, we've got opportunities with
more indications there, China I mentioned. Other emerging markets it's somewhat dependent on their economic
prosperity for a product like a anti-TNF, but there is longer term prospects in emerging markets for a product like
HUMIRA.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, David?

<Q - Michael Weinstein>: There you go. Okay. Well, a couple questions to start with. And, you know, if we look at
the P&L this quarter and your guidance changes for the balance of the year, gross margins obviously came in very
strong and you're guiding to a better gross margin than your guidance previously – you actually seem to be raising the
margin of your R&D guidance for the year, part of that is the moving parts from Solvay, but I was hoping you could try
and tease out for us what's happening within gross margins? There's obviously some impact from FX and on the flip
side you've got the negative impact from Similac. Help us get a better insight into the strength we saw this quarter, and
why that continues.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Mike, while you were
off, the second questioner had basically the same question and I'll just add a couple things to what I said there and you
do raise a good point. On the FX I'll just say again, we did get a bit of a lift beyond our expectations in the quarter, that
just has to do with the timing of sales versus costs, and the like and we do expect that to trend down again a little bit in
the fourth quarter and we would expect gross margin to be somewhat below what we had this quarter and my remarks I
think I said approaching 61%.
But you do raise a point that the recall impact we booked on the nutritional business, which was around $100 million is
pretty much all fall-through. And, you know, that's probably a half a point detriment to the margin in the quarter. So, I
think if you cut through that, and even considering some of the favorable trends from foreign exchange, it's still a very,
very strong performance.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Let me just ask a couple pipeline items here. With Certriad, the dialogue with the FDA
seems to be relatively slow. Should we be taking that out of our models at this point or are you still optimistic?
<A - Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President for Investor Relations>: I don't know if I would take it out of your
models, but certainly that process continues and, as I said, we do expect to meet with the agency here in the next few
months so, you know, it's always difficult to predict those with any specificity, but we're moving forward with a
discussion with the agency.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll add that,
obviously, given the timing, and the fact that if it were approved anytime even in the earlier part of the year, you know,
in a launch year, you're not going to see much profit impact initially from that product so I think when you're modeling
'11 it's not going to be a driver either way, depending on how the process plays out here.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: OK, then last one, just MitraClip and Synchrony, any visibility on FDA panels?
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Well, MitraClip, as I mentioned in my
remarks, Mike, we expect a panel in the first half of '11. Of course, that's up to the agency. Synchrony we're hoping for
a panel in 2011, but I don't have anything specifically to give you today. We keep working with the agency and
discussing with the agency next steps on that as well.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Thanks.

Thank you, our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Good morning, everybody, can you hear me.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Rick.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Good. A couple things. First, I was just rereading the second quarter transcript and you promised me
then and I'll hold you to it, more color on the integration, and the synergies of Solvay and now Piramal. Maybe talk a
little bit about, if you could, how you're going to hope to leverage some of the SG&A, higher SG&A, just in general,

what can we expect, thanks?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: The main thing I was
alluding to there was the announcement we made in September of the fact that we completed our integration planning,
that we were going to incur some costs associated with that both for restructuring and integration. And that, you know,
the conclusion of that planning makes me very confident in our ability to deliver at least the accretion we have in the
original forecast, which as you recall was at least 20 cents by 2012.
You know, what we're doing when we combine the – our former – our international pharma business with the Solvay
international pharma business we're finding a lot of commercial synergies in the sales organization. We're finding back
office efficiencies in the various companies and we're able to, you know, drive some pretty nice benefits starting in
2011 because of some discussions that have to continue with various organizations, you know, the timing will be not
immediate, it will be starting in 2011 and continue to accelerate into 2012. But that was really what I was alluding to,
Rick, the fact that we'd be concluding it and I think there's quite a bit of detail in the filing we made regarding the
integration planning for Solvay.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Sounds good. There's been some attention paid in recent months to an oral drug for arthritis. Saw
some data from Pfizer; AstraZeneca has a Phase III compound. Any perspective on the risks for HUMIRA, and how
you all might approach that opportunity?
<A - Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President for Investor Relations>: Sure, I'd say that the clinical development
programs for those agents are still kind of a long ways off and are ongoing. In this environment new mechanisms of
action certainly have a pretty high threshold in terms of safety and tolerability. We will start to see a little bit of the
Phase III, but it is, you know, fairly small data sets here this fall. But, you know, small molecules typically have a little
bit more off target toxicity. We've seen some side effect profiles, cholesterol issues, risks like that that could, you
know, certainly slow down the progress of those in development. So, we'll have to see how they play out.
Certainly if you look at TNF it's been around a long time, there's a lot known about the product, 13 years of experience,
as I mentioned. That's a lot of data. And, again, getting back to this, you know, current, you know, environment, I think
there's going to be a fairly high threshold for these products so we'll have to see how the safety plays out in the
upcoming data, but I think at least based on what we know that we'll see here yet this year, it's a pretty limited data set
and certainly, not enough to draw a conclusion on the long-term safety profile of these products.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Okay, and just a last broad one for Tom. Obviously, there's a lot of concern about procedure
slowdowns, increased pricing pressure. Maybe just, you know, Tom, your higher-level thoughts about those two points,
do you feel like – are you seeing just in a broader sense particularly on the device side, stable or improving as you go
out through September-October do you feel like price pressures are increasing, are you more concerned about that issue
today? Again, any perspective will be welcome, thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll start with the
price. In the – in the U.S. our situation was pretty well defined with healthcare reform and we've been very explicit
about the impact in 2010 and we continue to experience that and we had talked about an incremental impact in 2011.
And, you know, that – that seems to be pretty well – pretty well defined.
Outside the U.S. I'd say it's similar, you know, there were a tremendous number of actions by European government
health plans particularly in the pharma area over the last six months. Those have largely been completed and, you
know, as I talk to our people we feel like, you know, that step function has pretty much played out. We think that – we
don't expect anything similar next year and we've pretty much got the situation redefined at this level. So, I think it's
pretty well known on the pricing front.
You know, in terms of procedures and volumes, particularly in the U.S., as you know, we tend not to be as susceptible
to activities in the hospitals or elective procedures, probably the one exception in our business is the LASIK business
which continues to be pretty flat, but, you know, obviously, in the vascular business generally those are acute situations
that are going to be driven by the health condition, not some fundamental trend in procedures that are more elective.
So, we still have had very little impact in our devices businesses and I think it's just the nature of the mix of businesses

Our next question is Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: One for John and one for Tom. For John, vascular had another good quarter and topped our
expectations, your guide for 4Q is also above our expectations, but yesterday on the Boston Scientific call they said
they expected their business in Japan to get stronger now that their RESET trial has concluded. So, can you maybe talk
to us about some of the inputs that lead you to believe vascular can grow mid-teens, particularly in light of in Japan the
RESET trial now being concluded?
And then second, just for Tom, can you quantify what the impact of Similac and Meridia were on the bottom line for
3Q, and what the impact will be for 4Q? Thanks.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Glenn, we do expect to continue to
have strong performance in Japan where we, as you know, we've gained a lot of share and that's due to the performance
of the product, the overall platform, and how well we've done in terms of data and relationships, and so we don't expect
that the RESET trial is going to have a significant impact on that. We expect to maintain our share position not only in
Japan, but obviously with XIENCE PRIME in Europe and continue the growth that we've seen recently. So, I guess we
would disagree with that assertion.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: By answering your
questions on Similac and Meridia, again, when we announced the Similac recall we estimated about $100 million in
sales returns, that's pretty much where it came in and that impact of around 100 million, that virtually all falls right
through to the bottom line, Glenn, so you could say, you know, probably four to five pennies in the quarter impact of
the Similac recall.
Meridia quite a bit less. We again had to book a reserve for sales returns, that's probably closer to a penny. So, I think
the – you raise a point that if you look at our ongoing performance at $1.05, our 14% growth at that level, and then take
these things we overcame in the ongoing performance into account, we had a very, very strong quarter for income
growth putting these things aside. Obviously, for Similac and Meridia, we did have some one-time costs, which are
detailed in our earnings release.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Is there any residual impact in the fourth quarter?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Right now when I look at your guidance essentially you are reaffirming 4Q, and I was
wondering if you would have raised guidance further if it were not for Meridia and Similac.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I'd say on
Meridia it's a very, very, very small now, you know, we had very minimal sales and with the intangible no longer being
amortized, that has basically neutralized out Meridia. And as you know, on Meridia and Reductil, because of the
European action earlier in the year, we had a smaller expectation for that product on a quarterly basis during the year,
so Meridia is pretty much a resolved manner and minimal impact.

For Similac we clearly are in rebuilding mode both from a market share point of view and just replenishing the
pipeline, as John talked about, we're very pleased that the plant is back online and we're shipping the SimplePac
product back into the market. I think we've done a very good job in, you know, bringing other presentations of Similac,
and putting them on the shelf and our customer response has been very good to that, and they've shifted to some of the
other types of products, but that said, we are going to have a sales impact in the fourth quarter, quite a bit less than the
100 million pure fall-through we had in the third quarter.
And, obviously, we would have had better performance in the fourth quarter if that hadn't happened. But, you know,
we're mainly focused on rebuilding customer relationships and reestablishing that product firmly in the market as we
move into 2011.
<Q - Glenn Novarro>: Okay. Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Couple of questions, Tom, for you. Obviously, gross margins improved nicely this
quarter, and it seems that that's sort of a level at which that we can expect Abbott to continue to generate gross margins.
But on research and development expenses that, too, ticked up pretty significantly from the previous quarters. Is the
10.6%, percent ratio-to-sales is that the new normal now with the full integration of Solvay research expenses, as well
as the development of some of the recent products that you have recently licensed in? So that's the first question.
Second question relates to healthcare reform. If you could just quantify for us the level of healthcare – or the cost of
healthcare reform to the quarter, as well as European healthcare reform, and how that relates to – I think you had said
earlier this year you expected a $230 million hit from U.S. healthcare reform. If you can remind us where your thinking
is on that, as well as Europe, and are the numbers so far tracking in line with your expectations? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Right, well, in R&D,
you know, to me even more encouraging than the ratio impact is just the kind of the sequential increase in R&D in the
quarter, compared to the second quarter. I mean, we were up around $60 million, up, you know, strong double-digits,
compared to the – or, you know, I'm sorry, upper single-digits, compared to the second quarter. So, the sequential
spending is even more encouraging, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter with another nice sequential
increase in raw R&D spending. The quarter at 10.6% was aided by the fact that just generally, our third quarter sales
level is a little bit lower than the average for the other quarters so there was a bit of lift there.
But as I indicated in my remarks for the fourth quarter, we're going to be closer to that 9.5% range in the fourth quarter,
and for the full year between 9.5 and 10. And I think that is more the range you would – you should model as you look
at, you know, future years for us. But we are stepping up R&D significantly, if you look at the raw dollar increases, I
think it's very encouraging that we're committing more and more to the future of the company.
For healthcare reform, everything is pretty much tracking in line with our original expectations. As you indicated, Jami,
for the full year, we expected about a $230 million impact. And, you know, if you spread that out over the quarters,
there was a little bit more in the first part of the year, but it's a pretty steady amount throughout the year, and it's
playing out the way we expected.
For Europe, you know, the way I've talked about that is we typically see very low single-digit pricing impact on our
ex-U.S. pharma business. We saw roughly double that this year with the various austerity measures in Europe. But still,
when you add it all up, we're still at a low single-digit pricing impact year-over-year in 2010, and that pretty much
could be factored in on a pro rata basis over the quarter as well.
So we have overcome those, you know, the gross margin improved despite these types of things. But it's pretty much
playing out the way we forecasted earlier in the year, and the way we saw it on the second quarter call.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Just a quick follow-up on your European comments, how do you foresee the European austerity
measures and pricing pressures playing out into 2011? I understand that things are playing out to your expectations
now. Does it get worse in 2011, or do we still sit at this kind of low single-digits pricing pressure levels?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the key things
for 2011, and I talked about this previously as well, and on other calls, the austerity measures pretty much went in mid
to late in the year, and so we will have a lapping effect in 2011 which, you know, which will be meaningful as well.
But, again, any – our view is, based upon how aggressive these actions were and just our read of what's happening in
the market is incremental measures really are – you know, we really don't see much happening in that regard at least at
this point as we look at 2011. So, the main effect next year will be lapping what we saw, and then hopefully, we're
more in a steady-state, more very low single-digit type impact as we go forward.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: OK, thank you. I wanted to ask you about your expectations for a TriCor generic entry next year.
I recall that the agreement that you set up with Teva had some language around possible generic entry as early as
March next year, but there might be some conditions in which that may be delayed, so I was wondering what your
expectations are at this point for that generic entry and also, the conversion of TriCor to TRILIPIX, how that's going,
and how that might impact your – impact when it happens?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: We're fairly confident
based upon the conditions of that agreement, that license, that we won't see generic impact in 2011 in TriCor, and it
would go much more likely to the outer edge of that license agreement, which is mid-2012. For TRILIPIX, we continue
to see steady conversion, we're in the low-30s as the market evaluates the pros and cons of the two products, and we
just expect that to continue to improve, and there's quite a ways until the outer edge of the TriCor license agreement
when we would expect generic competition for that product.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay, great and just lastly, I know that you're going to start breaking out your established
products division growth rates next year and performance next year, but can you give us any insight into how your
emerging market pharma results came in this quarter?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: We're just – you're
right, we're going to have a separate division reported next year and we'll be very discrete about that and try to invite a
lot more color on it. We're still in the process of sorting out exactly how those two divisions are going to set up and
exactly which products end up where. I would say, though, that in general, across the businesses, particularly in
pharma, vascular, and diagnostics, I would say, you know, the emerging markets growth continues to be very good.
We're doing extremely well in China, across the businesses. And we're very excited obviously with India in the fourth
quarter, it will be our first addition of revenue from the Piramal acquisition, and we've got some nice initiatives going
on across the other businesses as well. So, we'll be more precise in the future, but in general, I think our emerging
markets performance was pretty good in the quarter.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay, thanks a lot, Tom.

Thank you, and our next question is from Bruce Nudell from UBS.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Oh, thanks for taking my question.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning,
Bruce.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Good morning. Just to follow up on Derrick's question, I think it would be – if you could provide
any color, you know, when you take the established products division and look out, you know, medium term, you
know, could you speak generally to the, you know, kind of growth rates you expect because a lot of the stuff, I guess,
that's – that's synonymous with that division is buried in other, but has done quite well historically. Could you kind of
give us, frame the sorts of growth rates you might expect from the division, and the margin structure? And I have one
follow-up.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, well, as we've
modeled this out over the next five years and as we're kind of compiling and really constructing that division in the
latter part of this year, you know, what we see is the ability to drive some of these branded generics, more established
products very hard in emerging markets and to really leverage in particular, the Solvay infrastructure that we inherited,
where they're very strong in markets in East Europe and Russia and also, the Abbott infrastructure where we're very
strong in Latin America. And so we take advantage of the best infrastructure and move additional products from each
side to the other side, as well as to bring the Zydus products into the market, and then on top of that, to drive Indian
growth through the Piramal acquisition.
When we model all of that weighed against slower growth in the European markets for some of these products, I think
mid to upper single growth is very achievable on a sustainable basis, and again, the way we've defined this business is
more of a durable one, not subject to clips and big movements, and hopefully, we can do better than that with additional
investment in SG&A and driving additional products, but that's certainly a good baseline to start with.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Thanks, and then I had another question. And it's something, you know, I don't have an answer to
at all is, you know, in one way biodegradable stents could be very disruptive as a more natural product, as it were. On
the other hand, the latest generation of drug-eluting stents has done a great job of lowering late stent thrombosis, which
was the original kind of target for biodegradable stents. What do you need to show clinically to kind of make it either
disruptive on the share level or on the ASP level, so that docs will use it and/or payors will pay a premium?
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Well, as we talked about, we have
some very good early data, I think we just need to have longer term data with larger patient sets, which we're making
some very good progress on. I think the phrase would be, stay tuned on that front, as we progress throughout the year
and go into early '11, I think we'll have some updates for you on that front that will be more encouraging. But we really
just need to move into that later stage of clinical trial work where we get a large patient sampling and show the kind of
benefit similar to what we've showed with XIENCE.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: I guess just one more follow-up on the established products division. Should we be thinking
about that division margin structure as kind of, you know, I know there are puts and takes, ASPs versus selling costs,
similar to the current pharma division?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: No, I mean, the gross
margins in this business are good. They're certainly above our corporate average. There is, you know, this is more of a
primary care business. There's a little heavier SG&A investment for the business. On the other hand, there's a relatively
lower R&D percentage. I think when you add that all together, you're going to end up with Op margins somewhat less
than the proprietary business, but still very healthy and a very nice contributor as that business grows.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Thank you so much.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Bruce.

Thank you. Our next question is from Sara Michelmore from Cowen.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Great, thanks for sneaking me in. I guess the question on the diabetes business, I know you
guys have been working on taking some costs out of that business given what's gone on in the marketplace. You called
it out, Tom, in terms of a gross margin contribution, could you just talk about where you are with that process, and
what's left to do.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: You're talking about
gross margin in diabetes?
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: In diabetes, yeah.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Well, we did –
we had some plant efficiency initiatives we've implemented over the last couple years. It's pretty much at the tail end
where we're making a few more product transfers into our more efficient facilities. But we do expect continued, you
know, reengineering of the manufacturing processes there. And I'd say we've had our step function in diabetes care, it's
moved several points over the last couple years. They've done a great job. And I'd say going forward, it's more in that
steady type improvement scenario.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: Okay, and then we talked a lot about the medical optics pipeline, but, you know, just taking a
step back, can you just give us an update in terms of where that business line is relative to your expectations and, you
know, what is it going to take to really get that to be a notable growth contributor? Is it really the pipeline or is there a
potential that that LASIK business could bounce back at some point? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I guess, to
answer your question, take a half a step back and look at how we're doing this year and I think there are a lot of good
things going on within that business, they're being masked by a couple items. The LASIK market driven by consumer
confidence continues to be very, very flat, and that was going to be a nice lever for improving margins and obviously,
growth, whenever that inflection point hits. We still haven't seen that and we're probably going to assume going into
2011 that it takes a while for that to happen again.
The other thing that's happened that in Japan, particularly in the LASIK business and also, across – we've had some
competitive challenges there. There's really one geography where we've been challenged. If you adjust for those items,
and in Japan, we're taking a number of actions to kind of right the ship there.
If you take those into account and look at what's going on underlying the business performance is good, and you're
correct that the key to future growth beyond LASIK is going to be a number of these pipeline products hitting. John
talked about 20 products over the next five years, we do have a new lens solution that's just hitting the market both in
Europe, and the U.S., as well as programs like Synchrony and other enhanced cataract products, et cetera.
So it's been, you know, we've had our disappointments this year in that business, but I think there are a lot of good
things happening and hopefully we'll see that start ticking up to be a positive contributor to growth over the next year or
two.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: And then just one last one on Similac if I could. How are you guys looking at the momentum
of that product line, if that's the right word? Is it possible that it could get worse before it gets better, or do you feel
fairly good that you have visibility in terms of your ability to at least retain the share that you have? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's still pretty
early in the process, we're doing a lot of monitoring of consumer sentiment, et cetera. It has definitely stabilized. We
had an initial effect, but it's definitely stabilizing and we've taken a number of initiatives to restore confidence with our
customers and to start building that positive momentum, but it's just too early to see that inflection point at this point in

time.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: And Sara, I mean, our number one goal
from the start after the recall was to maintain broad availability for our products, which we did. We were never out of
powder, we just were out of that particular container, the SimplePac container. So, we've done a number of things in
our liquid business to increase production and stimulate demand there. And also, to make other sizes available. And all
those things we – you know, customers can order online at the Abbott store, product as well, and they've taken
advantage of that. And I think the business has done a really good job of aggressively taking actions to ensure that
customers remain loyal and we've gotten good feedback from our customers on how we responded after the recall.
So a number of actions there that are taking place, maintaining product availability and now as I mentioned in my
remarks getting that one line and that one manufacturing facility back up and running, and now shipping product to the
market here a few days ago will make a big difference, and we'll obviously target some of the major retail stores first
with those SimplePac Similac containers.
<Q - Sara Michelmore>: All right, great, thanks so much.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Hi, good morning, can you hear me okay?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I can. Hi, Bob.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great. So, I just wanted to follow up on Bruce's question on bioresorbable stents and ABSORB. I
think you guys have said in the past that you might hope to launch a product in Europe by 2013 and I was just
wondering if you could give us an update on timing for a potential OUS launch, as well as any initial thoughts on how
long the U.S. process might take?
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: We're not officially updating our
guidance on that today other than confirming the 2013, but I think it's fair to say that, you know, as we work through
the regulatory and strategic approach, commercial approach, there's certainly some opportunity to potentially move that
date up. So, as I said, to Bruce, you know, stay tuned and we will update you as we can and as it's appropriate as we get
into the next quarter or two.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great, and then the follow-up on that also is that I'm just wondering your level of confidence that
the product that you have today that's been in clinicals, you know, is the sort of the final version that you need. Because
as I talk to physicians, it seems the number one concern, as much as long-term data, is really the sort of acute results in
terms of elastic recoil and is the product going to be strong enough to present that or prevent that. I'm curious about
your level of confidence that the product that's been in clinicals right now is the final design and you're very
comfortable with what you're seeing and don't need to make any major incremental tweaks.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Yeah, we, you know, we did make
some improvements, as you probably know, from cohort A to cohort B to make some device enhancements for
improved deliverability and vessel support. But, you know, more specifically, as you've seen with the early data on the
smaller data sets, the MACE results are very good, low thrombosis rate, low rate of MACE, so all of the clinical data
points that we would care about and people would pay attention to look as strong as our XIENCE platform and we'll
have to see how we do and continue to progress in some of these larger trials. But, as I said, I think we're making pretty
good progress here and stay tuned on updates for that.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: OK, great, thanks very much.

Thank you, our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: And good morning. The Solvay number that you gave, could you give us the U.S., OUS
breakdown? I'm sorry if I missed that for the quarter.
<A - Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President for Investor Relations>: We didn't have it specifically in the remarks,
but kind of a 70-30 mix isn't a bad ballpark estimate for that, 70 being ex- U.S., 30 being U.S.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: And I think most of us try to calculate an organic rate for the quarter. Could you help us out a
little bit with that? I get to about 1.3% with the recall, 2.5% without the recall. Am I in the right ballpark?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: That's a little bit low.
I guess what I would say is, you know, when you look at our organic growth rate year-over-year, you do have to take
into account some of the things we faced as a company and I think a lot of them are transitional or one time in nature.
Going back to the beginning of the year as you may recall, we had a significant Venezuelan business that was impacted
by the 50% devaluation. We've obviously had the significant pricing pressures in Europe. We've had the U.S.
healthcare reform impact and we've had the Similac recall, as well as some products in our pharma, such as Depakote
that continue to decline. A lot of those are transitional items, and while I think the number is a little better than what
you quoted I think it has to be put in the context of a lot of these transitional issues that really we've dealt with this year
very well and delivered a very strong performance overall despite these factors.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: That's helpful. Then one last one. Zemplar has been, I think, a strong product for you guys and
if I'm not mistaken 500, $600 million annual product. What are your expectations going forward, with the new dialysis
bundling rule that goes into effect I think in 2011? Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President for Investor Relations>: We do think there is going to be an impact on
Zemplar from a different approach used by the providers in terms of negotiating with suppliers, and so we are
expecting that there likely will be a reduction in Zemplar sales in 2011 and we're going to be factoring that into our
planning forecast.

Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Dodds from Citigroup.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Hello.
<Q - Matthew Dodds>: Yep.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Dodds>: Hey. A couple questions. First, on the vascular business, outside of all the stents you continue
to do really well, even better this quarter than last quarter in I would call it, other. I'm wondering, how much of that is
MitraClip just doing well OUS versus pull through you're getting with XIENCE in Japan and XIENCE PRIME?
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: MitraClip continues to do well in
Europe, but it is a pretty small piece. You're talking about an annualized product sales that are less than 50 million so
it's probably 10 or less in the quarter, but certainly good performance on a relative scale for that product. Japan is

clearly helping us, but also Europe, XIENCE PRIME continues to do extremely well in Europe and our other product
portfolio we've made a number of improvements, as you know, to the balloons and delivery catheters, and so forth. So,
there are enhancements across the product portfolio and some pull through effect that you get when you're performing,
as well as we are with the DES platform.
<Q - Matthew Dodds>: One other question when you look at your other sales category I know it has diabetes, and the
AMO in there, when you take those out, it's down a lot this year, it's down I think like 35% year-over-year. I know
animal health might be in there amongst other things. Is there anything though that has gone away in that division that's
making these comps so tough? Because it definitely is one of the drags on the organic growth.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: These comps are
always impacted by volatility, particularly in this bulk pharmaceuticals business where things go up and down and
timing of shipments are often impacted so I wouldn't – I wouldn't read too much into the year-over-year change in that
category.
<Q - Matthew Dodds>: OK, all right, thanks tom; thanks, John.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Thank you. Operator, I think we have
time for one more question.

Our final question today is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. Question around the diagnostics business, and
while I recognize it's being run for profitability, it is curious that if you look back for five quarters, for example, you
look at the operational growth ex-US it shows slight gains still above 3% and yet we're kind of flat to slightly down this
quarter. You commented about China and you also commented it was a contributor to overall gross margins, but I'm
just curious about what this says about the immunoassay business, principally in Europe, and whether or not that should
be a sustainable run rate, thanks.
<A - John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs>: Right, well, international diagnostic
sales, as we talked about were down modestly, and there was some impact from the European economic climate
overall, and the austerity programs that are going on there. So, that did affect performance, but we had strong
performance in the U.S. as a result of things like the PRISM HIV assay, and the overall mix of the new midsize
ARCHITECT system. So, when we look at that, we expect that that improvement in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned,
will see an uptick in the fourth quarter and as we continue to place the ci4000 systems throughout the world.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Tony, I would say one
more thing, that as you know, part of this entire profit improvement strategy is being more selective in accounts we will
participate in and, you know, a little slowdown is not unexpected as we try to upgrade the mix of the customers in the
portfolio.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks tony.
