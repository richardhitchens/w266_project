Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered solid results for the quarter and I would like to
thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to serving customers. Comparable sales grew 4.3% primarily

driven by 3.3% increase in average ticket. We achieve this growth by executing well in a challenging environment that
included an increasingly severe drought in California, and historic flooding in Texas.
In fact, comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 4.6% for the quarter with all 14 regions
generating positive comps and positive comps in 11 of 13 product categories. Our seasonal business performed well
strength outdoor power equipment and seasonal living offset some of the weakness -- some of the softness in Lawn &
Garden, which was most pronounced in the West.
We also experienced solid growth in big ticket discretionary project categories such as kitchens, flooring, mill work
and fashion fixtures; and for the third quarter in a row, we drove double-digit comps and appliances. Our team in
Canada continue to deliver strong comps in local currency. Building on the momentum we've been gaining, we're
accelerating our store expansion in this market. We recently acquired 12 former target store locations and one
distribution center with plans to open these locations in 2016 and 2017.
Combined with our organic expansion plans we expect to have roughly 70 stores in Canada by 2017. Our business in
Mexico also performed well during the quarter, achieving double-digit comps in local currency. However, as the U.S.
dollar strengthened, we experienced a 30 basis point drag on our consolidated comp due to foreign currency.
For the quarter, gross margin contracted 8 basis points, primarily due to the strength in appliances and outdoor power
equipment. We leveraged operating sellers in the quarter and deliver earnings per share of $1.20, a 15% increase over
last year's second quarter. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we
repurchased $1.5 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $218 million in dividends. In May, our
Board of Directors approved a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.23 per share to $0.28 per share.
Looking forward to the second half of 2015, key drivers of the Home Improvement industry remains supportive for
growth. Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year and
recovering the housing market continues with moderate home price appreciation and stronger gains in housing
turnover. We also continue to be encouraged by the results of our second quarter consumer sentiment survey. Roughly
half of respondents indicated that they believe their home values are increasing, double the number from 2012. And this
positive sentiment around home values is reading through the spending parents with plans to begin a Home
Improvement Project in the next six months continuing its recent upward trend. Further survey respondents indicated
that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending, suggesting an affinity
-- the strengthening affinity for the home.
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us (technical difficulty) opportunities within an improving economy. We're
pursuing further top line growth to continue development of omni-channel capabilities, differentiating ourselves
through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro Customer. We also
remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in a few specific areas including
store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend.
The execution of our strategic priorities alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop together with our key focus
on productivity and profitability give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015.
Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Robert, and good morning everyone. During the second quarter, we've recorded our strongest performance in
big ticket categories such as appliances, kitchens, outdoor power equipment, and seasonal living. This is a reflection of
consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes, as well as the strength of our product offerings in these categories
and our evolving omni-channel capabilities.
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the third consecutive quarter. In addition to our leading brands in this
categories such as Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE. We provided service

advantages like delivery and haul away and facilitate in-home repairs and maintenance.
We have further strengthened our offerings with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire pro appliance
series in the introduction of 17 kitchen suites and understanding that more than 80% of customers start shopping for
appliances online. We've enhanced our presentation on lowes.com, including improved product search, enhanced
videos, improved presentation like 360 degree views and simplified product groupings.
It's no wonder that for the seventh time in the last eight years, J.D. Power and Associates has ranked in house and
customer satisfaction among appliance retailers. Based upon our knowledgeable sales specialist, brand and assortment
competitive pricing and delivery.
In order to sell the entire kitchen, we display our kitchen products including Cabinets and Countertops immediately
adjacent to our clients offering. This quarter, we drove above average comps in kitchens though a combination of
targeted promotions and our investment in project specialist who meet customers in their homes. These employees
represent another important element of our omni-channel strategy.
We now have projects specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores. And we're
expanding our interior project specialist program into another 470 stores reaching over three quarters of our stores by
year-end. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find a right contractor to do the job, we are
rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement.
We achieved high single-digit comps in outdoor power equipment with particular strength in Walk-Behind and Riding
Mowers and pressure washers. We offer a wide range of mowers to help customers maintain their yards and we
continue to provide compelling and exclusive brands and innovations like our innovative Kobalt 80 volt handheld
outdoor power tools, and a home channel exclusive Hustlers Rafters 60-inch zero-turn mowers, a brand landscapers
know and trust. The outdoor living experience we introduced last year grow strong comps in our seasonal living
product category.
In fact our patio and outdoor fashion area recorded strong solid comps again this quarter on top of double-digit comps
last quarter assisted by robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. Entering the second
half of the year, we'll use this seasonal sales to address customer needs for the farm by planting leaf removal,
(inaudible) and exterior maintenance. Then as winter arise we will help customers refresh their homes for holiday
guest, decorate and organize their home after the holidays. We'll focus on using this space to provide the inspiration,
guidance products and services that customers need to tackle the projects that are relevant for each macro season.
Our performance in paint was in line with the industry. We are pleased with the launch of HGTV HOME by
Sherwin-Williams and look forward to building further momentum with this brand. Brand is the number one purchase
driver in paint and Sherwin-Williams is the most recognized brand in the category. We expect the addition of HGTV by
Sherwin-Williams to appeal to both DIY and pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color
expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for us for their next paint project.
Combined with our outstanding Valspar and PPG, Olympic brand partnerships we expect to grow traffic to our stores
and increase overall market share in paint.
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of pro focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first
quarter, including Kobalt machinery tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation. Last month, we expanded our
line of Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's stores nationwide. Lowe's now
offers the broad installation of Hitachi power tools with the latest innovations that deliver ladder, faster and more
durable products.
We continue to collect feedback from our pro customers and employees to identify other local and national brands that
best meet the needs of pro customers. Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we officially re-launched
lowesforpros.com at the beginning of the second quarter and has seen an increase and use by our pro customers in line
with our expectations. So far, we have been promoting lowesforpros online and through pros social media and in the
third quarter, we will begin the formal launch through our pro appreciation days as well as other media.

We continue to actually serve the pros to our account executive pro services or AEPs. AEPs column regional customers
to help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. We currently have approximately 135 AEPs in the
field, an increase of 25 over last year. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger pro
customers especially maintenance, repair and operations or MRO customers.
We are pleased with the programs results excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit second quarter
growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Our focus on strengthening our
portfolio brands, serving regional pro customers to AEPs, as well as our recent relaunch of lowesforpros.com are part
of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the
quarter, we capitalized on big ticket market share opportunities with strong growth in categories like appliances and
outdoor products; which contributed to a slight decline in gross margin rate but substantial margin dollar growth. We
mitigated the unfavorable mix impact by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation, improved first cost
through shared efficiencies and to achieve higher sell-through of seasonal products.
Our store teams once again effectively manage payroll, increasing sales per hour in line with comps. We continue to
leverage our prior technology investments, as well as improve selling processes enabled by our customer experience
design team. Most importantly we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction
scores. We also drove productivity and marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging
our investment in MyLowe's and we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the
year by consolidating procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions.
The quarter tested the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain and we passed that test with flying colors. To meet
high demand in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures were unusually warm, our distribution teams work
efficiently to move portable air conditioners from the northeast. Likewise they were instrumental in moving products to
eastern Texas. So we could help customers recover from flooding and begin the process of repairing and rebuilding in
the wake of storms.
While inventory at quarter end was up 4% till last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for atoms that are
most relevant to our customers. For instance, we ended the second quarter with higher levels of appliances to support
exceptionally strong sales as well as higher levels of portable air-conditioning units and grilles.
We expect to sell through most of the seasonal inventory in the third quarter and to end the year with minimal growth
in seasonal in the inventory per store. We are pleased with our actual execution in the second quarter, we continue to
make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and are focused on improving productivity and profitability.
We look forward to sharing further progress due over the course of the year.
Thank you for interest in Lowe's and I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Rick good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. The sales
increase was driven by both ticket and transactions with total average ticket up 3.3% to $67.83. Our total customer
transactions grew 1.2%. Comp sales were 4.3% driven by a comp average ticket increase of 3.3% and comp
transactions grow of 1%.
Looking at monthly trends, costs were 3.6% in May; 4.6% in June; and 4.6% in July. In Q2, July 4th fell in fiscal July
this year and fiscal June last year, while the shift did not affect comp sales for the quarter; it did impact the monthly
spread. We estimate that normalizing for the timing of the holiday June and July comps would have been 3.9% and
5.8% respectively. Year-to-date total sales grew $31.5 billion, or 4.9% versus the first half of 2014, driven by a 4.7%
increase in comp sales. Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.47% sales, which decreased 8 basis points from Q2
last year. The decline in gross margins was driven by mix and promotional activity.

The mix of product sold primarily appliances and outdoor power equipment negatively impacted gross margin by
approximately 20 basis points. Also, we've noted our efforts to adjust our promotional calendar to be more competitive
with the market. We anniversary this promotional change in the third quarter. The pressure from these items was
largely offset by value improvement. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.92% of sales, a decrease of 6 basis points from
the first half of 2014. SG&A for Q2 was 20.94% of sales which leverage 39 basis points.
We experienced leverage in a variety of expenses including store payroll, bonus, maintenance and repairs, utilities,
advertising and payroll taxes. These items were somewhat offset by store closing costs of $13 million related to a lease
termination for recent relocation, as well as updated lease assumptions for stores closed in 2011. Also in the quarter,
our Canadian business incurred $4 million of expenses associated with the recent purchase of certain target assets. This
was primarily related to a lease termination costs for our existing distribution center as we work to transition into the
larger former target facility.
In addition, the recurring costs associated with the 12 store leases that we assumed. These two items totaled $17 million
in (inaudible) EBIT and EPS by 10 basis points and a penny per share respectively. Year-to-date SG&A was 22.39% of
sales which leveraged 48 basis points versus the first-half of 2014. Depreciation for the quarter is $375 million, which
was 2.16% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes were even increased 41
basis points to 11.37% of sales. For the first half of 2015, EBIT was 10.18% of sales which was 56 basis points higher
in the same period last year.
For the quarter, interest expense was $133 million; the effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.8%. Earnings per share
was at $1.20 for the second quarter, an increase of 15.4% over last year. For the first six months of 2015, earnings per
share of $1.90 represented a 15.9% increase over the first half of 2014. The $1.90 was in line with our year-to-date
plan.
Now to a few items in the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash, cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $900
million. Our inventory balance of 9.7 billion increased 389 million or 4% versus Q2 last year. As Rick mentioned, the
increase was driven by appliances that support sales growth, as well as seasonal inventory. Inventory turnover was 3.9,
up 16 basis points over last year. Asset turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.74.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $7.1 billion represented a 15% increase
over Q2 last year, primarily due to the timing of purchases year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter lease
adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.08 times. Return on invested capital increased 237 basis points for the quarter to
14.98%. Looking at the statement of cash flows the year-to-date, operating cash flow was almost 4.2 billion and capital
expenditures were 570 million resulting in free cash flow of nearly $3.6 billion, which is up 2% until last year.
In May, we entered into a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive
approximately 14.5 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the
program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares for $500 million to the open
market. In total, we repurchased $1.5 billion in the quarter with approximately 4.9 billion remaining on our share
repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted the key
drivers of the Home Improvement industry remain supportive for growth. For the year, we expect the total sales
increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by a comp sales increase of 4% of 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20
stores, which includes five Orchard and two City Center locations.
We are anticipating EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion
for quite a comfortable 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter.
For the year, we expect most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expenses leverage will come from
store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings and indirect spend.
In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. Our confidence of flow through will accelerate
in the second-half of 2015 is based on few items. First, gross margin pressure from both the changes in the promotional
calendar and mix should dissipate in the second-half and we have much easier second-half prior year comparisons.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased bonus accruals, which would drive leverage in Q4 of this year.
Lastly, we expect additional leverage from credit as a result of program growth. The effective tax rate is expected to be
38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is result of the settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The
higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of
approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014.
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital forecast for 2015 is now
approximately 1.3 billion with results and expected free cash flow of $3.7 billion for 2015. We expect to issue
incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25 times lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance
assumes approximately 3.8 billion in share repurchase for 2015.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.
Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
Simeon Gutman, Analyst
Thanks. Good morning.
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Simeon Gutman, Analyst
So, I think the key question is on flow through and thanks for some of that color, Bob. You mentioned that there is
going to be some seasonal choppiness first-half of this year that looks like it was the case, because it's below average.
You mentioned a couple of items that will, I guess accelerate that for the back half. I guess, can you reiterate, I guess,
what gives you the confidence, are there some indirect cost saves that are in place or those are still to come. And then,
as far as the promotional cadence goes, can you just remind us what -- is that a general comment about the overall
business or is that within certain categories?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
So, Simeon, I'll start with kind of the mechanics of the improved flow through in the second half and I'll let Mike talk
about changes to the promotional calendar impact on the second-half. So, there's a number of items that give us
confidence that second-half flow through is going to be higher than the first-half; I call it out three in my comments.
So, let me give you a little bit more color around those three.
I mentioned the promotional calendar and mix pressure dissipating as well as easy compares. If you look at 2014, gross
margin improved 42 basis points in the first half of 2014 and declined 6 basis points in the second half. So we do have
easier comparison in the second half. For 2015, gross margin declined 6 basis points we expect about 20 basis points of
improvement in the second half or roughly 26 basis point swing.

Second in bonus for the first half of 2015 we've seen 7 basis points of deleverage in bonus, we expect about 13 basis
points of leverage in the second half of 2015 or roughly 20 basis point swing. Lastly credit. Credit was flat to 2014 for
the first half, we expect about 15 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 for a swing of 15 basis points. So
those three items of the lion share what gives us confidence in the flow, so we do have a couple of other items giving
timing of projects like facilities, repairs and store labor projects with the first half is a little heavier than second half,
but we do have a number of items that we can point to that gives us confidence in the second half flow through.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
That was to be an emotional environment. I will describe that emotional environment is stable. I'd say in the second
quarter we targeted promotions, largely at appliances or the big ticket categories with the intent to match the
promotional intensity of the competition.
So while our promotions intensity increase, relative to second quarter of last year and was consistent with competitive
environment, we expect that to obey. And the second half of the year as we wrap our win when we started to increase
our promotional intensity last year which is around Labor Day.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Simeon, this is Rick. I would just add to that is the one thing we did in the second half of last year, which was
timing around the promotional business; around the holidays with the two-day extensions of the events we will not
comp that until Labor Day this year, so that's what also Bob was mentioning, we talk about promotional pressures,
those incremental two days that did not happen last year this time during the first half will begin to comp that actually
in Q3.
Simeon Gutman, Analyst
And just to clarify the store closing costs I think some of the Canada cost, those -- any of those linger into the third or
back half and then I'm assuming that's excluding that from some of your leverage assumptions for the remainder of the
year?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
So those $70 million I mentioned was in the first half. The only thing that extends from the second half is the carrying
costs for the 12 target leases, that's relatively small. That was only about $0.5 million of the $4 million in Q2; but that
is embedded in our outlook for the year.
Simeon Gutman, Analyst
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Fassler, Analyst
Okay. Thanks a lot, and good morning to you. I want to focus on a couple of sales items. First of all, can you talk about
the impact of the weather-related businesses on the comp overall and especially on transaction count, whether that have
a material impact. And where do you saw the cadence of the business change as both we move particularly after a
season and perhaps some of the weather issues, particularly in Texas, would have stated?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
I'll start with the transaction count impact. So, we mentioned that we had two categories that were below average,
Lawn & Garden was actually negative. If we think about tickets below $50, there were only up 0.8%.
So they were positive, really hurt my Lawn & Garden in the weakness business largely because of the strange weather
we had in the quarter.
Matthew Fassler, Analyst
Okay. And then a second follow-up, I know that paint, based on your slide that was also below the company average.
You do have some new product intros, what's the state of that category for you, was there a weather impact there as
well as a product transition you think is impacting other business growth?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Before the bulk of oppression paint largely in exterior categories as well -- exterior stains in particular is what we saw
about for pressure largely in Texas and Midwest. We're very pleased with the share we've roll out. We'll have a
relationship with Valspar and PPG and we're excited about our paid business; but we did see some weather impact in
the second quarter.

That's great. And just a final quick follow up, Mike. So, just to play devil's I've to kill on the promotional cadence, you
did get more promotion last year, your appliance business has been extremely strong, presumably hand-to-hand with
that promotional sense. How are you thinking about the sales in the business where you got more promotional, as that
promotional intensity a bit?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
We like the factor, we can't share obviously. We think there are a number of things. We think that promotional piece
was a part of it; but keep in mind that our promotional cadence was the line to match the promotional environment that
we were in. I'd say a little different, we went from under-promoting to promoting at the industry level.
That said, when you look at the outperformed appliances, it's not coming from -- boarding at the level of the industry
and our performance is coming from the things that we've talked about, improved display appliances having the
(inaudible) and the suites of appliances that we talked about having the next day delivery of appliances, the fact that we
control our appliance inventory is a powerful thing. When a (inaudible) controls your appliance inventories. So, we like
to grow in big ticket, but is not coming from additional promotion beyond what we see at the industry level.

Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
Scot Ciccarelli, Analyst
Good morning, guys. You guys have clearly made a lot of merchandise changes to appeal to year pro customers more,
but I'm curious when you talk to your pro customers what attributes did they seem to value the most from your
segment, is it price, is the brand selection, proximity of the store, like if you guys could kind of create a hierarchy there
would be very, very helpful?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Scott, this is Rick, I'll talk a little bit about it and then I'll turn it over to Mike to talk a little bit about the brands. When
we talk to the pro, one of the largest I think contributing factors is location, proximity to the store is a definite aspect of
the pro environment. If you are not convenient from a location standpoint then you don't, you're not as relevant and
that's based on what we know from a research standpoint. I would say that we continue to look at other aspects of
where we are from a general-purpose and we talk about the five ways to save, we know that delivery of services just
play an important role as well as price.
But I would say the biggest things that we've got right now would be location, it would be having the right brands, and
then making sure that we're competitive from a price standpoint of services standpoint. I think all of that is fairly
equivalent when we think through where we are.
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
And I build on that, Rick. When we talk to pros and this is in that particular order, but brand certainly are important to,
inventory debt is very, very important to, breadth of assortment so they can go to one place and completed jobs are
important, and localization is deeply is critical, there are local norms and building codes that are -- that we got to get
right. We deployed a field based merchandising team to help ensure that we get better localization, we're pleased with
the progress that we're making. The to Rick's point, services are important, like job site delivery and access to credit.
So, I'm careful not to put one above the other, we got to have them all and our progress is working towards getting rid

Scot Ciccarelli, Analyst
And so when you guys --
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
I will just say Scott, in addition to the key drivers that Mike and Rick mentioned, two other things that also resonate
very well, once you have the brands, you have the debt as inventory, you got to have the convenience and that is a
value proposition on our proprietary credit resonates very well, it was a pro customer and the relaunch of
LowesForPros that we just launched. We're also getting right feedback from pro customers and it's a much more
convenient way to do business with those as well. So that's a new item we will launch this quarter so.
Scot Ciccarelli, Analyst

Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Research.
Kate McShane, Analyst
Hi, thank you. Good morning. We noticed that you outpaced your largest competitor in ticket by over 150 basis points,
and I wondered if this was solely a function of the strength of appliances, or did any other categories contribute to that
and you also saw the meaningful acceleration in sales of greater than $500. Can you talk to the drivers of that as well?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
It's Mike Jones again. I can talk to that but we are very pleased in our growth in ticket. In fact this quarter's average
ticket is the highest recorded since 2007. So the teams did a great job. One of the higher mix of appliances and outdoor
power equipment driven parts are going to be one-third of the growth in ticket. The remainder of the increase was
driven by customers moving to higher price points within product categories. In fact, we observed a higher ticket
growth that pretty much any product category.
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, okay, this is Rick. I'd also add to that our service business is also contributes to that. Our services business for
the quarter outpaced the total company comp and when you look at that our interior specialist programs and exterior
specialist programs performed very well. We're very pleased with the results that we get there in those two aspects also
drove a higher average ticket from a project standpoint.

Your next question comes from the line Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan.
Christopher Horvers, Analyst
Thanks, good morning guys. So I want to focus on the acquisition of the stores in Canada. The four target stores, I think
you said you will be at 20 stores by 2017. At what point do you have mass in that market to where you will see
profitability grow. I think you're not making money at this point due to mass, when do you see getting to profitability?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Chris, I think we have 39 stores opened a day, we required the additional 12 target, a former target locations. We
obviously, already had some stores in the pipeline that we in our organic growth pipeline, so we said combined with the
target locations where we had in the pipeline by 2017. We will be to about 70 stores.
Actually, we were just about to the point of would have been breakeven next year in target in Canada. With our current
operations, we are not take on the additional allocations that it will take a year or so to get those open up to speed. So,
but time to get to that 70 store mark we have a pretty good critical mass to grow off there in Canada.
Christopher Horvers, Analyst
And then related to -- can you give us, share your updated thoughts on your Australian investment. I know you become
more involved in that business over the past year or so how are trends occurring there and what's your latest thought
process on your investment there?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, actually I was just down last week for a joint venture board meeting. I met with a team, I walked some of the
stores, the team down there has gone and looked at the opportunity to improve the operations that come in with a new
format and working on resetting the layout of some of the new stores opening out of shares in the lab that we're
resetting. Some existing stores getting and increasing the range of product and categories we didn't have quite enough
range down there with the customer and creating much better theatre for presentation of the product in areas like
flooring, two world, those type of things and very pleased we're seeing great performance over the new format
compared to the original layout that we'd open in the store.
So very pleased with the progress the team is making down there, as we've talked previously on the calls will slow
down the rate of expansion to be able to make sure that we get stores out of the ground, operating at a higher annual
rate and then being able to go back and take some of those expanded range and the new layout and to existing base of
stores that we have. So overall, very impressed with the visit I had last week and the progress that I saw the team
making down there.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
Mike Baker, Analyst
Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. One, did I just say so a further ticket increase was due to going to a higher price plans
which to me sounds a little bit like uptick continuum, is that come back now in the better economy. Can you compare
that one-third of the ticket increase to how it's been the last couple of quarters?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
I don't -- we don't call that's a continuum, but it certainly is an uptake from the value proven initiatives where we have a
good line designs that allow us to sell out the continuum. Certain there is a lot of weight training with our store
associates to enable them to be able to sell up as well. And our relationship with our vendor partners are actually
critical, where we collaborate with them to have both better products, more innovation and better line designs and price
point progressions that allow us to start as well. So why we don't hold up the continuum, it's -- there is certainly a lot of
similarities to what was being done under that program as well.
Mike Baker, Analyst
And is that -- something that has been accelerating over the last couple of quarters?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
I'd say, it depends on category, there were some categories we're seeing accelerate in some categories as some of the
innovation starts to get older. We're starting to modulate some, but what we challenge our merchants to do is to go out
there and find innovation each and every day, and to work with our vendor partners to ensure that we have the ability to
sell up the price point, because the innovation allows us to do, and just to touch on that if you look at some of the
launches as recent like our Kobalt 80 volt products -- hand held products doing very well. Our American standard
format stores, it's to my knowledge it's something installed in the market that continues to do very well.

Our center work surface for Pros post 2000 pounds of weight were (inaudible) 8 square foot area doing very well. So
we have a number of new launches that give our associates something to talk about, so that they can sell up the price
point.
Mike Baker, Analyst
Okay, it makes sense. One more quick one, if I could. Buyback if you stick to your guidance for the year, I think you're
going to buy back about 1.1 billion in the back half, which is a lot less than you buy back in the first half, is there any
upside to the buyback plan?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
So, Michael, we purchased 2.5 billion to date the outlook suggests 3.8, which we come is 1.3 in the second half,
certainly, if we've got their performance in the second half, we could see some upward moves there but at this point in
time, we're comfortable with the $3.8 billion target.

Dennis McGill, Analyst
Hi, good morning. Thank you. I'm wondering, if you could maybe just walk through any regional disparity you saw in
the quarter, if you compare year-over-year comps, and just to help flesh out the weather impacts little bit more?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
We look Dennis, it's certain across regional performances, we were very pleased with the consistency we see across
regions, if you look at it from a divisional perspective, we saw the strongest performance in our Southern Division
across the country, but the balance between regions was pretty consistent across the country as well.
Dennis McGill, Analyst
So I guess the weather impacts, it would be more consistent, I guess this weather impact everywhere as far as working
in your view?

Yeah, well, I think we definitely sell more weather impact, particularly, if you talked about rain in the southern markets
and the western markets, the drought in California, but you're always look at weather form what happened this year to
what happened last year, you always have migration between markets and geographies that you see from that
perspective, but when you we look at it, like I said the South, the North and then the West was probably are the way
that we would break out our overall performance from this divisional perspective.
Dennis McGill, Analyst
Okay. Thanks. And then with respect to the second half margin expansion guidance, and if you were to look at the top
and bottom end of your range. What are the potential negative offsets to the positive discrete items you mentioned, that
would reflect you from the top to the bottom?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Well, certainly, if you think about negative impacts, if revenue comes in lower than expected that would pressure, the
amount of fixed cost leverage, we've got planned and then if there's any acceleration in the promotional environment
that would certainly impact gross margin. We feel good about a lot of things we're doing. We've been spoken about
capabilities we put in place with regard to indirect spend that's going to deliver same with that regard to the sales
environment. Also to the extent, we've got pressure on sales or gross margins second half that would probably
accelerate the amount of bonus leverage that we've got. So we've got some bid against that we believe will offset any
pressure you might come our way.
Dennis McGill, Analyst
Okay. But fair to say that the vast majority of the variance is top line driven?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
I think there is a number of risks that is certainly one of them.

average. So as you think about the second half of the year when you don't expect an incremental step-up in the
promotional activity, what categories do you anticipate will get better especially your comps will remain around this
level, especially with the comparison getting more difficult?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
When we expect to still see growth in outdoor and profit in many on appliances we're excited about our seasonal living
behind some of the work that you see as to with our CX custom experience organization as we go into the back half of
the year. We're excited about some of the launches that we have in flooring and particularly laminate, laminate for the
second quarter was up double digits, and we got a great launch that we just did with one of our vendor partners, that
we're pretty excited about. With our (inaudible) laminate product growth supporting with mobile, so excited about that.
I don't look at it more as where do we have launches that will drive incremental growth and certain laminates are
exciting for us, that will decide for us, we did a Q launch with Renai and tankless water heaters, we're excited about
that, Hitachi, Pneumatic and some of the work that we did in tools. We're excited about as well behind global ad and so
again I'm cautious to try to predict where the industry is going to drive growth. I tend to focus a little more on where
the initiatives are and we got some great initiatives and some great research that we think that will drive performance in
the back half.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Michael, this is Rick. The one thing I would add to that is we think in Lumber & Building Materials, you'll see the
deflation begin to abate, which will help as well and then paint will be another key categories, was only the back half
year as we create more awareness from Sherwin-Williams and we see the weather become more conducive especially
on the exterior of the business to drive that category.
Michael Lasser, Analyst
Let me ask the question, I guess from a different way. Are there categories or product areas right now where you're
under the market from our promotional perspective, and could you see yourself going above the market based on the
returns that you've been able to achieve with the promotional activity that you've engaged in over the last year?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
I think, we are promoting at above the market for most of the categories and to the extent we see share opportunities in
a given category, there may be lean or headline of motion, motion for that categories, I would answer that.
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
To Mike's last point, we think about OP and appliances, I think there's some share opportunities out there as we're
seeing shift from the industry standpoint, certainly, I think we've got a great line-up as Rick alluded in his comments on
appliances, some of the new product, we've got out there that's resonating well OPE.
So we expect that to continue to be strong, but then layering on the other things that Mike talked about including from
paint, not only is it the new brand what weather challenge for us also, we resell our stores in the first half of the year,
first quarter of the year, so we had disruptions in our paint department, obviously as we were going through that resell,
that's all behind us as well.

opportunity in your prepared remarks. So maybe you could provide some broader thought on how you see think close
and purse that market potential, especially in light of what's happening in the competitive landscape?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, (inaudible) Rick's comments, I'll let him address that for you.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, when you look at that we've talked over the last several years about our holistic strategy for the pro and we are
improving our product and service offering, as Mike talked about with brands, and we've talked about in the outside
selling organizations and what we've done in our five ways to save program in the launch of lowesforpros.com really
help us continue to feel confident in our strategic priorities around the pro-customer, we feel confident in our ability to
continue to meet and exceed our expectations from that standpoint.
I think it's also important to remember that the MRO is historically been a very strong customer for us. And really the
advent of our account executive pro services is in place to help us continue to facilitate the growth of the MRO space
and we know that lowesforpros.com will continue to drive affinity with that customer which has a tendency to shop
more as much from a dot com; platform that's in the store, so we feel good with who we are, but we're always

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
Peter Benedict, Analyst
Hey, guys. Bob, quick one on the balance sheet, the improved AP inventory ratio you mentioned one of the timing
there but this trend has been going up about five quarters now. So can you give us a sense of maybe what you're doing
differently there and how long you think you can sustain these improved -- these improved trend and payable?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Peter. So our table is up 15% year-over-year primarily related to the timing of purchases. At quarter we also saw
roughly a 2.5-day improvement in day's payable outstanding. The merchant teams were working really hard to value
today's inventory and relative today's payable and trying to get better coverage there. That's something that is been
guided of late, we saw about a day improvement last year; we want to have roughly a 1.5 day or 2 day improvement
this year.
So while the time will come and go at year-end we should see some improvement, just from the day's payable
outstanding. There's a number of tools in place including the supply chain financing program at this point affective to

allow our vendors to leverage those balance sheet.
Peter Benedict, Analyst
Okay, perfect, sounds good. And then maybe, Rick, a quick one for you on the OPE strength particularly with respect
to the writers. Do you think we're running a kind of a replacement cycle there, I mean that's the category that has not
had a lot of strength for several years. So just curious what you think is going on there. If it's more than just kind of a
one season type thing?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
This is Mike Jones. I'd say its two things, one of which is innovation, we're seeing a lot more innovation on tractors
purchasing in the past and there is a bit of replacement cycle as well. So I think it was, we're gaining a little both.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
And then the other thing I would add to that Peter is, as Roberts spoke out earlier we continue to gain market share in
that category and we think with the brand alone of the innovation that we had, we'll continue to gain market share in
that category throughout the year.
Peter Benedict, Analyst

And your final question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.
Gregory Melich, Analyst
Great thanks, I will make it count I guess. I guess two questions, first on just overall sales. But if we look at your
guidance, it looks like you do a comp of 4A in the first half and then it implies at the second half, you're assuming at
about three to four. And if that's the case, how should we think about SG&A leverage, X the bonus stuff that you talked
about, given that there is less comp in the plan. What else might be helping it?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So first half comps were 4.7, Greg, second half comps would be in the 4-ish range, so not terribly dissimilar.
There is a variety of factors that would contribute to leverage, Rick talked about the good work done in with the store
operations team to continue to thoughtfully put associates in front of customers, allows us to be more effective in our
utilization of payroll, that certainly continues in the second half of the year.

I mentioned in the credit, we've got project related expenses around facilities, repairs and some of our projects that
were first half, we did, we will get benefit there, and then in your expand as a capability to continues to get momentum,
that should give us some benefit -- greater benefit in the second half of the year. So let's say that there's not a lot of
difference between in the comp first half and second half and then we've got some other discrete items that should drive
SG&A leverage.

online standpoint I think as Rick went through his comments, he talked about some of the additional features and
benefits that we're adding to lowes.com which is resonating very well with the customer particularly when we have
more and more customers starting their purchase, process online, they made as you know, finished online or come to
the store, but overall, lowes.com was up about 20% in the quarter, now that we've talked about the receptivity we've
had for Lowe's or pros launch.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Greg, I think the things that we've really been looking at of course, we've had about a quarter of works the data that
we've been evaluating as we continue to move through and we're learning as we see shopping behaviors to the pro on
the category, and on the site, what they're looking at and what categories are really resonating well.
We've been very pleased with the receptivity of the site itself, we're measuring things such as category of products that
are being purchased; assortments that are being evaluated, we're looking at the amount of channel pick up or they're
picked up in store, then picking up to the delivery, or is it being partial.
So we think, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from that standpoint so far. As Robert says on lowes.com will
grew roughly 20% in the quarter, and I think that continues to be driven by several factor and one of the most being the
new innovation that we're putting on the site itself. When you look at what we've been able to do in the last -- first half
of the year, the patio configuration tool. You heard me talk about accessories is helping to seasonal living categories in
the quarter. There is no doubt that tool is really helping us from the dot com standpoint. And then you look at of what
we've done to really be able to show product differently on the site.
We've increased the number of 363 product views, another 3,500 items were added during the quarter in Q2 this is up
to roughly 15,000 items, we were able to spin the view of that category. Product videos, we talked about how
increasingly the accessories shoppers going to dot com first to evaluate product categories. We added another 200
videos into that category, category during the quarter, added 4,000 enhanced images and pictures to the side as well.
Introduced the search engine capabilities that we're looking at for more intuitive search. And so as a result of that, we
sell traffic to lowes.com and increased 19% for the quarter and we saw a slight increase in conversion as well. So when
you look at the holistic aspect of the dot com platform, we feel very good with the innovations we've added, with the
technology improvements that we've made. Like said, our earlier with lowesforpros, we're very pleased with what
we've seen there. We've actually seen a double-digit increase in new customers to Lowe's that are on this site that had
not previously shop with us before, which is very exciting when we think through the roll out of the site itself.
