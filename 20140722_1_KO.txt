Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year, we established five global strategic priorities to
restore our global growth momentum. Halfway through the year, I'm pleased to report that we've delivered another
quarter of sequentially improving performance results. While I'm pleased with this year-to-date progress, we're
conscious of the fact that we still have more work to do.
In spite of continued sluggish global economic growth, the beverage industry remains vibrant. Consumers today have a
wider array of beverages to choose from than ever before and our system is responding by evolving the way we
operate, leveraging our strengths to create new competitive advantages.
Our second quarter and year-to-date performance results reflect the steady progress that we are making and that we
expect to continue as we further solidify the foundation for long-term sustainable growth.
We closed out the second quarter with 3% global volume growth, including global sparkling growth of 2%. And
importantly, price/mix increased 2% on a consolidated basis, as we strive to deliver balanced volume and revenue
growth.
We're seeing a number of encouraging signs across our global operating system. In the second quarter, brand
Coca-Cola grew 1% in North America along with solid 3% sparkling price/mix. We saw improving volume growth
across several key markets in Europe. Eurasia and Africa continue to deliver balanced volume growth.
Key markets in our Asia-Pacific operations delivered strong performance including 9% growth in China, double-digit
growth in India, and 1% growth in Japan. And we saw steady execution in the face of a challenging macro environment
in Latin America.
As mentioned, this progress is built on the implementation and execution of our five global strategic priorities,
priorities that emerged from a disciplined fact-based look at what drives results and long-term sustainable growth.
We know for example that great marketing, combined with great in-market execution are fundamental building blocks
of our formula for long-term sustainable growth. When we conducted a comprehensive review of our business last
year, we identified areas where we could improve and put a focused plan in place to address them.
With that in mind, I will now provide an update on our progress against each of our five strategic priorities. Our first
strategic priority is to accelerate global sparkling growth led by brand Coca-Cola. We grew global brand Coca-Cola
1%, a sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2014.
As noted earlier, our global sparkling brands grew 2% in the second quarter, thanks to solid performance across our
portfolio of billion-dollar sparkling brands including Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero and Schweppes. This led our 19th
consecutive quarter of core sparkling value share gains.
Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Light declined mid single-digits. While this was a sequential improvement from the first
quarter, we do recognize that we have more work to do here.

Progress in growing our global sparkling beverages is built on proven strategies that include delivering best-in-class
marketing, driving immediate consumption transactions, and leading industry innovation.
While I could point to multiple examples of each, I would particularly like to highlight our Share a Coke campaign, as
it successfully combines all three strategies and it is being rolled out in more than 80 markets this year.
The viral impact of this campaign and the engagement among teens has been more than encouraging. We're excited
about the campaign's expansion not only to new markets, but also its return for an encore in many markets.
For example, this year in our Northwest Europe and Nordics business unit, we are extending the program to include all
Coca-Cola trademark immediate consumption and future consumption packs and increasing the number of names from
250 to 1,000 per market. This is a tremendous logistical feat and marketing achievement befitting the world's most
loved beverage brand.
The growth of brand Coca-Cola in North America in the second quarter gives us confidence that our focus on driving
incidents, delivering best-in-class marketing and evolving our price pack architecture is setting the foundation for
well-balanced growth in our flagship market.
Through these efforts, we are reviving the romance of brand Coca-Cola, driving household penetration and increasing
consumption frequency, all of which contributed to growth in the second quarter.
Our smaller size packs contributed significantly to brand Coca-Cola growth in the second quarter and year-to-date.
Over 60% of the volume growth in brand Coca-Cola in the second quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our
mini-can and 16-ounce immediate consumption packages, reflecting strong consumer demand for smaller packages of
ice-cold Coca-Cola.
So, we remain optimistic about our sparkling business in North America and around the world and we're committed to
supporting our brands, committed to driving execution and staying at the forefront of evolving consumer needs.
Our second global priority is to strategically expand our profitable still beverage portfolio. We've delivered 5% still
beverage volume growth in the second quarter and 6% growth year-to-date. Sports drinks, tea, energy, coffee and water
all contributed to global growth and enabled us to gain volume and value share in still beverages year-to-date.
Juice and juice drinks growth slowed year-to-date due to price adjustments, primarily to offset cost of goods increases
in North America. However, we gained volume and value share in North America and also on a global basis.
Overall, the global juice growth story remains very robust. We are strengthening our leading brands as demonstrated by
the double-digit growth of Maaza and Rani year-to-date; along with high single-digit growth for Simply; and mid
single-digit growth for Del Valle.
Our tea volume increased 4% in the quarter, growing volume and value share in the second quarter and year-to-date.
Importantly, our tea brands within the U.S. and Japan, our two largest tea markets performed very well. Tea volume
grew 6% in North America, driven by double-digit Gold Peak and Honest Tea growth; while in Japan, tea volume grew
5% led by 8% growth of Ayataka, the 21st consecutive quarter of strong growth for this dynamic brand.
As a system, we are enhancing our premium water brands to drive revenue, while investing in our value chains to
improve profitability. Examples of premium water brands growing double-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date
include smartwater in North America, I LOHAS in Japan, and Vio in Germany.
As we focus on building great brands, we're pleased to share that smartwater will soon be available in Great Britain and
that addition of DASANI Sparkling and DASANI DROPS is enhancing our brand margins in North America. Our
water portfolio grew 7% in the second quarter and 10% year-to-date.
In the sports drinks category, we grew volume 6% in the quarter, fueled by our FIFA World Cup POWERADE
activation. As the global value leader in still beverages and with $11 billion brands and many more in the pipeline, we
are diligently working to enhance the value of our still portfolio.

And as exemplified by our recent partnership with Keurig Green Mountain, we will continue to strategically target
opportunities to strengthen our position and build our breadth across new categories, while building category beverage
depth.
Moving now on to our third strategic priority, which is to increase brand investments by maximizing productivity, our
productivity initiatives are on track as is our commitment to increase media investments in key markets. We are
delivering more and better quality marketing by focusing on increased efficiency and effectiveness.
Our global marketing campaign charters are fueling productivity and efficiency; while at the same time, driving media
effectiveness through higher-quality communication. Example of the power of this approach is the full-scale activation
of our FIFA World Cup campaign, where a single creative idea, 'this is the World's Cup', was executed across more
than 170 markets in the second quarter.
The success of our Coca-Cola music anthem for the 2014 FIFA World Cup reinforces the engaging nature of this
campaign, as the anthem reached over 2 billion impressions, charting in the top 10 songs in 40 countries and was
ranked as the number one song in Brazil at the start of the World Cup. The full impact of our enhanced marketing and
productivity initiatives will clearly build over time.
Our fourth priority is to win at the point of sale by unlocking the power of our system. Our global system is committed
to investing in new plants, investing in new distribution capabilities, investing in coolers and marketing. Enhancing our
immediate consumption capabilities, while optimizing in-store activations and advancing our customers business
strategies, and finally putting more feet on the street to service these accounts.
To that end, you may have read last week that together with our bottling partners, we will be investing an additional
$8.2 billion by 2020 to support our long-term business plan and vision in Mexico. Since 2010, our total system
investments globally have exceeded $60 billion.
Our fifth priority is to invest in our next-generation of leaders. We're doing this by inspiring our people to live our
values of focusing on the market, working smart, acting like owners and being passionate ambassadors for our
company and for our brands.
We're harnessing the potential of our millennial associates. Their optimism, their global mindedness,
entrepreneurialism, and social awareness drive them to build sustainable practices into every aspect of what they do,
including right here at The Coca-Cola Company. We therefore established an internal group of millennial voices and
we're working with the World Economic Forum's Global Shapers to provide our leaders with insights on how to
continue to evolve to meet the needs of this and also future generations.
We continue to focus on strengthening the core, front-facing capabilities of franchise leadership, commercial leadership
and marketing leadership, while also embracing emerging capabilities in the digital mobile and social media arena.
We're working with our global bottling partners to encourage more cross-system experience, having company
associates join bottlers, and bottling associates join the company to instill a one-team mentality across our global
system ranks.
And another terrific example of how we're living our fifth priority is the Woodruff Cup, our most prestigious internal
award named after our legendary Chairman, Robert Woodruff, whose tenure with the company span from 1923 to
1985.
Each year our Business Unit Presidents, select one of their peers as winner of this award and people leadership is a key
criteria. Our most recent winner, the South Latin Business Unit, exemplifies what it means to inspire our
next-generation of leaders as demonstrated by the fact that women make up more than half of their workforce and that
they've consistently been ranked among the top three best places to work in that whole geography.
Our focus on our five strategic priorities enables us to execute the fundamentals, while simultaneously transforming
and advancing our business. An important example of this is our North America re-franchising effort to build the 21st
century beverage partnership model.

Our ongoing work is underpinned by our full commitment to create a modern, agile, consumer and customer focused
operating model and system, which balances national scale and local capability.
As we continue to rollout an evolved business model in North America, we expect to franchise the large portion of
North America territories into a handful of regional bottlers, proven regional bottlers that can best serve every local
community within their contiguous operating territories. These larger bottling partners will be complemented by a
select group of local bottling partners enabling us to benefit from the passion and local touch of a franchise model and
to grow our business faster and more profitably over time.
We're making progress and we're implementing this work by executing smaller scale transitions today, so that we can
seamlessly transfer larger portions of territory in the future. It is important for us to follow this deliberate process as we
establish a structure to maximize long-term value for our shareowners, while ensuring that there is no business
disruption to our customers and consumers. We will provide you with additional details regarding this transformational
initiative before the end of the year.
In summary, and as mentioned at the beginning of the year, we're committed to executing strategies that will deliver
stronger growth. Notwithstanding the volatile environment in which we're operating, we're making steady and
sequential progress as we invest in our brands together with our bottling partners and we expect to fall within the
corridors of our long-term growth algorithm in the second half of the year.
Indeed, our second-quarter and year-to-date performance results reflect the steady progress that we're making to restore
our global growth momentum and I look forward to providing you with further updates later in the year.
Now, I'm happy to hand the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with an
update on our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for the balance of the year.
Following Kathy's prepared remarks, Irial Finan, Sandy Douglas, Ahmet Bozer, and I will participate in our Q&A
session to address any market specific questions that you may have today.
Kathy?
Kathy N. Waller
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying that it's an honor to serve as the CFO
of The Coca-Cola Company. In my more than 25 years with the company, I've seen our business evolve and grow over
time, while remaining strategically focused on doing the right things to drive long-term sustainable growth. That's why
I am confident about our business and I look forward to working with each of you.
As Muhtar mentioned, we are continued to execute the five strategic priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year.
We achieved 3% volume growth in the quarter and delivered sound financial results over the first half of 2014.
Let's start by reviewing a few key drivers of our financial performance. Unit case growth was ahead of concentrate
sales growth in the quarter, primarily due to timing of shipments. Importantly, after considering the impact of one less
selling day, unit cases and concentrate sales were in line year-to-date and we expect them to be in line for the full-year.
Comparable currency neutral net revenue growth was 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date, after excluding the
impact of structural items. Our top line growth included two points of positive price/mix in both the quarter and
year-to-date.
Comparable currency neutral operating income was up 5% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date, after excluding the
impact of structural items. Operating leverage was even in the quarter as we continued to make the necessary
investments behind our brands to accelerate growth, including a mid single-digit increase in DME as we invest in the
growth of our brands together with our global system partners.

On a comparable basis, currency unfavorably impacted this quarter's operating income by 4%, which was three points
better than the outlook we provided during our last earnings call. The difference between the outlook we provided and
the actual currency impact was primarily due to a new provision in Venezuela that imposed a maximum threshold for
profit margins and decreased our bolivar-denominated revenue and profit.
The new provision resulted in an approximate $0.01 drag on comparable EPS in the second quarter, which is partially
offset by the impact of slight improvement in other currencies compared to our previous expectations.
Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and
will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
We also benefited in the quarter from lowering our underlying effective tax rate from 23% to 22.5% for the full-year.
Cash generated from operating activities was a strong $4.5 billion in the first half of the year and we continue to make
capital deployment decisions based on a consistent and disciplined framework as we have outlined before.
First, we reinvest in the business, which includes making the necessary investments to strengthen our brands and
includes capital investments, which we expect to be roughly $2.5 billion for the year.
Secondly, we reward our shareowners by paying a healthy dividend, which we have increased annually for more than
half a century.
Next, we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships, and joint ventures. We view these as
enablers to help accelerate growth and create value in a capital efficient manner.
And lastly, we repurchase shares. Year-to-date, our net share repurchases totaled $1.3 billion and we are on track for
net share repurchases and the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for the full-year.
As we look ahead to the second half of 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items as we model
our business. We previously communicated that we expected structural items to unfavorably impact the first half of the
year as we cycled the de-consolidation of certain bottling operations in 2013.
However, we now expect structural items including Venezuela to be 1 point to 2 point drag on net revenue growth and
an approximate 3 point drag on operating income growth during the second half of 2014.
The re-franchise territories in North America had a nominal impact on our comparable results in the second quarter and
are not expected to have a meaningful impact over the balance of the year.
After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior-year rates we expect a 3 point
currency headwind at operating income during the second half of 2014 with a relatively similar impact on both third
quarter and fourth quarters.
And we now expect a currency headwind in the 5 point to 6 point range at operating income for the full-year. This is an
improvement compared to the previous outlook we provided, primarily due to the decrease in bolivar-denominated
revenue and profits.
After taking into consideration all of these factors, we expect the impact of structural items, net of the benefit from the
change in our underlying effective tax rate to be a $0.02 drag on comparable EPS during the second half of the year.
Finally, we continue to expect operating leverage on a currency neutral basis to be even to slightly positive for the
full-year.
In closing, we delivered sound financial performance in the first half of 2014. And we expect to continue our sound
financial performance over the remainder of the year.
And I believe our company and our global system are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our great
industry.

Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Good morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, Muhtar, if I look at your second quarter performance, volume growth of 3% sequential
improvement versus Q1, global price/mix held steady at 2%, I guess second quarter also though benefited in part,
because of easy comp and you had the Easter benefit. So, can you maybe talk about your ability to sustain the top line
momentum as you look out in the back half of the year and be mindful of some of the macro economic conditions that
you see in the marketplace?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Thanks, Judy. Well, again, just to quickly go through the quarter, as you said, volume
was up 3%, sparkling volume really importantly was up 2% and brand Coca-Cola up globally and in North America.
Those are really three important points.
Also, another quarter of value market share gains. I think more than 25 consecutive – 28 to be exact consecutive quarter
of gaining value share. You see us having a very – with our system, very clear focus on priorities. We had our entire
global bottling system get together with us a few months ago, and again, a recommitment to the focus on our priorities.
Sequential improvement in a lot of large markets, particularly Europe, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and
again good results, very strong results out of Eurasia and Africa, improving in Nigeria, South Africa, Turkey;
improvements again if you take Asia-Pacific again very strong quarter in China as well as in India, double-digit growth
in India, Thailand, saw again – so, if you take all of those margins that are improving, gross margins has improved in
the quarter compared to the prior year.
Clear path on North America franchising, strong belief that what we are doing is working in our system, is really
important. Good bottler alignment, yes, there are a few exceptions, but there always have been and will be, and more
work to be done.
So, I'm the first to say we operate in a very volatile global environment, both politically and economically. China
slowing down is impacting many commodity exporting countries and from Africa to Latin America; but overall, what
we're doing is working more marketing through productivity gains, better marketing.
We mentioned Share a Coke program in over 80 markets. Tremendous leverage on our World Cup program in more
than 170 markets with probably the biggest activation that we've ever had and all this will not generally have an impact
on the quarter that you spend in, it comes in after with better incidence, better brand loyalty, better purchase intent that
we're all seeing.
And what is happening in North America, in terms of sparkling price/mix also, you can see that we have a very
disciplined approach, both in the United States and globally, where we've been able to achieve a 2% price/mix on a
global basis.
And yes, there was an Easter shift, but at the same time, our gallon shipments were below our unit case volume for the
quarter. So, if you say that that would neutralize the benefit that we may have got from Easter, I think, overall, we feel
pretty confident with – again the caveat that we need to do a lot more work and continue to do a lot more work, more

focus, better execution, but the five priorities are working and early shoots, green shoots and we expect that the balance
of the year, as I mentioned in my script, that we should be able to fall within the corridor of the long-term growth
targets. And again, there may be issues along the way, bumps along the way, but the most important thing is that we're
resolutely focused on continuing to build momentum here.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. That's helpful. If I can just quickly follow-up on North American pricing, particularly in
the sparkling side, where you got the 3% in the quarter, maybe a little bit more details around the drivers of that
whether it was – how much was mix versus rate. And your views on whether you can sustain that kind of pricing and
maybe even see acceleration if you look out the next...
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. Sure, I'll say a few things and pass it over to Sandy, but all I will say is take note of
the fact that a very big portion, percentage, 60% to be exact of the growth came from smaller packages, that's obviously
an enhancement of the mix driving revenue, but also rate.
So, I'll ask Sandy and then may be Irial, if he has any commentary on North America, but we are operating with
tremendous diligence and discipline in the marketplace and success for us is a combination of both the growth that we
have on the volume, but importantly also growth in transaction, which is a really good litmus test of the success of the
business that is coming more into play each day as we progress. Sandy?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas>: Thanks, Muhtar. Hi, Judy. We said at the beginning of the year that our focus in
North America was going to be a disciplined combination of volume and price and that we would see that as a strategic
priority and the second quarter really reflects that; 3% price/mix on sparkling, while achieving volume growth on Coke,
and Muhtar mentioned the importance of smaller packages in driving that outcome. It's also important in driving
growth because consumers want smaller packages and we've been working on developing that as a part of our overall
strategy, so lots of discipline.
As we ahead, we're lapping some very promotional activity in the third quarter of last year and our discipline will
remain and the bottlers and the company around the country are focused on marketing and selling our way through and
maintaining an extraordinary amount of discipline on pricing, and we're optimistic that we'll be able to hold that
strategy.
<A - Irial Finan>: Hi, it's Irial. Against all, I can just repeat what Sandy said and I've said in the last three calls now,
which is, we really are focused on building a long term sustainable business and that's mixing pricing and volume and
transactions in a very balanced way and coming up with a great result for our company and we will do that and we'll
continue to do it.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. The only thing, I would add here also Judy is that, we see a path forward to being
able to build more romance with the brand through smaller packages. And that's really an important element in, what is
also being discussed.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to get a clarification if I could, when you talk about
the $0.02 impact, you mentioned it was comparable EPS, but it sounds like that's sort of reported EPS as well, is that
correct?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Kathy?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Sure. Hi, John. And thanks for the question. So, Venezuela impact, yes, that is a $0.02 drag
on comparable EPS as well as reported EPS, so if you look at Venezuela, you take it in two pieces, there's currency
impact as well as the impact of the provision, the provision is less bolivar-denominated revenue, because of capped

margins, and it has gone straight to the bottom line and then the FX is – the impact is because as well, we don't have as
much bolivar-denominated revenue and income. So, you could split those two pieces. And yes, it is comparable as well
as, as reported.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, Kathy, if I could just sort of follow-up, we're continuing
to see weaker volumes in some of the higher-margin regions like Latin America or Europe, what have you. So, can you
talk a little bit in terms of how you're going to look at – how should we think about margins going forward? If this type
of relative weakness in some of these higher-margin markets continues to particularly Latin America, which is your
highest margin region and it's been a little bit softer over the last couple of quarters? Thanks.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So, I would split the question in two. And I actually – let Ahmet help me answer with it. But
the margins in Latin America are impacted this quarter by the Venezuela provision. And then when you look at
ongoing volume growth and contribution to the company, I'll let Ahmet.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yeah. John, hey. Just couple of points. Rest of Latin America, the margins and the growth and
profitability overall is in a good direction, no important issues there. Also keep in mind that we've been able to realize
positive price/mix in high-margin places like Europe. We've been able to grow in Japan, so we are able to balance
across the international territory to have positive price/mix and margins.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yeah. Okay. Great.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: John, just to add, I mean, I think, yes, you are right in saying that Latin America has
slowed down to where it traditionally has been. And we've seen this kind of cyclical slowdowns in Latin America. And,
as some parts will get better – I think starting with towards the end of the year.
We also see some other volatility – continued volatility in like Argentina and other markets. But overall, I think, for
most of what we're cycling as well, we expect Latin America – major markets in Latin America to have some
sequential improvement in the second half of this year. And then overall longer-term, we feel very confident about also
what is lying ahead in Latin America.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Kathy, I wanted to follow-up on John's question, just relative to leverage. And I guess, there
are two parts to it. One, just, I think, I caught in the prepared comments that you mentioned that on the comparable
currency neutral basis, you'd expect some leverage in the second half. So, I'm just trying to make sure I heard that
correctly and that we should be thinking about ex the Venezuela impact and ex the structural change in currency,
there'd be currency neutral operating profit growth.
And then, second question, if I've done the calculations correctly, it looks like on a comparable basis currency neutral
gross margins in the quarter were up. So, if you could just talk a little about a, if that's true? And b, if you could talk a
little bit about how you would expect gross margins to evolve going forward, kind of what type of inflation you're
seeing? And just sort of how – what factors you might see driving gross margins in the second half?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Okay. Hi, Bryan. Thanks for your question. So, our outlook for leverage on a currency neutral
basis remains flat to slightly positive. And when you think about gross margins, so gross margins have improved for
the second quarter and year-to-date and when we look at our margins for the back half of the year, we delivered sound
financial results and we anticipate that we will continue to deliver sound financial results for the quarter – for the back

half of the year. So, we do anticipate that margins will continue in the same way that they've been in the first half of the
year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So, there was nothing unusual about the gross margins in the first half, we could potentially
see more progress on gross margins and we're just spending more money back, which is what's getting the leverage to
slightly flat, is that the way to think about it?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: We are continuing to invest behind our brands. And so, yes that is part of the leverage story,
but that's causing, like in North America some negative – slight negative leverage in North America, because we are
spending behind our brand. So, we are getting pricing and we are committed to rational pricing, so we're getting
pricing, which is helping us with the gross margins, but we are continuing to invest behind our brands.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Excellent. Thank you.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Just to add to that Bryan. If you look at the second quarter compared to the first quarter,
marketing is substantially higher in the second quarter than it is in the first quarter and particularly towards the
back-end of the second quarter, substantially higher. So, that explains some of the things again what Kathy was saying.
But also, our productivity is on target. It has been on target for the first half of the year and will be on target for the
second half.

Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. Can I ask a couple of specific questions on Latin America? First on Brazil, given
all the investments you made in the market and the World Cup, I was just wondering why volume performance wasn't
stronger in the quarter. You mentioned in the release of tough macro environment and some competitive activity, but I
was hoping you could give us a bit more detail?
And then second with regards to Mexico. I know you've taken all the pricing related to the tax increase earlier in the
year, but have you also passed on pricing now for sort of general inflation in the country? Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Michael, it's Muhtar here, and I'll ask Ahmet to provide additional commentary,
but think of Brazil as having a very tough macro environment in the first half. So, if you look at the entire consumer
disposable and non-disposable consumer durable consumer goods sectors, we're under tremendous duress in the first
half of the year, particularly leading up to – particularly more so even in the second quarter.
So think of it this way. Had it not been, the result would have been perhaps not what it would have been had we not
done all that activity? So from that perspective, I think we see brands getting stronger, incidents and purchase intent
getting stronger in Brazil as a result of all the activity, and I think that should benefit us going forward in Brazil.
So certainly, the macro environment in Brazil as you can read as we can all see, has been very challenging. And so,
given that backdrop, I think our results – we're content with where we are and we believe that what we've done will
benefit us in the second half and going forward.
In terms of Mexico, I think both times prices were adjusted, they include a certain portion for also inflation, so take it
as that; but again, I'll ask Ahmet to provide any further commentary for both Brazil and Mexico.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Muhtar. On Brazil, the only thing I would add Michael is that we have a pricing
packaging architecture, which allows us to have different tax both for immediate and future consumption at different
price points and we are executing those with great discipline and that in fact is helping us navigate this challenging
external environment. And we expect that to continue to bear fruit in the third quarter and fourth quarter along with the
strong marketing programs we have.

With respect to Mexico, the only other thing I would add is that we do have a – not just passing the tax and the
inflation, but a consumer-driven pricing approach, which has been very carefully calculated and the elasticity that we
have calculated in reality are happening better than that we've expected. So, in other words, our Mexican business is
showing more resilience in this area.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Hi, Kathy. I guess Muhtar, as you think about the
sparkling global outlook and your efforts to build on where you are here in the second quarter, is it fair to think your
emphasis will continue to be on volume share gains more so than dollar share gains or do you think there's potential for
more dollar share growth in spite of the volumes being a little below what you're hoping for?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I think success for us is certainly continuing our value share gains. Obviously, you can't –
only value share gains without volume is not sustainable over the long-term, but we have a very disciplined approach
just like in North America also for our international business related to more smaller packs, so benefiting the mix will
benefit us, but also very importantly, it's critical for us to achieve price/mix on a global scale.
Different geographies will again play differently into the picture. We have such disparate pricing per case depending on
which geography we're talking about. So, geographic mix is an important piece of this, as is package mix, and as is
rate.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: And could you – obviously a lot of markets to talk about and this call isn't useful for
going into many of them, but when you look at North America specifically and you see the 3% price/mix on the
carbonated and a bit of growth there on the stills, but you also have the flat volumes and then data we look at is CPI for
the larger carbonated space, which continues to be down, so retailers continue to promote the carbonated component of
your business.
How are you thinking about the opportunity for better value share performance in North America, given the volume
share situation you're facing?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I'd just say that once again smaller size packs contributed significantly to, say brand
Coca-Cola volume and revenue growth in Q2 and year-to-date, as a matter of fact. So, if you take over 60% of the
growth in brand Coca-Cola in Q2 was driven by double-digit growth in our mini can and 16-ounce immediate
consumption packages, I think that is how I would like to leave you with. That is what I'd like to leave you with, as an
opportunity.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys. So, if you would have predicted back in December that price/mix in North America was
going to be up as much and your volumes would have remained flat and Latin America unit case volume would have
been flat even with all the Mexico tax issues, I think I would have said you're being optimistic, but that is what you're
delivering, which is good. But it does raise two questions for me.
One is, it has concentrated your volume growth in only two of your six reporting segments. So, I want to get a better
sense of how comfortable you are with those two currently and your expansion of volume growth in the other
segments? Like what gives you confidence that the other ones can grow as well?

And then secondly, a question about the mix between volume and price/mix, which if you look over the past 10 years,
it's been mainly driven by volume, obviously pricing that much more balanced. And I'm trying to understand how much
of that is actually a change in strategic intent that you described versus just FX driving you to raise more pricing? So, if
you can help with those two that would be great in the broader volume context?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. Ali, I'll take the last first. The strategy is driven by what consumers want and that
is not just a phenomena for the United States, but smaller packages are a key focus. So that helps the mix, that helps the
revenue, that helps also the price/mix. Then, again, couple that with a very disciplined approach towards also having
the right balance between value and volume share gains. And, so it's really important.
In terms of concentration of volume growth, I think the important thing is for you to focus on the improvements from
quarter-to-quarter. If you take key geographies like Europe, France had an improvement, Germany had an
improvement, Great Britain had a significant improvement, Italy had a significant improvement, Spain had a significant
improvement, and Europe overall had a huge improvement when you look at the total. And just, again this is just pure
simply from volume. And then if you look at pricing and other things, you'll get also a similar picture.
So, I think focus on the sequential improvements. Focus on us delivering on our focused priorities. And so, what I see
there's that we will strive and diligently strive to continue with sequential improvement building momentum as we go
forward. And I also mentioned as an answer to a previous question, that I thought, Latin America, we would see some
also sequential improvement.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. Thanks. And, one of the things you've gotten asked a bunch
on this conference call is about margin and margin mix, and one of the things obviously that can offset margin
pressures is incremental cost cutting. Can you talk a little bit more about how you view incremental cost cutting versus
what you've announced so far? What you think the potential is, and when you think we might hear more about more
cost cutting at the company?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Well, we announced significant cost cuts over the last four years or five years, different
programs. And as I mentioned earlier, again, we're on target with our productivity. And that productivity is being
reinvested to drive growth.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Great. Thanks. Maybe building on that and focusing back on North America. As you talked
about you had good price/mix realization in sparkling of 3% and you did see margin grow in the quarter, which is great.
But overall, we only saw 1% price/mix and year-to-date margins remain slightly below last year's level in the U.S.
based on my math.
So, as I think about the path towards re-franchisement and smoothing that path, it seems to me greater profitability is a
great enabler of that. What needs to be done? Is there a way to get even more aggressive on price/mix realization or to
Ali's point pushing on productivity more to get the North American profit pool to expand to facilitate entry of new
partners? Thanks.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: I'll talk about a couple of levers and then ask Irial to join me. But the growth in profitability in
North America, the major opportunities exist in pricing and the overall effectiveness and efficiency in the system.
We talked about price as a lever and an area of discipline and focus and price is achieved through rate as you know and
also mix and a whole lot of innovation is going on inside of packaging to give consumers what they want and to earn a
return as a result of that.

Couple that with our overall system architecture work, which Muhtar described earlier, which is on track as we
overhaul IT product supply, as we overhaul customer management and shared services in the re-franchising progress,
which is on track with our bottlers, we'll create a system that is on one hand more effective and grows faster and on
another level is more efficient generating better margins.
But at the end of the day, that combination needs to be built on accelerating growth and the focus of the near-term has
been to reinvest the proceeds into marketing to rebuild brand momentum and brand momentum at price point, and
we're optimistic about the progress, but we have a whole lot more work to do.
<A - Irial Finan>: The only add I would give is that, wearing to the bottling hat is that we remain absolutely
committed to deliver one of our core priorities, which is, excellence and execution in the marketplace. And as every
day goes by, I get more comfortable that we're starting to do things better every day, every time we go to an outlet and
fundamentally, that's the other piece that actually gives us the capability to get extra price and mix in the marketplace
and we will continue to do that, and it's a journey, it's not turning a light switch on, it happens day-by-day,
week-by-week, month-by-month and I feel pretty good that over the next number of years, our capability in the
marketplace, married with great marketing, is going to deliver the kind of price/mix we all desire and that's why the
discipline in remaining focus on price/mix married with transaction growth and married with volume is why we feel
confident about our North American business over the long-term.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Could you just comment about some of the market share losses in Mexico, Brazil, and then a
much smaller market in the UK? So, what do you think is driving that? And then when do you think some of those
trends are going to reverse, because some of these losses are fairly substantial. I think it was like a little over a point of
value share and scan channels loss in Brazil, about a point in Mexico, and then similar trends in the UK?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. Bill, I think in the UK, most of that loss was in Q1. If you look at Q2, we've had
sequential improvement in the UK and we expect that going forward in both Mexico and in Brazil that more minor
losses to the B brands and local players will reverse themselves in the course of the year. And we already see that
happening in both markets. So, I think that was the difficult operating environment in Brazil, in terms of also us having
discipline in our pricing. And the same goes for also Mexico.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. Got you. So, you think that your losses are really a function of maybe the more
aggressive pricing you took and maybe as that stabilizes this year?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And very transitory.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. Thanks so much.

spending as the quarter progressed and your volume growth, just again, just trying to understand if the spending is
actually working. And when you think about the ROI on that spend, what discrete things and specific things is Coke
doing to make sure that there is a glide path to getting better return out of that spend? Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think, two things. Spending increased as we moved through the quarter. So, there
was much more spending in, let's say, the end of the quarter than there was at the beginning of the quarter. And
therefore, you would expect that not all that benefit is going to flow obviously into the quarter. And this is, again, about
generating long-term sustainable momentum, which we believe is happening.
Again, I want to remind everyone that I am pleased with these results in a difficult operating environment. And to get
growth back into sparkling is a significant achievement to get growth back into Coca-Cola and the world globally and
in the United States is a significant achievement. And we will continue to focus on where we need to be
quarter-after-quarter, one quarter at a time. I just want to say that I believe our approach is working.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
<Q - Kevin M. Grundy>: Good morning and thanks for the question. So first, Muhtar, you talked about increasing or
broadening your product portfolio. So, maybe without tipping your hand too much, what would be the top of your wish
list by product and geography? And do you still feel comfortable with your energy drinks strategy?
And then separately, Kathy, now that you kind of bring a fresh look here. Do you plan on doing anything differently
from a capital structure perspective? And I guess I'd say that within the context that there's an argument to make that
Coke is under-levered and can potentially add leverage? Or by adding leverage could add value to shareholders and
we've seen a number of companies in the CPG space that have been rewarded by the market for such action. So, any
thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. Kevin, obviously, I can't walk you through a wish list. That would be too much
information to the whole market and everyone that plays in the market. But I would say, our portfolio is really very rich
as you know from our $17 billion brands and so many more in the pipeline.
And, again, our sparkling brands have really performed well on a global basis, Sprite and Fanta and Schweppes, in
addition to Coca-Cola. So all of that tells me that what we're doing in different brands and creating more incidents,
more transactions is working.
And you heard the numbers that I mentioned in tea, both in the U.S. and globally in premium waters, in juice and juice
drinks, in sports drinks, all of that we're pleased with a much richer portfolio than we had say three years ago.
And that portfolio is again yielding very good results, particularly also Simply, in the juice category, Simply, Rani,
Innocent, all those different brands, Del Valle, across the world yielding very good results, and again, both also in
China too and Southeast Asia with new innovations that are really working well for us in both the fusion of dairy and
juice as well as pulpy drinks and also juice and juice drinks.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: And...
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Kathy, go ahead.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: And the second part of your question. Yeah, I believe the company has always been very
focused on driving long-term sustainable growth and we've done that in a very consistent and disciplined way and we
are very focused on reinvesting in the business and to accelerate growth and create value.
So, I believe, obviously, we focus on making sure we have share repurchase and we do give a healthy dividend back,
but we will continue basically, what we have been doing focusing on driving long-term growth.
<Q - Kevin M. Grundy>: So, no real change on that front?

Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial, and Jackson. Our performance year-to-date progressed against each of our
strategic priorities and the positive signs that we're seeing in many global markets all illustrate our view that the 20/20
vision and strategic plans are solid. Proof points are out there. 3% growth in the quarter, global price/mix of 2%,
increased global media spending reflecting our confidence and building on the strength of our brands, and also in our
ability to engage our consumers and customers effectively, and global year-to-date value share growth in our
categories.
So, we're winning in the vibrant beverage industry and also coupled with sound financial performance during the first
half of the year. So, we're making steady progress and we're where we are expected to be at this stage in the year.
I look forward to providing all of you with additional updates as we continue to restore our global momentum in the
months ahead. Thank you for your time this morning and for your continued interest and trust in The Coca-Cola
