MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call.
[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Brian Yoor
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom
Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide his opening remarks begin and our 2013 outlook. Tom will then provide a brief overview of our
fourth quarter and full-year 2012 performance as well as some additional detail on our 2013 outlook and guidance. I
will then provide highlights and guidance for each of our major businesses. Following our comments, Miles, Tom, and
I will take your questions.
Please note that our discussion of 2012 performance will include the results of what is now AbbVie. However, AbbVie
will provide additional highlights and details of their 2012 performance and 2013 outlook on their call next
Wednesday, January 30.
Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2013. Abbott cautions that these
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from
those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other

In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our
website at Abbott.com.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Brian.
Good morning. This morning, I'll review our 2012 results and our outlook for 2013.
Abbott reported another year of strong performance in 2012 and executed on a number key actions that will drive
future growth for the company. And on January 1, we launched AbbVie as an independent Fortune 200
biopharmaceutical company. The creation of AbbVie is a significant event in Abbott's history, and our ability to change
is the reason that Abbott has endured, as evidenced by the fact that in 2013, we also enter our 125th year
well-positioned for future success.
As we announced this morning, we expect to deliver another year of strong performance. We issued ongoing 2013 EPS
guidance of $1.98 to $2.04, representing double-digit growth over 2012.
I'll talk more about the year ahead in just a moment. As Brian mentioned, our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results
are for total Abbott and include the proprietary pharmaceutical business.
So for the full year 2012, Abbott delivered ongoing EPS growth that exceeded our initial guidance range. We also
generated record operating cash flow of more than $9 billion, returning more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form
of dividends. We've increased our dividend payout for 40 consecutive years. Abbott is one of only a handful of
companies to deliver with such consistency.
Since our separation announcement in October of 2011 through the end of last year, Abbott's stock price appreciation
and dividends generated a total shareholder return of nearly 30% compared to the S&P 500 return of somewhat above
19%.
Before I review our business results, I want to spend a few minutes on the longer-term outlook for the company, with
the expectation that Abbott will be one of the largest and fastest-growing diversified healthcare investments. Over the
last several years, we recognized the significant economic and demographic shifts that are changing the healthcare
industry, including the development of healthcare systems and improving economic conditions in emerging economies;
a global population that's growing older and living longer, resulting in an increase in age-related and chronic diseases;
and the increasing focus on the type of innovation that reduces costs for payers in addition to improving outcomes for
patients and delivering value to customers.
Abbott is well positioned to become a leader in this new environment. We're balanced across four business segments:
branded generics, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition. These businesses also provide us with a diverse customer
base and payer mix.
We are more weighted to the growth that's taking place in emerging economies, with the expectation that 50% of our
sales will occur in these faster-growing economies and geographies by 2015.
We hold leadership positions across all of our major businesses. We have many opportunities in our broad-based
pipeline. This includes next-generation diagnostic systems; medical devices in coronary, endovascular, and structural
heart; as well as innovations that are important to our customer-facing businesses in branded generics and nutrition.
These businesses have more rapid R&D cycles focused on brand enhancements, local solutions, and improved

formulations and packaging. And we remain focused on financial discipline and operational execution as we expand
margins and continue to generate very strong cash flow, upwards of $4 billion this year.
Moving on to our 2012 results and outlook for the businesses that comprise the new Abbott, full-year 2012 new Abbott
sales increased mid-single digits operationally, adjusted for the transitional items we've discussed before, the impact of
Promus royalty revenues, and our direct-distribution initiatives in nutrition. Emerging market sales for new Abbott,
which represented nearly 40% of sales, continued to drive growth, increasing double-digits operationally.
As we've discussed over the past year, going forward Abbott will be comprised of four roughly equal-sized businesses,
and I'll provide a brief overview of each.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals Division, or EPD, we're generating international sales from a large and growing
portfolio of hundreds of branded generic pharmaceuticals that have broad use throughout the world. Sixty percent of
EPD sales are in emerging markets, and 40% are in developed markets. While full-year 2012 sales in developed
markets were impacted by austerity measures, sales in emerging markets generated strong growth.
EPD has a number of early-stage geographic and product-expansion initiatives under way, including more than 150
registration approvals and new product launches expected in 2013. As these initiatives generate new growth
opportunities and as faster-growing emerging markets become a larger percentage EPD's sales base, we expect to see
steadily improving growth.
Our Medical Device businesses include Diabetes Care, Vision Care, and Vascular Devices. In Diabetes Care in 2012,
we continued the global rollout of our FreeStyle InsuLinx glucose meter. It's the foundation of our diabetes pipeline
where we're focused on addressing the needs of insulin users. In 2013 we're planning on several new product and
software launches as well as initiating our pivotal clinical trial for our next-generation sensor that we expect to first
bring to the European market by the end of 2014.
In Vision Care, we launched several new products in 2012, primarily in our cataracts business, which now represents
nearly 65% of our Vision Care sales. We've outpaced the growth of the cataract market, driven by double-digit growth
in emerging markets and share gains in the premium intraocular lens segment, led by our TECNIS brand. Cataract
surgery remains the number-one surgical procedure in the world, and it's a market that will continue to grow as the
world's population ages.
And in Vascular Devices, we're seeing this business grow most rapidly outside the United States, where we now have
more than 60% of vascular sales. We launched several important new products last year that solidified our position as
the number-one vascular device company globally. And as we look to 2013, we expect to accelerate growth by first
gaining share with our leading drug-eluting product portfolio. We launched our new XIENCE Xpedition drug-eluding
stent in Europe in August and in the U.S. this month. We expect to launch Xpedition in Japan midyear.
Second, building on the 2012 international launch of ABSORB, the world's first and only bioresorbable vascular
scaffold, which is available now in more than 30 countries, including most recently India. Our pivotal clinical trial for
U.S. approval is also now under way.
Third, accelerating sales of our structural heart device, MitraClip, in international markets. We're planning for an FDA
panel in the first half of this year as we work to bring this important product to the U.S. market.
Fourth, expanding our market share in endovascular, where we're applying our expertise in developing best-in-class
coronary devices to increase our penetration in this faster-growing market.
And finally, driving continued strong growth in emerging markets, where interventional procedures are growing
double-digits and penetration remains low. This geographic segment comprises more than 20% of total vascular sales
and has been growing at a strong double-digit pace. We expect this type of growth in emerging markets to continue in
2013.
Diagnostics had another impressive year in terms of both sales and margin growth. Full-year 2012 operational sales
increased more than 7%, and operating margin approached 19% of sales. We expect another year of strong

performance in 2013. Core laboratory diagnostics delivered 7% operational growth for the full year. 80% of this
division's sales occur outside the United States, with more than 35% of sales in emerging geographies. We are focused
on China, Brazil, and Russia, which combined have grown 30% year to date. China is our largest growth opportunity,
where we've seen increasing demand for industry-leading systems such as ARCHITECT and PRISM, as this country
continues to invest to improve its healthcare system.
Molecular and point-of-care round out our diverse portfolio of Diagnostics offerings. We're growing both businesses as
we increase penetration of systems and tests in the developed world and expand in emerging markets.
We also plan to launch several new instrument platforms across our Diagnostics portfolio over the next several years.
These systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed, scalability, and shorter turnaround
time. Lowering costs is also a major design objective for these programs.
While we'll invest in Diagnostics R&D at a somewhat higher level in 2013 to deliver these future growth opportunities,
we expect continued steady expansion of Diagnostics' operating margin over the year ahead. We remain on track to
well exceed our original target of 20% of sales over the next few years.
And finally, our Nutrition business had a very strong fourth quarter, with worldwide operational sales growth of 10%,
building continued momentum for 2013. Nutrition is the fastest growing business in our portfolio and has the most
opportunity for margin expansion.
In 2012 we had a number of key achievements that continue to position us well for future growth. In the U.S., we saw
strong growth across our key brands, maintaining our leading infant formula share with Similac, and delivering
double-digit growth of both PediaSure and Ensure.
Outside of the U.S., emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of our Nutrition sales, and they grew double
digits for the full year for both pediatric and adult. We've seen outstanding productivity from our R&D organization,
with 80 product launches in 2012. We made good progress on the expansion of global capacity in the U.S., China, and
India. Our three new manufacturing facilities are expected to come online by early next year. And we exceeded our
2012 expectations for operating margin improvement and remain on track for our goal of exceeding 20% of sales by
2015.
So in summary, new Abbott is a diversified, differentiated, large-cap healthcare investment opportunity, well
positioned to deliver top-tier growth. And as we look to the future, we see significant opportunity ahead. We hold
leadership positions across our major businesses and we're delivering customer-focused innovation.
Our portfolio is aligned with favorable demographics that are driving growth in healthcare. We have a large presence in
rapidly growing emerging markets. We're focused on expanding margins across our businesses. And we have strong
cash flow generation, which will provide ample resources for investments in future growth and returns to shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom to review 2012 results and the 2013 outlook in more detail. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles.
Before I review our financial performance, I'd like to explain how we'll handle the transition from pre-separation
Abbott results to post-separation Abbott results. In our remarks today regarding 2012, our results reflect all of the
pre-separation businesses, including the Proprietary Pharmaceutical business. Our 2013 guidance and outlook will
reflect only the new Abbott businesses.
Regarding 2013 comparisons to 2012 for new Abbott, we plan to provide investors with a post-separation baseline of
the quarterly income statement on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations prior to our first
quarter earnings release in April. This will be for 2012. In order to provide this information, we must first complete in
the coming weeks the so-called audited carve-out AbbVie results from Abbott's combined fourth quarter results.

So while we don't have the final 2012 baseline established as of today's call, we understand that investors are looking
for perspective on 2013 growth rate on both the top and bottom lines. With that in mind, today we'll provide you with
our projections of full-year sales and ongoing earnings per share growth in 2013 over an estimated 2012 baseline.
Please keep in mind that the growth rates against the actual 2000 (sic) [2012] (15:30) baseline may change somewhat
once the final 2012 carve-out is completed.
So let's move on to our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results for the total company. We're very pleased with how we
ended 2012, as we exceeded our initial expectations for ongoing earnings per share for the full year. For the fourth
quarter we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.51, in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the
quarter increased 5.6% on an operational basis and 4.4% on a reported basis; that is including an unfavorable 1.2%
impact from foreign exchange. These results are in line with the expectations we provided on our third quarter call.
We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, particularly, as Miles mentioned, in those businesses that will
comprise new Abbott, with these sales growing double digits on an operational basis in the quarter. As we discussed in
previous quarters, sales growth trends for new Abbott businesses have been affected by two factors that are transitional
in nature; first, the phase-out of Promus royalty revenues and our vascular business. This impacted year-over-year sales
growth in 2012 and continues into the first quarter of 2013 for Japan sales; and second, the shift to direct distribution in
certain markets in our international Nutrition business. Adjusting for these transitional factors, new Abbott operational
sales growth would have been in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter and the full year 2012.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio for the total company was 63.3%, in line with expectations, including a
negative exchange effect of 130 basis points. Recall from our third quarter call the we expected the trend of favorable
foreign exchange impact on the gross margin ratio that we had seen through nine months to reverse in the fourth quarter
and continue into 2013. This is what's occurring, as we anticipated. Excluding the impact of exchange, our underlying
ongoing gross margin ratio improved by around 80 basis points.
Overall, as we look at 2012, we delivered strong ongoing earnings per share growth despite a challenging environment
and a foreign exchange headwind on sales of almost 3%. We generated record full-year operating cash flow of more
than $9 billion in 2012, exceeding our initial expectations and our forecast for the fourth quarter, and we delivered
these results while we successfully launched AbbVie.
Looking ahead to 2013, as of January 1 Abbott and AbbVie began operating as independent companies. As indicated,
while my remarks for 2012 were for the entire pre-separation results of legacy Abbott, the guidance I'll now provide
reflects the outlook only for new Abbott. The AbbVie management team will discuss its outlook on a separate
conference call next week.
Today we issued full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04. As previously discussed, our
non-GAAP ongoing EPS metric going forward excludes the impact of intangible amortization expense, forecasted at
$0.40 per share in 2013, as well as other specified items discussed in our earnings news release. We believe this metric
provides a meaningful measurement for assessing Abbott's earnings power and growth. The midpoint of our guidance
range represents double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth based on our estimated 2012 ongoing EPS baseline.
Sales for those businesses comprising new Abbott approached $21.5 billion in 2012. Consistent with financial profile
expectations we communicated on our third quarter call, we expect 2013 full-year operational sales growth; that is,
excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the mid to high single digits. While the impact of exchange varies across
our businesses, based on current exchange rates we would expect exchange to have a slightly negative impact overall
on our full-year reported sales. Brian will review our growth outlook by business in a few minutes.
From a geographic perspective, we expect continued double-digit full-year operational sales growth in emerging
markets for 2013. As we've discussed before, approximately 70% of Abbott sales are generated outside of the U.S., and
approximately 40% of sales are in emerging markets, which we expect to continue increasing as a percent of Abbott's
total sales over time. We're forecasting a full-year ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio, again excluding intangible
amortization expense, of approximately 55%, consistent with the modeling guidance provided on the third quarter call.
We're forecasting continued investments in R&D to drive long-term growth in 2013 and beyond, with full-year ongoing

R&D of 6% to 7% of sales.
We forecast ongoing SG&A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year 2013. We expect this ratio to
decline as we progress through the quarters this year, and it reflects meaningful leverage over the 2012 estimated
baseline. I'd note that SG&A includes the estimated impact from the Medical Device Tax under the U.S. Affordable
Care Act that begins in 2013.
Overall, we expect to expand our full-year ongoing operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013. We're
forecasting net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013; non-operating income of approximately $20 million,
and around $50 million of expense in the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L. We're projecting the full-year tax rate in
2013 at around 21%, which now includes the 2013 U.S. R&D tax credit enacted into law January 2.
As we move into the post-separation period, 2013 will also be the first year we report quarterly results for new Abbott.
Certain items that span both 2013 and 2012 are expected to affect quarterly comparisons to the 2012 baseline. These
include: the impact of exchange rates on sales and margin between the years; the wind-down of Promus revenues in
Japan in the first quarter of 2013; and non-operating income recorded in 2012. We expect these anomalies to result in
less ongoing earnings per share growth in the first half of the year and more in the second. However, after adjusting for
these items, the underlying earnings growth for new Abbott each quarter is forecasted to be strong and more in line
with our full-year outlook for double-digit ongoing EPS growth. Today and as we progress through the year where it's
significant, we will communicate in advance these types of items that would affect upcoming quarterly earnings
comparisons to 2012.
So specifically with regard to the first quarter of 2013, today we're providing ongoing EPS guidance; that is, before
specified items, of $0.40 to $0.42 per share. We forecast specified items of approximately $0.17 in the first quarter,
reflecting intangible amortization expense, separation costs, and cost reduction programs. Our operational sales growth
in the first quarter is expected to be low to mid-single digits off a 2012 baseline, approaching $5.3 billion. At current
exchange rates, the first quarter is our most difficult sales comparison with almost 1.5% negative impact from
exchange, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits. We expect the last quarter of the
wind-down of Promus in Japan be a sales headwind of somewhat less than 1% in the first quarter.
We're forecasting an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio, again excluding intangible amortization expense, that
approaches 55% in the first quarter, ongoing R&D at around 7% of sales, and ongoing SG&A expense of a little over
32% of sales.
Finally, I'd note that we had around $40 million of non-operating income in the first quarter of 2012 related to a
contractual settlement, which is non-recurring in 2013.
At this time, we'd also like to provide an early view of the ongoing P&L profile of the business as we see it in the
second quarter of 2013. At this time, we forecast operational sales growth in the second quarter in the mid to upper
single digits off a 2012 baseline of around $5.3 billion. We currently expect the second quarter gross margin to be
negatively impacted by year-over-year effects of exchange. So at this point, we forecast the adjusted ongoing gross
margin ratio at around 54.5% of sales in the second quarter. We forecast ongoing R&D expense at around 6.5% and
ongoing SG&A expense falling below 32% of sales in the second quarter of 2013.
So in summary, we delivered strong ongoing earnings per share growth in 2012 which exceeded our initial forecast
while at the same time executing the steps necessary to launch AbbVie as an independent company. Our 2013 outlook
for Abbott reflects strong performance of the top line and double-digit ongoing EPS growth as we continue to build
Abbott to be a top-tier performer in the years ahead.
With that, let's turn to the business operating highlights. Brian?

This morning I'll provide a brief overview of fourth quarter and full-year 2012 performance for each of our major
businesses that comprise the new Abbott. I'll also review our 2013 sales outlook by business. My comments will focus
primarily on operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
I'll start with our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, where sales in the fourth quarter and the full year
increased in the low single digits on an operational basis. Full-year 2012 sales in the emerging markets grew high
single digits on an operational basis, with the BRIC and key emerging markets growing mid-teens. This growth was
largely offset by mid-single-digit declines in developed markets, where austerity measures impacted performance.
In 2013 we expect to accelerate operational sales growth from the low single digits into the mid-single digits by
executing on a number of product and geographic expansion initiatives. We're also moving a large number of
registrations through our pipeline and regulatory approval process. This includes: increasing the breadth of our product
offerings by launching new and improved formulations of our current trusted brands, such as Creon and Brufen as well
as launching new progress such as Amitiza, which we recently launched in Japan; expanding geographically, including
registrations of numerous products across multiple geographies such as Central and Eastern Europe and Africa; and
accelerating and capturing new sources of growth through select licensing agreements. Through our agreement with
Nobel in Turkey, we're expanding our cardiometabolic offering, and through our agreement with Zydus, we're
launching new products into key Eastern European markets.
We expect to deliver double-digit growth in the emerging markets in 2013, growing faster than the market in many key
countries where we have strong positions. We're particularly focused on the BRIC markets as well as several additional
key emerging markets. We expect our total emerging market sales base to increase to approximately 65% of total EPD
sales in 2013, up from 60% of EPD today.
So for the full year 2013 in EPD, we expect mid-single-digit operational sales growth, with continued strong bottom
line performance. At current exchange rates, this business would be relatively more impacted by exchange in 2013, so
we'd expect full-year reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits.
For the first quarter of 2013, we expect low single digit operational growth, with higher sales growth in the second half
of 2013. Including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect a low single-digit decline in EPD sales in the first
quarter.
Moving on to Medical Devices, in Diabetes Care global sales in the fourth quarter increased more than 4% on an
operational basis. In the U.S. in the retail segment of the market, we continued to grow faster than our competition and
moved into the number two market position during 2012. Outside the U.S., sales growth was driven by share gains in
key emerging markets and continued uptake of our FreeStyle InsuLinx meter.
Looking ahead to 2013, we expect sales to be relatively flat on an operational and reported basis. While we expect
continued growth in key emerging markets, the 2013 implementation of CMS competitive bidding for Medicare
patients will impact sales in the U.S.
In Vision Care, global operational sales increased in the low single digits for the fourth quarter and the full year. While
our LASIK business continues to be affected by economic conditions, we've seen a steady acceleration in the growth of
our cataract business, which now represents nearly 65% of our global Vision Care sales. We also saw continued strong
double-digit cataract growth in emerging markets, including strong performance in India and China. For 2013 we
expect low single-digit operational and reported sales growth in our Vision Care business, driven by continued growth
in cataract sales and continued emerging market expansion.
In our Vascular business, adjusted for the impact of non-commercial revenues, including Promus, full-year worldwide
vascular sales increased 3.5% on an operational basis. As a reminder, while the impact from the U.S. Promus transition
was completed last year, the impact from the Japan Promus transition will continue into the first quarter of 2013.
Global sales in the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted for the impact of non-commercial revenues and foreign exchange,
increased modestly. International sales, which comprise more than 60% of total vascular sales, increased 8%
operationally. This was primarily offset by the expected decline in U.S. XIENCE sales, reflecting drug-eluding stent
market dynamics as well as a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011, when XIENCE PRIME was launched

in the U.S. market.
International sales represent nearly 70% of our drug-eluding coronary product portfolio, which now includes both our
market-leading XIENCE stents as well as our new bioresorbable vascular scaffold [BVS], ABSORB. International DES
[Drug-Eluting Stent] sales increased nearly 13% on an operational basis in the quarter. We expect to increase market
share in 2013 with the continued global launch of our new, more deliverable XIENCE Xpedition drug-eluding stent and
our BVS, ABSORB. Since our launch of both new products last year in Europe, we've seen meaningful share gains,
solidifying our deliverability advantage with Xpedition and establishing a new path forward in this market with
ABSORB.
In Endovascular, sales increased in the low single digits in the fourth quarter and on an operational basis, including
continued strong growth internationally. In Structural Heart, MitraClip, which is our first-in-class treatment for mitral
regurgitation, continues to see strong demand outside the United States, with sales of nearly $30 million in the fourth
quarter. We've nearly doubled our 2012 sales over 2011 and plan to nearly double sales again in 2013. Starting this
month, MitraClip will receive formal reimbursement coverage in Germany, which is where the majority of MitraClip
procedures occur today.
Looking ahead to 2013, we expect low to mid-single-digit operational and reported sales growth for our Vascular
business, driven by several new product launches as well as continued strong growth internationally, particularly in
emerging markets. For the first quarter of 2013, including the impact from the wind down of the Promus transition in
Japan and foreign exchange, we expect reported sales to decline in the low single digits. Adjusting for both of these
items, we expect first quarter sales to increase in low single digits.
Moving on to Diagnostics, in core lab diagnostics, operational sales increased nearly 6% for the fourth quarter and 7%
for the full year. As Miles mentioned, emerging market sales represent 35% of total sales, an increase in the mid-teens
for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect emerging markets to represent more than 40% of Core
Laboratory Diagnostics sales in the next several years.
In addition to delivering strong sales growth, we are also delivering on our pipeline. We recently launched two new
tests on our ARCHITECT platform that continue to broaden our menu and differentiate us from the competition. In the
coming months, we're also launching a next-generation automation solution to improve efficiencies in the lab.
In point-of-care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased more than 14% on an operational basis. And in molecular
diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 5% on an operational basis for the fourth quarter. For 2013, we expect our
worldwide Diagnostics businesses, including core laboratory diagnostics, point-of-care, and molecular, to generate mid
to high single-digit operational and reported sales growth with double-digit growth in both point-of-care and molecular
diagnostics.
And finally, in our Nutritionals business, global sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter on an operational basis,
driven by high single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally. In the U.S., pediatric sales
increased more than 8% during the quarter, including strong double-digit growth of both our PediaSure and Pedialyte
toddler brands. U.S. adult sales also increased double digits, driven by continued strong growth of Ensure, where we've
continued to launch new innovations to drive sustainable growth.
Outside of the U.S., pediatric sales increased 14% on an operational basis in the quarter. We launched several new
products in the fourth quarter in key global markets, including the continued rollout of our Similac Total Comfort
infant formula brand as well as other specialty toddler products. Adult Nutritional sales increased mid-single digits,
driven by continued strong growth of both Ensure and Glucerna.
We also made significant progress during the year on our margin expansion initiative in Nutrition, where for the full
year 2012 our operating margin improved nearly 250 basis points over 2011. Key drivers of improvement in this
division remain focused on driving down manufacturing costs, reducing freight and distribution costs, focusing our
products and geographies on profitable growth, and optimizing our supply chains.

So as we look ahead to 2013 for our global Nutrition business, we're forecasting sales to approach double-digit growth
on an operational and reported basis. This includes low to mid-single-digit growth in our U.S. business and double-digit
growth in our international business.
So in summary, in 2012 we completed our planned separation into two leading global healthcare companies and
demonstrated strength through our financial performance. As we move into 2013, Abbott is well positioned to deliver
durable top-tier growth as a diversified healthcare company, one with a broad and balanced portfolio of leadership
businesses that are aligned with favorable demographic and healthcare trends.
We will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Can you hear me okay?
Operator
Mike, your line is open. Thank you.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks, sorry. I have a bunch of questions. Let me start with, can you just spend a
minute on the spread between GAAP and cash guidance for 2013? It's obviously more than the amortization expense.
So are you just assuming certain charges that will run through over the course of the year, and that's why the GAAP
numbers are off?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes, two basic things happen beyond amortization. There's a little bit of post-separation
I'd call it residual separation costs, and there are some previously announced actions we took in areas of cost reduction,
particularly in areas that impact manufacturing, that do carry over into 2013. So that's the difference.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And then can you – two questions. One, do you have, Tom, a new Abbott EPS
number at this point for 2012? And then second, can you aggregate up all the divisional revenue guidance to what your
organic revenue guidance is and reported revenue guidance for 2013 for the total company?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: On the second point, we provided mid to upper overall operational growth as guidance
for 2013. And if you were to go through all the details that Brian outlined in his remarks, those details will build up to
that type of growth. So I think you'll find that certainly this all hangs together.
With regard to the 2012 baseline, as I spent a few minutes on my remarks, we need to provide investors, and we plan to
do so before the first quarter call, with the adjusted 2012 effectively continuing operations baseline for new Abbott. As
I indicated in my remarks, we can't really do that until we've completed this carve-out work which we still need to
complete the fourth quarter, which we're going to do in the coming weeks. And once we do that, we will be able to
provide you a detailed quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP reconciled P&L baseline, if you will. But of course, we have
done some modeling. And as we model it and based upon this guidance range and if you take the middle of this
ongoing guidance range we've provided, that would be double-digit growth plus – over what we believe the 2012
baseline will come in at.
So I think things are very consistent with what we've been saying, and it's just going to take us a little bit of time to
come up with the precise numbers. Among the challenges we'll have when we present that is just effectively
normalizing capital structure between the years. As you know, when we look at the carve-out of AbbVie, AbbVie did
not have debt in the carve-out. They do have debt going forward. Abbott will have less debt than what we've had
historically in the implied carve-out of the Abbott side. So there will be some adjustments in those areas where we will

build a 2012 baseline that's meaningful relative to how we're growing the business in 2013. Hopefully that answers
your question.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Yes. And then maybe Miles wants to jump in on this last one. But EPD is probably the
business that people probably have the least amount of visibility into and probably the least amount of conviction in
terms of sustainability of mid to high single-digit growth, which you guys have talked about. Can you just talk a little
bit about the strategy to accelerate growth off of what looks to be a subpar year in 2012?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, I think you're right. I think people do lack a certain understanding or visibility to the
business, Mike, and I think it comes from two major dimensions. One is there's a lot less – call it publicly available
sources of data for a lot of the countries that make up this business, at least for analysts and investors to have an
independent look at. And there are a lot of countries here, as you know. But I think the first thing is the absence of that.
The second is this is a business that's a segment business. Meaning there's a proprietary pharma business in a lot of
countries. There's a commodity-generic business in a lot of countries, and there's a branded-generic business. And
they're all three different. They're different.
And this branded-generic business is quite large, and much more like our Nutrition business. It's very consumer-facing
and a lot more like that in terms of consumer choice, consumer pay, et cetera. And that's why some of the lack of
complete understanding and so on.
The business, however, is quite attractive. It's very profitable. It's quite attractive. It's growing very nicely. But it's a
story of really two geographies and maybe two market segments. 60% of the business now is in what we will
characterize as emerging or growth markets, and 40% of it's in developed markets. And those developed markets, as
you know, have been under a fair amount of austerity pressure.
So if I were going to divvy it up, we've got a tale of two different segments here. The BRIC countries and the other
emerging markets and so forth, depending on which markets, are either growing very high single-digits or mid-teens
double-digits, et cetera, on the sales line. And so the emerging markets collectively growing double-digit is very
healthy.
But Europe in particular is experiencing the kind of austerity pressure and pricing and utilization that it's experiencing
for many products, even outside of healthcare. And so the developed markets have been down in the last quarters
mid-single digit. So two steps forward, one step back for a while here.
So there are a couple of things that will evolve that will drive EPD's growth. We believe very strongly in the growth in
the various emerging markets. That will be driven by the launch of new products, of which there are many this year.
And new registrations. So the expansion of our product lines and the launch of new or improved products that have
significant potential in these markets.
So that will drive some of it. We're still rolling out geographic expansion. That will drive some growth. And then we've
got good momentum in a number of these markets. So I think certainly on the emerging side, it's all going I'd say pretty
much according to what we would expect.
The European piece or developed market piece – but in effect, we're talking about Europe – I'd say if that can stabilize
– and that's getting an awful lot of attention from us from a stability standpoint – that would help. If you can stem the
bleeding in Europe, that would be a tremendous plus.
It is a profitable business. It is a cash-generating business. But from a growth – when you meld the two together, the
appearance of growth appears to be diluted, of course, as you point out. And what we've got to do is, I think, break out
on an ongoing basis here and communicate for investors, so they can see both pieces, because they're really two
different tales.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: That's helpful. Thanks, Miles. We'll let some others jump in.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Maybe one quick question for Tom and then for Miles.
Tom, when we think about the first half of the year where you gave much better visibility, if we think about the
acceleration from first to second quarter, I think it sets up nicely for the acceleration story for the whole year. So I
wanted to come back to the first half of the year.
I think if you think about the first quarter to second quarter, is it really two components? First, the headwinds are
fading, which are largely Vascular, as well as the Nutritional distribution. That gets you from low-singles to mid.
I guess what I'm really asking is to get from mid to that upper-end or upper-single-digit part of the guidance, what are
some of the key growth drivers that get you from mid to high? And if you could just confirm that to get from low to
mid, it's more the Vascular and Nutritional distribution.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: There are a lot of things going on.
As I'd remind you from my remarks, the first quarter – and really you'll be looking at dollars in the end – the first
quarter is the one quarter where we're still getting a pretty tough exchange comparison of around 1.5 points on the top
line, so that's certainly part.
You're correct that this lapping of the Japan piece is probably the biggest anomaly. The second after that is the direct
distribution getting better as we go through the quarters throughout the year.
And just frankly, a lot of the execution we are expecting across these businesses, in businesses such as EPD. And really
the momentum we're starting to see as Nutrition exits 2012 is what's going to continue to build throughout the year. So
I think it's a matter of building momentum.
And vascular, we shouldn't dismiss the potential second half benefits of ABSORB and MitraClip doing better in
Europe. The Xpedition benefits we think we're going to get in the market. Vascular, we're expecting to see a nice
pickup in momentum as we move from the first quarter on through the year.
So there are a number of elements of it. Just to remind – and I want to be sure from your question that it's clear to
investors – our full-year estimated growth over the baseline is mid to upper single-digits growth. So I think that level of
growth across the quarters, with maybe a little bit better in the back and, as we said, a little bit softer the first quarter, is
the way to think about the year.
So I think there are a lot of things going on that are going to accelerate the growth, and we feel confident about that.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great, that's very clear, Tom. And then, Miles, maybe more of a strategic question. You've
been very clear about the growth objectives and the growth potential of new Abbott. If you think about capital
allocation, what should investors be prepared for over the next couple years?
You have a dividend, an extremely clean balance sheet that's likely to get cleaner by the end of the year. And then the
first two years of the development of the new Abbott growth story – is this more dividend/share repurchase, or is this
more dividend with selective M&A? What should investors be prepared for over the next couple years as it relates to
capital deployment?
<A - Miles D. White>: I think we've been clear that there's a certain level of dividend and share repurchase that
investors have come to expect from us on a relatively reliable, steady, even growing basis.
We've not been one to do big spikes of share repurchase, et cetera, to – we believe more in a steady return to
shareholders over time. And I think that it's important that we live to that steady and reliable return-to-shareholder
identity.

I got some feedback from investors in the fall, both positive and more positive, I guess, about dividends. People like the
reliability of income, but they always want more income. And the payout ratios between the two companies now in the
split are different. They're, combined, greater than what Abbott paid up through the end of last year on a percent of EPS
basis. But AbbVie pays proportionately higher as a percentage of EPS. We now pay proportionately lower as a
percentage of EPS, but both are growing dividends.
And I got feedback from some thoughtful investors about that. And I always listen to investors. But I'd say at this point,
we've communicated at least an opening philosophy of the dividend payout. But frankly, could that change with time?
It could, but I would tell you, if it changes, it's likely to increase, not do anything else. Because we actually believe in a
cash return to our investors in a dividend-like fashion.
Now buried in your question there was that secret little "What about M&A?" thing. And we've had a track record in the
past of occasionally adding pieces to our business when it made the most economic sense for us, et cetera. And while
that hasn't been an area of high focus in the last one to two years, that has been largely because I don't think there has
been as much that was attractive to us, and we were consumed with the work required to split the companies.
As I communicated with a lot of our investors in the fall, we're always paying attention and tracking what might make
sense. But my criteria are always the same. It strategically has to fit what we're doing, where were headed, what we're
trying to accomplish, and so forth. And it's got to make economic sense. It's got a make economic sense, deal sense for
us. It's got to make economic and deal sense for our investors. And I'd say our track record is such – we've been pretty
thoughtful and pretty careful about that. Been fairly selective, et cetera.
I don't rule it out, but I would tell you that the projections that we have right now for the business going forward for
2013 and beyond don't require it. We don't have some gap in their where we're projecting returns or projecting growth
that we don't know that we can deliver with what we already have.
So I look at the M&A opportunities or licensing opportunities as opportunistic. And if you ask me are there some of
those on the radar screen, I'd say yes. And I communicated that the categories that have attraction for us tend to be in
device areas or some geographic expansion, perhaps in some selective categories of pharma, et cetera, that we've
communicated. But they are fairly defined. They're not real broad.
And beyond that, I almost never project what we're going to be interested in or what we're watching or what we're
doing, for all the competitive reasons that you can imagine. The press seems to do a pretty good job of speculating on
just about everything that comes to market that Abbott might be interested. And more often than not, we aren't. We've
got in our own minds what we know will fit well with our business. I suppose it makes for great media to speculate
from time to time.
But in any case, we like to some of our powder dry so that we're prepared if a good opportunity comes along. We like
to keep some liquidity in our hands, and we don't like to let too much liquidity sit in our hands and earn little. So we
keep a balance of dividend in there, and frankly, if we accumulate a lot of cash and we just don't seem to be finding
opportunities for it, then we buy back shares and give it back to investors.
I know that's a long-winded answer, but that's really it.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Actually, Miles and Tom, very clear. Thank you very much.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thank you, David.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. As I look across a number of
the businesses in the fourth quarter, there was a nice acceleration versus a slowing in Q3. I guess most specifically, I'd
point out nutritionals, molecular, diagnostics, diabetes, and medical optics. Can you maybe talk about some of the

dynamics underpinning that uptick in growth?
And I guess the reason I ask that is a lot of the guidance that you're providing for certain segments also does point to
growth improving throughout the course of 2013. So maybe you could just provide some perspective as to the year-end
turnaround. And then what are the drivers to allow that to continue and hit the numbers that you're putting out there?
<A - Miles D. White>: David, I'll take a little crack at framing this, and then I'll let Tom and Brian chime in here.
I'd say first of all, while we like nice, sequential-smooth quarters, the world doesn't actually provide us that. The world
doesn't act in smooth fashion. And our third quarter tends to always be – I guess I'd say the slowest of the four of the
year because of obvious seasonal impacts and so forth. Whether it's exchange or any of the temporal events that Tom
talked about earlier during the course of the year, that obviously has some impact, too.
Over the course of the year, there were a number of programs or projects that we undertook that you'd begin to see the
fruition come to you in the latter part of the year to jump-start 2013. So I'd say a lot of that is at play here. And some of
it's just plain-old economy in some places or the launch of products taking hold.
As we look at 2013, Tom indicated we're still lapping some of the one-time events of the early part of year, particularly
exchange. And so even 2013 won't look particularly beautiful in terms of smoothness. It will look like a tale of two
halves. A slower first half and a much more robust second half.
And that's not really a hockey stick in there as much is it's comparisons. The underlying, true growth of the business is
nice and solid. And the launch and timing of products and so forth, solid. So one of our challenges for the year is giving
you good visibility to that quarterly gating and what underlying momentum is.
And Mike called it out earlier. There's a need, I think, too, for analysts and investors to know what the baseline is
they're comparing to. And so we've got to be able to give you here – I'd say by the end of first quarter or in the first
quarter call – what the quarterly breakdown is of Abbott separated from AbbVie, which this carve out-completion will
give us. And then we'll be able to more precisely show you – here's the underlying momentum, here are those one-time
or bigger offsets like exchange that swing so much.
And then I think underneath that, you'll see – we've got a breakdown, as I said when I was answering Mike's question,
about the branded-generics business – you've got to look at the components. You've got to look at the emerging
markets piece. You've got to look at the European piece. And we can show you that separately so that you can see what
parts of the business are truly driving growth and where we've got our challenges with austerity measures and so forth.
So I think all of that plays in. We've got to sort it out for you. Because as we know going forward, this is not a business
where we're tracking HUMIRA and everything else. We've got to give you some insight into all the individual pieces. I
would say the underlying growth of the businesses, as we say, is significant and promising, and we think it's
mid-to-high-single. And there are some events that happen over the course of the year, including product launches and
so forth, that drive us toward that higher single that we want to see.
Brian and Tom, do you guys want to add to that?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes. David, I think Brian will just cover a couple of the businesses you talked about,
where the momentum did pick up in the quarter and give you a little more color on that. Why don't you go ahead,
Brian?
<A - Brian Yoor>: Hi, David. Let me start with Nutritionals. As you saw in the quarter, we performed at double digits.
We were up double digits year over year. And we had strong performance both in the U.S. as well as our international
business.
We've been seeing strong performance out of the U.S. all year. In this quarter, we saw particularly continued strong
performance from our up-age toddler brands, and we have PediaSure and Pedialyte there that have been performing
double-digits. PediaSure most notably consistently throughout the year. We also maintained, as you know, the share
leadership there in the U.S. market as far as our infant-formula market, where we have a commanding share lead.

As we move into 2013, this may moderate a little bit. We're up against a market in infant formula that's relatively flat.
However, we have a lot of momentum from our PediaSure and Pedialyte that will continue into next year that will help
offset that.
Also, we have – on our adult business has been growing very strong. It has been growing double-digits in the Ensure
business for the U.S. And a lot of this comes from new product launches. We've launched a lot of products across our
Ensure line, most notably Ensure Complete. And we're seeing that these innovations matter. And as Miles mentioned,
we had 80 product launches this year across Nutrition, so that has been a real differentiator for our portfolio.
If you switch over to international and you take out what we have been talking about – these headwinds on the
distribution as we change how we distribute to our end customer – we have been growing double-digits in our Nutrition
business. This quarter, we didn't have any headwinds from the distribution programs that we were working through.
And what you're seeing is now the results coming through on a pure basis.
We have very nice momentum in China, where sequentially we're gaining share, and we continue to plan to do so, as
well, into next year. And then if you take a lot of the key emerging markets in Nutrition, we're growing double-digits
and consistently have been.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up to that, and maybe, Miles, you could help me
think through this. Just on a longer-term basis as we think conceptually about the growth rate of the business and the
top line that it's a combination of emerging markets [EM] growth driven by strengthening of those economies, lab
build-out, higher healthcare consumption. And what drives the acceleration and the overall top line is really EM
becoming a larger percentage of total and the higher growth segments like Nutritionals starting to comprise a bigger
part of the business; and then a backstop on that, new product launches in things like vascular and medical optics and
diabetes to help to at least keep those businesses stable. Is that a fair way to think about the long-term growth rate?
<A - Miles D. White>: I think about the long-term growth rate a couple of ways. First of all, you're right. The
emerging markets have their own tailwinds, their own wave, if you will. And in those markets I want a bigger
surfboard to ride that wave. And I think that's a question of expanding product lines, whether it's registrations in the
Pharmaceutical business or more product innovations in the Nutrition business or taking our Device businesses more
thoroughly into those markets, which we're doing. We're seeing great opportunity for all of them as those economies
and those healthcare systems develop. And as the sophistication of medicine practice there expand, we're seeing the
impact of that on Diagnostics. We're seeing it in our Coronary business. We're seeing it in our Medical Optics business.
They're all benefiting from that, and the Abbott presence there and the Abbott brand there is actually a big boost to that.
I would tell you that I recall a consultant telling me about five years ago that there was no point in diagnostics being in
China. Five years later, I'm glad we ignored that. It's a fantastic market for us. We fit well there. It's great growth and
great profitability on top of it, so we're in a nice position there. So those markets that have their own tailwind of
expansion and growth are great, and it still behooves us to expand and tailor our product lines and so forth to those
markets, which we're doing.
Developed markets are still of very high importance and interest us. And I think that to be forthright about it, it's a little
different story. You're not relying on tailwind of growth. You have to take share, and you have to do it by
demonstrating to the payer and/or the customer that your value or your cost position relative to what you deliver is
valuable and worth it. And hence, our offerings in Diagnostics, we'll pay a lot of attention to that going forward. I think
we've got great opportunity in Diagnostics in these markets and core diagnostics that I think our business today is
demonstrating already with its high single-digit growth rate, mid to high single-digit growth rate in Europe and other
developed countries and economies. So what we know is in our next-generation products and systems, they need to be
even more cost effective for us to have a good value proposition in those markets on a sustainable basis. So I think the
developed markets are still awfully attractive to us.
I think the Nutrition business has shown that even in markets where birth rates are declining, we're taking share. The
U.S. stands as just a prime example. And we can grow and expand and create an adult nutrition market because we can
show that it's got merit and value. And in a lot of cases, we're putting the clinical evidence behind our products to show

that. So there are opportunities.
Our EPD business, as you know, will struggle for a while in developed markets, and we're looking at all the ways that
we might staunch that. But I think – and in our Devices, I'd say, as has been pointed out many times by those people
who follow the device markets, particularly the coronary device markets or vascular device markets, this is no longer a
market where you just bring a new innovation out or a new technology, price it higher and the market expands to
absorb the cost. Today, whether it's countries in Europe or hospitals in the United States or anywhere, they've got a
fixed budget. They've only got so much to spend. And they're trying to make that fixed amount of money cover as
much innovation as they can. And I think that means that companies like us change our strategy. We've got probably
the most thorough and powerful product line top to bottom in the stent category, and our job is to take share out of a
fixed revenue pool, fixed profit pool out there, and I'd say that probably forecasts a change to our strategy. And we
think we've got the wherewithal to alter that strategy and take share and grow in our business and actually achieve the
returns for the innovation we've invested in.
So I think those developed markets are ones where competition is such that you've got to take share. And in the
emerging markets, you're going to ride a wave of tailwind of growth. From our perspective, we think that the leadership
positions we have in each of our businesses, the product lines we offer, and the things that we have on the board for our
pipeline are all well defined and well designed for exactly that, and that we'll see lower growth rates out of developed
markets, higher growth rates out of emerging markets, and what I would characterize as very durable growth on an
ongoing basis.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. And I just need one real quick one. Since you didn't put the numbers out on HUMIRA,
any perspective you can provide on inventory build or price versus volume growth in the quarter? This looks like a
pretty good number there.
<A - Miles D. White>: I can tell you that Rick Gonzalez won't want me answering any of his questions. So I'm going
to leave you for him next week to ask him about HUMIRA because I now live in a no-HUMIRA world.
<Q - David H. Roman>: I had to try. Thank you very much for the perspective and detail.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the U.S. Nutritionals business and
specifically the adult segment. The growth there was pretty robust. I know you've provided guidance for the U.S.
Nutritionals business overall, but maybe talk about what we can really anticipate over a longer period of time for the
U.S. adult business and what opportunities you see there. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, as Brian indicated when he answered the question a bit earlier, even though the infant side
of this market is a little tougher because of birth rates and the like, we've just had outstanding brand execution on
PediaSure and Ensure and a number of our brands really across the portfolio. And it does come down to innovation.
When we can bring out a differentiated product that delivers value for customers, we're finding we can take share in the
various markets. And I think the team did a truly outstanding job of that in 2012.
For 2013, we have a little bit lower growth expectation in that business and, to the contrary, a little bit higher growth
expectation on the international side; so overall, higher growth for the Nutrition business overall. And really, it's just
continued brand execution and more or less offsetting a flattish infant market that we've been experiencing. That's an
area where clearly we'd like to continue to take share and gain some growth, and the team is focused on that. So I think
in the U.S., more of a mid to upper sustainable growth rate is probably more in the range, but I think that team aspires
to push towards upper single growth, and that's what we'll continue to target longer term as we build this business.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks. And this follows on to Mike's question earlier. But getting to EPD and the
performance in Western Europe in a little bit more detail, you talked about perhaps taking some measures to improve

the performance there in Western Europe with respect to EPD. Could you go into a little bit more detail as to what your
options are to change the trajectory there? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: As we've talked about before on EPD, this team is really moving into its full execution
mode after coming together from disparate businesses. A lot of focus on commercial execution in this market, and then
there has been some cost management as well on this side, so we're trying to be sure that the costs are in line with the
revenue opportunities, and I'd say those are the two key things. We're open to product opportunities coming out of the
various product pipelines, including areas like the collaborations we've had, et cetera. To the extent we can bring those
to the market, that should offset some of the austerity measures.
The last thing I'd say is while the last 12 to 18 months have been tough from an austerity perspective, as we exit 2012
and as we go into 2013, I think we are seeing a bit of stabilization there, and I think the comps in the second half of the
year relative to the austerity measures should be better. And hopefully the government won't be quite as aggressive as
we go forward as they have been as they've gone through this very, very difficult period the last couple years.
<A - Miles D. White>: The irony of Europe is depending on the country that sometimes the price pressure is greater on
the generic or branded generic products than the innovative products. It depends on the country because they do protect
innovation and they do protect the patented products. But once of course it's off patent, then it's a different story. But I
think we have felt a fair amount of pressure there. And to some degree, the impact on the business is a lot less than
probably what it could have been. And I think that the innovations that we put into our products, improvements in our
products, expansion of the registrations and products on the shelf, or adding new products, all of that helps. And it's
hard to be specific with you in detail because it depends locally on each market, each country and the mix of product in
that country, and the I'd say scale that we are on the shelf in that country. But I think Tom has answered it. It's one that
we're paying a lot of attention to. And in the meantime, while we deal with the headwinds of Europe, we try to manage
cost and expense very tightly.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi, good morning; two questions, one for Tom. I wonder if you can help us with the
quarterly earnings split for the year. You've given us guidance for 1Q of $0.40 to $0.42. Should we assume 2Q is in
that range, and then 4Q we get a big hockey stick with EPS north of $0.60? And then any commentary on share count
and share repurchase? And then I had a follow-up on Nutritionals.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I'll say just a few things. First of all, when you look at the baseline of the new Abbott
businesses, the patterning we're seeing in 2012, there are couple anomalies as I talked about in my remarks. But overall
in general, and it has been this way in this company for a number of years with or without the Pharmaceutical business,
that the second half is generally a more profitable year. Growth is driven harder. It generally is stronger, and margins
are a little bit better as we're leveraging that expense base. So I don't think the patterning you're going to see here is that
much different than what you really have seen at Abbott over the years, and it's just a function of the business and, as
Miles mentioned for example, some of the seasonality factors. So I think that's one piece of it.
And then when you're talking about the second quarter, I think the best thing to do is just to take the profile information
I provided in my remarks, and that should give you a good sense of at least this point where we see the quarter coming
out. Obviously, when we get into the first quarter call, we'll provide more specific guidance range. But the intention of
trying to give you an early look at the second quarter was to help you build that quarterly gating before we get this final
baseline out in front of you. So I think it's – and as I said my remarks, when you cut through the anomalies, you're
going to find that the year-over-year growth quarter to quarter is pretty consistent across the year.
<A - Miles D. White>: You're not going to have to wait until the fourth year to see it, Glenn – fourth quarter rather.

<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And then any commentary on share repurchase or shares outstanding?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: We had a pretty active year in 2012, and we are definitely planning a level of share
repurchase for 2013. Obviously, with the separate company, our relative amounts perspective changes, but I think it
will be meaningful. And at this point, we're just not going to provide forecasts on what that will be.
<A - Miles D. White>: We continue to have robust cash flow.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And then let me ask you just a follow-up on Nutritional and specifically on China.
That's one area of concern that I hear with investors and that is China in the Nutritional market is slowing. And I think
the investors hear that because that's commentary coming from Mead Johnson. So, Miles, can you talk about the size of
your China Nutritionals business and how you see that market? I'm assuming your growth is accelerating, but
commentary would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: China is an important market for us. We're not as concentrated solely in China. We're fairly –
we're 100 countries in our Nutrition business across the board. But clearly China is an important one for us, number
one.
Number two, investors have asked me all during the late fall, gee, are we seeing a slowing in China? The answer is no,
we're not. We're actually seeing acceleration and expansion and we are expanding, and our growth rate in China is
pretty healthy. And I think China I would tell you is a very difficult market for investors, analysts, and even the
manufacturers to measure from time to time. I did see that one of our competitors in the industry there acknowledged
inventory challenges in China. It's hard to measure inventory in China, and it's hard to keep track of inventory in China.
We know that. I think the large multinationals that are extremely well established have a better view of that than many.
It's one of the reasons to be out of distributors and go direct. You can have a greater control over inventories and so
forth. I've seen that some competitors have indicated that they may have inventory challenges in the market. And it's a
hard – if you've got too much inventory in the market, you might think the market is slowing.
I would tell you the underlying fundamentals of that market don't appear to us to be changing or slowing. So I think
that any of us from time to time go through little ups and downs of the absorption of our products in that market. And
it's such a healthy market, such a good market that I think measuring it quarter to quarter isn't always that informative.
You've got to look at it over the course of a year. And I think our competitors would probably acknowledge the same,
that it's a very healthy market. It's still robust, and we're all still expanding into more cities. It's intensely competitive. It
has obviously drawn a lot of competitive attention. The large four multinationals, which includes us, Mead, and the
Europeans do very well in that market. And there are some local Chinese manufacturers in the value segments that are
also growing, doing well. I don't have much to say about the market except that it's really robust, good, and we're not
experiencing any slowdown there, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: All right, thank you.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Thank you. We have time for one more question.
Operator
And our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Guys, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Tom, let me start with a financial
question. The midpoint of the old guidance that you gave was about $2.03. The tax rate came down a little bit, about
$0.02. So that gets you about to $2.05, and the midpoint for today's guidance is $2.01. So am I doing the math right;
what changed?
And the baseline operating margin, so I think the midpoint of the operating margin guidance for 2013 on the last call
was about 18.5%. What is your best guess as to what that was for new Abbott in 2012? And then I just had one
follow-up.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes, I'd just like to clarify something. Obviously, this is the first time we've provided
guidance. On the third quarter call, as we moved into our discussions on the two new companies, we felt it was
appropriate to provide some meaningful profile perspectives on both companies, which we did on that call. And
certainly – and I think the key message there was, from an Abbott perspective, from a new Abbott perspective was that
given the top line growth and our ability to grow the bottom line and expand margins that we saw this as a double-digit
grower. So this is the first time we've provided guidance.
If you look at that profile information, a lot has changed in the world since October, but not a lot has changed in terms
of our forecast. We're still very close that profile that we provided. Tax is a little bit better because of the R&D tax
credit which, obviously, we didn't know about back in October. And we've gone through a budgeting process. We've
looked at final exchange rates, which in a number of countries have moved significantly since October. And it's just a
function of completing our budget process, which is why we didn't provide guidance in October because we knew we
needed to go through that process before we could provide you a meaningful guidance number. So I think what we're
providing today is very, very consistent with what we talked about in October. And anything a penny or two up or
down is really a function of just the process we've been going through. So I think I hope that answers your question
there, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Tom, and the R&D tax credit for 2012, did you push that into 2013? And then I just
wanted to ask for established Pharma, the potential impact of the new drug pricing list in India. Can you talk a little bit
about that? We've gotten some questions on it. I think you guys have roughly $800 million to $1 billion of exposure in
India, and I'll drop. Thank you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: The 2012 R&D tax credit, which is, as most investors know who have been following the
story, very odd for all companies in the way this has to be handled, since Congress didn't approve the law until after
December 31, the accounting impact of getting the 2012 credit actually becomes a 2013 accounting event. That is not
reflected in our ongoing guidance. We're planning to call that out as a specified good news item, if you will, in our
quarterly reporting in 2013, and that is not reflected. What is included in the guidance is the regular 2013 R&D credit,
which is now law, which we can count on as we move through the year.
With regard to your question on India, obviously, there has been a fair amount of discussion with various ministries on
the pricing environment in India. As one might expect, this has gone through quite a range of discussion. The most
recent feedback on this was more of a market-based model, which is much more consistent with the way we view the
appropriate approach towards balancing innovation and customer needs within the market. And if you look at the result
of that conclusion, it's very consistent with our planning assumptions for 2013 for the Established Pharmaceuticals
division. So at this point in time, we feel good about our assumptions. I know there are additional discussions going on
and there is not a final approach towards this. But all information we have at this point is that our assumptions are solid
for 2013.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the question.
