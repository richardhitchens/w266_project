MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Nan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Allergan Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the
conference over to Lisa DeFrancesco, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Nan, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan third quarter 2015 earnings
conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations
for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. The press release and our slide deck, which we are presenting this
morning, are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We're conducting a live webcast of this call, a
replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyright material
of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's expressed written consent.

Turing to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or
other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's
important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of
business trends and information as of today's date.
Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on the number of factors
affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our public periodic filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except
as expressly required by law.
At this time, as a result of the press release Allergan issued on October 29, 2015, confirming the company has been
approached by Pfizer and is in preliminary friendly discussions regarding a potential business combination transaction,
the company will not be issuing any financial forecasts that could require additional reporting under Rule 28 of the
Irish takeover rules.
With us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our CEO and President, who will provide an overview of our third quarter
continuing operations business highlights, and Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the Allergan
third quarter continuing operations results in more detail.
Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman; Bob Stewart, President of
Global Generics and Commercial Operations; Bill Meury, President of Branded Pharma; David Nicholson, Executive
Vice President and President of Global Brands R&D; Paul Navarre, President of International Brands; Philippe
Schaison, President of Allergan Medical, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the third quarter of 2015.
We're obviously been very busy on many fronts and our teams continue to build on the momentum we have had all
year. This momentum will propel our future growth.
Turning to slide 5. Allergan's third quarter performance illustrates that we continue to execute on the four pillars of our
growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and strong results in
continuing operations, key products and key geographies. Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit
growth among many of our franchises. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce. Our
team is looking forward to showcasing our R&D pipeline, the success we've had this year and the depth of our pipeline
across all seven therapeutic areas later today at R&D day. And we are executing on strategic business deals including
our Teva transaction earlier in the quarter, to allow us to focus on growing our business.
With the announcement of our plans to combine our global generics business with Teva in a deal worth approximately
$40.5 billion, we are now reporting our Generics business as discontinued operations. Although the business results are
consolidated into a single line in the income statement, our Global Generics team continues to perform well.
I'm impressed with the continued momentum in the business and proud of the performance of this team. For example,
the Generics R&D team has submitted 25 new ANDAs in the US this year, with 16 of them potential first-to-files. This
team is the gem of the generics industry, and they are on track to submit approximately 35 applications by year end.
Outside the US, we filed over a thousand marketing authorizations in critical markets. This year, we have received
approval and launched over 25 products in the US, and these new launches are adding to our results. Internationally, the
teams in the UK, Russia and other Eastern European markets continue to deliver strong performance. The
pre-integration work with Teva is going well, and we remain committed to closing the transaction during the first
quarter of 2016.

This plan to divest the Global Generics business allows us to dramatically simplify our operating structure, sharpen our
focus on seven core therapeutic areas and reload our capital structure to continue our transformation. We are confident
that we are creating the most dynamic company in growth pharma.
Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter net revenue
grew 90% on a year-over-year basis to $4.1 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition. On a pro forma basis, sales
grew 10% despite the loss of exclusivity on one of our largest products, Namenda IR, which experienced generic
competition in the quarter.
Strong sales in key products across our business drove 65% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.48.
Meanwhile, non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2 billion and cash flow from operations excluding R&D asset acquisitions,
restructuring and integration payments was $1.7 billion in the quarter.
Our business continues to drive strong performance. More than half of our products are delivering double-digit
volume-driven growth. On a pro forma basis, year-over-year brand revenue increased nearly 13% excluding Namenda
IR, divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange.
On slide 8, our growth in the quarter was broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we drove double-digit
growth from leading brands across key franchises such as BOTOX, Restasis, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Saphris. We
continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with new launches and approvals. Our recent launches, including
AVYCAZ, DALVANCE, Namzaric, Liletta and KYBELLA, are all performing well, supported by strong promotional
activities. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including
VIBERZI in a few weeks and VRAYLAR in the first quarter of 2016.
In addition to progress made in our R&D pipeline, we are also strengthening therapeutic area leadership through new
acquisitions of important programs. In eyecare, we continue to add shots on goal in development opportunities for dry
eye disease and eyecare with the acquisition of AqueSys, Mimetogen and Oculeve. Mimetogen, which we just
announced this morning, brings a novel topical formulation dry eye treatment that could potentially be used alone and
in combination with other dry eye therapies. This adds a Phase III program further strengthening our dry eye pipeline,
giving us the potential to launch six new products over the next five years.
In aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera for its leading product KYBELLA, adding a non-surgical
treatment for submental fullness, or double chin. We also announced this morning the acquisition of Northwood
Medical Innovation, developer of an innovative implant technology, earFold. earFold is a medical device for the
correction of prominent ears.
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which adds potential breakthrough treatments in depression and will
be discussed in detail later this morning at R&D Day. And in GI, we recently completed the acquisition of commercial
rights to Constella in more than 40 international markets. This adds an important product for our commercial team
internationally and helps position us for the potential to add new GI therapies like eluxadoline to our product offering
for international customers.
Before I turn the call over to Tessa to review our financial performance in the third quarter, I wanted to touch on our
R&D Day and recent commentary on product pricing. Later this morning, David Nicholson, Bill Meury and Philippe
Schaison will give an update on the pipeline and the commercial potential it contains. We believe that people will begin
to take more active notice of our pipeline after today's meeting.
With more than 70 projects in mid to late stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our therapeutic
areas to help us sustain leadership in the areas where we choose to compete. We are building a sustainable innovation
engine to power our top-line performance and therapeutic area leadership well into the future. Please join us for an
exciting day beginning in about an hour.
Turning to pricing. Pricing has been in the headlines and featured in the presidential debates. But let's not pretend that
this is a topic that has just appeared in the news. It's been a focus for many years. We know that cost is a constant
concern; so is patient access to medical innovation. Allergan seeks to strike the right balance between care and cost.

We operate in an open science model, developing promising products that frequently originate with smaller companies.
These companies often lack the infrastructure to bring their products through expensive late stage trials or the
commercial presence to recoup their R&D investments. The innovation ecosystem is full of these smaller companies
who have extraordinary ideas and brilliant scientists. We want to be the magnet for their great ideas in this new
innovation ecosystem.
Our model is designed to bring these extraordinary ideas to market. Our R&D staff is more than 2,000 people strong.
They mobilize resources to help regulatory authorities around the world assess safety and efficacy of our products
while providing data to payers to reflect their value. Let's face it, this effort is costly and often reflected in the cost of
medicine, and it is easy to miss the significant value they represent. They reduce the need for hospitalization, surgery,
follow-up visits and more dire medical consequences.
Allergan has a heritage in knowing health system economics very well, and we want to make sure patients have access
to important medicines. Like many of our peers, we have patient assistance programs to make sure that patients have
access to our medicines regardless of their ability to pay.
We are bold in acquiring and investing in promising treatments for serious diseases – Alzheimer's, severe depression,
glaucoma, debilitating gastrointestinal conditions. Our business model does not involve purchasing old products
already in the marketplace and taking excessive price increases. We prefer to acquire mid to late stage drugs and invest
extensively in their development. To make those decisions to help people with unmet medical needs requires us to
build bridges with physicians, academic medical centers, government, regulators and inventors of these molecules so
that they see us a partner who shares in their dedication to improve people's well being.
If you look at our recent development acquisitions, it's all about investing in ideas that can help change the way
medicine is practiced. What makes the biopharmaceutical industry great? Inventions that change lives. We will
continue to use our resources to advance treatments for unmet medical needs and to tap into the world's best ideas to
advance care for patients. We will do this, but we will continue to strike the appropriate balance between care and cost.
In closing, our team continues to focus on execution and our results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at
delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things to make our company the most dynamic and bold
in healthcare. I am so proud of this team's performance and I'm looking forward to what we can do with the strength
and focus on just branded pharmaceuticals.
With that, now I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa.
Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 12. Our overall results for the third quarter is on slide 13.
In the third quarter we delivered very strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated revenue
for the third quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 90% versus third quarter 2014.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $305 million compared to $192 million in the prior year period.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 22.4%, a decrease of 3.1 percentage points over the prior year
quarter as a result of the synergies realized from recent acquisitions.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2 billion, an increase of 168% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues
and higher gross margins across business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased
65% to $3.48 compared to $2.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the quarter. This rate was below expectations driven primarily by the allocation of
the entire interest expense to continuing operations earnings. This rate could change by potential repayment of debt
upon the close of the Teva transaction.
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $1 billion impacted by recent asset acquisitions. Excluding
acquisition related restructuring and integration payments, our third quarter cash flow from operations would be $1.7

billion.
Slide 13. Turning now to our US Brands results on slide 13. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year.
US Brands revenue was $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 50% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of
Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products including Restasis, Linzess, women's health products and
new product launches including Liletta, Namzaric and AVYCAZ.
Adjusted gross margin within US Brands continued to be strong with margins approaching 88%. SG&A as a
percentage of revenue decreased to 18.3% versus 22.1% in the year ago quarter, driven by continued synergy capture
from recent acquisitions.
Turning to slide 14 and our US Medical Aesthetics business, third quarter revenues were $457 million, an increase of
9% versus third quarter 2014 results on a pro forma basis. Sequentially, US Medical Aesthetics performance was
affected by seasonality related to aesthetics procedures. Third quarter gross margins were strong at 93.9%. SG&A as a
percentage of revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points versus third quarter 2014.
Turning to slide 15 and our International Brands results, third quarter revenues were $661 million versus $58 million in
the prior year, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Year over year growth was also driven by fillers and Ozurdex in
international markets. Sequential revenue performance was mostly due to seasonality.
Gross margins increased 25.7 percentage points to 83% in the third quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher
margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A increased 3.2 percentage points to 29.8% versus third quarter 2014
due largely to the Allergan acquisition.
Turning to our Anda business on slide 16, revenues increased to $576 million, up from $500 million in the prior year,
an increase of 15% driven by trends in our base business and new retail chain businesses. Results include third party
revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 17 details our debt capitalization. We ended the third quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion
and equity of $77.5 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. In the third quarter, we paid
down approximately $231 million of our debt. In October, we borrowed $800 million on our revolving credit facility to
fund the Kythera acquisition. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 3.98 times debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA
versus 3.9 times in the prior quarter due to continued investments in R&D assets. We remain committed to maintaining
our investment grade ratings.
And now, I will turn the call to Lisa for Q&A.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Nan, I think we can start taking questions. I'd like to ask everyone to limit yourselves to one question, so we can get
through everyone in the queue.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Just had a question on
SG&A, it was 22.4% of sales in the quarter. Can you help us put that number into context with your longer term 21% to
24%, guidance range I think you laid out in September? I guess, was there anything unusual or any reason to expect
that ratio to move higher going forward? Because otherwise, it seems like the company is going to be quickly trending
to the low end of that range as top line continues to scale here. And if can slip in a second quick one, we've been getting
this question a lot. Can you just disclose the mix of price versus volume driving your growth in the quarter? Thanks

very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes so thanks, Chris. I think with SG&A, our previous guidance and range is still
appropriate. Obviously, as you look at this quarter, I understand why you're thinking that way, but I do just put you
back to the guidance we issued before. I don't know if Tessa, if you want to add anything.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah, we're within the range. And unfortunately given Irish rules, we can't really provide
guidance on a go-forward basis. But I would just say that we are within the range.
<A - William J. Meury>: And then on price volume, I'll start with the top products. If you look at BOTOX, Restasis
and Linzess, the price volume, or I'll say volume price is probably 80/20. It's largely driven by pure demand in units or
prescriptions. If you look across the entire product line, it's roughly 50/50. And our price appreciation trades in the
single digits.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes thanks, Chris.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on Namenda now
that we've now had a chance to see how the generic impact has come flowing through the model. Your updated
thoughts on Namzaric; it's a little slow out of the box. Do you still view this as a $500 million to $750 million peak
sales product, or should investors think about that peak sales target as more of the combined value that XR and
Namzaric could retain?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I would start, maybe then Bill can jump in. I think as you think about where we are
with Namenda XR, I think the team has worked very hard and accomplished quite a bit. We still focus a lot of our
energy and time inside our organization on both XR and Namzaric. The one thing that I would caution is with respect
to Namzaric, most of the formulary coverage, although it's quite good right now, kicks in in January because of the
Medicare Part B part of this equation. And so I think our expectations are a little higher post broader formulary
coverage than it is today. But Bill, anything you'd want to add?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah, that's exactly right. I would make a few points. The first one is XR is very stable, and
that's because the formulary coverage at the end of 2015 and into 2016 is as high as it's been. Next, Namzaric isn't quite
as spread, good steady jog. 60% of our use today is coming from Aricept monotherapy. As Brent said, when formulary
coverage converts in 2016, and after several months of direct-to-consumer advertising, I would expect over time that
the overall business is going to grow and that Namzaric is going to account for a greater and greater percentage of it for
one simple reason. It's a better product. If you look at the data, two drugs is better than one, and I think it will take us
just a little bit of time to move this category.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Thanks, Jason.

David, if you're on mute, please un-mute your line. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of
Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks. Brent, just on the international business, you're still small here, but there is
clearly a lot of opportunity in growth outside the US and you've got a pretty big portfolio of products that you could
leverage, and I think you called out eluxadoline in the prepared comments. So the question for you, what's the strategy
here assuming that you remain standalone, and where does this rank within your business development priorities?
Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. So I think when we did the Allergan deal, we talked about international as being
one of the more important longer term growth levers for us. I think that still largely is untapped. We have a very strong
team around the world. We have big opportunities to continue to leverage the infrastructure that we have. I think the
deal we did with Almirall to buy Constella is a proof point of the types of things we're going to do as we're preparing to
hopefully get approval for eluxadoline in Europe over time to be able to have more opportunities to leverage GI as a
good move for us.
Obviously, aesthetic medicine is very important. We have lots of opportunity to continue to expand the aesthetic
portfolio in Asia, China; I would call out Latin America, Brazil as another market I would call out where we're seeing
strong growth. And then of course eyecare is very important to us around the world. And we continue to look for ways
to build our portfolio and leadership in eyecare. And in many markets we are number one in eyecare outside the US. So
we have a big heritage there, and it's important for us to continue to leverage.
With respect to business development, it remains a priority. We will continue to look for ways to add scale and product
flow in key international markets around the world. And if we do that ourselves by eluxadoline approval or our
JUVÉDERM approval recently in China or buying Constella or other things, it's an important growth driver for us in
the future.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Should we think about this, though, as more of a bolt-on source of capital? I mean
everybody is going to be focused on the $29 billion that you have coming in from Teva in Q1, assuming that another
deal on the side here doesn't happen. So should we think about international as smaller deal build-out, or could we see
more significant capital allocated there?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, I mean I think about it three ways. It's going to be organically through driving our
70, most of our 70 late stage, mid to late stage programs and global development programs to the extent it makes sense,
to doing R&D type deals for international product flow, to buying already marketed products like we did Constella and
then perhaps from time to time where it makes sense strategically and financially, bolting on a small business into place
like Brazil or China or even Europe.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on the cash pay
businesses as well as just BOTOX overall. What's going on behind the scenes in each of the individual areas?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, I mean obviously they're an important part of our business. I think the biggest
component of the cash pay business is the aesthetics business within US Medical. That business continues to perform
exceedingly well. Obviously there was some seasonality in the third quarter as there always is. Philippe, I don't know if
you would want to comment on anything particularly. But I think KYBELLA is really starting to get momentum and I

was at the sales launch with Philippe and his team last, I guess two weeks ago.
<A - Philippe Schaison>: So, we are in the focus of training roughly 1,500 top tier reps on top of the 800 that have
been already trained. From a market share standpoint, you can see a guide point, we continue to solidify our market
share especially on the filler market. And we have achieved 2 million consumers as part of our BD loyalty program,
which is a all time high. So we're thriving and we're doing extremely well and everything is in the green.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Just for directional purposes, about 20% of our sales globally come from cash pay
business. Most of that is the Allergan Medical. There are some cash pay brands as well, but the vast majority is that
from the aesthetics business within Allergan Medical.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: And what about BOTOX and the therapeutic areas like how is migraine doing, overactive
bladder, all the key drivers?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. You hit the right ones. Those are the main growth drivers for BOTOX therapeutically.
Both indications are growing at a high double digit rate. The core indications, the original indications are relatively
stable. Listen, in both those conditions, it's a highly effective product and it's also very economical. And the injector
base today in the United States for BOTOX is very experienced and comfortable with the product. I expect that both
indications can continue to grow for the next several years.

And your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. I'd be interested in your thoughts on the outlook for Restasis, given as the

for Restasis. Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. Sure. I think Bill probably is best positioned to answer.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes. It's a good question. I don't believe that this is going to be a fight to the death between
Shire and Allergan. I've said before that the gap between the prevalent population and the prescription treated
population is enormous. It's larger than it is in most categories. The importance of dry eye disease is clear, and it's
getting more and more attention because of the impact it has on quality of life, the impact that it can have on vision and
positive post-op outcomes. When you look at the data sets between the drug, I would simply say that we'll have to see
how Lifitegrast stands up in the real world.
I would also point out that in the second half of 2016, we'll be launching a multi-dose preservative free form of Restasis
which I believe is going to be very popular with physicians and with patients for two reasons. The first, it's just more
convenient than 60 single unit vials or droppers, and it's also easier to administer. And a big problem with all of these
eye drops is they're difficult to instill and it's often a major problem with compliance.
Our promotional program in this category will continue to be at the very top. We have a large sales force that covers
primary care, optometry and ophthalmology. We'll continue to run the largest direct-to-consumer advertising program
in the industry. And then lastly, we obviously as you ask about formulary coverage, we have preferred status on 85% to
90% of health plan formularies and 90% of that is Tier 2. And so, this is a highly economical option. There's no doubt
eyecare professionals are going to try something new. But I believe long term, this category has the potential to double.
So there's more than enough to go around.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. I have a question and if you can't answer it, I have a backup. But it's about a
technicality, Brent, related to the prior press release. Can we assume that because Pfizer approached you that a business
combination means that talks are about Pfizer potentially buying Allergan or not necessarily?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, I can't answer. So you should go to your back-up question.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: All right. It's more boring. Tessa, can you share the Generic sales and the gross margin and the
segment margins in the quarter perhaps?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yes. So, given the focus of this call is on continuing operations, what we will be
providing is disclosures in our 10-Q which will be filed shortly. What I can say is we had solid performance for the
Generic business, and revenues were around $4.77 billion for the nine months, for year-to-date nine months.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And remember that just in fairness, that is discontinued operations accounting. So for
those that also cover Teva, it's not just a simple one-to-one kind of translation. Is that fair, Tessa?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: That's fair. But it performed according to our expectations, a good solid performance, but
you'll get more detail in our 10-Q.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Irina Koffler with Mizuho.
<Q - Irina Rivkind Koffler>: Hi. Thanks for taking the call, or the question. I just wanted to see how you're thinking
about your sales force going forward. Is it the right size? Are there opportunities to be a little bit more efficient, or use
alternative distribution models there? Or are you in fact thinking about adding instead?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I was going to make a bad joke but I'll stop. Well, I mean for me the sales representative
around the world is a very important part of our company, that we tend to put them at the center of the way we think
about our business and what they do, as they are the most intimate with our customers. I think we look at our sales
force deployment globally very thoughtfully and strategically. For example in facial aesthetics we just increased our
sales force by about 75 sales reps.
<A - Philippe Schaison>: We're up to 300.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Which was already the largest facial aesthetic sales force in the United States, and now
it's even larger and more powerful. China, we just invested in our sales force and added sales reps. And so we do look
at it, deployment of the sales reps very strategically. In the US, Bill can comment, where we have the most sales reps. It
is a very hard-working, dedicated group I think delivering more details than any other sales force in the industry.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah, that's exactly right. It's certainly the most productive when you look at calls per day
and we have roughly 4,000 representatives, but they operate as if it was 4,500 or 5,000 just by virtue they lead the
industry in activity. The most significant change that we've made in the past 12 months to 18 months is we've
customized the field force. So there's no longer a one-size-fits-all approach. We don't have the same number of
representatives in the state of Massachusetts as compared to the state of Mississippi.
And so we will invest in regions and sales force based on the estimated return. But we do operate with a principle,
when we launch new products and we have multiple new product launches over the next several years, we will always
aim to achieve share of voice leadership. And so details and representatives on a routine basis are being reallocated
across the product lines so that we can maximize the value of our business. It's a terrific group. They're well
compensated and we'll change, but I don't anticipate any fundamental shifts in our sales force model at this point.

And your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I have two financial questions and then a BOTOX pricing question.
So with respect to the tax rate, I may have missed it earlier, but how should investors think about your go-forward tax
rate? And then when you give 2016 financial guidance in February for the standalone company, how should investors
think about what you're going to bake in for debt reduction? Meaning that's a huge swing factor in modeling EPS. And
maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about it at a high level at this point.
And then separately on BOTOX pricing, could you just update us on when a decision will come down on whether
Allergan will be able to separate pricing for the cosmetic and therapeutic indications, and more appropriately price
BOTOX for therapeutic indications? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And so, let me take the last first and then Tessa can take the financial ones. We are
continuing with our litigation with CMS around bifurcation of pricing. I really don't have an update on that today but it
is something that Bob Bailey and the legal team are staying very focused on, and we'll see how that plays out. And as
soon as we have an update, we'll certainly provide it but I wouldn't build any expectations in around that. Second, we
continue to think about therapeutic BOTOX as with new toxins for the future, but that's a longer-term strategy as well.
So I think for the short term, David, I would just view those prices as being coupled.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So, in the two finance questions, David, I'll address the second one first. We are
committed to providing an update in terms of financials similar to what we've done in the past which should be during
the Q1 earnings release in February. And by then to the extent that we have more clarity with regards to how we would
deploy capital, assuming the Teva transaction would have closed by then, then we will provide you guidance with
regards to capital deployment including debt repayment. One thing obviously that we're committed to is the investment
grade rating. So to the extent that we don't deploy the capital, we will pay down the amount necessary to maintain the
rating on a go-forward basis.
With regards to the tax question, based on our release, what actually occurred because of continuing operations is that
the bulk of, or the entire interest expense was actually allocated to continuing operations, hence the low tax rate. On a
go-forward basis, that should trend upwards assuming we pay down debt. But we can't really be precise at this point
given our restrictions based on Irish law. But it should trend higher based on debt, if we assume debt paydown.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: You're welcome.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of clarifying ones and
more of a strategic one. First on BOTOX, you reported 13% constant currency and think about 9% actual results for
BOTOX. It's a pretty big difference given how the product is distributed geographically. Can you just give us a little bit
more color on the currencies involved?
Second for Bill, fair to say that if Lifitegrast comes to market the end of 2016, we should expect a weaker Restasis in
2017, 2018 essentially, at least in attenuation for a couple of years in growth of that product?
And then, maybe I think is the meme but we're not to supposed to ask it, but more broadly, Brent, you got actually good
results this quarter. You seem to be in the process of actually executing what you told us you would. You got the
revenue growth that will put you much above your peers. Your multiple is much lower. Doesn't seem like a great time
to engage in friendly discussion with another company. Can you help us think about this a little bit?

<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So let me address some of the questions. BOTOX itself, the total BOTOX franchise grew
year over year by about 7.9%. We obviously had half – that's BOTOX specifically.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, I think the 13% pro forma was for the entire branded business.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Correct.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange is what I said in
the prepared remarks.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Right, but BOTOX itself year over year grew by about 8%, 13% excluding FX.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: You're looking at the chart versus what I said, Ronny, right?
<Q - Ronny Gal>: No. I'm actually looking at the – I'm actually looking at your product slide. BOTOX continued
strong growth in both therapeutic and cosmetic of more than 13% excluding foreign exchange. This is the slide 8.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. That's right. It's hard to hear you, Ronny. That's a little bit – we hear about every
second word. Yeah so you got it.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So it grew 7.9% excluding FX. Stripping out FX, it would be 13%.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Okay. So BOTOX is growing 13% constant currency in the third quarter.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: That's correct. Yeah.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Correct.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Is there a reason why the gap between the currency adjusted and non-currency adjusted is so big? Is
there a couple of currencies that went particularly bad this quarter?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: I mean it's largely euro. Plus, we had some protection related to certain hedges that flow
through.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. We hear you fine. Yeah.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay. Just maybe if you could offer some perspective on the upcoming VIBERZI launch,
especially given what you've seen from the competitive adoption or the adoption of Salix thus far or the Salix Xifaxan
so far in IBS-D. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah I mean, well I'll ask Bill to comment, but we're very excited to be launching
VIBERZI. The sales force meeting will be next week. I'll be down there for a few days to talk to the sales reps with
Bill. But it's going to be – we're making a big investment in this launch, it's safe to say. Bill, you want to talk about it?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. It's the perfect complement to Linzess. IBS should be thought about as a continuum
with constipation on one end and diarrhea on the other. And because we're able to market two products to the same
condition essentially, we're able to talk about it in a more complete way. And I think it's a competitive advantage. As it
relates to the product compared to Xifaxan, it's a completely different approach to treatment. This drug works on
motility and visceral pain or hypersensitivity and Xifaxan essentially is an antibiotic. There's certainly room in this
category for more than one product.

Promotionally speaking, this will be one of the largest launches in the industry from an investment standpoint. And I'm
pretty sure it's going to be the largest launch in gastroenterology. It's going to be very noisy. We know how to do this.
We did it with Ironwood during the launch of Linzess. The DTC advertising will start not one year after approval but
only three months. And the promotional effort unlike other companies in the area, will capture not only
gastroenterologists but primary care physicians. And there's an interplay in almost every category between primary care
and specialty that we can navigate that other companies can't. And I would expect that this drug should do as well as
Linzess does on the other side of the market, and could ultimately almost double the size of our GI business over the
next five years.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ariel G. Herman>: Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jami. So someone already asked about pricing for the third
quarter, but going forward you have previously provided a CAGR for your expectations for the overall Branded
business. Can you just provide some color around what's baked into that regarding price and volume? And then
secondly, can you touch on the competitive dynamics with the potential competition to BOTOX from Revance's
product? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah so, I think obviously we're under some restriction under Irish law with respect to
guidance, but our pricing as I mentioned during my opening remarks, is always a balance. And most of our key growth
drivers are, as Bill indicated, predominantly in a volume situation, not a price situation. As we think about price, we
tend to think about mid to high single digit price increases across the portfolio. And so we don't really think of any
change or expect any change in our very, I think, conservative pricing policy and the way we think about price. And so,
we're not going to – I don't think you're going to see us change our view, or perhaps better said, our commitment to the
10% growth objectives and aspirations that we have. So, I think that's going to stay fairly normalized for the
foreseeable future.
I think with respect to Revance and competitive toxins, I'll ask David to comment as well, but I would just remind you
that there are competitive toxins already in the market and more, if you talk to customers, very few care about having
an extra few weeks or a month of duration or effect for BOTOX or toxins. And in fact, what they mostly complain
about is price. And in our competitors' price, their toxin's at a much lower rate than we price BOTOX, and yet BOTOX
continues to be a strong market leader. And so I would just urge you to keep perspective. As what Philippe said earlier,
we have 2 million members in Brilliant Distinctions. We have a full range of facial aesthetics. We have the largest field
force. BOTOX is the number one branded pharmaceutical brand in the world. And so, this is a very strong franchise
with very good staying power. And so, sometimes there's a hammer looking for a nail, duration may be just that. But
scientifically, maybe David can comment, too.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yeah, happy to talk about that briefly. Clearly, we'll be talking about BOTOX during R&D
Day later today. BOTOX of course is a pipeline in a product. We remain committed to continuing to build the pipeline.
We will be launching new indications for BOTOX around the world, so extending our aesthetic reach geographically.
And we will be developing BOTOX a new therapeutic application. I would point out, if we're talking about duration,
that BOTOX in some indications has a duration for up to nine months. So if you're talking about hyperhidrosis for
instance, BOTOX works for up to nine months. And so the duration of BOTOX depends on the use and the dose that
we administer. More of this during the course of the day as we walk through our R&D pipeline.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, I would just add, David, BOTOX really is a fortress product. It's got a lot of
indications, 10 indications. It's got great brand recognition and has supported by the strongest promotional effort, and
it's got good and strong clinical science and experience behind it.

Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. First, can you tell us a bit more about
the generics this quarter, what the actual sales were, the year-on-year trends and just some commentary there? And
number two, Brent, so in an M&A scenario, is there anything legally preventing you from issuing more in shares than
your own share count?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah so, Tessa, you want to? She already answered the generic question.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. Some for generic, what I said earlier was that they had good solid performance,
performed according to our expectations. We will provide more granularity for discontinued operations in our 10-Q
which should be filed in the next couple of days. But revenue-wise, it was at $4.77 billion for the last nine months.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And so your other question, Umer, was about share repurchase?
<Q - Umer Raffat>: No sorry, I meant, can you issue, in an M&A scenario where you're issuing equity, is there
anything that prevents you from issuing more in equity than your own entire share count?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: To be fair, I just don't know the answer. Maybe if you could want to follow up, we can
talk to the folks who may know the answer to that. I just don't know, Umer.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Okay. No problem. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Okay.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a quick couple. First is in a
relatively small part of your business, that's the breast implants. How well is Allergan positioned to take advantage of
some of the competitive missteps there? And second on business development, assuming you remain standalone, what
are examples of some therapeutic areas that might excite you among the ones that you are not in currently?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. So, I'll ask Philippe to address the breast implant situation and maybe just a quick
overview of what happens following closing.
<A - Philippe Schaison>: Sure. So as you know, Sientra stopped selling their implant in the US following what
happened in Europe where they lost their CE Mark and their manufacturing plant in Brazil got on fire. So right now,
we're converting most of Sientra larger account to Allergan, which is a triple win for us because not only we're gaining
market share on the breast implant side, but while we're converting those accounts to the breast, we also strengthen our
business for our portfolio of fillers and BOTOX. So for us, it's a triple win. We get the breast implant business as well
as the filler and the BOTOX.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I think it carries over to Europe as well, right, Paul?
<A - Paul Navarre>: Yeah. Internationally, the situation is the same in Europe. I think we've always had the
positioning of high-quality implants and top branch service to customers. So I think anytime there is an event like that
on the market, we benefit from it being the leader, so we are seeing that and we're seeing transfer of account and
demand as well.

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I think with respect to potential future therapeutic areas of interest, we're really
focused on the seven we're in. When you think about the seven we're in, we still have a lot of white space opportunity.
For example, we're number one in aesthetic medicine and a robust pipeline of projects, but yet mostly focused on the
face. There's still a whole body to work with in aesthetic medicine and lots of opportunities in eyecare. Obviously,
you've seen us do a lot of things recently to support our robust development organization with dry eye and glaucoma.
But there's still more things we can do in retina beyond DARPin and Ozurdex, and there's new opportunities there
globally as well.
CNS, a strong presence in Alzheimer's and neurology and psychiatry. But we don't participate let's say in, just as an
example, MS or Parkinson's or a variety of other conditions that could leverage CNS. And I can go down through the
entire seven therapeutic areas and point to a big white space that would allow us to leverage our infrastructure
commercially, our R&D capabilities with very little additional costs but expand ourselves into those therapeutic areas.
So that's really the goal.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Thanks.
Operator
And your final question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with BTIG.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Thanks. Brent, could you talk a little bit more about your focus on the GI space heading into next
year? Certainly you've got VIBERZI coming online, you've got Linzess. I noticed that the filing of low dose strength of
Linzess, the 72 micrograms. Could you talk a little bit about how that low dose might help you in the chronic
constipation treatment market, and is VIBERZI going to be the first detail in the GI space in front of Linzess?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, so I think later today we'll talk more about the pipeline. And certainly, we have
more than just low dose. We announced with our partner, Ironwood, the colonic release program for Linzess. And then
of course, we have very importantly relamorelin moving its way through the clinic. So maybe Bill could just talk about
how we view it from a promotional perspective.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah, the reason we developed the low dose alongside Ironwood, and also the sprinkle
formulation which will be introduced, is to accelerate our conversion over the over-the-counter market. I mean most of
the sales for Linzess today are being captured by patients who are using over-the-counter medications. And that will be
the primary source of growth in the future. A low dose is going to give physicians some optionality, and for patients it
may be better tolerated, though Linzess at 145 micrograms and 290 micrograms, based on our estimation, is extremely
well tolerated. The average patient is taking close to 120 days of therapy as compared to Amitiza or Zelnorm which
were trading at roughly 90 days of therapy.
Broadly speaking, though, it's a great space. And with VIBERZI, we can pool resources for the two products so that
each one is going to get a greater level of effort than they would have if marketed independently. And as Brent said,
we'll cover more about the pipeline, relamorelin and the other life cycle opportunities, during R&D Day this afternoon.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And maybe then Paul Navarre could just touch on our thoughts around Constella and
perhaps later [indiscernible] (54:22) and other GI opportunities around the world.
<A - Paul Navarre>: Yeah, you mentioned it, Brent. GI is a strategic priority for us. So internationally, we're going to
steadily create the franchise. And the first step was to actually buy the rights of Linzess in 41 markets internationally.
So that's going to be the first step of creating that franchise, and then we're going to wait for the approval hopefully
with the launch of [indiscernible] (54:49) in 2017. So I think we have a similar ambition internationally for GI.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think that was our last question, right, Lisa?

hope will be an exciting and interesting and informative session with our R&D colleagues and commercial colleagues.
And I would just like to end by thanking our team around the world for a great quarter. We have quite a few things
