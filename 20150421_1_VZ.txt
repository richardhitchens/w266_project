have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator
Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor
Relations.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike
Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.

Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this
presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject
to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the
SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website.

The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year
basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported
earnings were $1.02 per share and there were no special items of a non-operational nature. This compares with adjusted
earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%.
As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter since
the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago, on a non-GAAP illustrative basis
adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assumed 100% Wireless
ownership for the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%.
I would also like to make a few points about our Wireline segment reporting. Our Wireline results include the
operations we are selling to Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016.
Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale.
This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale.
Therefore, Wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets.
The first quarter included $146 million pre-tax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward until
closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind
us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for
future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation.
To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 spectrum auction, improving our mid-band
spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline. As we stated on our conference call in mid-February,
we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our
network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology.
Our early experiences with small cell deployment have been very favorable and we believe that the industry is making
good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor
labs.
We also executed several value-creating transactions that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership
in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders.
We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the
end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and
California to Frontier for $10.5 billion. And we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which
resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction,
including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive, is scheduled to occur in the second quarter.
Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders.
Now let's move on to our primary focus, which is executing our day-to-day strategy for the benefit of our customers
and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflects strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue
growth, high-quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow.
In Wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565 retail postpaid net adds
in a seasonably low volume quarter. Total Wireless revenue grew 6.9% and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected, our

Wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels.
In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 4% and we continue to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer
growth. Total Wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity
improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion.
Now, let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide 4. Total
operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter, continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the
first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%.
Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet
of Things and Telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter, these revenues totaled approximately $150
million, an increase of 25%.
We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular, innovation within the
transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us. Through Verizon Telematics, we are already providing a
platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through two-way broadband connectivity to vehicle.
Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct-to-consumer aftermarket product which modernizes
traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience.
In terms of video, we are on track to launch our mobile-first OTT video product this summer and we have already
announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities, which you will hear
more about during the year.
In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost
structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded by
60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter
for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So, we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective.
Let's turn now to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model we have been
executing the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum
acquisitions, return value to shareholders, and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to
execute on this investment strategy, take competitive dividends and delever the balance sheet.
The monetization of our tower portfolio enabled us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. In
the first quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the
tower monetization transaction which is non-recurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is
reflected in the financing activity section of the cash flow statement.
We also securitized a portion of our wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash
proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow, excluding the TOWER proceeds, totaled about $4.2 billion.
Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we
expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion.
In Wireless, we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, Wireless CapEx totaled
$2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G
LTE network primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to
utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems.
We are also beginning to refarm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EVDO to 4G LTE in select markets. Despite what
others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network
performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what
matters most to customers – coverage and consistent performance – and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G
LTE network in the nation.

Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our
strategic goals. Our financial deleveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter,
we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction.
During the past six months, we have been very active in the debt capital markets, managing our maturities and taking
advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109
billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. We are on track with the plans to delever and remain
committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
Now, let's move in to a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide six. Our Wireless strategy is to provide
the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher
customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail
postpaid customer base.
Total Wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue of $17.9
billion declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment
revenue. Service revenue plus Edge installment billings were up 3.1%.
During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continued to increase. The percentage of
phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the
percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter as we are currently running near 50%.
Edge phone activations totaled 3.4 million in the quarter and we now have an Edge phone base of 10 million,
representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base.
In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service
margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year.
As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases,
equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue rather than
wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which
was similar to a year ago.
Now, let's turn to slide seven and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 108.6
million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to 102.6 million and our
prepaid connections totaled 5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volumes. Postpaid gross
additions were 3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and
tablets. Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year, coming in at 1.03% for the quarter. We
are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high value customers. We are seeing good results with
our postpaid smartphone churn, less than 0.9% as compared to our basic phone churn at more than 1.2% in the quarter.
Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added
621,000 new 4G smartphones and total net smartphone adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new
4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000 as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net
decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally, net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled
10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We
ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration
increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 70% of our retail postpaid
connections base. About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network.
As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Within MORE
Everything accounts, average daily usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because
increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency
of our LTE network.

In terms of our upgrade rate, about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This
represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading, which was expected due to seasonality
and extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our
basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly 17 million basic
phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We also have a profitable
growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connections base,
so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and
lower churn at the account level.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue
performance on slide nine. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the
first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of 4% or better growth. Mass
markets, which includes Small Business, grew 2.9%. FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first
quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products
and some pricing actions.
Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the
quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to our data speeds of 50 megabits per second or
higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier where just over 20% of our consumer
FiOS customers currently subscribed. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband, we added
133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration.
Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter.
In FiOS Video, we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS Video
subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is
by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year, we introduced Quantum TV, SpeedMatch
and our Quantum Gateway router.
As part of the evolution of customer choice for video consumption, we just introduced FiOS Custom TV within the last
few days. The Custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape, allowing customers to better choose
the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of pre-selected and local broadcast channels,
and choose at least two channel packs out of seven. This new option, coupled with our traditional programming
packages, provides more choice, more control and more value in an easy self-serve manner.
In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 copper customers in the quarter. For
the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of
decommissioning ten central offices. Post conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower
cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us.
Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers, driving higher penetration in existing markets and
generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets, and we will be
disciplined and rational in our approach to customer acquisition.
With that, let's turn to slide 10 and cover Enterprise and Wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the
enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise
revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with
trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport
revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which are smaller in scale.
Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth
in applications and services.
In our Global Wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services
continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than
offset this growth. We also had a favorable contract settlement which improved revenue this quarter, and which will not

reoccur. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure. In
terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. Our path to a stronger and
more profitable Wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating
and capital efficiency.
On the Enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher growth areas like cloud, security and
professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements
and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and will
continue working to improve our overall cost structure.
Let's move next to our summary slide. We're off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were
successful in the spectrum auction, executed a tower portfolio monetization and signed a definitive agreement to sell
certain Wireline properties. At the same time, we returned value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase
program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an
adjusted basis.
Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively
and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and
provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our
targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability, and capital spending in the range of $17.5
billion to $18 billion in 2015.
Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8%, and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. In addition to our ability to deliver
strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and
video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and
become more meaningful in the future. Our deleveraging plans are on track, and we remain committed to getting back
to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thank you, Fran. David, we're now ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes
from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Well, thanks very much. Good morning, Fran. So you had a couple of management changes in
the first quarter, John Stratton taking over as President of Operations and combining the IT and network units. Can you
give us a little bit of color of any sort of implications, any strategies around him that have happened as a result of that?
Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, Simon. So as we have moved into our next phase, as Lowell has
consolidated the operational performance under John, this gives us a better breadth of consolidation, if you will, post
the Vodafone acquisition. And if you go back to when we did the acquisition, we stated that there was some internal
walls that could be broken down and we could become more efficient.
And with the establishing of Marni Walden's organization around new products and services, this is where we get into
the Internet of Things and over-the-top video. She runs Verizon Digital Media Services and some of the other

incubation companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John's organization and
streamlining, implementing Verizon Lean Six Sigma, and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we're looking
for.
With Marni's organization, it's creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the
business. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense as we
move into more software developed network areas and more of the network is driven out 3acenters, it makes sense that
Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective. So I think what
you're seeing here is more well-organized within the company, more cohesiveness, and more direct relationship
between growing revenue and cost reduction.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. Great. So no real changes in the sort of cost trajectory or the CapEx trajectory?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I've – CapEx, we've given you guidance of $17.5 billion to $18 billion and right
now, we're staying on track with that. You should see that ramp through the rest of the year and obviously, coming out
of the auction, we added $500 million to that to densify and build out, and that takes a little bit of queuing up time. So
you'll see that more in the back end of the year.
And as far as cost reductions, you've seen some of the measures we took at the end of the fourth quarter. If you look at
Wireline alone, Wireline is down over 5,400 people from the beginning of last year. So continuing to streamline that
business and become more efficient. And for Wireless, as John has taken over, we're starting to see some streamlining
around customer service and some of the other things that we've talked about in the past. So I wouldn't downplay the
cost reductions that we'll realize in the future here.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, David. Let's take the next question, please.
Operator
One moment please. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two, if I could. Fran, on the quarter, I
think the two numbers that really stood out to people were, number one, the really low SG&A in Wireless. I think
going back to our model, maybe the lowest percentage of Wireless revenue we've ever seen. If you could kind of step
us through how we got there from last quarter and what the outlook for that would be, would be huge.
And then the second big number was really the ARPA number, which I think stepped down further than people
thought. Now, it could have been related to EIP or it could have been the pricing environment and the market retention
efforts that you're executing on. Could you kind of give us a picture for how we got to where we got in ARPA and kind
of what we can think about that for the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Dave. Just clarification, on the Wireless revenue, you're talking about service
revenue?
<Q - David W. Barden>: I was actually talking about total revenue as a percentage for SG&A, but either way, it was a
really low number.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Yeah, so look, I mean, I think that if you look at the service revenue and ARPA, it
all goes to the same issue, which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and
customers move, you're shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you're going to continue to see a decline
in service revenue, you're going to continue to see a decline in ARPA. But I think what I would center around is what
we said in the script, which was we grew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also, if you look at the EBITDA margin, which
kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean not 100% of it, but if you look at $1 of revenue and $1 of cost, there's

zero margin. So, if you look at total revenue, 44.8% versus last year at 44.9%, so it's a very consistent profitability
measure.
The other thing, too, is if you look at the Edge benefits, you're getting benefits from both lower commissions and so
forth, so that is also impacting the SG&A line. Because your indirects before, if you think about how that worked, we
were refunding the indirect through a commission payment for the subsidy of the handset. That all goes away. So you
are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line.
But overall, if you look at the profitability of Wireless, and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin at
55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the Wireless service margin would still have been over 50%. So the
profitability of Wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again, I would go back to what Simon brought up, I
would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we're creating in the environment.
<Q - David W. Barden>: So this is a good baseline for kind of extrapolating the rest of the year?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I mean, from a rest of the year standpoint, I think that the outlook is strong. I think
that obviously, as Edge continues to escalate, you're going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation
benefit. But I think as far as Wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit because January normally is a
slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter.
As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother's Day and Father's Day, I would expect that the
promotional activity in competitives is going to heat up here. So that will offset some of the benefits that you're going
to see. So, look, I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up. But it's really
about overall revenue growth and the profitability of the business, and we feel good about that.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Perfect. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Thank you. David, next question, please.

Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, first, if I can follow up, Fran, on the Edge stuff, can you help us
think about the high end of the Edge mix, given the distribution of where you sell this? What portion of your sales are
in channels that don't have access to the Edge program?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, all of our channels have access to the Edge program, but obviously, within our store
channel, it is very, very heavily weighted towards Edge at this point. We're doing very little subsidy model selling out
of the store channel, and it's because where the market has moved. I mean, when your entire competitive environment
is just advertising and promoting service pricing and ignoring the whole equipment side, we have to follow that in order
to be competitive.
So, the store channel, by far, is very heavily weighted towards Edge. Indirect is starting to come up as time goes, but
also keep in mind, the business channel and our enterprise channel are not really taking the Edge product. So if you're
asking me, will it get to 100%? The answer is no. I can't tell you exactly what that percent will be, but we do see that
the second quarter will probably be in the neighborhood of a 50% take rate.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. And then second, I like the Custom TV launch this morning. There is some controversy
around ESPN and Disney. Can I ask, do you guys have explicit permission for this? And have Disney and other pushed
back since Friday to you or is this just a storm in the media? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I think the right way to answer this without getting into too public about our
contractual situations, look, this is a product that the consumer wants, it's all about consumer choice. I mean, if you
look at the TV bundles today, most people only, on average, watch 17 channels, so this is a way to give consumers

<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: All right. David, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups and then a question. The follow-ups is first, can you just
give us the ending net receivable balance for the installment phones and what that was last quarter? And then are you
allowing for installment plans, early migration? Is that something you're using to get the take rate of Edge up? And then
just a broader question I had, if I could. If you – just address the larger strategy for Wireline. You went through a
quarter of monetizing some additional – or announcing the monetization of some additional assets. What's your
thoughts longer-term for your Wireline business? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Mike. So on the accounts receivable, I'm not going to give too much detail here on
this call, but if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter with the securitization that we did, it's relatively flat.
On early migration on Edge customers, obviously, we have an Edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off.
So if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want, and we do have
customers who are taking that and Edging up. But there is no "early migration" other than what's instituted in the price
plan.
On the Wireline strategy, look, I mean if you look at the three properties that we announced to sell: Florida, Texas and
California, they were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we built out with FiOS. They're
heavily penetrated properties, but the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we looked at strategically
when we laid this out, it just made sense based on the offer that Frontier had in front of us to actually sell those
properties. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than the fact that they were not strategic properties because they
were islands. But if you look at the rest of our Wireline footprint from D.C. all the way up through Boston, it's very
contiguous, it's highly populated, we have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So it's extremely viable for
us to continue to penetrate these properties.
And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest penetrated market that we have and still has the
highest growth opportunity that we have. So we're holding on to some of the markets that we believe are contiguous.
You'll see more and more with Wireless and Wireline combined under John's leadership. So there's more that we can
do strategically with the footprint that we have. And again, it just made financial sense to return that back to our
shareholder and bring that cash in to delever the balance sheet. So that's really there all is to it, Michael.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. The smartphone metrics continue to be really
impressive, but as you note in the presentation, about 20% of your subs still have feature phones. So I was wondering if
you could just walk us through what is the strategy for upgrading and retaining those subs, particularly because it seems
that your competitors are continually targeting that base. And should it be reasonable to think that at this point in the
upgrade process, we might continue to see some modest degree of net losses in the phone base or is what we saw in the
first quarter just a seasonal factor?

<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Brett. Well, I guess a couple of things here. So we still have 17 million basic and
11 million 3G phones. And coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base.
And that was a key ingredient going into the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you've seen, if you look at the
basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improved that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost
double the number of basic phone loss customers than we did this year. And as you noticed, we came out with some
strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phone customer and the 3G customer.
Now, having said all that, look, the environment is, is that there – if you look at prepaid just on a standalone basis, our
prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors' postpaid pricing. So we're in a
competitive pricing standpoint, and as I said coming out of the fourth quarter, we will not – we have to be rational and
we will not chase every customer. But we're making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and
upgrade them into a price plan that's fitting for them. And we made improvement in that, but I will tell you we still
have some more improvement to do. But we're not satisfied with any losses, but then again, we will not chase every
add either based on just cheap price. So I think that's the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: And just a quick follow-up. I believe in the past, you said some of the small losses
you've seen have generally been customers that were not as profitable. Is that still the case?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I think what I said was if it's – not quite, I wouldn't put it in a profitability
perspective. But what I would say is if it's a customer who is just price-sensitive and don't – does not care about the
quality of the network or is sufficient with just paying a lower price, then that's probably a customer we're not going to
be able to keep on the Verizon Wireless network.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: David, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe if you can just comment regarding subscriber quality,
maybe net add quality or base quality. I'm just thinking about the credit scores within the base, the prime mix, and
obviously we've seen a lot of prepaid migration into postpaid. Just what you guys are seeing in respect to that. And as a
follow-up, just a comment, if you would, on the appetite for additional factoring, how we should be framing that for the
full year. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. So on the securitization piece of the business, yes, you should anticipate that this will
be an ongoing program on a quarterly basis going forward.
As far as the quality of our base, I think the quality of our base speaks for itself. We have not made any credit policy
changes. We have a very strong quality base. But there are – a certain segment of our customers, as I just discussed
around basic, where we're trying to bring them up into a price plan that's meaningful for them.
But if you look at – again, if you look at the lay of the land around price plans, as I said, our prepaid pricing is a little
bit of a premium to some other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000
prepaid retail customers. I can't answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made of choice
to go to a postpaid price plan because it's actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So I
can't factually state that, but I think that's some of the migration.
But also, I would also say that on the resellers' side, which we don't talk much about, we had a very strong growth
through our TracFone relationship, over 400-and-some-thousand net adds this quarter. So, it could've been a migration
from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid bases, and I
think others will have to talk to that but we're not seeing a lot of that within our base.

<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Fran, just how do you frame the credit risk, these installment plans? I mean I'm
assuming you guys obviously have pretty tight credit standards, but do you see this as a risk for you guys and the
industry that's having more and more loans out there for Apple phones?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, sure. I mean, obviously, it adds risk to the balance sheet because you're putting up a
very large receivable now; before, it was just service revenue that you were at risk at. And if you look at the economics
of service revenue, it really is what's the economic loss to the company. It really comes down to what's the actual
economic loss of providing the service to the customer. It's not actually the retail service revenue that's the loss. So
obviously, the cost of service is minimal so the loss was a lot less. Now, you're actually putting up a receivable that has
a $1 for $1 loss if the customer does not pay.
And again, we're very comfortable with the credit models we use. As I said, we really haven't changed our credit and
we have a very strong credit base. So at this point, I don't see any trends that would be concerning me on the
outstanding receivable at this point.

Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great, thanks. Two quick ones. First, following up on the video tearing, Fran.
Could you talk a little bit about maybe sort of expected sort of penetration that you expect for these new plans, and
maybe compare the profitability of these new services to sort of traditional TV subscriptions?
And then from an Edge standpoint that you've guided to flat consolidated margins for the year, but as you see the
higher take rate of Edge – and first of all, where that can go for the year? Could that drive better Wireless margin trends
and lead to a better overall consolidated margins for the company? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, John. So on the video tiers, look, I think it's way, way too early to start talking
about what the take rate is or the profitability. So, we'll leave that until we get some trending behind us. Obviously,
we've done this because of the consumer benefit, give the consumer a better choice. So, let's see what happens here as
we go and then we can address that later.
On the EBITDA margins, look, I mean I'm kind of reiterating our guidance that we came out of the fourth quarter from
an outlook perspective. And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If
you look at last year's trending, as we said, coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more
consistent across the quarters. We wouldn't be as bumpy as we had been in the past. I think that you have to look at the
whole thing in retrospect.
And also, the other thing is I would not get focused in on the service margin sign. And as I said, I really prefer us to
look at the total revenue and the EBITDA margin. And if you saw, the EBITDA margin was very, very strong for
Wireless this quarter, and that kind of normalizes out a little bit of what the Edge take rate is. And then again, I also
can't speak to what we're in for from a competitive standpoint on additional pricing moves through the year. So, I'm
kind of reserving on that side of the equation as well from an outlook perspective.
So on outlook and profitability, I would say, reiterating what we said in the fourth quarter and more consistent earnings
profile moving forward. So, I think that's where we'll leave it.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: David, another question, please.

Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much and good morning, Fran and Mike.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Morning, Amir.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Good morning.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: You folks highlighted that 4G devices now constitute approximately 70% of the retail
postpaid connections and that traffic or LTE network handles about 86% of the total wireless data traffic for the
quarter. Given these dynamics of what seems to be a rapid adoption of LTE technology, I was wondering if you could
give us an update on your ability to refarm spectrum in order to take advantage of the network efficiency opportunity?
Fran, you had mentioned that there are continued cost reduction opportunities that your scale provides you, and any
color there would be helpful.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, Amir. Yeah, so I think that this is all pointing to where the future growth of
the business comes from. I mean there's not many businesses where consumers want to consume more and more. And
if you look at it, 86% of the usage is on the LTE network. And if you look at our MORE Everything accounts, they're
up 54% in consumption year-over-year. So obviously, consumers are willing to consume the content on their wireless
devices, which is why we're so optimistic around Internet of Things and, of course, over-the-top mobile.
Now, as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're
already starting to refarm the 1900 PCS licenses in certain markets and we still have a long way to go there.
Also, we are looking at, as I said, the LTE unlicensed, which is a really good fit with the licensed LTE piece, which
will give us a lot more download capability and a managed network comparability. So, there's a lot that we can still do
around our spectrum and efficiency. And obviously, with the LTE network, as you have seen, with 86% of that traffic
running on it, with a 54% overall year-over-year increase, the cost structure of the business really has not changed
because the ability to deliver this on a very cost efficient network is there.
So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model, what we did in the AWS
spectrum, in buying the licenses, and our plan to build out and densify, I think we're in a very good financial position to
execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. And then one quick follow-up, if I may. You folks have been consistent in noting
that deleveraging the balance sheet is a priority for you. And as you mentioned, it seems as though the approach you
took to the AWS-3 bidding process seems to reflect that strategy. How should we think about your ability or resources
available to pursue other assets in the market? Specifically, I'm thinking about the potential broadcast spectrum auction
or any material third-party portfolios, if they were to come to market.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: So, I think, look, I mean we are very focused on our balance sheet and we're committed to
delevering. And as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction, we've had four priorities. One was to continue to
invest in our networks and platforms, which we are; to buy spectrum, which we did; to have a competitive dividend
payout, which we are; and to delever the balance sheet. And we continue to do all that.
As far as any type of strategic acquisitions or additional spectrum, we're probably alluding to the incentive auction.
And I think that we're just going to have to wait to see what the rules are before we decide how we're going to execute
on or around the incentive auction. So, I think that's still a little bit ways out before we can make that decision. But,
look, we positioned the balance sheet to be able to execute on the strategies that we need to execute on in order to
deliver the future growth and earnings of the business, and I think we're in a very, very sound position to do that.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. Thank you very much for the color.

Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Hey, Fran. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the over-the-top
video service offering. I know we're going to see a more formal unveiling this summer, but can you just discuss kind of
the news flow, what we should be honing into, as you go into that announcement? I mean I assume it's more content
announcements.
And then on the packages you announced last week, should we consider this separate from the OTT or kind of a
precursor of this integrated Wireline/Wireless model?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. So first on over-the-top video, as we have talked before, you see us announcing
some of the content deals that are in this. But it goes back to what I said before: this is all around having the consumer
consume more content on their wireless handset through the Verizon Wireless network. And we know that consumers
want content. We know what a viewership is. And this is appealing to mobile content, and let's not confuse that with
linear TV content. So, I would not read into the custom TV package as a precursor to the over-the-top video. It's not.
These are two very distinct ecosystems.
As far as the monetization model, when you think about the monetization there's many different avenues we can do on
this. There could be premium subscriptions. There could be pay-per-views using the multicast technology. There can be
advertising models so that the consumer does not pay for the content consumption or, as others would call it, sponsored
data. So, I think there's a lot of models that we can use. And I hate to say this, but let's wait until Marni and team are
ready to make the big splash here this summer, and then we can have more discussion around what it means.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: David, we have time for one more question. If we could take the last question, please.
Operator
Your last question today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim K. Horan>: Thanks, guys. Fran, the wireless data growth is fairly incredible at this size and base. Do you
think you have pricing power for wireless data? Two of your competitors aren't really charging all that much for it. Do
you think that'll change in the industry as maybe the networks get filled up? Yeah, your thoughts, thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I think this is the great lead way into the over-the-top mobile and it's developing
more ecosystems around monetizing the consumption that happens on the network. Obviously, we're in a period of time
where we see this service pricing dilution because of the installment sale, and I think that will continue. And of course,
we're increasing bundles, so more data for the same price.
But this is no different, Tim, than what we saw on the voice world way back where we had a price and then all of a
sudden everybody started seeing dilution on per minute price because more minutes were being given away into bundle
and we saw a little bit of access accretion but overall pricing was coming down. And then all of a sudden, the usage
track started up again and revenue took a turn, and I think that's the piece that we're in right now with the data world.
But the key to this is to develop these other ecosystems to create more monetization around customer usage, whether
that's premium subscription, pay-per-view or advertising models. And that's really what we're concentrating on.
<Q - Tim K. Horan>: Thank you.

Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Thanks for everybody for joining Verizon this morning. We are absolutely off to a good start to the year.
We stated coming out of fourth quarter that we would return to historical margin in Wireless and we delivered on that.
We also stated that we would continue to improve the profitability of our Wireline business and we delivered on that.
We had a good growth quarter. We had strong profits and strong cash flows.
We look forward to a very positive 2015 and we look – very hopeful and confident in our ability to execute on our
strategy, grow the business profitably and invest for the future.
Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
