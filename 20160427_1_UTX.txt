Okay. Thank you, Kali, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported EPS in the first
quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better than expected results were against a difficult
prior year compare and reflect solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start.
And as a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted
EPS of $6.30 to $6.60.
Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March
investor meeting. And you can see these on Slide 1.
First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better than expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt [&
Whitney] is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut, and West Palm Beach engine centers
had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. At our
Climate, Controls & Security business they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.
The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation, while continuing to meet program and
customer milestones.
And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter, despite China sales being down 3%.
Also new equipment orders for Otis in China grew 2% year over year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since
the end of 2014.
On the innovation front there are now five A320s in revenue service, all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine. And
they're providing our customers with better than expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service
fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program.
And at Carrier Transicold we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck/trailer that operates
exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and
investment in sustainable technologies.
On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. Look at our SG&A in the quarter, down year over year both in
absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best in class versus the peer group.
And as always we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th
time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that
record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years.
We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On
top of that we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share
repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our
share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017.
As always we remain focused on what we can control. And this means driving productivity, while continuing to invest
and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable
long-term growth and of course increase shareowner value.
Across the business we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the
portfolio well. At Pratt as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo. And the C-series is on track for entry
into service in the middle of the year.
On the military side we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 Long Range Strike
Bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come.
As you know we have strong content on new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well. And these
innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace
Systems.

Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its
Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a
straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone.
On the Otis side in the quarter we installed the world's largest double-deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's
tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center (sic) [Central] in
Australia, which will be the tallest residential building in Melbourne.
This is just a few examples of many of where our investments in innovations are starting to pay off. Let me turn it over
to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results. And I'll be back with just a few closing comments before
we start Q&A. Akhil?
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 2. As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, in what continues to be a slow
growth and challenging macro environment. Once again it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower than expected
pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger
second half growth rate.
However, for our commercial businesses the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven
primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You
will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above normal SEER 13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up
high single-digit in the quarter.
Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid-to high single-digit declines in commercial
HVAC, commercial refrigeration, and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a
double-digit increase in truck/trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA
region.
In China, Otis and commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth
across rest of Asia at both Otis and commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8% respectively, partially offset by declines in the
refrigerated container business.
Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong.
On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as
the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.
Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In
our commercial businesses we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new
equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth.
At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment
were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter, driven by lower exports. Domestic
commercial equipment orders were flat.
Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was
down 13%, driven by primarily by Russia. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%.
As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent
indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions, and exports have been better than expected,
showing some signs of economic stabilization.
At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had
expected coming into the year. And at CCS, commercial HVAC was down 6%, and Fire & Security orders were down

slightly.
On the Aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace
Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by
timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 2015 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.
Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was
offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis EPS
was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges.
Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to
support the Aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in
Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of four annual payments. We continue to expect
full-year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016.
As Greg said, we are confident in our full-year outlook: Sales of $56 billion to $58 billion, and adjusted EPS range of
$6.30 to $6.60. With a solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker than expected U.S. dollar thus far, our
contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the
rest of the year.
With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?
Paul Lundstrom
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Turning to Otis on Slide 5. In the quarter sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and
3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in
China and EMEA, more than offsetting drop through from stronger volume in other areas. Foreign exchange translation
was a 5-point headwind to sales and earnings.
New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA, and mid-teens
growth in Asia, outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter.
Otis service sales were up low single-digit overall, as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was
partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA.
New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA we saw new
equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%.
China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong with
orders up 11%. And for the year guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of
profit decline for Otis.
Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of
growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare.
Profits were up 4% at constant currency with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating
margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3-point headwind to both sales and profit.
During the quarter we saw continued growth in HVAC sales with both North America residential and global
commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the Fire & Security business was down 4% with a high single-digit decline in the
global Fire Products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector.
Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter with a nearly 25% decline in the container business, offset by
continuing growth in truck/trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single-digit.
CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last
year. Globally, equipment orders at both the Fire & Security and the commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%.

While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back-half compares and continued
productivity, we are confident in the full-year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low
single-digit organic sales growth.
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was
driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%.
Military engines were also up in the quarter with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially
offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines.
OEM sales were down 12% and 15% respectively at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan
shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the investor meeting in March.
Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial
OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of
the fully learned out C-17 engines.
As we expected E&D was also higher in the quarter. And we continue to expect a second half spending decline, as we
approach entry into service for the C-series and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan
programs.
Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better
pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for
a similar amount. For the full year we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.
Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up
1% with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy
programs.
In line with our expectations commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% with low single-digit growth in both parts and
repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning.
Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines
in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly.
Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit, an 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior
year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities.
Unfavorable commercial mix, largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop through from lower
military sales, were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction
actions and pension tailwind.
For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost-reduction actions,
we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC
Aerospace Systems.
With that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Paul. I hope you guys got all that. As I said at the beginning of the call, strong start to the year. We're
delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged on the progress we're making on the
strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March.
As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full-year 2016 outlook.
And as Akhil said, we've got a pretty significant contingency at the midpoint.

So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro
environment remains uncertain. And like many others we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of 2016.
And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS, pricing at Otis in both Europe and China, and of course the
aerospace aftermarket trend.
So while we considered bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the
guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember it's our practice that we'll continue
to watch these trends. And we'll revisit this at the end of the second quarter. Okay?
We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term. And that is ultimately our mission. We've got
this focused portfolio of industry leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline. And we also have
global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about.
And these trends are real. That's revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization, and the global expansion of
the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth, not just this year,
but well into the future. And of course translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation.
So with that let me turn it back to Kali and open up the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just wondered if you could give us a little color on the order commentary in truck/trailer
versus containers? I know you quoted the revenue, but just wondered if you could tell us how the orders are trending?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So, Carter, the orders – as you know Transicold had a very, very strong orders quarter last year in
Q1. It was up 24% organically with truck/trailer in North America up 73% last year.
So on the back of those compares what we are seeing this year is down 24% in Q1 year over year on orders, with
container down a little north of 20% and North America truck/trailer down a little north of 50%. Europe truck/trailer
continued to be very strong with up double-digit order growth.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I wouldn't read too much into these quarterly order rates, either, Carter. You know this is a
lumpy, lumpy business, both truck/trailer and container. Still feel confident in the full-year guidance. And we still have
very, very good market share in both truck/trailer as well as the container business. So it's lumpy, but it's early. So I
don't think there's any real cause of concern here.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on the provisioning you mentioned, the
down low single digit. Just for clarification, do we lap the fall off in those provisioning sales beginning next quarter?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, there's going to be some improvement as you will expect through the rest of the year. I mean
our guidance for the year is to be flat. Little bit of the weakness in the first quarter was also driven by some push out of
Airbus 320neo deliveries, as you can imagine, because that caused some of the airlines to delay their uptake of
provisioning. But we do expect full year to still be flat and compares to get easier as you pointed out.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. And the fundamentals are good, right? You've got A320 deliveries picking up, and
neos deliveries picking up. You've got A350 deliveries picking up. You've got C-series coming into service. I mean all
of those things would point to a much stronger back half and to Akhil's point, much easier compares.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning, gents.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Just maybe, Akhil, you provided a range in mid-March, $1.35 to $1.40 [adjusted EPS] as a
placeholder for the quarter. It came in at $1.47. I hate to sort of be counting the pennies here, but what drove the
upside? Did you see a better back half of March? Was it some shift on commercial OE? Can you maybe add some color
to that upside?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Nigel. I mean it's always good to be on the positive side of a beat, as opposed to the other.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Sure.
<A - Akhil Johri>: It's – well, the reality is our execution was much better. I mean, as Greg said, UTAS was in the
middle of implementing a huge ERP implementation. And we were just a little concerned whether we would be able to
catch up with the impact of that. And as Greg said, the team did a fabulous job of making sure we met customer
commitments and were able to get past the SAP implementation and still deliver on our commitments. And so that was
a better – slightly better performance at UTAS versus what our internal expectations were.
Pratt executed extremely well. The production output was the best ever for a Q1. Again we had a little contingency
against that. And then Otis environment – from a macro point of view Otis came in better both in China and in North
America than we had expected.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's really helpful, Akhil. And a quick follow on. Greg, maybe, there's a lot of – obviously a
lot of news and noise about the GTF technical fix. Maybe just bring us up to speed on how that's looking right here?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think it's all really good news, Nigel. As we look at it today, as I mentioned, we're at
99% plus dispatch reliability. I think importantly, if you talk to the airlines, you talk to Lufthansa, you talk to IndiGo,
they are seeing better than the 16% fuel burn that we had been committing to, something like 18% better fuel burn.
So the engines are performing better than expectations. We had a software drop last quarter or last – yeah, last month.
Reduced the nuisance faults in the cockpit by about 80%. All of the other fixes that we've talked about are going to be
in production by June.
And the whole fleet- the few engines that we do deliver in the first half will be retrofitted by year end. So everybody
feels good about the program on the neo. And I think it would be the same across all of the GTF platforms, at Embraer,
at Bombardier, at MRJ. This is a great engine.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<A - Akhil Johri>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, Akhil, I was wondering if you could give us a quick update on your cost structure
initiatives? They on track? Both from a timing and financial impact perspective? And maybe some quick comments on
whether the political climate today is making things maybe a bit more difficult? Or giving you pause on any of your
plans at this point?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Jason, let me take – let me start off. And then Akhil can fill in the details. But we're on track.
We're going to spend about $500 million this year on restructuring. First quarter was light, only about $62 million.
But importantly, we announced a couple of big initiatives at the Climate, Controls business. That is the closure of a
couple of the big facilities. Those as you can imagine are very, very difficult decisions. We think they're the right thing
to do for the business. And we will continue to do the right thing for the business, even as we are perhaps chastised by
some of the politicians.
The fact is this is a globally competitive marketplace that we operate in. And we have to do what's right for everyone,
shareowners, the employees, the communities that we operate in.
So, look, tough decisions. We have plans in place to help employees through these transitions, through our employee
scholar program. We offer people a full 4 years of college education if they're displaced by any of this outsourcing. We
provide significant severance and out-placement assistance.
All those things you have to do, keeping in mind you still have to do the tough things. And I give credit to the CCS
team. I know they're getting beat up a little bit out there in the media. But we have to do the right thing for the business.
And we will continue to do that.

Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. I just wanted to start on Otis. I guess one of your peers had talked about Southern Europe
stabilizing. Doesn't look like you saw that yet in service. And then also they seemed to find the competitive temperature
of the water sort of heating up a lot in Q1. Again, doesn't sound like you saw that in China. So just wanted your
thoughts on those two points.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Julian. Look, I think Europe was a better story for us this quarter than we had seen in the
past. If you go back and look at our last four quarters, the service in Europe had been down sort of mid-single-digit.
And this quarter it's down 1%. So it's a trend in the right direction.
We saw growth in our portfolio and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from
December to March. So that's another good sign.
Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver
of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those two are still not
there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out.
With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rate in
value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we're seeing some traction there with improving sales
effectiveness, with improving product positioning. So feel relatively good; it's one quarter, but the trends were
encouraging.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think I'd also add there, Julian, Akhil and I just got back from a trip to the Middle East and
to Southern Europe. We were visiting with Otis customers and visiting the Otis branch offices. And I think it's clear
that the guys running the offices have a good handle on what they need to do to stem the price erosion that we've seen.
Again none of these things happen overnight. It is good, as Akhil said, to see some stabilization. We visited both the
Otis brand in the offices as well as some of our second tier brands.
I mean they have good strategies. Again I think as we saw in Spain when we were in Madrid, the economy there has
bottomed out, unemployment is getting a little bit better. Even in Italy, despite some of the issues around the banking
crisis, we still see growth in some of the major cities.
So it's not doom and gloom in Europe. I think it's stabilizing, as we said, and should bode well for the years to come.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks. And then my second question, just on Aero Systems, you had a pretty hefty EBIT drop
in Q1. I just wondered if there was a big weighting within that of your – sort of the comp year on year from the contract
and license agreements? You had dialed in $150 million headwind for the year from that item. Is that very sort of Q1 or
first half weighted?
<A - Akhil Johri>: I wouldn't call that out specifically, Julian. That was about $40 million of the $150 million was in
first quarter year over year. I think the bigger thing is if you go back and look at the quarterly profile of UTAS, Q1 was
their strongest quarter. Again organic growth was the strongest in Q1. Profitability was the strongest in Q1.
Provisioning was pretty good in Q1 last year. So I think as we go through this year, the compares get a little bit better.
This $68 million change in year-over-year profit was very much in line with our expectations, certainly for first quarter.
So no drama there.
What will happen is we'll see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the
rest of the year, compared to first quarter. And the mix starts to get a little bit better, especially given what we saw with
the decline in the legacy businesses in the first quarter of this year. So it's more I think just again consistent with our
expectations. No change, no drama. I would say UTAS came in exactly where we expected it to.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next
question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So, I know that the 19% increase in commercial spares in first
quarter at Pratt presumably was the big price hike, plus the V2500 turbine overhaul coming up. But can you give us
some color? I mean is 0 to 2 still the right number for spares for the year? And maybe focus both on Pratt and UTAS
and what your revised guide assumes for Pratt aftermarket compares in the second half? Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So, Cai, you've got both the points right. I think we had the benefit of very strong orders in
Q4 of 2015. And so some of the sales associated with those orders flew in Q1, which was helpful. We also saw some
timing related purchases in Q1 associated with V2500 engine, as you pointed out. So both those factors drove our
exceptional 19% in Q1.
Compares will be more difficult in the back half, especially in Q4, which was a decent quarter for Pratt as you know in
commercial aftermarket. So while we think there is upward pressure on aftermarket, commercial aftermarket at Pratt,
I'd like to wait for one more quarter and see the trends in Q2 before taking – officially adjusting the guidance, if you
will, for aftermarket for Pratt.
UTAS, very much in line with what our expectations were. 1% growth in commercial aftermarket for first quarter. Low
single-digit growth for the full year, slightly better in the back half than first quarter, largely on the back of
provisioning and spare parts. And I think we have – all on track.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So you're still at 0 to 2 at Pratt?
<A - Akhil Johri>: It could be. If there's upward pressure there, clearly. But to give you a more precise number, I think
let's wait for one more quarter of trends.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Look, I think obviously we're very encouraged, Cai, as you would expect with 19%.
But as Akhil said, the back half, especially fourth quarter compare will be more difficult. But clearly, we think there
may be some upside. But we'll see. It is early as I pointed out. It's only April. So just keep those expectations in check
here today.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Doug.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On Otis and CC&S in China, when you look at where you stand right now, I know, Greg,
you've talked about the need at Otis for additional product development there. It feels that over the last years there's
been a real focus on cost reduction, both in CC&S and in Otis, with the goal of getting margins higher.
As you look at your position in products today, particularly with respect to China, both at Otis and CC&S, what do you
see in terms of the positioning right now? Investments that may need to be made? Where is this likely to head over the
next 2 years?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think both Philippe [Delpech] and Bob McDonough laid it out pretty well. We've had to
make some additional investments in the product line, especially if I think about CCS, that's got to be in the big
chillers. It's a big market in China. We don't have huge share there. Good share, but not leading share today. And so we
have to continue to make investments in products.
It's the same at Otis. Otis has got some again decent share in China. But we need to make investments. We need to
continue to drive the innovation theme, as opposed to the margin theme. And as a result you'll see. I mean Otis margins
are down this quarter, but that's okay.
I think our focus here is the long term, and that is driving more product into the hands of the customer, so that service
can ultimately be the driver of growth.
If you think about service in China today, it was up 15% though the first quarter at Otis. So we're getting momentum.
Unit orders as we said were up 2%, even though overall orders were down a little bit in Otis China. So we're getting
some traction. But more investment. So we're not done there on the innovation and the investment side.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Does this mean that in both units should we expect to see a little bit of margin headwind,
say this year and next? I know that was kind of what it looked like at the Investor Day with the margin expansion really
coming farther down the line, so the 2018 to 2020 timeframe.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think – keep in mind CCS still has some margin runway, as Bob pointed out. 70
basis points this quarter is a little bit more than what we expected. But again organic was down 1%. So I think Bob has
got some opportunities on the cost-reduction side as well as the top line. For Otis we are going to see a little bit of
contraction, clearly. As we try and regain market share, you're going to see pressure on the margins.

<A - Akhil Johri>: But as we've talked about many times, I think the focus is on starting to grow operating profit at
Otis, not focusing so much on the margin percent by itself. Because ultimately it will be better for the shareholders if
we can start growing earnings at Otis, even if it comes with a slightly lower margin percent.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Right. You can't service elevators you don't sell.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Wanted to focus in on HVAC. And I guess I'll put Transicold and resi aside, because as
you said we've can get whipsawed on comps, and Transicold and resi we've got the 13 to 14 SEER noise. It does look
and feel like there's some slippage there though in the commercial business. I guess, Greg, you addressed it a little bit
on China, just now in chillers.
But can you update us on where you're at on product rollout in that business? Do you think there's some share erosion
in North America? And how do you plan to address that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. One quarter does not a trend make, Jeff, as you know. I think last year as we looked at
the market share trends improving, that was on the back of I'd say some big new product introductions, especially on
the big, big machines, the 3,000 ton chillers.
First quarter was weaker than what we had expected, clearly, on the commercial side, not just in the U.S., but globally.
But we have been making investments. We've doubled the R&D spend at Carrier on the – especially focused on the big
machines on the commercial side. So feel pretty good about where we are.
But still a lot of work to do. I think this is the one area where Bob has got the team focused. Because look, the rest of
the business, I think the resi business in the U.S. very strong, solid market share, good margins. Refrigeration business,
as we said lumpy, but still very, very solid from a market share perspective. Commercial HVAC, there's some work to
do here.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And as one of the things, Jeff, Bob talked about at the March meeting, Middle East, we are seeing
particular pressure in the commercial HVAC business. I think the orders there were down over 40%. And that shows up
in the overall numbers. It's an important area for us for CCS. And that's facing its own challenges right now.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And just a quick one on Otis, and I'll pass the baton. Just bridging the gap from units up 2%
to dollar revenues down 7%. That 9 points, I assume that's not all price. But can you give us some color on price mix
within that spread?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. Pricing is a large part of that, but there is some mix element as well. I would say probably
80% of that figure that you quoted would be price, and the rest would be mix. But I don't have the precise data here.
But I think it's not – pricing was a little worse than what we expected, but not that much worse. I think there is always a
concern when the market goes down, price tends to follow that a little bit, as all players start to go off lower market
units. But it was good to see that Otis was able to stake its own claim in terms of growing the number of units in the
order base. And that was encouraging for us.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think the other thing to think about, Jeff, is China actually looks like it's stabilizing.
And we've seen some rebound in the residential housing market. As you know that 60% of what Otis sells there goes
into the resi market, residential housing. So that looks like it's stabilized. And we're starting to see an uptick in
especially tier 1, tier 2 cities in terms of residential sales again.
So while we had kind of planned for the worst, I don't think it's going to be as bad as what we had thought in China.
And we should get a little bit of traction there on the – as the recovers in the residential market.

Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Just a quick question for you, Greg, on the B-21 engine. Will that be produced on the same
line as the F-35 engine and the GTF?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Ron, I'd love to be able to talk about it, but I really – all I can tell you is that yes, we have
been selected by Northrop and the DoD to partner on that with an engine. But I really can't talk about anything
specifically unfortunately.
But again it just bodes well, if you think about for Pratt's military business, really for decades to come. Now we have
the JSF, we've got the Long Range Strike [Bomber]. Clearly, Pratt's got a huge backlog coming.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. And then maybe just one more quick engine question, right? I mean there has been
all this press about A320s piling up because of engines and so on and so forth. Can you just give us some color on kind
of where we are on that? And what's going on with the fixes to the engine to get everything kind of back to normal?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think – well, we mentioned it earlier I think. We delivered I think 14 engines in the
quarter. We're exactly on plan with Airbus in terms of the ramp up that we had expected.
As I mentioned as well, 99% plus dispatch reliability, getting better fuel burn than what we expected. And we had the
latest software drop that Bob Leduc talked about in March that corrected about 80% of the nuisance faults. Everything
else by June will be incorporated in the production engines. And by the end of the year we'll have retrofitted all the
engines we shipped in the first half of the year with the software and everything else.
So the engine is performing well and couldn't be happier in terms of the dispatch reliability. I think if you talk to the
pilots, you talk to the airlines, they like the engine. And no bad news here.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: All right. Great. Thank you so much.

companies reported. Maybe you could just give us a little color, kind of specifically what's going on in the UTAS
commercial after-market.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Look, it's trending about in line with what we had expected. To your point, Peter, this
is more art than science. But we know the fundamentals are still out there. We know that neos deliveries are going to
pick up. We know you're going to see C-series enter into service here middle of the year. A350s are going to ramp up.
So we would expect to see a better trend as we go throughout the year. Keep in mind first quarter, a tough compare at
UTAS on the initial provisioning. We saw initial provisioning drop off significantly after the first quarter of last year. I
think that's right, Akhil?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Uh-huh.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: And so it should be – a little easier compare will help. RPMs continue to be strong. Is there
upside at UTAS? I don't know. Certainly, Pratt looks more promising today. But it is early in the year. So I don't think
there's anything to panic about. It's just a lot of it timing.

Our next question comes from line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Greg, I want to go back to sort of something you talked about at
the very beginning and said, the contingency has expanded. And it's now at around $250 million. Can you elaborate a
little bit on your thought process in terms of how you might want to use that going forward? Some of it might very well
– well, I'll just stop there. Keep it simple.
<A - Akhil Johri>: He helped us. Go ahead.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Mr. Rubel, how would you like me to use that? Should we pass it through in higher
earnings?
No, look, it's as we said, as Akhil said, $250 million of contingency at the midpoint at $6.45, clearly it's early. But what
that does is it bodes well. I think we've got a range out there for a reason of $6.30 to $6.60.
I think as we get to the end of this quarter, the second quarter, we'll take another look at the overall results. And if
everything is in line, you could expect us to probably take a really hard look at the range again. But it's early, it's April.
Could you see higher earnings than the consensus out there, $6.50? Maybe. But, look, let's just wait.
<A - Akhil Johri>: The other thing, Howard, is as you know FX can change very quickly, right? I mean it's only 6
months ago, people were talking about going to parity for euro and now it is $1.13 and everybody is feeling good. All it
would take is for Fed to signal that they are going to take the interest rates up here, and you'll see euro go back down
towards that level.
So it's April. It's too early. The CCS order trends is something we need to continue to watch as we have said. And then
if the Pratt aftermarket stays at this level, then obviously that's good news. But it could change again. So it's – I know I
have developed an internal nickname here of wet blanket. But I think it's appropriate to kind of use ...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We like to think his balance works at UTC, right? So Akhil's pessimism, my optimism,
which is unusual, it all kind of balances out here. So we like where we are. We like – we think the consensus is right in
line. And I don't think there's much more to say about it, Howard.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: No, I appreciate the candor and color. Just as a follow-up a little bit, the benefit of where
you have been is that there are some markets where commodity prices have been a little bit better. And there's some

other cost benefits that have sort of come out of where you are today.
What are you doing – or what do you ask some of the operating executives to do to either take advantage of this
continued weakness in commodities in other markets to help the business longer term?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So as you know, Howard, on the CCS side we have a program in place to hedge through our
copper requirement specifically. And we have through our supply agreements, we have long-term arrangements with
suppliers where we have a price fixed for copper for the next several quarters.
And based on that we know that our first half commodity tailwind is slightly greater than what we expect for the
second half. We are looking at some of the similar arrangements on the Aerospace side, particularly with regard to a
couple of long lead items, like nickel and others. But there's still some work to be done on that. But that's the direction
we have with the corporate executives. Peter Longo in his new role as the Ops VP is looking at that hard with the
business units.

Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. You may have addressed this, but there's a lot going on today. But at Pratt the
deliveries in the quarter were 9% or 10% less than what Bob Leduc had shown us in the March slides. So I was
wondering what that disconnect was?
And then the second part is that with aftermarket at Pratt as strong as it was, it's probably up $250 million with
commensurate aftermarket profits, it seemed like the margin at Pratt was a little bit lower, even after going through
your comments about the losses on the new engine. So if you could further explain that? Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So on the EBIT road map for Pratt, let me answer that first, and then touch back on the
quarter question that you asked on the deliveries.
On the EBIT road map I think Paul mentioned we had about $70 million headwind from the commercial OE mix on the
OE side, right, for large commercial. That included both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada, $60 million of the
$70 million was negative engine margin, up year over year. $50 million, Paul talked about, was the headwind from
military mix that was there. And then there was another $25 million higher E&D when you strip out FX and pensions.
So that was the net negatives in the Pratt EBIT.
On the positive side you had about $80 million drop through from the higher commercial aftermarket. We had about
$40 million good news from pensions, and another [ph] $15 million (49:14) from Pratt Canada FX. So when you net all
that you're within rounding of $17 million of down year over year profit.
With regard to the deliveries I think we saw some change – slight change in the V2500 deliveries. Paul, I'm – is that...
<A - Paul Lundstrom>: Yeah. But importantly, GTF was exactly what Bob had laid out and what we had talked about
in March.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And, Akhil, so at $80 million aftermarket. I would have thought the aftermarket
profit would have been somewhat bigger, given the aftermarket revenue. But maybe some of it...
<A - Akhil Johri>: Keep in mind, George, that this includes the repair side of it as well. It's not just all spares, right?
So it has the overhaul and repairs aspect, the wrench-turning side of it, which comes with much lower margins, as you
can imagine.

And then there is always some element of mix that comes in with regard to whether it's more of the IAE deliveries,
which come with some kind of an intangible amortization that relates to the Rolls Royce payments, right? So
combination of all that is what drives that drop through of $80 million.

If your phone is on mute, please un-mute.
Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Hey, maybe Akhil, the – because you're the pessimist in the family. The cash flow
performance in the quarter and the conversion, even if you correct for the settlement charge, it did seem light. And so
getting to that 90% to 100% every year seems like a bit of a stretch. But this year you're even more looking like you're
down the road to a stretch. Is this a really 4Q-weighted load? Or do you start to see material improvement here in the
nearer term?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Well, Myles, first quarter was a little light. But it's not – again not unexpected. So adjusted for this
Pratt Canada, the Canadian royalty settlement, we were about 65%. And if you go back and look at our history, there
have been quarters where have been 44% and in fact as low as 34%, because I did look at that just to satisfy myself that
we were still on track. And we have hit 100% of net income.
So this year is with the Aero ramp, we obviously do not want to disappoint our customers. And we are making sure that
we have inventories and buffer stock and all the things that Bob Leduc talked about ahead of when our needs are to
some extent. We do expect still to be able to get to the 90% to 100% level, maybe towards the lower end of the range.
But definitely towards the 90% to 100%.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think, Myles, to keep in mind, working capital grew almost $370 million more this
year in first quarter than it did last year. And most of that was at the engine company. And that's again the back-end
load of the production build on the GTF as we do the ramp.
So naturally you're going to see the liquidation of some of that inventory. Bob is obviously more concerned I think
about making deliveries today than he is about inventory. But he understands the need to liquidate that through the
course of the year. So better to be safe than sorry I would say at this point.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. And then the dividend raise yesterday or the day before, obviously in line
with your implied EPS growth. Do we expect that to kind of be the go-forward pattern? As you accelerate your
earnings into 2017 and 2018, similarly the dividend growth would return?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think it's – as we've said we've been – maybe the thing to focus on here, Myles, is the
payout ratio. It's 41% with the last dividend raise. So while it was a modest 3% increase, last year earnings did not go
up. In fact they went down. This year a modest growth in earnings, dividend rise in line with that.

But as earnings accelerate through the end of the decade, as the top line grows as we expect, you could expect to see
that payout ratio remain in that kind of 35% to 40% range, maybe closer to the 40%.
But clearly, we've got confidence in the future. And we didn't – as we debated how much to take the dividend up, I
think this was the prudent course at 3% with a 41% payout ratio. And we continue to look at it every year.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. Thanks.

Our last question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning, thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, on first question back on GTF. Recently in the press I saw something saying the ramp
is going to be 200, 400, 600 engines per year. Want to make sure that we're still on track for kind of the 200, 400, 800?
And that you're still thinking 2018 is the peak loss?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That's exactly right. So this year Pratt is committed to just over 200 engines. Again the
majority of that's on the neo. Some of those are going to Bombardier on the C-series. That doubles next year. And then
it goes up another 200 the following year.
And to your point we'll see maximum negative engine margin in 2018. It's nice to say we're coming down the cost
curve as we're delivering these engines. Still a long way to go. But I think Bob would tell you, Bob Leduc that is, got
high confidence in hitting target cost here. And seeing those negative engine margins then start to flatten out and then
decrease somewhat, as we conclude the decade.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And I'm sure you don't want to talk about 2017, but...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Nope.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: But just a quick one there. Well, you previously commented that you would expect Otis EBIT
to – Otis and UTAS EBIT to grow in 2017. I guess now that we're a little bit further in, how do you feel about that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look, do I think they should grow? Yes. We're not going to give guidance though, David,
today on 2017. There's a lot of moving pieces here.
The Otis part especially, because of some of the continued investments we're going to make in R&D will give them
some headwind next year. It's hard to say. We're trying it in Europe. We're going to go. But generally speaking, they're
making the decisions today to take cost out to invest. And we feel good about the prospects as we go through these next
couple of years for both businesses.
Gregory J. Hayes
All right. Well, thank you everyone for listening. Again good first quarter. Paul and team will be available all day for
any follow-up questions. We thank you for listening. And we'll see you all next month at EPG. All right. Take care.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may
all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.
