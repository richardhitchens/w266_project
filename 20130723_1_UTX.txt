As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.70. That's up 5%
versus 2012, with better than expected segment operating profit growth and higher net gains. Segment op profit grew
by 15%, led by strong performance at Climate, Controls & Security [CCS], and also with the benefit of the Goodrich
and IAE [International Aero Engine] acquisitions.
Gains in the quarter exceeded restructuring by $0.05. That's compared to $0.04 last year. And taxes were a $0.13
headwind to earnings growth. You recall that last year we had about a 23% effective tax rate in the second quarter as
compared to about 28% this quarter.
So it was a solid first half of the year, even in an uneven economic environment. We've accelerated restructuring to
position the business though for future growth. Additional restructuring savings combined with good orders momentum
and easier compares in the back half give us confidence to increase the bottom end of the EPS guidance range. So as
you saw the press release, we now expect earnings per share of $600 million to $615 million growth. That's growth of
12% to 15%, an increase from the prior guidance of $585 million to $615 million.
We continue to expect double-digit earnings growth despite these uneven end markets. In the U.S., the potential Fed
tightening caused some volatility in the markets. But we still believe the economy is recovering, and we are seeing
strength in the leading sectors. Auto sales were up 8% in first half and are growing at the fastest rate in five years.
Housing starts are 24% higher year to date. And in commercial construction, the Architectural Building Index has
shown expansion in eight of the last nine months, so good progress in the U.S.
Europe, of course, is a little different story, with unemployment now over 12% and the PMI, or Purchasing Managers
Index, consistently below 50%. We didn't plan for much growth in 2013, but the fact of the matter is we're actually still
seeing a slight contraction in sales in Europe. Year-to-date sales are down about 3% across our Commercial businesses.
On the other hand, we do see continued strength in China. We're all cautiously watching the economic indicators
coming out of China. They talk about some falling imports, exports, tightening of credit markets, lower GDP forecasts.
Whether it's 7% or 7.5% GDP growth, it's still one of the fastest growing markets because fixed investment has
continued to grow. And that's driving very strong order growth at both Otis and CCS.
At Aerospace, we continue to see strong growth in the commercial aviation industry; RPM is [Revenue Passenger
Miles] up 5.6% in the month of May. Airlines are now projected to earn over $12.7 billion for the year. And while we
continue to see pressure in the military, particularly at Sikorsky, the overall aerospace industry remains very healthy.
Okay, let's talk about orders for a second. We are on slide two for those of you following along on the webcast. Talking
about economic uncertainty, it remains. But as you can see on slide two, overall our orders position we well for growth
in the second half of the year. And just as a reminder, we talked to orders in constant currency, as we normally do.
Otis, as we mentioned, very strong quarter, 22% growth in new equipment orders; and that was led by China with 35%
growth. That's 32% growth in China year to date for Otis, so a very strong recovery.
Climate, Controls & Security global equipment orders grew for the third straight quarter. This reflects the strength in
the U.S. economy, where residential HVAC orders were up 19%, but partially offset by Europe, which was down about
4% across the CCS businesses.
Turning to Aerospace, a very encouraging sign at Pratt & Whitney; after five quarters of contraction, legacy Pratt &
Whitney large commercial spares orders grew 15% organically. And importantly, this included growth across all three
major engine families, the PW2000, the PW4000, and the V2500.
At Aerospace Systems [UTAS], we saw growth for the second straight quarter, with orders up 4% on a pro forma basis.
We're still looking for more recovery in the back half, but it's good to see growth at both Pratt and UTAS on the
commercial spares side.
So in summary, despite the uneven end markets, strength in the U.S., emerging markets, and commercial aerospace are
going to offset the softness that we're seeing in Europe in defense.

Our orders momentum still points towards a recovery in the back half. But as I said in June, with year-to-date organic
sales down slightly, we're now probably going to see organic revenue growth of about 3% for the full year, which is at
the low end of our prior range. So total sales are now expected to be just around $64 billion for the year.
Turning back to Q2 results on slide three, total sales and segment op profit increased 16% and 15% respectively. That's
driven, of course, by Goodrich and IAE acquisitions and strong operating performance at CCS. Organically, sales were
flat versus prior year following a 2% decline in the first quarter.
CCS had another strong quarter, 7% operating profit growth. And margins expanded 120 basis points, as they
continued to realize savings from the integration of Carrier and F&S [Fire & Security] and capitalize on their operating
leverage.
Overall segment operating margins at UTC declined 20 basis points, with the strength at CCS more than offset by
headwinds from pension and the decline of the military business at Sikorsky.
The Goodrich and IAE acquisitions continued to exceed expectations and contribute $0.20 of earnings in the quarter.
As I mentioned, earnings per share of $1.70 included $0.05 of gains in excess of restructuring. Nineteen cents of the
gains in the quarter came from the sale of the Pratt & Whitney Power Systems business and some small tax settlements.
These were more than offset by $190 million we invested in restructuring, including $93 million at Pratt & Whitney as
we continued to reduce the cost base there.
Foreign currency, a small impact, about $0.01 in the quarter, and free cash flow, 101% of net income; we repurchased
an additional $335 million of stock, and we expect to buy back a similar amount here early in the third quarter.
So I'll stop there for a second and let Jay take you through the segment results, and we'll come back and talk about full
year. Jay?
Jay Malave
Thanks, Greg.
Turning to page four, Otis sales improved 4% at constant currency in the quarter, led by solid high single-digit growth
in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. New equipment sales were up in all regions, led by
double-digit growth in China and Russia. Operating profit was up 1% at constant currency. Solid growth in China and
other emerging markets was offset by continued weakness in developed Europe and transition costs associated with the
factory transformation in North America.
New equipment order growth was strong, up 22% at constant currency, with double-digit growth in Americas and Asia,
led by a 35% improvement in China. Orders in Europe were down mid-single digit.
Given continued pressure in Europe and the significantly weaker yen, we now expect full-year profit growth at Otis of
$75 million to $100 million versus the prior range of $100 million to $150 million. We expect profit improvement to
come in the second half based on conversion of the higher new equipment backlog, especially in China, continued
savings from restructuring, and completion of the factory transformation in North America.
On slide five, Climate, Controls & Security increased profits 7% in the quarter on 1% lower sales, resulting in another
sharp increase in margins, up 120 basis points from prior year to 16.9%. Organic sales were up 1%, with mixed results
across geographies. Europe was down mid-single digit on continued economic weakness in the region, while Americas
was up low single digit, driven by 13% growth in the residential HVAC business. China was also up mid-single digit
while Asia overall was flattish, driven by a decline in Australia. Transicold was up 11%.
While the organic growth in the quarter was modest, this was the first quarter of growth in over a year, and we
anticipate acceleration through the remainder of the year.

On profit, CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth, driven by strong conversion on the higher organic sales,
restructuring and productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security and
lower commodity costs.
Global commercial HVAC orders were flattish, with 10% growth in Asia offsetting declines in North America and
Europe. Orders for global Fire & Security products were up mid-single digit, while the fuel businesses were down a
similar amount. Transicold orders were up 5%, and commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were down 5%.
With solid results in the first half and anticipated organic improvement, we now expect profit growth to be in the range
of $175 million to $200 million, up from $150 million to $200 million on low single-digit organic sales growth at CCS.
Turning to Aerospace on slide six, at Pratt & Whitney sales and profit increased 5% in the second quarter. Higher sales
were driven by the consolidation of IAE and transfer of the Aero Power business. Organically, sales were down 6%
year over year due to lower military engine shipments, partially offset by higher large commercial engine OEM sales.
Large commercial spares sales were up 2% organically over last year's second quarter. On a pro forma basis, including
consolidated IAE sales in both quarters, large commercial spares sales were up 5%. Profit growth was driven by the
benefits from the IAE consolidation, restructuring savings, and lower E&D, partially offset by lower organic sales and
higher pension costs. In addition, the absence of favorable one-time items in last year's second quarter offset the benefit
of a commercial contract closeout this quarter.
As Greg mentioned, Pratt & Whitney large commercial spares orders were up 15% organically. Based on year-to-date
sales, however, we now expect large commercial spares to be flattish for the year organically from up mid-single digits.
Pratt & Whitney's proactive cost reduction and restructuring measures give us confidence in its full-year profit growth
outlook of $100 million to $150 million on mid-single-digit sales growth.
UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with operating profit of $532 million on sales of $3.3 billion.
On a pro forma year-over-year basis, sales were up mid-single digit, with commercial OEM up double digits and
commercial aftermarket up mid-single digit, partially offset by declines in military OEM and military aftermarket of
mid-single digit and low single digit respectively. Orders for commercial spares grew 4% on a pro forma
year-over-year basis. Compared with the first quarter, profit was up 4% on 2% higher sales driven by solid conversion
on the sales growth and continued synergies capture.
With the first half of the year complete, we now expect full-year sales to be around $13.5 billion, at the low end of the
previous guidance range of $13.5 billion to $14 billion. We continue to expect operating profit of around $2.1 billion in
spite of lower sales due to continued cost containment and better than expected synergy traction.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide eight, operating profit decreased 24% on 3% lower sales. During the quarter Sikorsky
shipped a total of 62 aircraft, including 47 based on military platforms and 15 commercial. The sales decrease was
driven by lower military aftermarket volumes as well as unfavorable military aircraft mix, partially offset by higher
commercial volumes. The profit decline was driven by lower sales as well as headwinds from the Multiyear 8 margin
reset, and higher pension and export compliance costs.
For the full year, we continue to expect profit to be down $100 million to $150 million on low single-digit sales
growth. We expect profit improvement in the second half from the benefits of higher aircraft volumes and restructuring
savings.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg to wrap up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, thanks, Jay.
So I'm happy to report that with the completion of the Rocketdyne divestiture in June, we are now done with the major
portfolio transformation. The entire organization took on a huge task over the last two years to complete two significant

acquisitions, integrate new organizations, divest over $4 billion worth of businesses, and paid down $7 billion of debt.
And I'll tell you; the team executed flawlessly. We now have a portfolio that's well positioned for long-term growth and
we've capitalized on the big urbanization and commercial aerospace ramp.
Let's go over some other highlights in the quarter. We announced significant wins across our Aerospace businesses at
the Paris Air Show. Pratt & Whitney announced orders for over 1,000 engines, including orders for the launch of the
second generation Embraer Regional Jet. Customers see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option
orders now for over 4,500 engines.
The UTAS Aerospace Systems business is also well positioned with the electric system, [ph] the cell (15:25), wheels
and brakes other systems that Embraer. They also secured new long-term MRO contracts from several airlines and
supported Airbus in the certification of the A400M.
Sikorsky continues to see strong international demand, announcing orders for 11 S-76D search-and-rescue helicopters
for Japan and six additional S-92s for the Chinese oil and gas market.
On the commercial side, our businesses continued to win key orders. Otis was awarded the largest elevator contract
ever in India to install 670 elevators and escalators for the Hyderabad Metro. Otis also won a contract to install 255
units at Tianjin 117, which at nearly 600 meters will be one of the tallest buildings in China. CCS was awarded a
contract in the quarter with China Resources Land to provide HVAC and fire detection systems in residential and
commercial buildings across China over the next two years.
So the investment in innovative new products is paying off. We're delivering real value to our customers and securing
key orders that will drive top line growth well into the future.
Okay, let's take a look at the rest of 2013. As I mentioned, we announced the earnings of $600 million to $615 million.
That's at the top half of our prior range and represents earnings growth of 12% to 15%. A relentless focus on cost
reduction will allow us to deliver double-digit earnings growth.
We continue to invest in restructuring as well. We spent about $240 million in the first half of the year, and the
businesses have good payback projects in the pipeline. With almost $435 million of one-time gains realized to date on a
pre-tax basis, we now expect about $450 million of both gains and restructurings for the full year. That's up from our
prior estimate of $350 million each. So you can expect about $100 million of restructuring in each of the next two
quarters.
Strong cash flow, of course, remains a hallmark of UTC. We continue to expect cash flow will equal or exceed net
income for the year. We paid down $1.2 billion of debt in the second quarter. That's almost $1.6 billion in the first half.
And we have an additional $1 billion due in the fourth quarter, so we'll pay down about $2.5 billion of debt this year.
We're also buying back shares. The remaining $335 million of original share repurchase plan will be completed here
early in the third quarter. And we expect to do a little bit more towards the end of the third quarter or early fourth
quarter, assuming cash flow remains strong.
So the portfolio transformation is behind us. We're focused on integration and execution, and we are seeing a gradual
recovery in our end markets. The order books support a resumption of organic growth in the back half, and we're
confident in the revised EPS guidance.
So with that, Pablo, let's open the call for questions if we can.

Mr. Copeland, if you wouldn't mind checking your mute button. Let me move on to our next question in queue from
Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you, good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Jeff.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, just a couple questions. Greg, first just on share repurchase, so you're going to blow
through your placeholder really quick, but it still sounds like you're soft pedaling in the back half of the year. Can you
just give us some thought on how cash looks in the back half, your efforts to maybe repatriate some foreign cash that
you talked about, and why there wouldn't be room for that repo to come up a little bit more?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I'd like to take issue with the soft pedaling on the share buyback. We're going to take it up. I
think the question is how much. I said maybe between $200 million, $300 million, $400 million, and it will really
depend upon strong cash flows in the back half of the year. As you know, CapEx is on a ramp. We spent a little over
$600 million year to date and we've got a plan for about $1.7 billion, so there is still a call on cash in the back half of
the year which is a little higher than what we expect.
We also, as I said, are paying down about $2.5 billion of debt. And you recall, going into the year we talked about only
about $1 billion of debt due. So I think we've been aggressive on the debt paydown. We've got CapEx in front of us,
but we still have room to take share buyback up. And we've still got that $1 billion placeholder out there for M&A, not
a lot going on but there's also always a possibility something could still happen for the year. So I think we're in line to
do more share buyback. And clearly if the M&A doesn't happen, it gives us a little bit more room. But I'm just going to
tell you, there are other calls on cash right now.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right, got it, understood. Also, could you just give us your quick take on what your pension
tailwind looks like for next year if you were to snap the line today at these interest rates?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, so obviously, there's going to be tailwind next year in the pension. There are a lot of
things going on there. First of all, you've got the fact that four years ago we decided to sunset the plan, so we've taken
the tough actions and that gives us tailwind. We also have losses from 2008 that come off, and you've got a higher
interest rate. I think right now we snap the line at about 4.6% on a discount rate versus 3.9% last year. You guys know
how to do the math on that. It's about $28 million – $29 million for every ten basis points. So there's definite tailwind
from pension next year. Again, it's a little early because there are other assumptions that go into the pension number,
mortality and all that. But for the most part, there will be a pretty good tailwind next year.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then finally and I'll move on. But just on China, Otis, can you just give us a little more
color on where you're seeing the strength? Is it broad or is it Western China, and just what's going on competitively
with pricing in particular?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, so we talked about it. I think orders on a constant currency basis were up 35%. I think
actual FX was 39% orders growth, and sales were up about 20%. We also saw pretty good traction on the service
business with sales up 25%, so good strength there. Pricing remains tough, but the margins are holding up in China
because we continue to be able to take cost out of the supply chain and leverage on the higher volumes.
As I think about it specifically from a market perspective, where we're seeing the growth, residential is obviously the
key. It is the biggest market for Otis Elevators and it is very, very strong still despite some of the cooling measures.
We've also seen commercial office building start to improve. Social housing has leveled off. I think Otis would tell you
today that the market is growing a lot faster than what we had anticipated going into the year, and I think these order
rates more than support that.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning. Thank you, nice numbers, a couple things, Greg, and I'll rattle through them.
One on interest expense, I can't ever seem to get it right. You're refinancing; you're taking some charges for doing some
things. Could you just give us a range of what you think you could look at for interest expense for the full year?
<A - Jay Malave>: Howard, for the year, we're in the range of about $950 million is what you can expect it should be
for the year.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Okay. You took some fairly substantial actions at Pratt to lower costs. Could you talk about
some of the benefits from the operating levers that you expect in the second half of the year and going forward given
the change in mix and other things?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, so back half of the year at Pratt, obviously spares are not going to be as we had
expected originally. Going in, we talked about 5% growth or so in spares going into the year; probably more like
flattish given how low the first half was, but again good orders momentum. We should clearly get some traction out of
spares in the back half of the year.
We took out – I think about 575 people took advantage of the voluntary early retirement program that we just offered.
That will help, again, in the back half of the year to add some earnings growth to Pratt. We're taking some other actions
around the business as well to take advantage of some of the cost reduction opportunities that are out there. R&D is
coming down as we had expected, about probably $75 million to $100 million I think. It was down about $14 million in
the second quarter and $35 million in the first quarter, so we're halfway there in terms of the R&D reduction.
So a lot of good things going on at Pratt; spares are coming back. This is a tough year at Pratt. We've got this big trough
because military engines are coming down significantly, although mil [military] spares have held up pretty well. And
you've got an increase in commercial shipments which, as you know, come with a little bit of a bill.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: You changed management at Pratt Commercial, separated the organization into two. What
are the marching orders for the two gentlemen going forward on that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, so Todd Kallman, who has led that business as President for the last seven years, he is
the guy that has been at the forefront of the GTF marketing campaign. And I've got to tell you, he's done a hell of a job,
but it's a huge job. And I think what we have decided to do, what Dave Hess and Alain [Rondeau] have done is to split
that up between an aftermarket focus and an OEM focus. And so Dave Brantner is going to take over as head of the
OEM side of the commercial engine business and be present there. And Matthew Bromberg, who is head of our
corporate strategy development group for the last couple of years, he's going to lead the aftermarket. His focus is
simply on making sure we have a flawless launch on the GTF and making sure that we capture the aftermarket channel
going forward on all of these five GTF platforms that we've won. So again, I think it makes a lot of sense. Mr. Brantner
is going to focus on getting engines delivered, getting costs down, winning new campaigns. And Matthew is going to
focus on winning that aftermarket and continuing to drive growth in the aftermarket.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I just have one last question. The 787 has had some challenges in operation. They were very
minor ones, but some of it comes back to working on and enhancing the reliability of the electrical system. What are
you doing there and can you talk about some of the improvements you've make already?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, Howard, as you know, I think with any new airplane, there are always teething
problems and we've had a couple issues on the electric power system. We've worked closely with Boeing. During the
production hiatus, I think we took the opportunity to go out there and improve reliability of some of the power panels
where we had a couple of issues, and there are just constant teething problems. But again, because the 787 has gotten so
much publicity, I think people are hearing a lot more about it. But the fact is this plane is as reliable or more reliable
than the 777 was when it was introduced into service, and our systems are doing very, very well. So look, we've got a
lot of systems, nine major systems on the aircraft. Each one might have a minor glitch. But I think overall The Boeing
Company would tell you that we're working very closely with them to get all these things behind us.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, Greg.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hi, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Greg, a couple things in CC&S. Maybe can you just give us a sense of how you're
thinking about the second half there? Transicold, you had revenues up 11% but orders I think you said up 5%, so that
looks like maybe it slows a bit. Can you gauge the different components of CC&S in the second half?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think we can go through all the CCS businesses. Obviously, Transicold is an important part
but not the only part. But we did see decent orders growth in the second quarter, and sales were up mostly because of a
very easy compare last year. You recall last year on the container side, we didn't get any orders I think from May
through September in that business. So the compares get very easy in the back half of the year, and we continue to see
pretty good traction on the container side.
We're also on the truck trailer side both in North America and Europe seeing good order growth. Europe surprisingly is
strong given where the economy is, but that's all coming from cold chain expansion in the Eastern European area. So
that business is doing well. Thinking about res in the U.S., again, very strong orders growth, good revenue growth, and
we think that trend is going to continue and will support a very strong back half of the year.
So if you think about it, the first half of the year we didn't get much growth out of CCS in total, but we did get growth
in some key markets. And again, China was another place where we saw good growth in CCS. Orders I think in
commercial HVAC were up about 15%, 16%. F&S products were up over 30%. So there is good momentum in
emerging markets despite the fact that Europe overall was down, I don't know, 1% I guess on commercial and a couple
of points on the F&S business.
So lots of moving pieces; we've taken the revenue guidance down for CCS. We now expect probably around 3%
organic revenue growth for the full year, which still indicates pretty solid growth in the back half of the year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just – so taking up the restructuring, in terms of
paybacks, what kind of year-over-year savings do you now expect in 2014 from the actions you're taking?
<A - Jay Malave>: A lot of these programs I'd average about two years, Shannon. So this year, we're talking about
incremental $100-plus million, and so you're probably looking next year in that range of another $100 million of these
actions.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And so that total, in terms of the total $450 million, how much year-over-year saves
through?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As Jay said, you get about $100 million of benefit this year because we've taken a lot of
these actions in the first half of the year, and a lot of them are quicker payback. That's the voluntary early retirement
program that we've done at Pratt, some of the other head count actions we've taken at CCS and UTAS.
Some of the other things that we're still doing in the back half of the year will be a little bit longer payback, probably
1.5 years to 2 years. So let's call it $100 million this year and then $100 million to $125 million next year of savings, so
there's probably $250 million of run rate savings by the end of next year.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Just following up actually on the restructuring, Greg, are you seeing the same payback
opportunities now on some of these new projects that you were a year ago or two years ago? And when you look just
across the company and you look going forward, do you think there's continued opportunity to – the same kind of
quality opportunities as we look into next year as you've seen in the past?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We came into this year thinking we'd probably do $150 million to $200 million of
restructuring. The fact is restructuring is a way of life here at UTC. It's how we drive productivity. And I'd tell you, the
units continue to come up with good payback programs. Now there are some things out there, some of these structural
factory actions that we take, take a little bit longer. Obviously, some of the CCS things – I'm sorry, CCS – some of the
UTAS actions that we're taking as we consolidate Goodrich will take a little bit longer to pay back. But on average,
even with all that said, we're still looking at two years or less payback for all of these programs.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Could you provide an update on CMH [Cyclone Maritime Helicopter]? There were
some – there was a media flurry the last few days just with some implications that they're still not taking helicopters. I
know that's not new, but just an update on the program. And I guess underlying the question, what is your level of
confidence that this doesn't turn into a much, much bigger deal down the road?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think I would tell you. I feel better about CMH today than we have probably in the last
year. We are gaining momentum with the customer. I think importantly, we're going to start pilot training in August, so
another month. We've got four helicopters up in Shearwater, Canada that's going to start pilot training. We've got
another five helicopters that are sitting up in Plattsburgh, New York ready to be delivered. There are two more in flight
tests. The eight that we've talked about going into the year, I think we've got a solid plan to deliver those. There are still
some issues, obviously, to work through with our customer. But I think again, we're seeing positive momentum there.
I don't think we're going to see a big, big bad news item come out of here. I think you saw some things in the Canadian
press with the Sea King, 50 years in service. And it has been a great helicopter; but again, 50 years and they're starting
to have some issues with that helicopter. We've got the best maritime helicopters sitting right there ready to go. So I
think it's all pretty positive right now. I think Mick [Maurer] has really done a good job with the whole team in turning
this thing around.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, and then just one more quick one. On UTAS spares, do you still expect high single
digit or 10%? I forget your exact guidance. I know you dropped the sales guidance a little bit there to the lower end of
the range, but specifically on spares.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Those spares at UTAS, I think we're about 4% on a pro forma basis in the quarter they were
up. And for the full year, we had talked about 10%. It's probably going to be more like 7% or so by the time we get all
done just because we haven't seen the first half growth, but we continue to see pretty solid growth. Look at parts versus
provisioning. You remember we sell both spare parts as well as end items. Spare parts in the quarter were up over 10%.
Provisioning was down about 10%. So provisioning is a little bit lumpy. I've talked to the guys yesterday. They see

they've got line of sight on the provisioning number to hit the full year, so we're pretty confident we're going to get it
mid-7%, maybe 8% range.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, very good. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Ron.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Just a couple. On the Pratt orders, can you describe maybe in more detail where you've seen
them coming from? Is it from – do you see more from the freighter market, or where has the order activity pickup come
from?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think, obviously, freighter is an important part, but I think most of the orders have actually
come on the commercial airline side. As Jay mentioned, I think we've talked about in the script, PW2000 spares were
up significantly. The PW4000s were up over 15%, and the V2500s were up almost 15%, so we're really seeing strength
across the board. Inductions into the engine centers are down year over year and content hasn't really improved. But we
know as these planes keep flying, the customers need parts, and they can go only so long. And I think Louis has been
talking about this. Whether it's four quarters, five quarters, or six quarters, eventually spares come back, and I think
that's what we saw this quarter. And we expect that kind of momentum to continue into the back half of the year.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: And is there any regional strength? Are you seeing it stronger coming out of North America,
Europe, out of Asia, maybe if you could characterize that?
<A - Jay Malave>: Ron, the Pratt legacy fleet is more concentrated in North America and Asia, so we saw that pretty
much across the board there. The V2500 fleet is a little bit more broad-based excluding Europe. Again, there wasn't any
one particular region that really stood out one way or the other. It was pretty even.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay, great, and then maybe one more, Greg, if you don't mind, a much bigger picture
question. Now that the portfolio reshaping has settled down, what has to happen for you guys to feel comfortable again
about maybe adding something else to the mix? Is there a bias towards Aero? Is there a bias towards Industrial? How
should we think about – and I know this is a longer-term question – about where you want to go with the portfolio over
the next several years?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think, as we've said, the portfolio, at least for the near term, is set. I think we're 55% Aero,
45% Commercial. Eventually, you'd like to probably get back to a 50:50 split. But for right now, we like the hand
we've got, especially with what's going on, on the commercial Aero side. So the focus right now is really on execution.
The next deal I would tell you again, as you think about the 50:50 split, will probably be on the commercial side. I
know Geraud [Darnis] has some ideas. Pedro [Baranda] has some ideas, nothing really imminent, though. And I think
again, we've got a lot on our plate right now. Again, we like the hand we've got. Urbanization continues to drive or will
drive strong organic growth for years to come on the Commercial side and also helps on the Aero side. So I wouldn't
look for anything big coming out of UTX for a few years.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Just back on the restructuring, the incremental $100 million, can you talk about which
segments those are in? And then related, what are the favorable items that are coming in to offset that that weren't
expected earlier?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Most of the favorable items you've actually already seen. We had a gain this quarter from
Pratt Power, the sale of Pratt Power Systems. We also had a couple of small tax settlements out there with the IRS that
gave us a little bit. There are maybe one or two more small divestitures on the CCS side that might generate a little bit
more gain. So the gains are pretty much done.
As far as the actual spend in the back half of the year, I think you'll see that across the business. UTAS, again, we've
talked about this. They've got about $100 million spend planned for the year. They've got some work to do to get to that
$100 million, but they've got a lot of projects lined up. Pratt continues to look for things on the aftermarket side to do in
terms of consolidation, more to come there. Obviously, Otis in Europe has some work to do with sales continuing to
atrophy there on the service side. Pedro and the team I know are looking for ways to take some structural costs out of
Europe, so I would expect more to come there. And really again, everywhere we look we find opportunities to reduce
costs. It's amazing what Geraud and the CCS team have done is they've brought F&S and Carrier together. They're on a
run rate to probably take $200 million of cost out of that business, which is incredible. So there are always
opportunities, and it will be spread across all the businesses.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay, and then you talk about for Otis the profit being a little bit worse because of Europe
and the weaker yen. Are those about equal, and is there anything that's a positive move that's offsetting that?
<A - Jay Malave>: Sam, if you look at the move from the midpoint to the midpoint, you're talking about $38 million.
Two-thirds of that was the currency, driven by the yen. And then the other third was essentially just the net weakness
from Europe, partially offset by higher restructuring and some favorability in China.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then a last question is you had talked, I guess it was last month, about that F100
court case. I guess as we look out into the remainder of the year, is there an additional reserve that we should be
looking for or any cash impact as we go forward?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No and no. For those of you that – what we're talking about here is the FEC or Fighter
Engine Competition that started in 1983. I think I had just been out of college a year then, so it's not my fault. The
whole issue here is we have the case. We had won at the trial court. The government appealed it. It was remanded back
to the trial judge. Right now, based upon outside legal counsel and our own review, we don't believe – or we believe
that we will prevail on appeal. So we have not taken any reserve associated with this, and we would not expect to have
any cash impact on this for quite some time.
The way these court cases work, my General Counsel is sitting here, it will probably be year and a half or so before we
ever get any resolution on this thing again and it has been going on for 30 years. So we continue to believe the
government wasn't harmed. And you should take a look at the 10-Q, which we're going to file on Friday. We'll have
some expanded disclosure in there, so I'd go through all that. If you have questions give us a call. But bottom line is we
think we're going to prevail on appeal.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Peter Arment of Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Good morning, Greg and Jay.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: First question I guess on Pratt & Whitney, I get the margin form that's there is really from the
consolidation and some of the restructuring gains. But I was surprised just given the amount of commercial engine
ramps, particularly in large commercial. Is that the level we should be expecting for the second half with a big
sequential uptick?
<A - Jay Malave>: On the OE?
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: On the OE side, yes.
<A - Jay Malave>: The OE should be growing a little bit in the second half. In the quarter, we had higher shipments,
particularly in the wide bodies with the GP7000 in the A380. And for the year, we're expecting GP7000 to still be up
year over year, so we will see some growth there. Other than that, I don't know that it will be significantly higher than
where it is today. I think what we did in the quarter is, generally speaking, probably where you'll be.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay, that's helpful, and then just a quick one I guess on Sikorsky. I get the domestic DOD
pressures. Can you just give us an update and color on some of the major international pursuits that are out there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think Sikorsky continues to make good progress on the international side. We're working
with Turkey on a relatively large opportunity there with the Turkish utility helicopter program. We expect to get
something finalized by the end of the year there. The India Navy contract has been a little bit of a disappointment just
because it keeps pushing out to the left. But we've had good traction in Brazil. We've had good traction in Colombia
and the Middle East. So again, there are lots of foreign military opportunities out there, and Sikorsky continues to win
more than its fair share.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thank you, Peter.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Can you comment, give us some color on the impact at Carrier of the blistering heat wave
we've had in the U.S. and Europe in July?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's good to own an air conditioning company when it's hot out. We've talked about this, Cai.
Orders were up almost 20% in the quarter on the res side.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, but you basically didn't see the heat wave in June. You saw it in July, which is after.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Right. And so sales were up 12% – 13%. Orders were up even more. The fact is it takes
some time to actually see that come through the channel. It's two-step distribution, so we sell into our major distributors
who then sell out to the dealers. So we would expect to see some level of good news yet here in the July – August, and
I think orders have continued to be pretty good.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. At Pratt, at Paris you were talking about things being somewhat better. And it looks
like things were definitely more than somewhat better particularly on the PW4000. Was there sequential improvement,
as I read, as you went through that quarter, and give us any color on what you're seeing in July?

<A - Jay Malave>: Sequentially in the quarter, sales were up about 15%, and orders were up over 30% sequentially.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: I'm talking about at Pratt, the PW4000.
<A - Jay Malave>: That was just in total. On the PW4000 itself, I'd have to get back to you on it, Cai.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Cai, the fact is we've started to see orders pick up in April and May, and I think it just
accelerated into June. We had a very good month in June of bookings. It's hard to point to any one thing in particular
other than just this pent-up demand that we've been talking about for the last year. So again, one month or one quarter
does not a trend make, but we feel good about the back half of the year. Frankly, as we're sitting here on July 23, I think
orders are okay here. But I don't think I want to be giving order data on a weekly basis here; it's pretty lumpy.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Just in terms of color, did this sequential improvement continue in July as best you can tell?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Cai, let us get back to you on that. I don't really recall because I'm focused more on second
quarter then third quarter. but we'll take a look and see if there's anything significant there.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Terrific. And the last question, you mentioned that military aftermarket was weak at
Sikorsky. Maybe give us a broader view of the impact you're seeing or expect to see from sequestration and basically
military aftermarket across the company.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Military sales or military aftermarket sales were down about 25% at Sikorsky in the quarter,
and orders were down about 40%. It's hard to delineate between just the budget cuts and what's going on as the
overseas contingency operations wind down versus sequestration. There has been some impact from sequestration just
because it's taking us longer to get orders processed through the government, to get contracts amended, and things like
that done. But it's a pretty tough environment on the aftermarket side. But not surprisingly, the overseas contingency
operations, the funding is down about half. And Sikorsky, of course, was a big beneficiary of the Afghanistan
campaign. So some of that is just natural, and a little bit is also from sequestration.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Thanks very much, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Greg, just a couple of quick balance sheet questions. You've got around – I think it's like $5
billion of cash on the balance sheet. Do you think that's a good, safe number to keep going forward or do you see an
opportunity to bring that down going forward?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The issue with the $5 billion, Rob, as you know, is most of that is sitting overseas, if not all
of that right now. We use that cash on a daily basis. We've got an intercompany lending program where we lend out to
the businesses for working capital needs. But that's not $5 billion.
You've also got a lot of cash, over $1 billion sitting in China that continues to grow as the businesses there continue to
generate strong cash flows, but hard to get at. So how much do we really need? Probably half of what's on the books.
The other half of it is just hard to get at and quite frankly, from a tax perspective, very expensive to bring back to the
U.S.
We've talked a lot about this. One of the benefits of that foreign cash is it does give you the opportunity to make
investments overseas and to do acquisitions overseas. So as you think about the M&A agenda, that's probably where to
look next.

<Q - Rob Stallard>: Great. And then secondly on the balance sheet, you mentioned you've got about another $1
billion of debt you want to pay down this year. If you look at it over the longer term, what's your thinking on debt
repayment on say a five-year period?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, we've got – the $1 billion that's due in December is the 18-month floating-rate note that
we issued last May. That will naturally get paid off. And then I would say there's no debt payment due next year,
although I would expect we'd probably do another $1 billion of paydown next year and probably another $1 billion of
paydown the following year, trying to get back into that solid A range with the rating agencies.
So again, I think I would model $1 billion – $1.5 billion of paydown each of the next few years, and there's not much
due after that. But again, I think we'll continue to deleverage until we see an opportunity to do something more
significant on the M&A side.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: That's great. Thanks, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi, thanks. Yes, I just had a question on Otis profits. Looking at the guidance, it seems
that you're assuming around sort of flattish margins year on year in the second half after they were down about 70 bps
in the first half. I just wondered. Does that guidance embed any sequential or year-on-year improvement in your
European aftermarket volume or price?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, in fact I think Europe in the first half has been a drag, probably over $40 million of
headwind here in the quarter – from first half, rather, from Otis's service business in Europe. We think that's starting to
stabilize, although there's still a little bit of pressure, particularly in southern Europe. Year to date, Otis has essentially
flat earnings. We've taken the guidance down to $75 million to $100 million. A piece of that was currency; a piece of
that's Europe. But with this very strong orders momentum that we've seen here in North America as well as China, I
think the back half of the year should be very good for Otis, and they should get back on the path for earnings growth
and should be able to hold margins as well.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks. And then on the overall business, I think you mentioned 3% organic sales
growth for the full year. You're running at about minus 1% in the first half. So does that mean we should expect
mid-single-digit organic sales growth already in Q3 because otherwise you'll need double-digit growth in Q4?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It will pick up probably in that mid-single digits in Q3, and Q4 will be even a little bit better.
Again, if you think about these Otis orders that we're getting today, it's about a six-month turnaround time for the
European – sorry, for the China orders. The other businesses are a little bit longer cycle than that. But spares, again,
order rates were good. I think spares at Pratt were up 15% organically. Sales were only up 2%, so a very strong
book-to-bill. So sales will pick up again as we move into the third quarter. And then lastly, I'd just remind you that
CMH will deliver in the fourth quarter. We've got eight helicopters. That's about $400 million of revenue out of
Sikorsky just in the last quarter.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks, and just lastly a quick one. CapEx is up about 50% the last six months. Is that a
good run rate for the second half as well?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: In fact, it's going to pick up even a little bit more. I think we've spent over $600 million first
half of the year. We've got $1.7 billion planned. And that's really being driven by the Aerospace guys as they continue
to ramp up or facilitize for the ramp up in production that we're seeing on the commercial Aero side and the new GTF
platforms.

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: I'm interested in UTAS. You talked about provisioning being down a little bit. But I would
think going forward with 787 growth, you would see some real benefits from provisioning going forward pretty soon.
So I'm interested in how you look at the 787 and UTAS right now both in terms of provisioning, but also in terms of
any impact we might see with respect to margins on OE deliveries.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So provisioning obviously is a little bit slower in the first half of the year than what we had
expected because of the production delays at Boeing. But again, as I mentioned before, we see pretty good provisioning
picking up in the back half of the year, especially as all these new customers come online. Boeing's going – I think
right now we're at seven a month. They're on track to get to 10 a month. We're going to support that, and that's actually
going to drive some good provisioning orders. Keep in mind, about half of our customers are on a CARE program,
which is where we actually do the provisioning ourselves and then charge a flight-hour payment to the airline. So we're
not getting quite the pickup that we had historically on some of the new program introductions. But from a
return-on-investment standpoint, it's a really good program. It benefits both the airlines and UTAS, so good back half
of the year.
On the OE side, it's still a pretty tough story. We've got about $6.5 million (sic) [$6.5 billion] (53:45) of OE content,
and the margins are awful and we've got a lot of work to do on cost reduction yet on 787. We've talked about this.
We're working with The Boeing Company trying to identify cost reduction opportunities to take cost out to save both
them and us some money but it's a tough slog right now. And there's a lot of work to do on cost reduction, particularly
on the Aero structure side of the business out in Chula Vista.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: I'm also interested. When you look broadly at the whole business you've done quite a bit of
restructuring over the last couple years. It looks like it has been very successful in terms of delivering better margins,
getting costs down. But now when you look ahead, you've gotten some very encouraging orders in this last quarter. Do
you see a point here where you're transitioning to really a different way to think about the company in terms of more
growth, potentially less restructuring because you may not need to get your fixed cost base down much more? When
can you get comfortable there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think as soon as we've turned the quarter on organic growth. And I think as we exit the year
if we do as we expect, which will be on a 5% or 6% run rate going out of the year, I think the need to do further
structural cost reduction, while it never goes away, I think again the focus will be on delivering on the organic growth.
And that just gives us huge operating leverage. You can imagine, CCS grew profits in the first half of the year on really
no revenue growth; it's all cost takeout, and that has really been the story of the first half of the year. I've got to tell you;
it's a lot more fun to see the top line growing and to focus on satisfying customer demands than restructuring. But
restructuring never goes away; we're always looking for productivity and room to grow margins.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: So you're comfortable that with the restructuring efforts you've done and you have underway
right now, you haven't done anything to your base that would constrain your growth. You're basically getting to a point
where you're prepared for it. Is that fair?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That's exactly right. On the Aerospace side specifically, we moved some work to lower-cost
locations, trying to consolidate work across the UTAS business. There's still more work to do for the Goodrich
Hamilton Sundstrand consolidation standpoint, but we feel very comfortable with where we are with the footprint.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Okay, very good. Thank you.
