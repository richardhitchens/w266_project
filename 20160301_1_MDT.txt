MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Medtronic's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent
any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
Ryan Weispfenning
Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. During
the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief
Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 third quarter, which ended on January
29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued, for the first time, a presentation that provides additional details on our
revenue performance, and as result, have reduced our prepared revenue-by-division commentary in Gary's section.
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements
and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional
information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the

SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any
non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter
of fiscal year 2015, and all year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which
adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien PLC in the prior-year comparison,
aligning Covidien's prior-year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in
the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us.
This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6%, in the upper half of our
mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.06, growing at 17% on a
comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 1,150 basis points of leverage, significantly above our baseline
expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points.
Our performance in Q3 was solid, with sustained execution resulting in another quarter of market outperformance. We
continue to deliver on our three growth strategies: therapy innovation, globalization and economic value, which are
driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company.
Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter to quarter, indicative of the challenges we are absorbing
in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the
sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single-digit range continues to build with each
passing quarter.
In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage as we realize our committed cost synergies
which, combined with our financial leverage, drove high-teens EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3.
Through FY 2018 as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high end of, or exceed our EPS
leverage goal of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize
foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom line on a reported basis as it is for most
multinational companies of our size and diversity.
We're attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging
programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline,
investing for our future while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns to our
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth with 200 basis
points to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders
through dividend growth and share repurchases. The expected net result is creating enormous value, with sustainable
double-digit total shareholder returns.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have three growth priorities stemming
from our overall strategies: new therapies; emerging markets; and services and solutions, with specific growth
expectations for each. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals.
In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new products and our pipeline remains robust. Our
new therapies growth factor accounted for nearly 2/3 of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350
basis points, at the high end of our goal of 150 basis points to 350 basis points. Based on our pipeline and product
breadth, we believe performance in the upper half of this range is sustainable over the long term.

In our Cardiac and Vascular group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products
that are helping to create important, rapidly growing Med Tech markets such as Transcatheter Aortic Valve
Replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons.
CVG is also seeing highly differentiated new products drive growth in its base businesses. In drug-eluting stents, our
Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in
Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx. In high
power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a
multiyear high share position.
Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG market and help
protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MR-Conditional CRT-D devices, which recently received
FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe. We also continue to make progress in bringing our
MICRA Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan, and we had a successful FDA Advisory Panel on this
technology two weeks ago.
Our longer-term CVG pipeline is also robust with potentially disruptive therapies like our drug-filled stent, Intrepid
Transcatheter Microvalve and Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies group
grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that
advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above-market growth.
Looking ahead, the majority of MITG's growth will come from five key growth drivers: within Surgical Solutions,
open to Minimally Invasive Surgery, or MIS, gastrointestinal cancer and lung cancer; and within PMR, end-stage renal
disease and respiratory compromise. Of these, the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open to
MIS strategy, which is focused on sustainable long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery,
transitioning open surgery to MIS and advancing MIS technologies.
Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions, supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of Bellco last
month. Bellco has a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of Bellco with
our legacy renal access business and our internally developed portable dialysis system offers a complete product
solution for end-stage renal disease.
To fuel the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expects to launch
more than 20 products through the end of fiscal year 2017, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and
approximately 25% in PMR. These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative
revenues over the next three years.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis,
better treatment, foster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In
Neurovascular, our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the
four clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our
Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device, a segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in
size by 2020.
In Surgical Technologies, we are seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm O2 Surgical Imaging System.
In Spine, despite boasting mid-single-digit growth in international core spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3
results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. core spine. We're focused in executing
our turnaround plan in spine.
Our primary focus is growing our market share through what we are calling speed-to-scale product launches.
Speed-to-scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence of new products as a result of faster innovation cycles
and launching these products at scale, with sets available for the entire market. These new products will also be
combined with enabling technologies, biologics and targeted physician training at the time of launch.

The goal is to constantly innovate procedures, such as OLIF and TLIF and improve upon their outcomes. We have
several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Solera Voyager and our elevated expandable interbody
device, both of which are expected to improve our share in TLIF procedures, an area where we've been struggling. This
quarter, we will launch the ATLANTIS ESSENTIALS, another cervical plate system, the first product in our spine
essentials platform. Spine essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more
streamlined pre-sterilized sets.
Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technologies with our spine
instrumentation, offering a differentiated surgical synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus
our efforts in gaining share in biografts, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio including INFUSE.
We're challenged this quarter in neuromodulation division as well. While we continue to make progress against our
FDA consent decree commitments and are focused on resolving this matter, our drug pump revenue has been affected.
We're also facing increased competition in Pain Stim. Our recently approved MRI surgical lead is expected to help our
competitive position in Pain Stim as we are the first company to have a complete spinal cord stimulation system
approved for full body MRI scans. In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim
and SureScan MRI technology, and more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD high-density programming
options.
While we are focused on solving the issues in spine in neuromodulation and our efforts in spine are expected to result
in steady improvement, neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in
overall RTG growth around the low end of the mid-single-digit range.
In our Diabetes group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system in the
markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing
remote access to pump and sensor data on the user's smartphone. We also continue to make excellent progress in
bringing the world's first hybrid closed-loop system, the MiniMed 670G, to market. We expect to complete enrollment
in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks, with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June.
Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by NICE in
the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed Paradigm Veo as the only system for reducing the risk of
potentially life threatening hypoglycemic episodes.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for Type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is underway and we
are already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 professional CGM system with Pattern
Snapshot. In our Diabetes Services and Solutions business, we are preparing to bring our standalone CGM system,
Guardian Connect, to market for the PMA submission in the U.S. next week as well as expected launch in Europe in
early FY 2017.
This product will allow us to provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time
glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone CGM product with the applications and cognitive
computing capabilities that we will bring to our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with
not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Overall, we are excited by the progress of
our Diabetes business and feel we are well-positioned for sustained growth.
Next let's discuss our globalization strategy.
In Q3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points for our Q3 total company growth
at the upper end of our baseline goal of 150 basis points to 200 basis points. We have consistently delivered
double-digit growth in emerging markets despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macroeconomic
pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization and in
developing public and private partnerships. We also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our
emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency of any single market.

In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China all grew in the mid-to-upper teens. In China,
we grew 14% where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into Tier 2 and Tier 3
markets is resulting in above-market growth. We continue to implement our channel-optimization strategy, which aims
to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistic platform distributors.
We're also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, like that of the Chengdu government
in Sichuan Province where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our portable hemodialysis
equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next-generation diabetes
pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan while working together with local authorities to
expand access for this product.
China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market, we have shown
that we can grow double digits in China on a sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare
market over the long term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country and we can never lose sight of this
potential.
In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19% driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest
Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region. In Latin America, we grew 10% including
7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume
weakness resulting from public spending constraints as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country
because of customs holds.
Across the emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated
approach of local channel optimization like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government
partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the Abraaj Group last
quarter. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market
outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the
single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to economic value growth strategy, our Services and Solutions growth factor contributed approximately
20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points
revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30%s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth where our
efforts are most developed.
We expect to further improve our growth of services and solutions model that expanded across all our business groups.
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20%s in Q3 driven by
strong performances within the U.S. Veterans Administration healthcare system where we are managing a cohort of
over 85,000 patients with multiple co-morbidities. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us,
especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.
In our Hospital Solutions business to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily
administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth rates in the
mid-30%s. Since the time we started this business a little over two years ago, we have now completed a total of 72
long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service
and product revenue over an average span of six years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also
have seven hospitals in Latin America and seven in the Middle East and Africa.
We continue to attract strong customer interest in hospital solutions in regions around the world, and we have a full
pipeline of potential contracts. We're pleased with the progress we are making in expanding hospital solutions into
operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have signed five operating
room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of
seven years.
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands-based
diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted

patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter, as well as
others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our Diabetes group from a market-leading pump and sensor
business into a holistic diabetes management business.
While all of these services and solutions, Care Management Services, Cath Lab and Operating Room Managed
Services and Diabeter are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important future building blocks that we
will use to create comprehensive value-based healthcare offerings where payment will be based in measurable patient
outcomes over a specific time horizon. We're rapidly developing expertise in these areas with a particular focus on
supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum, targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular
intervention.
This is consistent with the direction of CMS's bundled payment initiative and their first implementation of
comprehensive care for joint replacement, or CJI, which we fully support. While this initiative is still evolving, it is one
that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows it to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled
payments to other clinical areas where we participate more broadly.
Healthcare is going through a necessary transformation where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical
outcomes and expand access to care but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence
continues to grow in Medtronic's ability to lead and compete in these new value-based healthcare models around the
world.
Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value but to tie our
success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers. We remain convinced
that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based healthcare successful.
Turning now to the P&L, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a
comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 basis points to 400
basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year,
as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs.
Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A which is
the line item where the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergies that we're realizing today are located. The
remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and tax rate as well as share
repurchase activity.
Our strong revenue growth and operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we
generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next five years. We
also continue to look for ways to entrap in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we had entrapped
$9.3 billion of cash, and last month we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We're executing an
incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY 2018. We intend to use a majority
of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt as it comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in
order to meet our commitments to our debt investors.
We're deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and
returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver
dependable long-term dividend growth.
Earlier this fiscal year we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with
the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced.
Regarding share repurchases, with the incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15
billion to shareholders over three years, more than double the amount returned over the past three years.
With our M&A investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities. Any investment we make
must meet our portfolio criteria, which are: that targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes; allow for

Medtronic to add value; and we must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be
aligned with and strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and
minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.
Before turning the call over to Gary, I'd like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities,
which continue to go extremely well. We're executing our priorities of preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform.
We have preserved, and in many cases accelerated, the growth of both companies. Talent retention and employee
satisfaction remain high as our two cultures continue to come together.
Our value-capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage, and we have meaningfully improved the
sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals
through the increased access to our cash.
In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution of our organization, our operating leverage is coming through
as we expected and I'm pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar.
Third quarter revenue of $6.934 billion increased 61% as reported, or 6% on a comparable constant-currency basis,
which excludes the $344 million of unfavorable impact foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a
net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth.
Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus the $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last
year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant-currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings
per share from foreign currency translation. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%.
In addition to the $374 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to
earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $43 million charge for acquisition-related items; a $16 million net restructuring
charge; and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a
one-time capital loss.
Our Cardiac and Vascular group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7% with all
three divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6% as we took significant share in a flat
global implantables market. In high power, our strong Avera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. high power
shares since early in the decade despite the fact that we had declines in CRT-D. While our CRT-D business
experienced sequential growth in U.S. implant share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories
ahead of our Q4 CRT-D MRI launch.
In Coronary, we are holding global diluted earnings – drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor data
releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our
CVG multiline contracts in the U.S.
In Transcatheter Valves, we grew in the low 30%s, consistent with the market. Market share growth in Europe and the
initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss, where our competitor
product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in the largest valve segment limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20%s.
We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low risk trial, and it is worth noting that we now expect the
global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020.
In Peripheral, we maintained drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our
clinically differentiated IN.PACT Admiral balloon. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies group, which accounted for 33%
of our total company sales, grew revenue 5% with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. In Surgical

Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper-single digits, although we estimate that
U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%.
The PMR division grew 1%, as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator,
which resulted in an approximate negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect
quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million until the product returns to the market, which is
expected in the first half of next fiscal year.
Our Restorative Therapies group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 4% with strong
growth in neurovascular and surgical technologies, offsetting declines in spine and Neuromodulation. In spine, while
U.S. core spine was challenged, we gained international core spine share. In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit
growth. However, the InductOs ship hold in Europe is expected to continue through mid-FY 2017.
In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson's patients with early onset motor complications,
expanding the number of potential patients the can be treated with DBS therapy.
Our Diabetes group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue 11% with strong broad-based
performance across all three divisions. In IIM, our Type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth driven by the
MiniMed 640G. In NDT, our Type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we are seeing growth over 250% as
we continue to drive our iPro2 Professional CGM solution and the new easy-to-interpret Pattern Snapshot report into
the primary care channel.
And DSS, our Diabetes Services and Solutions business, we saw high single-digit growth driven by U.S. consumables
sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform.
Now turning to the P&L. As I discuss the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a
non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise.
The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%. This represented a 140-basis-point improvement over the prior year, but this
improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140-basis-point impact from foreign currency.
The 140-basis-point operating margin improvement included a 140-basis-point improvement in SG&A, offset by a
20-basis-point decline in gross margin, a 10-basis-point increase in R&D and a 20-basis-point improvement in net other
expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10%, or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points
over revenue growth.
Our operating margin included gross margins of 78.5%, SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3
operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from
our earnings hedging program.
It is worth noting that included in these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation
of the Argentine peso denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%. Regarding our earnings hedging
program, while we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in
our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market
currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings.
Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which included a €1.09 and a ¥1.13, we expect Q4
net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to a $15 million of income, which includes approximately
$110 million in currency gains and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended.
We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as-reported basis based on current
exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300-basis-point improvement in our operating margin on a
constant currency basis. Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track, and we
now expect to exceed our original FY 2016 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million and continue to target a
minimum of $850 million by the end of FY 2018.

Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current
rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase
over prior quarters as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results in reduced interest income.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments
of which approximately $6 billion was trapped.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to
the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our
non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%.
In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted
free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target a credit profile. In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and
repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase
approximately 81 million shares.
Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.422 billion shares. For FY 2016, we now
expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.427 billion shares, including approximately
1.419 billion shares in Q4.
Next I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY 2016 to
be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second half
revenue being in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you
consider the strong upper single-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year. While we cannot predict the impact of
currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for
the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to
$220 million.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36
to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates.
As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or
would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
Next I would like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017. While we intend to give our
revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here are some items to keep in
mind as you think about our next fiscal year.
First on revenue growth, while we are not formally providing our FY 2017 net revenue outlook, we believe it is
reasonable to think but our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis consistent with
our baseline expectations. However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY 2016.
This will negatively affect our Q1 FY 2017 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal
year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points and has a commensurate impact to earnings per share.
Regarding foreign exchange, given current rates, we expect a $200 million negative impact in FY 2017 revenue and
expect it to negatively affect FY 2017 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of
significant hedging gains we had in FY 2016 as well as continued pressure from unhedged emerging market currencies.
Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well as the financial leverage from share
repurchases we expect to generate in FY 2017, we would expect constant currency earnings per share growth to be in
double digits to lower teens after adjusting for the extra week in FY 2016, which would exceed our baseline goal of
generating 200 basis points to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage.
Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31.
We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City.

Thanks, Gary. And we will now open the phone lines to Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of
our Cardiac and Vascular Group, Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Geoff Martha,
President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We
want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question as necessary
and related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.
And, operator, first question please.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you, guys, and good morning. Let me start with a couple items. So, Gary, probably
the first question people have is just the operating margin expansion this quarter. It wasn't, I think, what people were
hoping and maybe what you were thinking in the last quarter. Can you just talk about how much of that was FX, which
you touched on, and any other comments just relative to the progression of the synergies from Covidien?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, I mean, as we indicated, Mike, I mean obviously, we're getting a lot of leverage in the
quarter, 1,150 basis points on the bottom line on a constant currency basis. And as I mentioned in my comments, 510
points on the operating margin line just of leverage there, and a 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis.
Unfortunately with foreign exchange, as has been a headwind all year, it's having a similar negative impact on the
margin. And so then we didn't get as much of an improvement that you might see on an as-reported basis just because
of that.
So as we've been doing all year, we're basically we're continuing to executing our operating leverage plans and our cost
take- out synergies that we had from the Covidien transaction. But as with many companies, we're experiencing the
foreign exchange that's mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are as we roll through that. We're trying to
manage that the best we can, but clearly that's having a big impact. The Covidien synergies, the integration costs, were
coming in right on plan.
In fact, as I mentioned in my comments, we're ahead of schedule and we clearly will exceed the $300 million to $350
million that we assumed in the current year. We are seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3, and as we indicated, and even
in Q4 we'll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of these synergies. So we're right in line
with things, but I agree with you. I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you're seeing from an
operations perspective.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And for FY 2017, the $0.20 to $0.25, that's, let's say, $0.05 to $0.10 more than maybe you
were thinking a month, month-and-a-half ago?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, I mean, I think overall the gains that we even said for the current quarter was, like, $100
million, and it's $100 million in Q4. So we're generating almost $400 million in gains in the current year. Obviously,
we're not hedged at those favorable rates next year, and as a result, that's going to have a negative impact.
I think the thing that's a little bit higher than what we would have even expected a month or two ago is emerging
markets. Some of the currency in the emerging markets have continued to weaken, and that's become a little bit greater
part of the total. But the biggest portion of the $0.20 to $0.25, the majority of that is just the hedging gains that we will
not have in FY 2017 that we had in FY 2016.

<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Right. And then last one. The CRT-D inventory drawdown that you highlighted in the
quarter, any estimate for how much that was? Because obviously the ICD performance was a little bit weaker than the
Street was expecting.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike Coyle will take that.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: It was in the range of about $15 million to $20 million.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. That's helpful, Mike. All right. Thanks, you guys.

<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here. I guess, Omar, I think the hallmark
the last several quarters of the business has been its significant strength in the U.S. And this is sort of the first quarter in
a couple where we've seen U.S. performance was a little slower here in the third quarter versus the prior two or three
quarters. It was pretty broad-based. There were certain specific things you called out. Is there anything broadly you'd
sort of comment on as it relates to the U.S. market performance in the quarter?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Like I mentioned in the last call, the three things that we look at the U.S., one is one which we
knew was going to slow things down a little bit was the anniversary-ing of the Affordable Care Act, and that probably
had a little bit of an impact. The overall procedure volumes based on the economy I think were more or less steady. I
think in Surgical Solutions maybe a slight drop in procedure volumes, but essentially they were steady and there's no
economy-related issues.
The third aspect was simply our new products, and like I said, these new products are going to come and go on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, and in general, we still had pretty strong performance from new therapies. But in prior
quarters it was even stronger, even a larger sort of synergy of different products coming in at the same time. I think
that's going to go float up and down, and that, I think, is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market.
But you know, I have to point out that our whole model is based on the diversification, because we can't depend on just
one market. And as you saw this quarter, emerging markets picked up a little bit and essentially sort of offset the drop
in our U.S. revenue. But I think overall from a market perspective, it's pretty steady.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. And then, Omar, for you or the broader team, obviously durable growth is what
you're trying to drive people towards.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: I think there's an outside sphere over the next couple of quarters that your CRM
performance is not sustainable, and obviously that's going to weigh on kind of relative growth the next couple of
quarters. Maybe either for Mike, why is CRM growth sustainable? And I guess, Omar, or for the broader team, if you
think about certain franchises, whether it's Spine or PMR, what are the key franchises that start getting better if CRM
performance begins to decelerate? Thanks so much.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks. Mike, you go first and then I'll kind of talk about it.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yeah, actually we see the CRHF business as being one of the prime drivers of sort of the
near-term catalysts for the business over the next couple of quarters. Obviously CRT-D, MRI being launched, not only
in the United States but with the 3T, you have the TRT-D MRI in Europe, we think that's going to be a big contributor.

We're going to continue to add expanded MRI capability in the standardized CT segment with the Evera MRI 3T for
Europe, and that'll follow on into the U.S. early next year. The [indiscernible] (44:52) is the single chamber offering in
that space where we'll be actually adding to the free capability of the link diagnostics for a single chambered device, so
really the first device that can actually detect atrial fibrillation.
We have the Micra that we would expect to come in in the first half of next year in the pacing segment, and at the
upcoming ACC meeting, we're going to be releasing the data on the FIRE and ICE Trial, which is the first very large
head-to-head comparison of cryo-ablation technology to point by point ablation technology. Not to mention the fact
that we also have things like CoreValve coming into Japan and Link coming into Japan next year. So we think there are
plenty of catalysts to keep the business growing here over the next several quarters.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, I think we're confident in our steady growth in CVG overall and certainly in CRM. But
like you point out, our business model is based on a diversification of a variety of other products, and I think the two
examples that you give are pertinent.
I think in PMR, we'll start to see an acceleration especially as the ventilator starts to resolve the issues that we've had
and we expect that early next year, early next fiscal year. And in spine, I think we've tried to lay out as much detail as
possible, our changing approach and we, like Geoff had mentioned earlier, we expect to see results in spine and steady
improvement every quarter. So an overall balance is what we look for, and then we also have a pretty good cadence in
diabetes as well. But Mike's pretty confident that we can keep our growth rate in CRM growing at least to a large
degree.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, David. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Omar, could you maybe come back to spine
for a second? It's obviously a business where there have been several iterations of sort of a turnaround plan over the
past, call it year or so. I think at the analyst meeting right before announcing the Covidien acquisition, you were talking
about the opportunity for cross-selling within RTG. Now you're talking a little bit about ramping up the product
cadence. What signposts are you watching to identify whether you have the right strategy in spine, and how long are
you willing to continue to let this business underperform?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, obviously underperformance is not acceptable. The thing is the market is still a very
attractive market for us and we've got core expertise, so we've got to get this thing fixed. And I completely take your
point. We laid out these strategies earlier. We haven't talked about the new product in as much depth. We talked about
in general terms. But as we've started to dig into it under Geoff's leadership, we found that the way in which we were
launching these products was just completely suboptimal which was really kind of almost compromising the value of
these products.
And the overall cross RTG synergies, what was missing before is we just didn't have specific targets on this. That's why
made the changes. We made changes in the field level. We've made changes in the overall leadership level, and we're
looking at this thing closely on a quarter-by-quarter basis and we expect to see improvement.
The real guideline here is U.S. core spine and the correlation of the product launches to an uptick in performance. I
think it's as straightforward as that. That's the benchmark that we're looking at. That's the benchmark that you look at,
and we're going to get this thing fixed. Because again like I said, we're in a position of high share. We're in a position
where we've got the biggest breadth with our customers. We've got to make this thing work. So that's the approach that
we're taking, and those are the guideposts that I suggest that we look at, we'll point out and you should look at.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. And then maybe for Gary. I know a lot of moving parts here around currency,
synergy capture, et cetera. Can you maybe just help us again, I'm sorry, frame the impact of the Medical Device Tax

suspension with currency hedging losses and how that all kind of ties into your comments around FY 2017? Because I
would've thought that the positive impact from the device tax suspension would at least give you some relief on
currency and hedging losses. If you maybe just could walk us through the different moving parts there again?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, well, again, we're not obviously giving FY 2017 guidance yet, so I don't want to get too
much into what's going on there. We try to give some highlights of some things just to consider as you go through the
model.
But the point is as we've try to highlight here even for the current year and as we go forward, we are continuing to
expect the revenue growth to be in that mid-single-digit range as we go forward. We are expecting we're going to
continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high end of, in fact exceed probably the earnings growth that we've
been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction, and that's going just as we expected. It's coming in,
in fact a little bit ahead of the schedule at this point in time, and so we feel confident that will be positive as we go into
the next fiscal year, obviously.
Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us as it is with many multinational companies. In ours, because
of the hedging programs we did, if anything, if you think about it from the foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50
impact in the current year but that was with significant gains that we had from our hedging programs. So our impact
was somewhat muted for maybe where other companies who don't hedge were at.
That is going to come to a head for us in FY 2017, and as we indicate, that's potentially another $0.20 to $0.25 of
impact as we go into next year. You're right. We're going to have some benefit from the Medical Device Tax. We're
getting some already in the current year that's helping; give us even more operating leverage than what we were
expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting that as we kind of drive through this.
And so there's positives from the Medical Device Tax; there's been positives from our share repurchase. All those are
factors we're taking in consideration. But I think if you weigh all those together, I think you're going to find that they
play out like we've indicated in our comments because – but the issue is foreign exchange is clearly still a significant
headwind for us. And then we obviously have a tough comparison next year in FY 2017 because of the extra week we
had in the current year.
Those are all the factors that we've tried to lay out for you as you put together your models, and we'll probably
obviously provide more details and more guidance as we get to our Q4 call.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, David.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: We'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America [Bank of America Merrill Lynch.]
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Hi. Thanks, and good morning. So just to follow-up on that, so two questions. One, for
Gary, I think you said in the prepared comments that while you're not giving guidance for 2017, your directional
thought on earnings on a constant currency basis was low double digits to low teens, but that excluded the $0.20 to
$0.25 and that also excluded the negative impact of the extra week. Is that right? Is that what you said?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: That's correct. I mean, Bob, what we indicated was that you're going to get to low double digits
mid-teens if you take out the impact of the extra week and obviously the impact of foreign exchange, which obviously
are going to be there, so I'm not trying to minimize those.
We think even with the extra week, it depends on how you look at it, you're probably still probably close to
double-digit growth on the operating earnings even with the extra week in there. But without it, you're back to the

lower double digits, mid-teens is kind of the expectation. But foreign exchange of $0.20 to $0.25 will obviously bring
that down somewhat as we go forward. So that's our expectations as we look for FY 2017 as far as the existing models.
Now, again, we're not giving you guidance, but if you just ran through what we provided on those key attributes, that's
what you would see in your models.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Okay. So then directionally, again on a reported basis for earnings, that gets you to the
high single digits depending on what ends up happening with the Medical Device Tax – how much reinvest or don't?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: That's right.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Okay. So then thank you for that. And then just to follow-up on one other thing for
maybe for Omar or for Mike Coyle. On the high power side, can you give us a sense as to what you expect for market
growth as we look forward? And I'm just curious, did we see the same inventory drawdown when you launched your
traditional ICD MRI [ph] safe (53:38)? I don't recall that, but I just would love to get a quick history lesson. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: No. We didn't do a drawdown in advance of that, and actually we wound up delaying the
launch for a few weeks to allow that to occur. So that's what caused us to decide, in this case, to go ahead and do the
inventory drawdown during the quarter.
In terms of the overall growth of the market, as we said, we think the overall implantables market was relatively flat
during the quarter. I'd point out two things to keep in mind. One, is one of our competitors had an extra few days of
extra week in their prior-year quarter, which is causing the market to look like it's slower than perhaps it actually is, in
addition to the fact that we had this drawdown that I just referenced.
So if you kind of correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat with low power growing in low
single digits and the high power basically declining in the low single digits. But we've had both, not only nice share
capture but also price improvements in the standardized CE segment tied to MRI. We would expect to see a similar
dynamic play out in the CRT-D segment, which of course is larger. So I think that'll probably give you the best view of
what we think is going to happen going forward.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Bob. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Thanks. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Yes we can.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: So I just wanted to follow-up on the numbers that you gave for your outlook, long-term outlook
for the TAVR market, and obviously coming in just a touch below what one of your competitors come in with and
maybe a touch below some of the comments that you had talked about, halfway to $5 billion I think was your language
over the past couple of months. Not to make too much of that, but we'd love to get a sense of how you feel about the
market developing or what, if anything, we should read into those differences?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, I'll let Mike answer that. Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Well, first, let me correct. We never said that we thought the TAVR market was going be $5
billion. In fact, I think the last update we gave prior to today would have been at around the $3.5 billion market around
2020, 2021. So I'm not quite sure where that comment came from.

In terms of overall growth in the quarter, we were quite pleased, in fact, that we essentially grew with the market in the
low 30% range for Transcatheter Valves. Obviously that market growth is quite robust and above the range of estimate
that we had given previously of 25% to 30% for FY 2016.
And in addition, given the fact that we had a major competitive launch into the United States during the quarter, we
were actually quite pleased that our global Transcatheter Valve business is essentially splitting the market in terms of
the growth rate, growing with the overall market. In terms of the guidance to a potential $4 billion market that was
included in the commentary today, there are a number of moving pieces here.
Obviously, we have not seen relative to the intermediate risk group, is it going to be not inferior or superior? We
obviously are just getting started with the low risk group, so we're basically – have error bars, if you will, around the
range. It's probably between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in terms of a 2021 kind of timeframe, and that's where we sort
of landed in the middle on the $4 billion. But I think that'll give you a sense of at least how we're thinking about it
today, and obviously, that will evolve as data gets presented on the performance in these patient cohorts.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Sure. That's helpful color. Thank you, Mike. And then Omar, just to clarify your comments on the
ACA and the volume trends, the sort of annualizing the ACA, is it fair to say much of that volume that you're seeing is
in the MITG space, that that was sort of a pull ahead and sort of equalizing this year? Or is that something you're seeing
more broadly across your businesses?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: No, it is primarily MITG and maybe Bryan you will – some color on that. Go ahead.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: Yeah, it was very clear, too. Because we saw an increase for it four quarters exactly, and two
quarters ago that ended. We saw basically the U.S. volumes go up to about 4% growth, and now they've come down to
about 2%. So they were 3% to 4% during that four quarter period, and they're 1% to 2% now. So we definitely saw an
increase and a drop-off as those annualized. But it's specific.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And then stable at that level.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: Yes. It's not like we're declining. We're just not growing as fast as we were during that
four-quarter period.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Matt.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks. Next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, Bryan, if you could give an
update on just the overall MITG group and just any new products that we should be looking for or any highlights, I
guess, as we're heading into the SAGES meeting?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Bryan.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: So just generally speaking, I have to say if you look at MITG, everything is going well and I'll
pull back and just talk about that for a second and then I'll get into the products and health of the business.
But we do, on a monthly basis, an employee engagement survey just to kind of check the pulse of the organization as
we're going through the integration and happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter of fact,
within MITG, the scores are slightly higher even in legacy Medtronic. And so being acquired and having a number of
changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back and an engagement perspective that
high gives me confidence that we're going to have a retention of key talent, which we're working hard to do, and we're

going to continue our momentum. So I think that's probably first and foremost, in my opinion, the most important
thing.
Second to that, I'd say is you're going to see a number of nice things coming from our Surgical business. I referenced in
the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched. That'll drive close to $0.5
billion in revenue over the next three years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio of products.
Just a couple that I'll call out that you'll see again at SAGES would be new generators that we have in our Advanced
Energy line. One of them will be a next-generation ForceTriad generator that will focus on better speed to seal and also
provide the capability to drive new ligature instruments, and that's the most important thing about that generator.
It'll give us the capability to drive instruments that'll be a little more unique in the marketplace, and I'll talk about one
of those in a second. We also have a generator that we're launching that is specifically for emerging markets. That'll
take that same capability in ligature and provide a lower cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well.
That actually launched a quarter ago.
And then one of the new instruments that I mentioned in energy will be a multifunction device, and this is important
because what you're looking for, the perfect world in advanced energy is to be able to divide tissue to skeletonize either
organs or vessels that you're trying to take, and you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts
well, But at the same time, you'd like to use that instrument for sealing. And one of these products that we're going to
be launching and talking about at SAGES will do both of those very well. This has been elusive for everybody in the
marketplace to get it done. We think we figured it out, and we're going to talk about that at SAGES.
And then we have a couple of items in stapling. We've got our next generation powered stapling that's coming. We're
getting great reviews from customers and, again, the most important thing about the powered stapling is it is the driver
for our end effectors with utilizing tri-staple technology.
So those are just a few things coming in the short term, and then of course in the midterm, we've talked about our
robotics platform. We'll give you a little more insight at SAGES. I want to be cautious to give you any specifics on
when we're going to launch, but let's just say it's in the midterm and we're excited about that project as well.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Great. And then just for you, Geoff, just as you're the now head of the RTG group,
that business had obviously some pluses and minuses. You saw some really good growth across the Neurovascular
business. It's obviously a legacy Covidien unit and then some weakness still amongst the Spine business. How quickly
do you think that it'll take to really turn, I guess, the franchises around? Clearly, we've seen kind of the turn within
R&D functions, within Cardiac Vascular group. What are some of the different things that you're doing within Spine?
Are you wrapping some of the solutions around it? Or what's kind of the approach in change of the, I guess, strategy
within RTG?
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: Sure. Well, thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses, like Neurovascular in
particular and our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, the Advanced Energy business, we want to make
sure those continue to perform. And we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches
and the new clinical data that they all have coming out. So very excited about that.
Spine, obviously a lot of questions even on this call regarding Spine. That's a multi kind of – fully first answer is the
turnaround there. We've been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple quarters. This quarter was
a little bit of a step back in the U.S., and we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued steady cadence
of improvement.
And it's really – there's a couple of things. One, as Omar mentioned, our core spine portfolio. We're excited about the
products. Our upstream marketing guys have done a good job building a number of new products, and now we're
focused on the downstream commercial execution and the launch of those products, and just this quarter we have
several new ones for lumbar fusion, this Voyager Fixation system and this elevated expandable cage. And the one that
I'm particularly really excited about is this O-lift procedure which we think, based on the physician feedback we're
getting, is going to be fairly disruptive to the space.

And so we have a number of those new product launches, and a big change is launching them at scale, so making sure
we have the right amount of sets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change.
The other component here is our biologics portfolio, which INFUSE is the biggest piece. That continues to rebound and
we continue to get – we just got a recent, a new indication for that O-lift procedure I just mentioned, and we're working
on other indications there for INFUSE and in our broader biologics portfolio.
And then finally, Omar already mentioned surgical synergy. A little bit of a more nuanced view on this one. First of all,
when people look at our overall RTG performance, the Spine business dramatically helps our Surgical Technology
business. Our navigation, that business has been about a high single-digit, low double-digit growth platform for the last
couple years, powered by navigation and the imaging platforms. Without Spine, we wouldn't have that type of growth.
Full stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those
two units so that our customers feel a differentiated surgical synergy experience.
And then finally, we're hiring what we're calling ETC reps. These are Enabling Technology Consultants that are really
driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedures. So it's a number of different
things, and look, this is going to be a steady climb back. We're pretty excited about the next two quarters, actually,
regarding spine.
And then getting back to overall RTG, the place that we have the most weakness actually is in spine because its moving
is neuromodulation. Our weakness in pain stim and pain pumps partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and
competition for stim, that's offsetting our growth in DBS and neuro and that's going to take a few quarters to work
through those dynamics.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Kristen. We'll take questions from two more people, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Could you speak up a little bit, Vijay. We can't hear you properly.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, that's better.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes we can. Go ahead.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Maybe one quick one on the guidance because I think Gary mentioned for the low teens growth
for next year. And if you [ph] altered (1:06:41) that by 1.5% [indiscernible] (1:06:40) and the $0.20 to $0.25 from FX
hedging [ph] gains there (1:06:47), I just want to make sure that the low EPS growth, is that [indiscernible] (1:06:52)?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I think I caught most of it. You were breaking up a little bit as you went through it. But again, I
want to make sure we're clear. We're not giving guidance for FY 2017 yet. And we just try to put some items out there
for you to think about as we go forward. So I'm not going to get specific about what we assume for share buyback, et
cetera, because obviously we're not giving guidance yet. But as we tried to highlight in our comments, obviously the
revenue growth we would expect to continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range, as we talked about.
Clearly we're going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earnings standpoint on a constant
currency basis because of the value capture we're taking out, because of the Medical Device Tax benefit and how much
of that's reinvested and not reinvested will come into play as we go through that whole discussion.

And obviously as you indicate, there will be share buyback benefits that'll be reflected in those numbers. And that's
why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we're going to be in the low double-digit to
mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis if you just take all of those factors into consideration.
That's after you take out the extra week if you're just comparing apples-to-apples. As a result of that, then you have the
FX impact coming into play.
So all we were trying to highlight to people is your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions, et cetera,
are consistent with what we've been saying. But just remember, FX has not went away, and just remember that we had
an extra week in the current year. So other than that, I don't want to give you any more on the guidance aspect. We'll
provide more details as we put together our guidance on the Q4 call.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: That was helpful, Gary. And maybe one for Omar. Omar, I know that you've spoken about
bundling in the sales department and part of it was expanding the Covidien surgical offerings in the EM, and I'm
wondering if you could provide us any sort of update on how that's tracking either in Europe or in [indiscernible]
(1:08:58) markets? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Actually, it's tracking very well. This is moving the cath managed services model to the
operating room. And like I mentioned, we've already got five contracts in place operating in Europe today with
contracted revenue of $140 million already from both devices and services. So I think the pickup is about equivalent to
what we'd experience with cath managed services about four or five a quarter, we expect to see. Maybe accelerate that a
little more as we go into more geographies more quickly. But we're quite pleased with the progress there, and we're
developing good expertise in that area.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Vijay. We'll take our final question.
Operator
Our final question comes the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: Hi. Good morning. Gary, I hate to come back to this, but I wanted to get to the operating margin
question again. And really, the reported number was just slightly below the guidance you gave of 28% to 28.5% last
quarter. And I understand currency had an impact, but you did also give us currency guidance which was – and you did
come in line with that. So I guess I'm curious what the disconnect was between what you actually did in currency and
what you thought the impact would be on the quarter?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, well, I think overall, that we gave currency guidance from the standpoint of revenue,
which did come in line with what we had expected. But I think where currency was a little bit greater was on the
bottom line. And it's primarily because of the Argentine peso that I mentioned earlier, that that cost us an unexpected
$20 million, a little over $20 million, $20 million, $21 million impact that we had not expected in the guidance that we
provided back, I think it was our Q2 call.
So that was the primary thing. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter than what we had
originally expected at the beginning of the quarter. As you indicated, the revenue was right in line, but the bottom line
was a larger impact. So from an operating margin perspective, we came in with basically where we expected originally,
but it was a little bit more offset on the bottom line from FX than what we had originally expected.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: And so when we think about you gave us guidance also for the fourth quarter here of 31% to
31.3% on operating margins. How again do we get comfortable? And I hate splitting hairs because I realize it's only 20
basis points or so. But given that it's sort of the marker that investors are using for the integration of Covidien, how do
we get comfortable that we won't again see, perhaps, an outsized impact on currency? Or is it just simply the nature of
the beast here?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Again, I wish I could predict currency and be able to tell you that there's not going to be
surprises positive or negative on the currency side. So I mean, currency is what it is and what the impact will be as we

go forward. Again, we were trying to give guidance on, as you said, 20 basis points, trying to call that within our
operating margin lines with all the moving parts that are going on is not easy. So we understand there are a lot of
moving parts here. Currency was negative in the quarter.
I'm not expecting another devaluation here in Q4, but if it happens in one of the currencies, that could be a little bit of a
negative. On the other hand, what we've tried to provide as far as guidance on what we expect based on what we know
right now and based on the current rates and where things are at, that gives the guidance on the operating margins. So
we feel confident about that assuming, again, that there's no surprises, positive or negative. So that's all the best we can
do at this point in time is to give you some indication on which direction these things are going.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: That's helpful.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: But let me just add one comment. The key element I want to make clear is the thing that we can
control, the cost takeout of the synergies that we're getting from the standpoint of the Covidien transaction and the
leverage we're getting across the rest of our organization, that's the piece that we can control and that is going right as
expected. It's, in fact, ahead of our plans, as I mentioned in our previous comments. So the piece that we can control we
are delivering on as expected.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: No. That's clear. Thank you.
Operator
That was our final question.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Go ahead.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Should we close now, Ryan?
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Yeah, let's close, Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. Listen, first of all, I just want to also reemphasize what Gary just said. As I've said ever since I started here, we
can work on things that we can control. While we accept other variables and we've tried to understand completely that
the valuation of the company is based on the actual performance, we can only drive what we can control as best we can,
meet our commitments and drive as aggressively as we can. And that, we are completely committed to doing. And on
that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we've got a pretty granular look at
that, we're delivering.
We're delivering, this operating team is delivering and they're stretching hard and trying to cover for other things. But
there's only so far you can go about things that are not in our control.
So I just do want to make that point that we haven't lost our operational focus on delivering these synergies one bit, and
in many ways, are a little bit ahead of our original commitments. But there are lots of moving parts there. And we are
optimistic about the future, and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year.
But listen, let me go back to the long term and really conclude by noting that our overall long-term financial model, and
let me remind you what it is: It's consistent single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we
will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence; 200 basis
points to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long term. And then some of that may be a little
higher in the next couple of years as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition as we saw this quarter.

And then finally, returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. That, again, is a
commitment that we're completely living up to, and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters.
Stepping back even further, look, this company is geared around fulfilling our mission of alleviating pain, restoring
