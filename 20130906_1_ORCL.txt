Safra Catz, President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, thanks, Ken and thank you all for joining us on such short notice. As you can see, we've delivered a really strong
quarter to finish the year in the face of sort of a wild Europe global economy, months closed new cycle. Since we were
actually ready, and then if -- in an effort to permit us to speak more freely, we thought you wouldn't mind if we release
today instead.
I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 in fiscal 2012, I'll then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the
call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. With the strengthening U.S. dollar, the currency headwind for the new
software license -- for new software license was 5%, which many of you remember is two percentage points higher
than our guidance. Total revenue saw a similar effect as the currency headwind was higher than expected. As a result,
my remarks hereafter reflect constant dollar growth rates unless I tell you otherwise.
For the full fiscal year, we delivered 9% new license growth in constant dollars following of course the spectacular year
last year at 19%. Our business surpassed IBM last year and it's now grown it more than double the rate of IBM over the
last five years. We delivered 11% EPS growth for this fiscal year after reporting 33% last year and we still average
nearly 20% growth over the last five years.
Obviously, we couldn't be happier with our Q4 results. The new software license revenue for the quarter was at the
high end of my guidance, the record $4 billion, up 12%. We're especially pleased as this was the third consecutive year
that we've reported double-digit growth for the fourth quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, our new license growth as
reported over the last five years is nearly double that of SAP.
We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as technology new license revenues were $2.7
billion, up 5% following double-digit growth in each of the prior two -- last two years. Applications had a fantastic
quarter, growing to 1.3 billion, up 27%, based[ph] on 16% growth last year.
All the regions including EMEA reported double digit growth in applications with North America reporting an amazing
38% growth. Geographically, the quarter was strong and balanced with new license growing 16% in the Americas, 13%
in APAC and 2% in EMEA, and again, the quarter was not dependent on any large deals.
Software license update and product support revenues were $4.2 billion, up 8% on this highly profitable and recurring
part of our business. Hardware system revenue was $977 million for the quarter, which was above our guidance.
Engineered systems business is now running at an annual rate of over $1 billion or so, and the growth rate of this
business has been nothing short of amazing. Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on lower volume than
we had last year. Total revenue for the quarter was 11 billion, up 5% from last year. In addition to our strong top line
performance, we're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of 5.5 billion which was 10% higher than last year
as operating margins expanded to 50% from 48% last year. And the full year operating margin was at 46.2% as we
continued to see ample leverage in our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. Okay. Sorry, I am not in my regular position. So I am just trying to
put together what I've got here. So let me move on to guidance. So assuming -- oh, okay. Non-GAAP -- sorry, not
ready to go there. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.82 above our forecast, even after considering the favorable
tax rate. That we're able to put these top line and bottom line results given our size once again demonstrates the
strength of our diversified portfolio of enterprise products, the breadth of loyalty of our huge customer base and the
strength of our operating model.
The fact remains that we have products in the data center, in the cloud and everywhere that customers want to buy. We
now have $30.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and operating cash flow increased to a record $13.7 billion for
the year, while free cash flow increased 13.1 billion for the year, up 22% from last year. Over the last five years, our
free cash flow has grown at an average of 20% further demonstrating the strength of the business model.
As we've always said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 87.6 million shares

for a total of $2.5 billion for the full year. We repurchased more than 207 million shares for a total of nearly $6 billion.
The record share repurchases of this year will nearly match of those the last three years combined as you saw in our
release, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to an additional $10 billion of common stock under our
existing share repurchase program in future quarters. The Board again declared a dividend of $0.06.
I'm going to move to the guidance. I will say in advance, obviously, I do read the same newspapers you all do and do
keep up with the news of the economy, et cetera, and so I have tried to keep that in mind in my guidance regardless of
our achievements in the fourth quarter. So, assuming exchange rates remain where they are at current levels, which
right now is a negative 5% currency impact on license growth rate and on total revenue growth rates. Our guidance for
Q1 is as follows; new software license revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range, these are in constant
dollars, 5% to 15% in constant currency or 0% to 10% on current rates.
On a GAAP basis, we expect new software license growth range to be anywhere from 4 to 14 in constant currency and
negative 1 to positive 9 under current rates. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 12%
to negative 2% in constant currency and negative 17 to negative 7 in current rates, and that doesn't include the hardware
support revenue.
Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 6% in constant currency and
negative two to positive one in current rates, the non-GAAP EPS is expected to be anywhere from $0.54 to $0.58 in
constant currency or $0.51 to $0.55 at current rates, up from $0.48 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.40 to
$0.44 in constant currency and $0.37 to $0.41 at current rates. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate
of 23.5%, of course, it may end up being different.
With that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark Hurd, President
Thanks, Safra. I'll just make a couple of comments and turn it over to Larry. We're lining up to drive even more growth.
We've lined up our North American organization to compete with our new application competitors. And just to be
clear, we're not lining up our sales force, they are already lined up. In Q4, we integrated Taleo and RightNow into
North America and had record bookings. In Q4, we lined up territories to be ready on June 1. This is the earliest I'm
aware of that we've ever had territories and comp plans aligned. Everyone has a boss, a territory and a comp plan.
We've asked Joanne Olsen, who runs cloud services, to run our North American applications business. Many of you
know Joanne. She is one of our most capable executives. All in order to get prepared to compete and drive more focus
and more growth. There are no changes to our tech or to our hardware sales forces. No changes in any other
geographies. We will continue to specialize our sales force against our secular competitors to take advantage of what
we believe are significant growth opportunities.
We added 500 sales and presales people in the fourth quarter. That makes a net increase of 3,300 people this year. Deal
and sales attrition are down materially over the past couple of years. Better news, the attrition amongst our top
performers is down materially as well.
We have the best product lineup in the industry, a great pipeline and sales resources to drive even more organic growth.
This year, we added sales resource while managing our expenses. We further specialized our sales force. We also
worked to ready the team earlier than ever before to execute for the upcoming year.
In closing, it was not only a strong numerical quarter in licenses, engineered systems and SaaS signings. We did the
things that you won't see in the numbers to prepare for future growth. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Larry.

Thank you, Mark. Well, Safra walked you through the numbers. And to me, the 12% constant dollar growth for new
software licenses really stands out. We sold $4 billion in software for the first time ever, and this growth comes off
double-digit comparisons over the last two years. Software had a fantastic quarter on multiple fronts, including
applications growth of 27% in constant dollars. The Oracle Cloud is now open for business and with the addition of
RightNow and Taleo, we're already the world's second largest SaaS company, with the bookings approaching $1 billion
run rate.
Human Capital Management had a great quarter, with SaaS wins over Workday at UBS, Societe Generale and Vivendi.
CRM also had a great quarter, with SaaS wins at Green Mountain Coffee, Swiss Life and Graco. Our industry-focused
businesses grew faster than our other software sales this quarter, with strength in health care, retail and financial
services. Over the last five years, our GBUs have grown approximately four times faster than our other software
businesses. By helping customers automate their strategic industry-specific processes, we position Oracle to sell to
customer our entire stack of integrated technology.
Hardware, another great quarter for engineered systems. We came very close to booking as much business this quarter
as we did for all of last year for engineered systems. Q4 bookings were $274 million. In FY '11, bookings were $300
million for engineered systems, very exciting. Both Exadata and Exalogic saw triple-digit bookings growth, with great
wins at PayPal, Deutsche Bank, Telefonica, Facebook and at SAP's largest oil and gas customer in Europe. Exalogic
continues to ramp faster than Exadata and Exalytics, our in-memory analytics competitor to SAP's HANA, is ramping
faster than Exalogic.
In Exalytics' second quarter since the product was released, unit bookings are more than double Exalogic and 10 times
those of Exadata in their second quarters respectively. Exalytics may very well be the strongest engineered system
value proposition, Oracle has yet released, and we're not seeing much competition from HANA. We have great
Exalytics wins at Toshiba, Sodexo and Thomson Reuters, who also bought Exadata, Exalogic and Big Data Appliance
systems during the quarter. While we exceeded our hardware forecast this quarter, our focus remains in returning the
overall hardware business to growth in FY '13.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard, Analyst
Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the quarter. I'd love to get a little bit more color on this transformation into selling
Exa systems. And to get your perspective in terms of how ready, willing is the customer for sort of mainstream
adoption and how much more work do you have to do in terms of getting all the products lined up in terms of making
that, if you will, that -- called a mainstream type of push, so we can see Exa becoming maybe an even greater
percentage of the hardware business? Thank you.

Okay, Jason. I'll start, then turn it over to Larry for a couple of comments. As Larry stated, our revenue in engineered
systems more than doubled in dollars year-over-year. And that's with the effect of currency. So, we had material growth
in engineered systems over the course of the year.
And I think what you saw in Q4 -- what we saw in Q4 was some pretty material movements in terms of existing
customers buying many more. And these are brand names, Jason. Brand names buying now, instead of two or three,
buying 10 and 20 to the point that it became as big a number as Larry described, where, in the quarter, we frankly
almost booked as much as we sold all of FY '11. So, I think, it's just exactly what you would expect. It's blocking and
tackling for us, getting customers to try the technology. It's a disruption to their normal path of business. Remember, all
of our Exa solutions combined servers and Exadata combines a storage as well as software and I think the ramp you're
seeing is superb, and I think, you should expect to see it again in 2013. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Larry Ellison, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, well, again, we expect our Exa system business to approximately double in the current year. And the systems,
while they're very, very fast right now, they're getting even faster as we adopt Intel's latest chips, the latest InfiniBand
technology, the latest in large Flash memory systems. So we're riding that technology curve and improving our Exa
systems at a much faster rate than, let's say, IBM is improving its Power Systems. So, while we're faster than IBM
Power now, that advantage is going to grow over the coming year and in coming years. This creates two interesting
opportunities. One is for us to become the number one player in high-end systems. Again, we expect to exit this current
year selling about the same unit volume in the Exa line as IBM sells in their Power line.
And we think at a somewhat higher unit price. So we think we're going to come very close at moving to the number
one position in high-end systems. That is not the endgame here. The most interesting part of Exa is not that we just
deliver the highest performance of any computer out there. It's that our cost performance is so attractive. Remember,
Exa is built out of commodity x86 machines, or Xeon server parts. Therefore, we have the ability to not only achieve
very high peak performance, but also achieve industry-leading cost performance. So, we think we actually can eat into
the commodity business, as well as the high-end server business. So, we think Exa applies not just to high- end
computing, but up and down the line, which gives us incredible growth potential going forward.
Mark Hurd, President
Yeah, Jason, just to close, when Larry is talking about 2x, we are forecasting a big 2013. Again, a like doubling effect
of engineered systems again and so listen, you could feel the momentum. We can certainly see it in our pipeline, and
we can see it in our results. And that Q4 was extremely strong for us. Okay, next question please.
Jason Maynard, Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini, Analyst
Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question following up on Jason's about the Exa
product line. This seems to be the first quarter in a while where you guys have been able to really upside, surprise and
do the high end of the range on the hardware side. And I'm just wondering specifically what -- even listening to your

comments, what specifically changed this quarter? Is it some of the new Exa products ramping? Is it the sales force
more comfortable? And also, kind of do you guys feel now that you have enough history where you're comfortable
with the guidance forecast given, I think, it was probably a little bit harder business to forecast given you didn't have
the history, Safra, that you did with the license business? So I'm just wondering if you could share some thoughts
around that. Thank you.
Larry Ellison, Chief Executive Officer
I'd like the comment. This is Larry. It's really a very, very simple answer. We had a large commodity hardware
business that was getting smaller a year ago and a small Exa business that was getting larger. Now, as we have a small
commodity business getting smaller and a larger, much larger Exa business getting larger. So as we double the Exa
business off a much larger base, it's a much larger percentage of the total. So there are always two things going on. We
said there's always two things going on in our product line.
The commodity business was in decline, and the engineered systems business was ramping very rapidly. Now that the
commodity business is small and the engineered business is large, a much larger percentage of the total, the impact on
the overall number is very positive because as Exa doubles, that's going to move the needle dramatically. So we expect
that the hardware story this current fiscal year to be a growth story, driven largely by Exa and a growth story not just on
the top line but also great margin expansion to go along with it.
Mark Hurd, President
Yes, and Heather to add to Larry's comments, as it relates to Exa itself, we had a pretty linear progression of
improvement throughout the year, it might have a little more in one quarter than the other on that pure linear view. But
Q4 was really, I think, nothing more than the culmination of a consistently growing pipeline through the year. And
even with what we delivered in Q4, we also, in Q4, saw our pipeline increase yet again.
So I think it really has been all of the things you described. It's customer familiarity. It's us getting out showing the
technology works. We have so many customers that have now not only tried the product, tested the product, and have
bought the product, implemented the product. It just all plays together. And I think to Larry's point, we expect a very
strong year in Exa in fiscal 2013.
Ken Bond, Vice President, Investor Relations
Next question please.
Heather Bellini, Analyst
Thank you.
Safra Catz, President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me just say one other thing, Heather, that I don't know if we mentioned it on this call so far, is that we do expect
hardware numbers to be up for the year. So year-over-year, we do expect them to be positive.

Philip Winslow, Analyst
Hi guys, great quarter. Just have a question on the applications business. You saw a really strong license growth there
this quarter, definitely a pretty substantial snapback over the past couple. Just curious here what is driving that
re-acceleration that applications growth rate. And then also, Larry or Mark, I wonder if you can provide any specifics
around any sort of Cloud wins or Fusion wins or kind of early feedback on those two, that'd be great.
Mark Hurd, President
On the app side, I'd just make this comment. It was getting broad-based. There is no single region. There is no single
deal and by the way, it was cross-pillar, if I can use that word. It was strength in CRM, strength in ERP, strength in
HCM. So it was broad-based, and I really can't give you a region. And by the way, that includes Europe. So, it was
fairly broad-based, across pillar, and across region. In terms of SaaS wins, I'll turn it over to Larry. He mentioned a
couple, and he can touch a little bit about some of our progress in the Cloud and wins there.
Larry Ellison, Chief Executive Officer
Yes, well, when we announced the Oracle Cloud a short while ago, we put up a lot of wins against Salesforce.com, a
lot of wins against Workday. So, right now, we're the only major application supplier that has a large business in SaaS
and a large business in on-premise. So we're really competing in both sides of the business and I think that bodes very
well for our future. So depending on -- the customers are somewhat self-selecting. They come in wanting a SaaS
solution for HCM, we have something to sell them.
They come in wanting a SaaS solution for sales force automation or service automation, or for that matter, financials,
accounting, we have something to sell them. We also, obviously, can deliver that same solution on-premise. It just
gives us, I think, a terrific competitive advantage, both the breadth of what we sell in applications, as well as the fact
that we offer on-premise solutions and in-the-cloud solutions. And let me throw out the last piece is we -- maybe the
most outstanding of all of the application areas and again, I could -- look, second to Mark said, it was very broad-based.
But perhaps the most outstanding was our industry-specific applications, which had a phenomenal fourth quarter.
And that's, again, an area where Oracle differentiates itself against most of its competitors. We have Internet banking
and loan origination in financial services. We have health care systems, we have retail merchandising systems. We
have a lot of industry-specific applications that none of are big-name application competitors have, big advantage in
breadth and depth.
Mark Hurd, President
You know, I think, adding to Larry's point, just to brag on our SaaS stuff yet again. Between the HCM release early in
the year, as I mentioned in Q4, we integrated Taleo with the HCM team. The wins that Larry described earlier, Societe
Generale, UBS, just to name a couple, are material wins. Our win rate now has gone up to the point that we're winning
most of the deals that we get down into a mano-a-mano square-off with our competitor. And we did a lot of work in Q4
to get that done. To Larry's point, you saw a ramp-up in CRM, in sales automation in the quarter, as well as we
integrated RightNow into North America as well. So did a lot of work in Q4. And as Larry mentioned a week ago, as
we did our Cloud launch, the number of wins was significant in the quarter.

Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Holt, Analyst
Great, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. My question is about the increase in sales capacity. Mark, I think you
mentioned 3,300 people. Where do you think you are in ramping that capacity and where are you directing it as you
head into next year? And maybe for Safra, how have you been able to do that and keep sales and marketing roughly flat
year-on-year? Thanks so much.
Mark Hurd, President
All right. I'll start and turn it over to Safra. They are going exactly where you would expect them to go. They are going
into SaaS, very focused in HCM, very focused in service automation and sales automation. We also have growth on our
industry business units, as Larry referenced. They're growing quite well, and they do a great job strategically for us.
When they grow, a material amount of Oracle revenue flows with the industry applications as they go. So we're
growing headcount in that area. We've grown headcount in our engineered systems. I mentioned the pipeline you'll see
the results in Q4.
We have a focus in both Middleware selling where we believe we have a strong competitive lead over competition,
namely IBM. In addition to that, we feel very good about the alignment of our BI offerings and the release of Exalytics.
So all of those areas are focused areas where we are increasing our sales force and adding to it. Most of that work,
again, was done in FY '12. We are working to increase the productivity as we assimilate those people into the
organization this year. We will still have adds in fiscal year '13, but most of the hard work was done as part of FY '12.
With that, I'll turn it over to Safra for her comments on expenses.
Safra Catz, President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, what's really been done by Mark and his team is really reshape the sales force so that we have a lot more
firepower; less staff, less helpers, more folks with quotas and delivering back to us. So as all those folks have -- are
going into a full capacity, we're very excited about this next year. But we've, really reshaped the sales force during FY
'12, and we're able to keep expenses where they needed to be by really changing our ratios.

The next we'll hear from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan, Analyst
Hi, I'm curious to get your thoughts on overall macro environment. Not that -- Safra has already pointed out that you
guys aren't economists. But what's the tone of customer conversations like? And I guess a follow-up for Safra. How
conservative are the close-heard assumptions to generate the forecast and I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Mark Hurd, President
I'll let Safra deal with any questions about the macro economy.
Safra Catz, President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, Kash, I'm sorry to disappoint you. We have not become economists this quarter, and we don't have any idea
what's going to happen. So you've been in this with us a couple of times, and so you know that it is a general matter, we
look at what's going on. I try to stay conservative, who knows depending on what's happening. It was a very tumultuous
end of May, as some of you remember. We closed our quarter and -- yes, I was actually in the Europe for part of it, as
the news was full of a global catastrophe.
So we keep that on our mind. Our European team, EMEA team did absolutely magnificently. And as in all our regions
worldwide, in the face of this, I'd like to stay conservative, but it may not turn out being conservative depending on the
euro, depending on whatever and of course, we always do feel some level of uncertainty as folks run to the dollar and
of course, I've got to keep that in mind also ultimately, and you guys need to keep that in mind in your models. The
tone from our customers, a lot of customers understand the value that we bring to them. We are important and very
strong partners for them to reach their own goal. And as a general matter, as you can see the results that our customers
vote with their pocketbook. And we expect them to do the same this next year.
Kash Rangan, Analyst
Great thanks and if I could, the engineering systems, Larry, your point this has been on a tear. Can you give us some
feel for if the business is going to double again, who you are going to be winning market share against relative to the
cast of characters; IBM, HP, Teradata? These are some high-end systems companies that come to mind. Just curious if
you can give us some color, who do you hope to get share from? Thanks.
Larry Ellison, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, this coming year, most of the share will be from the high-end guys. So we'll be encroaching on the
suppliers of high-end servers, and the leader of the supplier of high-end servers is IBM, and then there are specialized
players like Teradata, but it's going to be in the high end.
Long term, Kash, I think, it's more interesting. Long term, the Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics machines, because they are
built out of commodity parts deliver -- again, not only allow us to encroach and become the number one player at the
high-end and peak performance. I think it will -- we have a good chance of becoming the number one player in cost
performance, and that allows us to take share from the commodity guys and we're very excited about that prospect for
our long-term growth of the Exa line. However, for next year, I think the primary competitor is IBM pSeries.

And our final question will come from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle, Analyst
Thank you so much for taking my question. Safra, I just wanted to follow-up on Kash's question and see if you saw any
changes at all in pricing or renewal rates at all during the quarter.
Safra Catz, President and Chief Financial Officer
No, everything stayed really, really strong. It was really kind of two stories, meaning, what we were seeing on the news
and what we were seeing in our business. So everything remained really strong. We had a lot of big renewals, a lot of --
everything just went business as usual and it was a great quarter end, I mean, obviously and everybody remained really,
really strong all the way all around the world.
Ken Bond, Vice President, Investor Relations
