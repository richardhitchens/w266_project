MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Brandiss and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Sprint Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers'
remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Yijing Brentano, Vice
President of Investor Relations, ma'am, you may begin.
Yijing Brentano
Thank you, Brandiss. Good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Thanks for
joining us this morning. For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the
quarter; and then our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint Web site. Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point
out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We
provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including part one,
Item 1A, risk factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and when filed, part two, Item 1A, risk factors of our quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP
performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the
attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our Web site

Next, I would like to cover our loss per share results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the second quarter
were $0.28, compared to $0.15 in the first quarter and $0.25 in the year-ago period. The current period loss per share
includes $0.20 in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other, net of the effect of increased valuation
allowance. Loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other as
well as higher net tax expense. We recorded a net tax expense of $99 million in 2Q '11, including a $52 million
expense resulting from cumulative effects on changes in Michigan's corporate income tax law enacted in the second
quarter. For the full year 2011, we now expect our net tax expense to be approximately $200 million to $250 million,
which is higher than our previously communicated expectation of $200 million, due to the Michigan charge I just
discussed.
Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire second quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Other
result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 is
an estimate and, based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results, may need to be revised if our estimate materially
differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our
investment in Clearwire, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share, but would have no effect on Sprint's
operating income, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA or consolidated statement of cash flows.
The carrying value of Sprint's investment in Clearwire as of June 30, 2011 was approximately $2.1 billion. Clearwire's
stock price is subject to significant volatility and currently, their estimated fair value, based on their quoted per share
value, is below Sprint's per share carrying value. Although we have determined that the excess of our book value over
the estimated fair value of our investment is the result of a temporary decline, there is significant risk that the estimated
value of our investment in Clearwire does not improve. And accordingly, we could face significant non-cash charges
up to the full amount of our net carrying value.
Similar to the first quarter, we recognize that capitalized interest of approximately $100 million related to certain
previously unutilized spectrum licenses, which we intend to deploy as part of Network Vision. We continue to expect
full year capitalized interest related to these spectrum licenses to be approximately $400 million. As we discussed on
our last earnings call, the successful testing and deployment of Network Vision is expected to result in accelerated
depreciation expense, primarily associated with iDEN-related assets, due to changes in our estimates of the remaining
useful life of certain long-lived assets and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations.
As of June 30, 2011, the remaining net carrying value of iDEN-related assets was approximately $4 billion, with a
composite estimate useful life of 4.5 years, resulting in depreciation expense of approximately $800 million annually.
Successful completion of Network Vision earlier than the end of 2015 would result in an acceleration of these
depreciation costs. Assuming the completion of successful testing of push-to-talk and finalization of a migration plan
for push-to-talk customers, accelerated depreciation could begin in late 2011 or early 2012.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report, once again, we've made progress with respect to
each of our three key objectives: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash. If
you would turn to Slide 4, the customer experience has steadily improved for 3.5 years. In the quarter, the American
Customer Satisfaction Index, or ACSI, not only had Sprint tied for the top spot in the industry for overall satisfaction,
but Sprint was the most-improved U.S. company across all industries over the past three years. I'm also pleased to
report Sprint's 14th consecutive quarter of improved customer care satisfaction. Our top and bottom box customer
satisfaction results were all-time bests.
Turning to Slide 5, in addition, Vocalabs rated Sprint's call satisfaction best in the industry and yet another very well
known independent research firm also rated overall satisfaction with Sprint-branded services best ever and data

satisfaction unbeaten in the industry. The customer experience is an important factor for churn and postpaid churn
reached 1.75%, an all-time Sprint record. Sprints best's five quarters for churn in history have been the last five.
Prepaid churn also reached its lowest level in almost six years. The number of calls per customer to Customer Care in
the quarter, once a glaring Sprint weak spot, achieved an all-time best in the quarter and is now among the best-in-class
in the industry. We strive to provide a customer experience second to none.
Please turn to Slide 6, if you will. Perhaps the best indicator of brand strength is subscriber performance. Driven by
improvements in churn, we achieved 1.1 million net adds in the second quarter, an improvement of 1 million from last
year's second quarter and this was our third consecutive quarter with over 1 million total net new subscribers.
The Sprint brand was net add positive for the seventh consecutive quarter and net port positive for the fifth straight
quarter, which means more customers switched to Sprint-branded postpaid services from our competitors than switched
from Sprint to our competitors. Growth in the Sprint brand was not enough to offset losses with the Nextel brand this
quarter, but we achieved year-over-year postpaid net add improvement for the eighth consecutive quarter. To be net
add positive for all of 2011, an objective we still maintain, Sprint will need to improve year-over-year net add
performance by 855,000 versus last year. Through two quarters, we're two-thirds of the way there.
Key second quarter third-party measures of brand health, like First Brand Preference and Most Want to Investigate
reached best ever levels. And like last year, we again showed the most year-over-year improvement among major
carriers in our Net Promoter Score.
We launched a number of new devices in the quarter, including the HTC EVO 3D, the industry's first 3D phone, and
the HTC View, America's first 4G tablet. We added several Motorola devices to our portfolio. These devices included
the Motorola Xoom Tablet, the Motorola XPRT, Sprint's first Android world phone that offers enterprise-level security
features, the Motorola Titanium, which combines push-to-talk and Android on an iDEN network, and the Motorola
PHOTON 4G, our first international 4G smartphone, which will be available next week. 76% of Sprint-branded devices
sold in the quarter were smartphones, bringing the smartphone percentage of our Sprint-branded, or CDMA, customer
base to 58%. Our 4G momentum continues as we sold 1.7 million 4G devices in the quarter; our highest quarterly
number ever.
Moving to prepaid in Slide 7, driven by our best churn performance in nearly six years, we had 674,000 prepaid net
adds, our second best -- second quarter, which benefited from – the second quarter of 2009, which benefited from the
re-launch of Boost. That had been our best. The Boost brand received yet another lift with today's announcement by
J.D. Power and Associates for the number one ranking in customer care for non-contract wireless services.
If you'd turn to Slide 8, in addition to being known for simplicity and value, the Sprint brand is increasingly being
associated with sustainability. It was a privilege last week to share the stage with EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, to
discuss Sprint's industry-leading reuse and recycling practices. Also in the quarter, the Samsung Replenish was
awarded UL Environment's first-ever Platinum-level certification for a mobile device. And for the second year in a
row, Sprint received the Sustainability Leadership Award from the International Electronics Recycling Conference and
Expo.
ForestEthics evaluated paper use practices across three major industries and the evaluation included Sprint, Verizon,
and AT&T. No company in any industry was given higher than a C+, except for one, Sprint, which was awarded a solid
A.
Moving to Slide 9, with respect to our final priority, cash, we generated positive Free Cash Flow of $267 million in the
second quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we also generated positive operating income. Wireless Service
revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by the largest
year-over-year improvement in postpaid ARPU in over seven years. Postpaid Service revenue grew sequentially for the
third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted OIBDA was down sequentially, as the benefits of better postpaid ARPU and prepaid subscriber growth were
offset by higher cost of service and postpaid subsidy expense, mainly attributable to going from mail-in rebates to

instant rebates to simplify the customer experience, but also partly due to a higher mix of smartphones, especially 4G
devices. June, though, was by far our best postpaid net subscriber month of 2011. So we believe these investments in
the customer experience and in our competitive position will pay off in the long run.
Joe will discuss our financials in more detail. Please turn to Slide 10. Sprint continues to differentiate itself with
customers and with wireless ecosystem partners because of our unique adoption of an open strategy. We launched the
Samsung Nexus S 4G in the quarter, the first 4G device with embedded NFC chip. This enables Google Wallet, a
mobile capability currently offered only by Sprint. Rather than push our customers toward a carrier-controlled mobile
payments platform, we want to provide our customers with choice, whether it be Google Wallet, Sprint Wallet or
American Express' Serve Digital Wallet platform. Sprint ID is uniquely open, in that it allows a third-party, like ESPN,
EA Games or MTV to shape the user interface. Sprint shows its openness, yet again, by being the only wireless carrier
to provide Google Voice, launched in the quarter, which lets the end user and a third-party, rather than the carrier,
create a calling and voicemail experience.
Sprint is taking the concept of openness even further by introducing the innovative concept of spectrum hosting, which
today's announcement of our agreement with LightSquared shows. Our first priority is the customer experience.
Therefore, our 4G strategy began with our Network Vision plan to enhance our customers' network experience,
including coverage, quality and speed improvements through the deployment of new multi-mode network technology
that supports both 3G and 4G, utilizing multiple spectrum bands.
Our second priority is to maximize the utilization of and return on our existing assets and investments. This means
optimizing the use of our existing 1.9 GHz and 800 MHz spectrum as part of the Network Vision deployment. It also
meant negotiating a new wholesale agreement with our existing 4G partner, Clearwire, that insures we can provide our
customers with high-quality 4G service, and also that we would be supporting Clearwire by committing to purchase
and resell services through at least the end of 2012.
Today, we are announcing the next piece of the plan. Sprint will further leverage its core investment in Network Vision
by entering into a spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared, where Sprint will build and operate a 4G LTE
network and deploy the 1.6 MHz spectrum owned by LightSquared. This spectrum hosting leverages the Network
Vision platform, while it provides – while it improves Sprint's cash flow. Sprint will receive cash payments and also
receive wholesale purchase credits worth a total of approximately $13.5 billion if Sprint chooses to resell capacity
generated by the LightSquared spectrum. The OIBDA and margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the
ways we will improve our margins.
Now some of you are aware that LightSquared has made a proposal to the FCC to resolve concerns about potential GPS
interference. As a provider of GPS-based services ourselves, Sprint wants this issue to be resolved, and we will not turn
on the network until this issue is resolved.
So in conclusion, we continue to oppose AT&T's proposed takeover of T-Mobile USA. Sprint has been the most visible
leader of those that oppose the proposed takeover, but opposition is beginning to come from all corners. Just last week,
Senator Kohl, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, sent a
strong letter urging the takeover be blocked. Subcommittee Member Senator Franken sent a letter opposing the merger
this week. In addition, other key members of Congress, like Representatives Markey, Conyers and Eshoo are making
their voices heard, along with State Attorneys General, consumer groups, antitrust experts, influential business editors
and columnists, competitors and most importantly, tens of thousands of customers and consumers.
There have already been more comments filed at the FCC, largely in opposition to the proposed acquisition, than with
any other transaction ever reviewed by the agency. The California PUC has likewise opened an investigation to explore
the impact of the deal on its constituents, and several other PUCs are reviewing the transaction.
The big two have grown their collective postpaid market share and industry dominance every year since Sprint began
keeping market share records in 2004 and we don't expect 2011 to slow down this problematic trend. We intend to
continue to ensure that the dangers of this takeover and the negative impact it will have on our industry continue to be
heard.

The spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared provides one more piece to our network evolution plan. We will
meet with the investment community in New York on October 7th to describe this network evolution plan in more
detail, and the additional time between now and then will allow us to complete more pieces to our plan.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss financial results in more detail. Joe?
Joseph J. Euteneuer
Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I want to start the call by thanking the Sprint team for their hard work and
execution during the second quarter in a very tough competitive environment. If you move on to Slide 11, I would like
to begin by discussing revenue performance for the second quarter. Today, consolidated revenues grew by 4%
compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher Wireless Service and Equipment revenues, partially offset by
lower Wireline revenues.
Sequentially, total consolidated net operating revenues were flat, as growth in Wireless Service revenues were offset by
lower Wireline revenues. Wireless Service revenues, which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues, improved
by almost 5% as compared to the year-ago period and by approximately 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2011.
The year-over-year sequential -- and sequential improvements were primarily due to higher postpaid ARPU and growth
in net prepaid subscribers, partially offset by net losses of postpaid subscribers. Postpaid ARPU improved sequentially
to $57 and grew by nearly $2 as compared to the second quarter of 2010. This was the largest quarterly year-over-year
increase in over seven years. Strong smartphone sales and the related $10 premium data add-on charge continued to
drive sequential postpaid ARPU growth in the second quarter, and we expect the $10 add-on charge will lead to
additional postpaid ARPU improvement in the second half of this year.
Prepaid ARPU declined sequentially, due primarily to a higher mix of relatively low ARPU Assurance customers.
Looking forward, and as we stated previously, shifts in the mix of our prepaid subscriber base among our brands can
cause overall prepaid ARPU to fluctuate in the short-term.
We are also focused on improving revenue by growing the subscriber base. We are very pleased to have added over 1
million net wireless customers in the second quarter and nearly 4 million over the last four quarters, representing an 8%
increase in the size of the total subscriber base as compared to the second quarter of last year. It is also important to
note that we added more than 1.4 million Sprint-branded postpaid customers over the past year.
As Dan mentioned and shown on Slide 12, we faced a number of competitive headwinds that became more pronounced
in the second quarter. This includes the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone, aggressive pricing
on the iPhone, as well as a variety of other handsets.
We continue to be in encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in key brand and customer service metrics, and
we feel that our standing in the marketplace continues to progress and momentum is with us. A key contributor to our
improvement in postpaid subscriber performance has been the popularity of the HTC EVO line of handsets. We
launched the latest marquee HTC EVO device, the 3D, late in the second quarter, and although we didn't have the
benefit of a full quarter of sales of the HTC EVO 3D, we are pleased with the early sales results.
At the same time, the HTC EVO, the nation's first 4G phone, continues to be the best-selling device in our history. As
we look to the second half of the year, we recognize the importance that device selection has on our ability to attract
and retain quality customers. And we will remain focused on providing a strong line-up, including the highly
anticipated Motorola PHOTON, which will be available next week.
In 2011, we continue to expect Wireless Service revenues to grow, Wireline revenues to decline and total consolidated
net operating revenues to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2010.
Moving on to Slide 13, consolidated adjusted OIBDA declined $200 million sequentially and $187 million
year-over-year to slightly over $1.3 billion for the second quarter. This includes the estimated incremental impact of
approximately $120 million from customer acquisition and retention expenditures to remain competitive in the

marketplace and $73 million related to disputes and settlements, including the $18 million settlement with Clearwire
and ongoing Network Vision expenses of approximately $24 million. As Network Vision expenses continue to grow,
we plan to start reporting these costs separately, so that investors can track the progress of Network Vision and the
operating business separately.
During the second quarter, we took a series of actions to compete in the marketplace to minimize market share loss,
which had an impact on our adjusted OIBDA results. In the second quarter, we saw price reductions on the original
HTC EVO and a full quarter of instant rebates, which put pressure on our postpaid net subsidy rate. We felt this
incremental investment of approximately $120 million was necessary and helped mitigate the subscriber impact from
competitor actions, given the highly competitive environment of the second quarter.
Total net subsidy remained relatively flat sequentially, as lower overall prepaid subsidy was offset by higher average
subsidy rate per postpaid handset. Wireless cost of service increased sequentially, primarily due to: increased data
volume, primarily related to 4G; higher service and repair cost; and Network Vision-related costs. Higher service and
repair costs were related to increased mix of smartphones in the subscriber base, which on average have a higher
replacement cost, as well as fewer refurbished HTC EVO devices available for replacements.
Selling, general and administrative costs were flat sequentially, as lower sales and marketing costs were offset by
higher bad debt. Wireline adjusted OIBDA declined sequentially, as expected, primarily due to lower revenue resulting
from the migration of wholesale cable Voice-over-IP subscribers off of the Sprint's Wireline platform. Cost reductions
partially offset some of the sequential decline in Wireline revenue. We continue to expect the full year 2011 impact of
the migration of cable Voice-over-IP customers to cause Wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline by approximately $150
million for the full year of 2011.
Our full-year adjusted OIBDA outlook is unchanged from what we communicated on our first quarter earnings call. We
continue to expect for the full year, that improvement in postpaid ARPU and growth in the number of prepaid
subscribers will benefit adjusted OIBDA. However, we expect those benefits to be offset by the negative impacts of
entering 2011 with fewer postpaid subscribers, the projected decline in Wireline cable Voice-over-IP revenues and
higher wireless costs of service driven by data usage and higher subsidies associated with the highly-competitive
handset pricing environment.
As a result, we expect for the full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA to be relatively flat compared to 2010, excluding the
incremental operating expenses associated with Network Vision, which we expect to be between $200 million and
$250 million. As a reminder, seasonality generally drives higher third quarter cost of service expenses, including
roaming and service and repair. In addition, we also expect typical seasonal increases for postpaid churn in the third
quarter of this year.
Now moving on to Slide 14, we ended the quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $5.2 billion,
including $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $900 million of borrowing capacity
under our revolver. Our next note and loan maturities, totaling $2.25 billion, are due in March of 2012. Going forward,
we plan to maintain adequate liquidity to support a balanced fiscal approach allowing for repayment of debt, investing
in capital expenditures and future growth.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, were $640 million in the second quarter compared to
$555 million in the first quarter and $437 million in the second quarter 2010. The sequential and year-over-year
increase in capital investment was primarily driven by higher data capacity spend. We continue to expect that full year
2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, excluding capitalized interest, driven largely by CDMA
capacity and Network Vision.
We generated $267 million in Free Cash Flow in the second quarter. This was up from the $178 million in the first
quarter, primarily due to lower cash interest payments and pension contributions, changes of certain vendor payment
schedules, and a $90 million prepayment received from LightSquared for spectrum hosting, offset by a decline in
OIBDA, higher capital spending and increased device and accessory inventory.

Additionally, we received $200 million from LightSquared early in the third quarter, for a total of $290 million
received year-to-date. We made pension contributions of $12 million in the second quarter and early in the third quarter
and we intend to make a similar contribution in the fourth quarter of this year.
During the second quarter, our device and accessory inventory balance increased by over $400 million. Over 60% of
this increase resulted from five of the new devices we added to our handset line-up during the quarter as we built
inventory prior to handset launches. Approximately one-third of the increase in those new device inventories resulted
from the HTC EVO 3D, which we launched near the end of the quarter and was one of Sprint's best-selling devices for
first week in sales. The remaining increase in inventory was associated with devices we felt could have delivery issues
relating to the global part shortage. We expect by the end of the fourth quarter, our ending inventory balance to be more
consistent with prior quarters.
We previously communicated that we expected re-banding spend in 2011 to be similar to the same level spent in 2010,
which was approximately $450 million. We now expect 2011 re-banding spend of $300 million to $350 million due to
additional time needed by public safety licensees to complete their reconfigurations. Looking ahead, and consistent
with our previous forecast, the company expects to generate positive Free Cash Flow for 2011 and for the second
through the fourth quarter of 2011.
For the third quarter, we expect that Free Cash Flow will be negative, due to higher CapEx, interest payments, and a
decline in accounts payable. In the second quarter, the accounts payable balance increased, resulting from device
purchases near the end of the quarter and it's expected to return to a normal lower level in the third quarter. We expect
Free Cash Flow to be positive in the fourth quarter.
Now moving on to Slide 15, the Network Vision project progressed well through the second quarter. Working with our
three vendors, Alcatel-Lucent, Samsung, and Ericsson, we reached a number of milestones, including the successful
completion of 1X voice calls and 1X data and SMS transmissions in both the 819 MHz bands, as well as EVDO in
1,900 MHz.
We have started zoning and permitting work on over 20,000 sites and expect to complete deployment on a small
number of those cell sites by the end of the fourth quarter. As we stated on our first quarter earnings call, we will
continue to conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field and we expect to begin initial deployment in eight of the
largest metro markets following successful testing in early fourth quarter.
We are in the process of renegotiating our Master Agreements for cell site leases with the major tower companies in
connection with Network Vision and have executed agreements with three of those power companies, including
amendments to important contracts with Crown Castle impacting over 10,000 of Sprint's cell sites.
These agreements establish uniform rates for deploying all Network Vision sites, rather than negotiating tower
contracts on a site-by-site basis. This provides a high degree of cost predictability to Sprint as our network evolves and
grows. The lease renegotiations completed through June 30, 2011 resulted in an incremental increase to future lease
commitments related to cell sites totaling $2.3 billion. Once the migration of existing iDEN customers to a single
network platform under Network Vision is complete, we expect our cell and switch site lease commitments to decline.
For the second quarter, we recorded additional non-cash rent expense of $10 million, as a result of these new
agreements. Our expectation of the costs and benefits related to Network Vision, excluding spectrum hosting, are
unchanged since the program was initially announced. With the flexibility to use our own spectrum and network assets
and also to deploy spectrum owned by others, Network Vision provides Sprint the opportunity to offer 4G services that
were not available in the past.
As Dan mentioned, we will hold a meeting in New York on October 7th, in which we will outline our plans to leverage
this innovative architecture to enable our 4G strategy. We plan to discuss our technology and spectrum roadmap,
including the potential for additional spectrum hosting.
Now, turning to Slide 16, as Dan mentioned, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we have entered into a 15-year
agreement with LightSquared that includes spectrum hosting, 4G wholesale and 3G roaming services. This agreement
Company Name: Sprint Corp
Company Ticker: S US
Date: 2011-07-28

leverages our core investment in Network Vision to provide flexibility and access to spectrum that we may choose to
use in the future. Obviously, this agreement is also a benefit to LightSquared, as a result of avoiding having to build a
Greenfield network.
From Sprint's perspective, as a result of the work we expect to do for LightSquared during the eight year initial
performance period under the contract, we expect to receive approximately $9 billion of cash. We also expect to
receive LTE and satellite purchase credits, which are currently estimated to be valued at approximately $4.5 billion. We
expect to receive the benefits of the cash and the credits over an 11-year period, as a result of the staggered build and
assuming we use 100% of the credits earned. This $13.5 billion is expected to be recorded in revenue over the 11-year
period. The OIBDA and margin impact is expected to be positive and is one of the ways we may improve our margins.
It is also expected to be Free Cash Flow accretive over the same 11-year period. This transaction has no current impact
on Clearwire.
We will continue to operate under our existing wholesale agreement with Clearwire, which includes 4G purchase
commitments through 2012 and, at our option, could continue the wholesale arrangement indefinitely. Sprint may have
discussions with other spectrum owners regarding spectrum hosting. Any future agreements could provide Sprint
additional 4G capacity to further improve our margin, while allowing a spectrum partner to reduce costs and time to
market to deploy their own 4G services.
The LightSquared arrangement contains contingencies related to the resolution of interference issues with
LightSquared spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the agreement if certain conditions are not met by the
end of 2011. If Sprint exercises its termination right, only those payments received from LightSquared that have not
been contractually earned, including amounts not expended or contractually committed to support hosting services, will
be required to be refunded to LightSquared. During the term of the arrangement, Sprint has the option to purchase up to
50% of the expected 4G LTE capacity. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquared's material breach,
non-payment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquared spectrum-related assets.
Before I conclude, I will cover our forecast for 2011. Today, we reconfirmed our forecast for 2011, as provided in the
Forecast section of our first quarter 2011 earnings release dated April 28, 2011. The company expects net postpaid
subscriber additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total net wireless subscriber additions in 2011 as compared to
2010.
We expect full-year capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $3 billion. In addition, the
company expects to generate positive Free Cash Flow for 2011 and for the second through the fourth quarters of 2011.
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we continued to build momentum in several key metrics, but we are particularly
pleased with the growth in Wireless Service revenue. After the revenue decline the company experienced a few years
ago, reporting a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in Wireless Service revenue is encouraging. We look
forward to sharing more on our strategic network and operation plans in October.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Rollins.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Dan, I was wondering if you could talk
a little bit more about the teaser you made about June net adds? And if you could put that in the context of the full-year
expectation to be back to positive and maybe contrast that with the expense of getting those better net adds. In other
words, you said there was $120 million of extra promotions in the quarter. Did that relate more to June or was it
priming the pump to get to June? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, Michael. Well, basically, Q2 was almost a tale of two halves, if you will, where we had
the first half of the quarter and the second half of the quarter. So we felt confident in reaffirming our, as you mentioned
earlier, our previous guidance with respect to being postpaid net add positive for the year, based upon the way we
exited the quarter. And they were based upon actions we took in the quarter. The one thing that is changing in terms of
– we'll call it the economics of our industry, is that with the advent of smartphones, actually customer lifetime value per
customer is going up, is improving because, as you know, there's four elements that drive the profitability of a
customer. The most important two are churn and ARPU. Those are both improving.
But the subsidy expense and the cost of service, the expenses are higher. So in essence, it's slightly, if you will, the
customer financials have a little more risk in them, but they have more long-term benefits. So the cost of, if you will, of
adding new customers early on is higher. So as we mentioned, we took some actions in the quarter that – and we had
some new devices launch, let's say later in the quarter, in this quarter. The bigger, by the way, the largest increase in
cost or subsidy cost really had to do with changing, as I'd mentioned in my comments earlier, changing from a mail-in
rebate to an instant rebate. That is much more consistent with the simplicity that we're trying to provide our customers
and there was basically a cost to do that.
So that's really – I think – I hope I have answered your question. That is the relationship to, we'll call it, our guidance
for the year that we saw improving performance through the second quarter, particularly. And we had a pretty strong
June. June was our best month of the year. So that's why we felt we were exiting Q2 more strongly and it was as a
result of some of the actions that we took. And the largest and most significant was going to instant rebates.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Barden.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first question I have, Dan, is just – or
maybe, Joe, with respect to the LightSquared relationship. Could you talk about the sequencing of that relationship?
Obviously, you've received money from them, presumably as a prepayment to start building out sites for them. Is that
how we should think about the relationship working, is that this is going to be a consistently cash flow positive kind of
prepaid relationship with the company? And if that's the case, obviously, you have a second lien on the spectrum, but
we're not really sure what spectrum is really there to be used and what kind of first lien room is ahead of you in that
company. Could you elaborate a little bit on your comfort level with their funding situation and how far you're willing
to go down this path and maintain your comfort level? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Sure. So a couple of things, so first off, we've gotten the $290 million and let me just
point out that, from a cash basis versus the accrual basis on the books will be different. So obviously, we will be getting
pre-funding of any work that we would be doing for LightSquared. But from a book perspective, we will be
accumulating those cash payments in deferred revenue and then they will get recognized as we turn on segments of the
network. So understand that there will be a difference between cash recognition and book recognition. I think Dan
mentioned in his remarks that we need clear GPS spectrum before we go forward. So we can get started with a lot of
the planning and those things, but we need to get clearance on the spectrum before we start any heavy construction.

<Q - David W. Barden>: But just quick following up on that, Joe, beyond the FCC approval, assuming that they do
get it, again, how far, again, are you willing to go down this path? Is there any funding contingencies on this? Because I
guess LightSquared thinks that they need about $3.5 billion more money through their peak funding period in 2013 in
order to have the business they want to have. Are you going to do this and, I guess, how far are you willing to go down
the path without any incremental funding announcement?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Well, the arrangements are all prepaid so we're hoping that during this period of time that
they're trying to achieve clearance, they're going to be out in the marketplace going to raise money, so we should have
plenty of runway room before anything gets committed.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Joe.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for Joe, can you go through a little bit for me
the $73 million in disputes and settlements. Is that all one-time? And so we should really look at that as not really in the
jumping off point for 3Q?
And then second, for Dan, can you talk about your confidence in the company's ability to grow for the year, it sounds
like June was positive, but we talked about the little higher churn in the – excuse me – in third quarter. Where do you
expect the gross add share to really come from? Is this the better handset selection? Do you expect more marketing
events and things like that? Or are you relying on a little reduction in the competitive level of the industry? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Sure. In regards to the items that we talked in the $73 million, we'll always have
settlements, so trying to refer to them as one-time is probably inappropriate. But we obviously, anytime we have
settlements on anything, we'd love to be giving the Street a little heads up before they happened. I was brand new,
wasn't able to do that. So we just wanted to call them out that they weren't really part of what I'll call the ongoing
operations of the business.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Phil, I think number one, as I mentioned earlier, it's just the – it's the trend line. Secondly, from
a competitive environment, the second quarter was really the first full quarter for some key new devices and markets.
So for example, the iPhone at Verizon, it was the first full quarter for that, same with AT&T's $49 iPhone. Also,
Verizon launched three new LTE devices in the quarter, launched a number of new 4G markets. So there was just a
tremendous competitive intensity in the quarter that made it more challenging. We do intend also to have a stronger
handset line-up in the second half of the year. And I think our new advertising and our distinct position in the market of
being the only unlimited player is going to help us, as well.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, guys, maybe just a couple of follow-ups on the – some of the
expense items. I guess, Dan, you said the instant rebate program was the biggest driver of that $120 million. Now, just
to be a little bit more specific, was that – when did that start? And I guess I would imagine that would -- is going to
continue into the future. Do you see those -- that $120 million growing into the third quarter? And then, I guess, the
other one is being the cost of services with more handsets out there, or 4G handsets out there, and the new agreement
with Clearwire, how is that going to trend quarter-to-quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of the margin trajectory here
in the Wireless business, given what we saw sequentially in the second quarter?

<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Let me take the first part of your question and I'll leave any what sounds like additional
financial guidance, or lack thereof, to Joe. We changed the rebate plan on the 1st of April so basically it was new for
the quarter.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: So that's why we took a fairly large hit, if you will, in this quarter.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, I think the instant rebate was one of the things that drove a lot of the cost in the
quarter. It represented about $75 million, so it was the biggest portion of it. The port-in credits obviously were a lot
less. They were actually less than 10%. So I think as we go forward, we continue to modify how we look at it.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: But that's shouldn't grow. You don't think that $120 million going into the third quarter, but, I
mean, I guess the concern is that, like you said, Dan, you're seeing more 4G competition, as Verizon and eventually
AT&T here start lighting up these 4G networks, and you're going to need to maintain competitiveness going forward to
be postpaid positive. But does that -- do you think that $120 million that you spent is a good number going forward?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: No. I think actually going forward, it won't be that bad. This was a unique quarter because
of the intense competition. We made some conscious decision in controlling the levers to make sure that we didn't get
killed on a market share basis when you have Verizon with a full quarter of the iPhone in the market, with AT&T
lowering it to $49. So we think we took some unique measures to try to protect our momentum that we had going on in
the marketplace and as we exited the fourth quarter and you saw the performance of the HTC EVO and the 3D, gave us
confidence in going into the third quarter, but probably not at the same rate of costs.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Hi, good morning. Maybe a couple of questions, first, on Network Vision, some of the
recent tower agreements obviously coming together. You put out the release yesterday with Crown Castle. I'm just
wondering what flexibility do you have in these agreements as it relates to spectrum hosting? Is this included in these
agreements specifically and that the LightSquared deal has spectrum contingencies built in before you move forward?
Just wondering if that means you've secured the tower agreements to be able to do this when you get comfort around
the spectrum or if that's another step you'll have to take subsequently?
And then quickly, on prepaid, good quarter in what is usually a tough seasonal period. Just wondering if you can help
shed a little light on that? Is it predominantly Assurance opening up in new states? Is it share gains? Or is just
seasonality less impactful than historically? Thank you.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, Jason, Dan here. I'll take the second half and then I'll let Steve Elfman answer the first
part of the question. But in Q2, the real MVP was Assurance. So the growth you can really attribute to a strong quarter
from Assurance Wireless on prepaid. Steve?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Hi. Steve Elfman. We announced the Crown Castle and two others this past week.
And they both -- they provide flexibility for different spectrum, and I would also just like to say that they are -- been
good deals for both. It's a win-win for the tower company and for ourselves.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. There has been a lot of chatter about whether you guys might
get the iPhone later this year, and I understand you can't really comment a whole lot on that specifically, but maybe
within the context of your experience with iconic devices, if we were to see a product like that in your line-up at some
point in the next couple of months, how should we expect that to impact your operating trends? Do those type of
devices typically result in share gains from a gross add standpoint? Or at this point, is it mostly just another tool you
can use to drive churn to lower levels? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, Brett. This is Dan. Fortunately or unfortunately in our industry, there has been a trend
over the last few years where iconic devices are becoming a more important element of the overall consideration set
that a customer goes through. There's clearly price value, network quality, retail experience, care experience. They're
all important, but the device is becoming a larger and larger piece of that. So that's why we put so much focus the last
couple of years on strengthening the device portfolio. And you're right to point out that the iPhone historically for
AT&T and for the past roughly quarter and a half has been an important part of Verizon's arsenal. It's both important
for gross adds and for churn.
I think we, like our competitors, upgrade a substantial percentage of our customers each quarter, and it's an important
retention tool to have the device that your existing customers want, as well as if you have particularly an iconic device
that might be only yours or exclusive, it can help drive gross adds. So it's a crucial part of your marketing element for
both acquisition and retention, and you will see them both improve or both deteriorate based upon the strength of your
overall device line-up, particularly, we'll call them, iconic devices.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Horan.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: This may be two questions. I might have missed this, but can you give us maybe some
range of when the LTE networks might start to light up, either on your own or LightSquared. And secondly, Dan, just
on the net add guidance, are you not as concerned with the iPhone 5 coming out maybe that iPhone penetration is so
high now that the iPhone 5 won't have as much impact on you guys as maybe as the Street expects? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: In regards to your first question, we plan on October 7th walking you through our entire
Network Vision plan and operational plan, so we'll give you all of the details at that time.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Great.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: You cut out on your second question. It said something -- it was about the iPhone 5, what did
it – what was the question?
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Do you expect it to have much impact on you? I mean, it's -- a lot of the media expects it to
come out come mid-September; would you expect it to have much impact this quarter or into the fourth quarter?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, we don't comment on speculation. I think there's been a tremendous amount of
speculation, which historically has been much of it's been proven to be false, so I don't want to speculate on what
devices may or may not be launched when.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you very much. Good morning. Dan, I wonder if you could comment on the
relationship with Clearwire. You've got the wholesale agreement done, but where do you stand in negotiating things
like network sharing or more close interaction? You've taken your voting stake down recently below 50%. You
obviously have strong momentum in your 4G devices, 1.7 million this quarter so there is an interdependency here and
they have talked about needing cash to get through to EBITDA breakeven and free cash flow breakeven. So how does
that relationship stand today and how do you think about your options with regard to Clearwire over the next year or
two?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, we don't comment about ongoing discussions or negotiations between ourselves and
other companies. I think you're right to point out that we recently entered a wholesale agreement that is very substantial
between now and the end of 2012. And this quarter we gave Clearwire 1.7 million new reasons to be pleased with the
relationship with Sprint. And we've described earlier the voting interest. It doesn't change our economic interest at all,
our business relationships at all, but it was done to provide some protections, which we've explained earlier.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, Simon, if we were to go to the marketplace to try to raise money, we didn't want
any confusion about any potential cost defaults regarding their debt and that's why we lowered our interest.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Yijing Brentano>: Brandiss, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Okay. And that comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks, guys. One quick point of clarification and then a question, so on the point of
clarification, I just want to clarify on the EBITDA guidance for the year. I think on the first quarter, the flat EBITDA
included the $200 million to $250 million of Network Vision expense and now it seems to exclude that expense. I just
wanted to make sure that I was interpreting that correctly. And then I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit
of color on how you think margin trends should progress from here in Wireless during the course of the year and also
churn trends. You've obviously had big year-over-year improvements. Does churn follow the normal seasonal patterns
from here or could you continue to see it step down on a quarter-over-quarter basis? Thank you.

<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So on the answer to your first question, we haven't changed guidance at all. And I think if
you go back and look at our remarks, we had stated it the same way, so I think you just got to double check your facts.
But there have been no changes to our guidance on our OIBDA. We've given you guidance for the full year in regards
to OIBDA, so that should help you where you think margins are going to go for the latter part of the year. And we've
talked to you about seasonal patterns in the third quarter, so I think we did make comments on all of those things that
you just asked and to give you at least some help in considering what the future looks like.
