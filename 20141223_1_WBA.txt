Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. I'll keep my remarks relatively
short today. I will review the results from the quarter, provide an update on our progress toward the completion of the
second step of our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots, and offer some final thoughts before I turn the call over to
Tim for a detailed financial review.
We had a solid first quarter across both our pharmacy and retail products businesses with a strong holiday season and
good cost control across our enterprise. In fact, our stores' year-over-year sales growth exceeded the overall retail
market heading into the holiday season, which positions us well as we close out the calendar year. So I want to
congratulate our teams for their success.
For the full quarter, sales were a record $19.6 billion, up 6.7% from $18.3 billion year ago. GAAP operating income for
the quarter was $991 million, up 7.1% from $924 million last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was
$1.14 billion, up 3.5% from $1.1 billion in the first quarter 2014. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.85 in the
first quarter compared to $0.72 last year, up 18.1%. First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.81, up
12.5% from $0.72 in the same quarter last year.
In terms of our front end, or our retail products performance, while customer traffic in comparable stores edged down
2.7%, we were pleased that basket size was up 4.2%, resulting in total comparable sales for our retail products being up
1.5% relative to the year-ago quarter. As for pharmacy, we were also pleased that prescription sales grew 9% or 8.1%
in comparable stores, as our retail market share increased 10 basis points from a year ago to 19%.
As we finish out the holiday selling season in the next few days, we're also very focused on completing the work
necessary to close our transaction with Alliance Boots. In November, we secured financing to close the transaction as
well as refinance the majority of Alliance Boots outstanding debt. We also issued our definitive proxy statement in
preparation for our special shareholders meeting in New York on December 29.
We're currently on track to finalize the merger ahead of our original schedule. As we announced this morning, we now
expect to close the transaction on December 31 subject to shareholder approval. This is truly an extraordinary milestone
in a strategic journey we began six years ago to position Walgreens for a new generation of growth and value creation.
Wrapping up, let me touch on the journey we began six years ago, a journey that included transforming the front-end of
our drugstores, advancing the role community pharmacy plays in healthcare, and is culminated by taking Walgreens
global, creating the first pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. As I've said before, bringing these two iconic
brands together will be difficult if not impossible to replicate.
It has been my privilege to lead us to this point, to have had the opportunity to bring Walgreens to the world and
Alliance Boots to America. I wish Jim, Stefano, and the rest of this very talented leadership team all the best as they
now bring our vision to life through Walgreens Boots Alliance.
From everything I know and everything I've learned at this company over the past 35 years, I'm completely confident
that the combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots will truly change the face of global pharmacy, retail, and
wholesale. And I'm even more confident that the best days for our company are still ahead. And that's a tribute to the
hard work and commitment of over 350,000 women and men of both Walgreens and Alliance Boots who have made
this great journey and future possible.
On a personal note, I'd like to thank everyone on this call and many others for your thoughtful insight into our business.
I've appreciated your work, thoughts, and comments over the years. I also wanted to wish all of you a very happy and

healthy holiday season.
With that, thank you, and I'll now be stepping off and turning the remainder of the call, including the Q&A, over to
Tim. Tim?
Timothy R. McLevish
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. I want to cover two topics today:
first, to provide greater detail on our first quarter performance; and second, to share some thoughts on our expectations
post the closing of the deal with Alliance Boots.
As Greg mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results as they came largely in line with our expectations and
got us off to a good start to fiscal 2015. Our adjusted EPS of $0.81 reflects the execution of our strategy, with strong
revenue growth and solid expense management for the quarter.
Let me begin with a discussion of total revenue, which increased 6.7% year over year. This was due in part to strong
comparable store script growth of 4.1%, which built on a solid base of 5.5% growth in the same quarter last year. To
help drive that performance, we continued our focus on winning and gaining share with high-value seniors through
preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans. On balance, this business carries lower margins than the rest of our
script business, but remains quite attractive as it drives incremental revenue and gross profit dollars.
This strategy contribute to our overall retail pharmacy share increasing this quarter as we grew scripts by 10 basis
points more than the rest of the retail industry according to IMS data. We're also pleased with the progress we're
making in driving our front end, or retail products comp. For the quarter, we reported 1.5% comp growth building up a
strong 2.4% comp in the same quarter last year. Our strategy is working. This is evidenced by margin and basket size
being up while traffic is down slightly. Our main focus remains to drive profitable growth and thereby achieving the
right balance between sales and margins.
Let me now talk a little more about the retail products margin. This marked the third quarter in a row with
year-over-year improvement in retail products gross margin, which indicates that our strategy is beginning to pay
dividends. Let me remind you of the key elements of our strategy: first, the focus on enhancing our mix towards more
upscale retail products to drive higher margins; second, to drive supply chain efficiencies by removing excess costs and
thereby improving overall store productivity; and third, to leverage our Balance Rewards loyalty program to derive
valuable insights that will allow us to better target our promotional investments.
And now I'll shift to our pharmacy segment, which continued to face margin pressure due to third-party reimbursement
pressure from contract step downs, ongoing generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs at a similar rate to what
we saw in the fourth quarter last year, and finally increased mix of specialty drugs. Partially offsetting these pharmacy
margin decreases were the positive effects of a step-up in the introduction of new generics this quarter and purchasing
synergies generated by our joint purchasing group.
For the quarter, the margin weakness in the pharmacy segment was only partially offset by improvement in the retail
products segment. On balance, this resulted in overall adjusted gross margin being down 120 basis points
year-over-year to 27.3%. As we look forward, we expect negative factors impacting pharmacy margin to intensify in
the second quarter as the impact from a meaningful step down in Medicare Part D rates begins January 1.
While we view margin percent as an important metric to help assess the overall health of our business on a long-term
basis, we remain focused on leveraging our largely fixed cost structure by driving gross profit dollars in the near-term.
Our focus is for gross profit dollar growth rate to exceed SG&A dollar growth by greater than 100 basis points.
During the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our gross profit grew $144 million outpacing SG&A change of $77 million and
thereby contributing $67 million to operating income. On an adjusted basis, gross profit dollars increased by $133
million while SG&A dollars increased by $72 million year-over-year contributing $61 million to operating income.
This resulted in spread of positive 90 basis points, which is an improvement from the 50 basis points positive variance

we saw last quarter.
Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased 2.6% this quarter despite the pharmacy pressures we are currently
experiencing. We remain focused on mitigating the impact of these negative factors through a number of mechanisms,
including leveraging our buying group to secure better costs for drugs, incorporating inflation protection and payer
contracts as they come up for renewal, and continuing to help align appropriate industry reimbursement levels.
Additionally, we expect our retail products initiatives to continue to further drive gross profit dollar growth.
Adjusted SG&A dollars increased by 1.7% for the quarter. We are quite pleased with our expense management during
Q1. And with the pressures we're expressing in our pharmacy margins, we become even more focused on cost control
such as lowering our cost to fill to help create a more sustainable profitability.
As we communicated previously, we've identified and remain on track to achieve the $1 billion in cost savings
reflected in our fiscal year 2016 goals. While there will naturally be some incremental variable cost as we continue to
aggressively grow our business, we expect these will be mitigated by our cost savings program. We are looking to
identify further cost savings opportunities and will update you after that review is complete.
Combined net synergies for the quarter totaled $140 million and adjusted EPS accretion from our investment in
Alliance Boots was $0.11 for the quarter. Both of these were in line with our expectations. Please remember, last year's
adjusted accretion received a $0.07 tax benefit from the U.K. tax law change while this year's included a $0.02 benefit
from a one-time gain on an acquisition. The progress we're making with synergies is slightly ahead of schedule. It's still
early, but we believe there is upside to our original $650 million goal for the fiscal year and we'll provide more detail
on our second quarter earnings call.
Now let me walk you through our adjusted EPS. The GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share reconciles to an adjusted
earnings of a positive $0.81 per share for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. The net adjustment of $0.04 includes
the removal of the following: a LIFO provision of $0.03 per share; $0.13 per share of acquisition-related items, which
consisted of $0.06 of acquisition-related amortization costs, $0.02 of acquisition-related costs, $0.04 from Alliance
Boots related tax, and $0.01 from interest associated with the Walgreens Boots Alliance debt issuance.
And finally, a net impact of $0.20 from special items comprised of $0.02 per share negative impact from costs related
to the corporate and store optimization costs, $0.10 per share negative impact from fair value adjustments on currency
hedges, $0.09 positive impact related to the partial release of a tax valuation allowance and $0.23 positive impact of the
warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens Alliance Boots. The Alliance Boots impact was reported on a
three-month lag basis.
Moving on to our balance sheet, I would like to share a couple of words on primary working capital, which I define as
accounts receivable plus inventories minus accounts payable. Accounts receivable increased $850 million. Our
third-party receivables are in very good shape, down approximately $40 million year-over-year. The increase was
primarily due to higher vendor funding receivables from the joint venture and rebates for AmerisourceBergen.
LIFO inventories decreased $1.2 billion. About two-thirds of this improvement came from pharmacy inventory
reduction in conjunction with the terms of our agreement with AmerisourceBergen. The remainder was retail products
inventory reduction due to our initiatives to improve store-level supply chain efficiencies.
And accounts payable increased $400 million, largely due to reclassifying due from vendors up to the receivables line,
as I just mentioned. Overall, net working capital decreased by $700 million or 13.8% versus a year ago, which helped
drive solid cash flow performance for the quarter.
We generated approximately $1 billion in cash from operations versus $133 million in the year-ago period. Recall that
cash flow in last year's quarter was adversely impacted by the timing of payments related to the AmerisourceBergen
transaction. Free cash flow was $696 million versus a negative $231 million in the prior-year period. We were pleased
with the cash generation during the first quarter, due partly to the working capital improvement I just mentioned as well
as improved earnings.

In addition to the $500 million in shares we bought back in fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we bought another $500
million worth this quarter. The number of diluted shares decreased by approximately 12 million from last quarter.
Now let's talk about the rest of fiscal 2015. We do understand that you will not have a reliable base on which to build
your fiscal 2015 estimates, so we'll provide additional information after we've had a chance to review our plans with
the Walgreens Boots Alliance board. As you can appreciate, there are a lot of unusual factors that will impact results in
the second quarter. Some of these are still being developed. Therefore, we're not prepared to quantify our expectations
at this time. In the meantime, let me give you some key factors for you to consider in your models.
Subject to shareholder approval, we're expecting to close the deal with Alliance Boots on December 31 of this year. We
will eliminate the three-month reporting lag. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150
million per quarter. This factors in the recent financing with a blended rate of approximately 3.2%.
We will add 144.3 million incremental shares as partial consideration for the acquisition. Walgreens Boots Alliance
fiscal year end will be August 31. And remember that our future earnings will be impacted by exchange rate
movements, most notably in the pound sterling and to a lesser extent the euro.
Moving on to fiscal year 2016, many of you have asked my thoughts on our outlined goals. And now that I have been
here for nearly five months, I've had enough time to make a thorough assessment. Based on everything I've reviewed
and learned, I'm comfortable that the fiscal year 2016 goals and their associated assumptions are reasonable and
reflective of the markets.
I'm confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the controllable elements that drive the adjusted
EPS range. For those variables that are beyond our control, we have also identified actions that can help mitigate any
unforeseen pressures. All goals involve risks and opportunities, and we know that we must continue to execute in order
to deliver on them.
I would now like to provide a few thoughts around our financial reporting and communications going forward. With
regard to WBA, we are working diligently to develop the appropriate metrics and measures to help you better
understand our business fundamentals. To that end, we will break out the performance of the new company into three
reporting segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, which will include Walgreens and Duane Reade; Retail Pharmacy
International, which has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, and Pharmaceutical
Wholesale, which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries.
We plan to share more details at an upcoming Analyst Day in New York that we will host in the months after closing
the deal. We will provide you more specifics on this event as we finalize our plans.

2.6% increase in gross profit dollars this quarter. How do you expect the cadence of that to look like over the next few
quarters? It does sound like that would deteriorate over the second quarter. And then from an SG&A standpoint, is
there opportunity there where you still believe that you'll be able to drive better gross profit dollar growth versus
SG&A growth over the next few quarters?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Sure, Ed. So let me just talk about the pressures that we're experiencing from a gross
margin standpoint. There is ongoing pressure from generic inflation. Some of the impact that we had in the fourth
quarter was mitigated a little bit through some improvement in average wholesale price and the related impact on the
GURs [Generic Use Rates, et cetera. Certainly, we've generated some additional synergies from our joint venture
buying group in Switzerland.
And then as we've – I pointed out that we do expect a step down in reimbursement levels associated with the Med Part
D that's already contracted in. So on a going forward basis, we do expect continued pressure and maybe a little bit
additional pressure going into the second quarter and thereafter. We'll continue to – I mean, expect that we'll see some
improvement in the average wholesale price, which helps reimbursements. We'll continue to generate the synergy we
can to mitigate that on an ongoing basis.
And I will remind you that there's lots of speculation about the wisdom of taking on the Med Part D contracts. I will tell
you that incrementally it is very attractive business. Now, clearly, I mean there is a negative impact on overall margin
percentage and even dollars relative to last year, but had we not undertaken that, it would've had a serious impact on
both our revenues and our overall margins. So, I mean, at the end of the day, it was a good thing for us to take that and
it generates – continues to keep an attractive customer base coming to our stores and doing business with us.
We've talked about $1 billion cost reduction program. We made some good progress on that in the first quarter of this
year as is evidenced by our results. We continue to execute against that, and I would expect that largely to offset a big
piece of the margin pressure that we continue to experience.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Great. Thank you, happy holidays, guys.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Thank you very much, Ed.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Hey. So two related things, I guess, for Tim. Do you think – could third quarter
reimbursement pressure be greater than the second just because of the three months?
And then secondly for Alex, how are you guarding against all of this cost removal adversely impacting service levels in
the stores? You've taken out an awful lot and you certainly don't want to trample on service aspects in the stores.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yeah. I mean, in the second quarter, obviously, we have the step down in Med D, so
we'll have some pressure there. I wouldn't expect further pressure from there. There isn't a natural step down in the
third quarter on Med D. We'll have to see how the generic inflation plays out, but over time, we kind of eat into a little
bit of that as the reimbursements get some support with improvement in AWP, et cetera. So I don't expect a material
more pressure in the third quarter relative to the second quarter.
But let me – before I turn it over to Alex to respond, I just want to say one thing. Our cost reduction efforts certainly, at
some point, has to take cost out of the store level, but that's the reverse order in which we're focusing on it. We're
starting at the corporate level and working our way down through the supply chain and we're making best efforts to
mitigate any impact it may have on delivering service to our customers. And in fact, some of the things we're doing is
taking workload off of our store managers and our store employees to enable them to better focus on customers. So
with that, let me turn it over to Alex to comment.

<A - Alex Gourlay>: Thanks, Tim. Hi, John. It's Alex here. Yeah, Tim's right. I think the best example to give you is
the inventory reduction across the business. Tim said it was $1.2 billion in the quarter, $400 million-ish in the
front-end, and that's just reduced a lot of workload in the stores, and that means that our people in the stores are able to
spend more time focusing on customers and making sure they can actually get the right product on the shelf at the right
time.
We're feeling pretty good about program. It's reducing costs naturally and reducing working capital and making us
more efficient. So that's a great example of one of the efforts in terms of our cost reduction. We're really focused on
workload in the corporate office and really importantly in stores, and we're really focused on giving our customers
great care so we can make sure they come back time and time again. We think these two things are completely
compatible, and that's what we're focused on.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Let me comment on one other piece. You noted the mix of the impact on the front-end
on our retail products business. Traffic was down a little bit, margin was up and basket size was up. A big piece of that
was elimination of questionable promotions from last year, but again, as we endeavor to upgrade the quality of our
product on the front-end, improve the margin percentage and eliminate some of those unprofitable promotions, it
actually takes a fair amount of work out of the store. So rather than hang – lots of hangtags of discounts and so forth,
our store employees are much better positioned to be supporting and providing service to our customers.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Great. Thank you and good morning. I believe in mid-November you released a
filing with some internal targets, particularly an EPS target of $3.40 in fiscal 2015. I'm wondering if you could frame
the results today, which were very good, as well as commentary that you're ahead of the $650 million in synergies this
year and the closing date of Boots with that target as it relates to the internal target.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Alvin, I want to remind you that what you read in our S-4, our proxy statement, was a
piece of information provided to the bankers to enable them to generate fairness opinion on the transaction and we
haven't confirmed that information. But I will simply tell you this that the results of the first quarter are largely aligned
with our expectation for the year. I mean, it's kind of where we had anticipated the first quarter coming in, and it's
aligned with our projections for the year.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Thanks very much. Tim, I think that when you talked about reimbursement pressure, one of
the things you talked about was specialty, obviously a lot of new specialty drugs coming to market. Can you talk about
the difference in the margin for specialty products versus some of the other brands and generic products? And
secondly, as you think about your specialty pharmacy business for Walgreens, what do you see as some of the
opportunities as we move into 2015?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: So we regard specialty as a very important and strategic business. It carries some
characteristics, which create some distortions to some of the metrics as you might look at them, but at the end of the
day it's attractive business and it's our strategy to continue to grow that business.
These numbers aren't going to be perfect and precise, because they're averages, but how I think about the specialty
business is, you're talking about very expensive prescription drugs. They tend to carry prices up to 30 times what our

average prescription would carry. They carry gross profit perhaps 10 times what our average gross profit would be
across the rest of our portfolio.
So net-net that means that our margin percentage is going to be considerably less and it will put downward pressure on
that margin percentage. However, generating margins of 10X what our average is with modestly more SG&A to
support it means it's a very attractive business for us. Again, it may distort the ratios, but it's very attractive and it
generates very attractive dollar margins to support our business and operating profits.
I would also look to see – the next test is kind of what is the return on investment on it, but on average, probably the
required inventory to support that is actually less than the average because typically we don't carry those prescriptions
in the pharmacies or in our warehouses. It sits in our case now AmerisourceBergen or upstream in the channels, so we
aren't carrying the inventory to support it. So it's attractive business on most every level even though it creates some
distortion in some of the ratios.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And then, Tim, as you think about specialty and you think about infusion, there have been
some news reports that you're looking to divest your infusion business. CVS recently has bought an infusion business.
Can you maybe just discuss why you don't see that as part of the offering around specialty?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: We don't comment on speculation or rumors in the marketplace. We've never confirmed
any of those rumors.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Tim, one of the items that's been talked about in the past is that your occupancy cost is a
little higher than you'd like it to be. Can you give us some read on how many of the stores will be rolling off of their
leases and you could start to work down on that occupancy cost, or any other plans you have to work the occupancy
costs down.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: On balance, we've employed over the years a strategy to have the best corner location in
any geography, with an intent that it would generate more traffic and more revenue and obviously more margins and
more profits. In some cases that worked; in some cases it didn't. But on balance, it left us with an occupancy cost both
in terms of rent or lease cost and other occupancy as part of the strategy to provide better service and try to drive higher
traffic and revenues et cetera. So in some cases, or in many cases, on balance the average, when we look at it relative to
our primary competitor, our occupancy costs and store costs are higher.
We're doing lots of things to manage down all aspects of that overall cost structure, including taking a hard look at
those stores. Obviously, we have a vast array of different terms remaining on leases. They tend to be 10-plus year
leases, and some of them are well into their life cycle. But I can't say that we would have an appreciable impact short
term on just waiting for those leases to naturally roll. We are taking the opportunity to go in where we can to
renegotiate leases, and then in some cases it's attractive for a landlord to do that. And we're looking at a variety of
things. But it's not a short-term quick-fix solution. It's all part of our cost savings initiatives that we've talked about.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Do you think you need a smaller store format moving forward, or is it just getting away
from these marquee locations where you were just paying too much rent?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: It covers the spectrum. I'll let Alex talk about it, but in some locations, we would benefit
by a smaller format store. And in some cases, we're well served by having the size and scale that we have. But Alex?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, Mark. It's Alex here. We build every single store more or less same size. It was built around
the pharmacy business. I think it's a fantastic strategy, as Tim has said. So clearly, we're now looking at it from a retail
point of view. And formats is one of the options we're looking at in terms of how do we make more use of the asset. So

it's a combination of, as Tim has said, rent reductions over time, potentially some space moves over time, but also how
to make even better use of the asset by having the right offer in that locality for the customers who are actually based
around that store. These are all strategies that we're now deploying.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: As we've built the fleet, as Alex mentioned, we tended to use a cookie-cutter approach.
So if you look at most of our stores, they're quite similar in appearance and size and scale et cetera. As we go forward,
we'll probably adapt that format a little bit more to the market conditions and so forth. And we're doing everything we
can for the existing fleet where the size doesn't fit optimally to the market to adjust, as I talked about earlier.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Tim, you started talking about cost reductions and starting at the corporate level as opposed to
the store level. Is there any way for you to quantify for us what is the corporate cost opportunity and how we should
think about that?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I'm sorry, George, but I don't want to go into specifics on where it's at. We've identified
the overall program. I've also commented, not quantified, but commented that we will look harder at our cost structure.
And in all likelihood considering market conditions and considering the opportunity we'll go more aggressively at our
cost reduction program. We haven't finalized that. We haven't communicated to our board. But as soon as we do, we'll
get back to you on it. But we're going to go after all costs wherever there's opportunity, and I prefer to start with those
that are away from the customer, the furthest away from the customer.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay, and then maybe just a really quick follow-up. You highlighted the Med D contracting
terms. Can you give us any more color on kind of the company's assumptions on volume and share gains in that space
given how you're set up in the preferred networks and a lot of your preferred network partners? It looked like they're in
a position to take share this selling season. I guess any further color you can give us on the change in reimbursement
expectation versus the change the volume would be very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: On balance, we're some underwater on the incremental share and the incremental scripts
that we've picked up relative to the step down and those that we already had. So if we had assumed that we could keep
all of the existing scripts at the old prices we're deriving, it wasn't very attractive for us to enter into this contract but
the likelihood that somebody else would pick it up and would take that business away from us was quite high and it
was better for us to continue to participate with somewhat lower margins on the existing business that we're doing and
we've picked up some incremental customers and prescriptions. But I can't quantify exactly what that is. On balance,
though, I would say it resulted in a step down in margins from the prior year.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay, so volumes for 2015 expectations?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Alex Gourlay here. I just made a comment. It's not so much on volume being ready. We're
feeling pretty good about the market just now. The market is growing quite well. We've seen more lives coming into
the market through the various nations and the governments. We're clearly well prepared for the January period when a
lot of people present scripts in the market for the first time to the new pharmacy. So we have a big focus on that and
we're feeling good about how well prepared we are in the market and the market looks solid as you've seen from others
as well in this period.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. I'm curious as you look forward thinking about the pharmacy gross margin,
what your strategy is in terms of reimbursement rates, I think historically there was a focus on getting a strong
reimbursement for filling scripts at Walgreens store. I understand what's going on with Med D. But as you're thinking
about the impact and influence of preferred and more narrow networks relative to the scale of your store network, what
is your strategy in terms of trying to defend or define reimbursement in your pharmacy relative to the trend in the
market?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: It's Alex here. Hi. I think you've got to play in the market. So as always – we've always been in
the market, we've always tried to compete in the market and give payers good value in the market. And that's what
we're doing right now. Again, the market has changed, as we said before, and we're working closely with the payers to
make sure that we give them good value. So that will be the intent going forward.
The good thing we have that we didn't have before is that we have got the ability to leverage global buying through
re-buys. So again, as time goes forward, we're feeling good about where the organization is and the extra scale it's
giving us. So we're a big chain, we've got global buying power and we should and will compete.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: And I would say also, I mean, we've talked about the generic inflation that we've
experienced over the last year, and some of that is catching up as the average wholesale price gets adjusted more to
appropriate levels. The other thing that we are doing is, as contracts – reimbursement contracts expire and we renew
them, we're ensuring that we have inflation protection built into those and we're having good success in doing so.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And just a follow-up if I could on, Alex, I understand your comment on working closely with
suppliers and doing a better job even on buying. Tim, your comments earlier of upside to the $650 million this year and
looking forward – I understand you don't want to get into a ton of specifics but the source of optimism and upside, is
this more on the purchasing side or on the non-customer facing expense side? Where is the bigger incremental
opportunity you are seeing for 2015 and beyond?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Really it's on both sides, Eric. In the generics, a little – modestly in the branded, but a
big piece of it also is in the goods not for resale, as you point out. But just by sheer magnitude of the opportunities, it
more comes from the purchasing of generics. And as I said, we're making good progress and we're on pace if not a little
bit ahead on the target for the year and as we flush that out going into the second quarter, I would expect us to update
you on that and perhaps we'll see clear to providing an even better number.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. It looks like we have time for one last question from Mark Miller of William Blair. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Could you give us some perspective on the performance of Alliance Boots sales trends
organically? So I'd be looking for just any color you can give us on the retail comps and also the wholesale business as
you're bringing that business consolidating it into 2015.

<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: We do, as you know, bring in our 45% share of Alliance Boots. But until we close on
the transaction, we can't – it's a private company, and we're not at liberty to share specifics of their performance results
or growth. They do report periodically, quarterly some information on their, or I guess annually, on their website, but
they don't share detailed information, and again, we're not at liberty to share. Sorry.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Then I have an accounting question. So we're seeing the numbers for AB up through August.
What's going to happen to the results from September to December? And are there any unusual expenses that get
passed through that time period?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I mentioned earlier that when we close on 12/31, the transaction, it will obviously be
100% owned and it will be consolidated into the WBA totals. We are removing the lag as we report on a going forward
basis, but we'll restate to remove that lag and it will all be adjusted from historical perspective.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. But that period, September to December, those numbers actually, will they flow through
the P&L then? Or I mean, are there any expenses that are in that period that are unusual?
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I can't talk specifically about expenses that they're incurring. Anything that you
would've seen in ours would be reflected, but you will see when we do restate for the first quarter of 2015, after we do
consolidate, close the deal and consolidate, anything, any expenses, any unusual expenses that they might incur in that
quarter will be reflected in our consolidated numbers, so you'll have the visibility to them.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any
further remarks.
Rick J. Hans
Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. Lastly, on a personal note, I believe
all of you probably know I plan on retiring as of the end of the month. It has been my honor and pleasure to work with
Walgreens over the past 27 years and with all of you over the past 15 years as the head of Investor Relations. While
many great accomplishments have been achieved at this company over this time period, I believe the best is yet to
come. Thanks for wonderful memories, and behalf of Walgreens, so let me one last time wish you all happy holidays.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all
