MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Morgan Stanley fourth quarter earnings conference call.
Kathleen McCabe
Good morning. This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimate or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also
include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a
reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for discussion of additional risks and
uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan
Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or
instrument. I will now turn the call to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Kathleen. As we begin another year, I'd like to share my thoughts on the current
state of Morgan Stanley, discuss our progress against last year's priorities and share our plans for 2015. During my
comments, I will be referencing a presentation that you can find on the Investor Relations section of our website.
For the past five years, this management team has worked hard to do the following. One, to put the troubles of the
financial crisis clearly in the rear view mirror; two, to reposition our firm to benefit from our world class and
complementary franchises in Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and investment management as shown on
slide three; and finally, to lay out specific plans with clear signposts for investors to follow as we work towards

sustained higher returns.
Each year, we like to remind you of the key elements of the plan, mark those elements to market and refresh the plan
for the coming year so investors can properly judge our absolute and relative performance. Before I make my strategic
comments, let me briefly touch on the quarter. Our final results this year reflect a number of idiosyncratic issues,
including tax benefits, compensation changes, FVA implementation and legal reserves. In addition, the quarter reflects
a difficult market and trading environment across the industry, especially in October and the last few weeks of
December. Our trading businesses, in particular, Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading, were clearly not
immune to the unfavorable market environment.
While Q4 had several complicating elements, it was also an important quarter as we continue to put residual issues
from the financial crisis behind us. In a few minutes, Ruth will take you through the quarter in much more detail.
Before doing so, let me begin with the mark-to-market for 2014, which you can now see on slide four.
2014 was a year of focused execution against the strategic plan we have previously articulated. In Wealth Management,
we continued to improve our profit margin and are well on the way to delivering 22% to 25% margin by the end of
2015. In Fixed Income and Commodities, we continue to resize and reshape the business and doing more to drive ROE.
We continue to improve our expense ratios. We made strong progress in Morgan Stanley's specific growth
opportunities most notably growth in the banks. We increased our share buyback and for first time in several years, we
increased our dividend. As a result of these collective actions, we have made progress towards returns that meet and
exceed our cost of capital.
With that, let me turn to the six areas of strategic focus for 2015. First, Wealth Management, which is on slide six. For
full year 2014, we delivered a 20% margin in Wealth Management, up 200 basis points versus 2013 and we have a
clear path for achieving our goal of 22% to 25% by the end of this year. After taking into account the adjustment to our
compensation deferral, the pre-tax margin improved through the year. Our fourth quarter 2015 target is driven by the
revenue and operating leverage from deposit deployment and the ongoing benefits of scale.
It's important to note that this target does not take into account the benefit of eventual higher interest rates and stronger
equity market levels. The target also does not include the benefit of the positive secular trend towards fee-based
managed accounts. This trend plays to the strength of our advisory-based model and generally translates into more
stable revenues and deeper client relationships, a trend we have discussed with you in the past.
There are several additional drivers of upside for Wealth Management as we have outlined on slide seven. We continue
to grow our assets under management and ended the year with over $2 trillion of client assets, benefiting in particular
from our focus on the high net worth and ultra high net worth client segments. Since 2009, we have grown assets in the
$10 million and above household by 82% and assets in the $1 million to $10 million segment by 35%.
Our model, based on providing high valued advice, helps position us to meet the broad and complex financial planning
and investment needs of these clients. We have further upside as we attract more of our clients' deposits, a goal
consistent with our growing bank presence. Given the magnitude of the client base, even a modest increase in our share
of client deposits holds significant upside for us. Greg Fleming will share more of this opportunity with you later this
year.
Second is our bank strategy. On page eight, we describe for you the components of revenue growth in our banks. We
continue to benefit from the three tailwinds of one, growth in the deposit base and associated assets; two, the
optimization of those assets, namely moving cash into AFS and lending; and three, eventual upside from higher rates.
We see strong loan demand among our sizable Wealth Management and Institutional Securities client base. With no
bricks and mortar and embedded client base and the required infrastructure investments behind us, the incremental
margin on lending products is exceptionally high.
As a result of our ongoing progress in the bank, we're providing you updated targets for 2015, as well as growth to
$180 billion in assets by year end 2016, up from $151 billion as of year end 2014. Based on current market rates and
our expected asset mix at the end of 2016, the blended yield would be 2%. If we substitute the yields indicated by the
forward curve on the same asset base, the blended yield would be 3.1%.

Turn now, please, to slide nine. In our Institutional Securities business, our leadership in Advisory and Equity sales and
trading continues to provide further stability along with upside. In Advisory, we finished second in global completed
and announced M&A. With continued strength in large cap, cross-border M&A activity, we believe our global
footprint and leadership across products and geographies positions us well to benefit from current trends. In Equity
sales and trading, we built on the momentum of recent years with full year revenues of $6.9 billion ex-DVA, placing us
first among U.S. peers and, we expect, first, globally. Our success in 2014 reflects higher quality execution and share
gains.
This brings us to our third area of strategic focus, Fixed Income and Commodities as seen on slide 10. Against a
challenging backdrop, we made some progress on our plan to drive returns exceeding our cost of equity. Within Fixed
Income, we reduced balance sheet, risk-weighted assets and non-compensation expenses. We also maintain normalized
ROEs of greater than 10% in our areas of strength, namely Securitized Products and Credit Corporates. Furthermore,
we continue to optimize returns in rates and to roll down structured credit RWAs.
Within Commodities, we reduced our exposure to physical oil, most notably by selling TransMontaigne and we remain
committed to selling our oil merchanting business. We are also integrating the balance of our Commodities business
within sales and trading.
From a capital perspective, we remain on track to reduce Fixed Income and Commodities RWAs to $180 billion target
by year-end 2015, down from $390 billion in 2011. Furthermore, as you can see on slide 11, we will have an additional
$25 billion of deadweight risk-weighted assets that will roll down by the end of 2018, providing incremental ROE
upside. Assuming we find the right opportunities, we will utilize the [ph] associate (09:29) capital to maximize returns
across the franchise, either within Fixed Income or in other areas where client demand is consistent with the highest
return opportunities.
Number four, the next area where we see upside is the benefit from lower funding costs shown in some detail on slide
12. As the market has recognized the improvements to our business mix and balance sheet, our spreads have contracted
dramatically, more so than those of our peers. This reduces our funding costs as we finance older, more expensive debt.
This should result in meaningful reduction in our weighted average cost of unsecured funding on both an absolute and
relative basis over the next several years, providing us with further tailwind.
Last year, we issued new debt at an average spread of 100 basis points over three months LIBOR, an improvement of
200 basis points since 2012. From peak to trough, our average funding cost is expected to decline by approximately
25%.
Fifth is our ongoing focus on expenses as shown on slide 13. The changes to the compensation structure announced in
the fourth quarter reduced the overhang of prior year deferrals and decreased a portion of current year compensation
deferred into future years, which was the prudent thing to do. The result is a reduced liability in a muted environment
and greater operating leverage in an improved revenue environment.
With these changes, we've decreased our target compensation net revenue ratio in our Institutional Securities business
to 39% or less in 2015 and beyond. Notably, this guidance assumes a flat revenue environment. In a better revenue
environment, the compensation ratio could go even lower. In addition, we reaffirm that we're working towards the
compensation ratio of 55% or lower in Wealth Management, and 40% or lower in Investment Management.
We also remain focused on our non-compensation expenses and achieved a 29% non-compensation efficiency ratio in
2014, excluding obviously the elevated legal expenses versus 2012 levels. With the changes to our compensation
structure and our discipline on non-compensation expenses, we remain on track to deliver an overall expense ratio,
excluding elevated legal of 79% or lower in 2015.
Sixth is the return of capital to our shareholders. We have repeatedly emphasized our commitment to prudently increase
our capital returns over time, subject to regulatory approval. Our plan is to increase both our share buyback program
and our dividends with greater returns of capital, supported by the increased proportion of our revenue and earnings
coming from more stable businesses.

As you can see on slide 14, since 2012, we've grown our total payout ratio from 13% to 30%, while also investing in
our business through the completion of the Wealth Management JV. Critically, during that same period, we've grown
our capital base by 12%. The key drivers of increased return to shareholders over time are our consistent earnings, our
strong capital ratios, and a strategy that is consistent with evolving regulatory requirements.
Finally, let me address returns. Our focus remains on generating higher returns for shareholders by improving our ROE
to sustainable levels that exceed our cost of equity, independent of market conditions. We see a clear path to an ROE of
10% based on the levers we've just described to you, all of which are within our control.
To summarize, this includes achieving our Wealth Management margin target, executing on our bank strategy,
completing our exit from our physical oil business, progress on our optimization of Fixed Income, continued focus on
disciplined expense management, and continued CCAR capital approvals. We also see higher than 10% returns with an
improved rate environment; improved global economic growth, which in turn drives our Wealth Management and
Institutional Securities business performance; and higher payout ratios reflecting higher capital returns.
Now that we've finished the broader strategic discussion, let me return to Ruth, who'll walk through the details of the
fourth quarter performance and where we finished 2014.
Ruth Porat
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effective DVA. We have provided
reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. Results for the fourth
quarter include several significant items which complicate comparisons to prior periods. They include a net discrete tax
benefit of $1.4 billion, or $0.70 per diluted share, principally related to the restructuring of a legal entity. Compensation
expense adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion, or $0.40 per diluted share related to changes in discretionary
incentive compensation deferrals; a pre-tax charge of $468 million reflected as negative revenue, or a loss of $0.17 per
diluted share related to the initial incorporation of funding valuation adjustments, FVA, into the fair value
measurements for certain over-the-counter derivatives; and legal expenses of $284 million, or a loss of $0.12 per
diluted share, associated with several legacy residential mortgage-related matters. In addition, the impact of DVA in the
quarter was positive $223 million, with $161 million in Fixed Income sales and trading, and $62 million in Equity sales
and trading.
Excluding the impact of DVA, though reflecting the impact of $468 million related to FVA, firm-wide revenues were
$7.5 billion, down 13% versus the third quarter. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley
common shareholders, excluding DVA, were $783 million. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share,
excluding DVA, were $0.40 after preferred dividends. Earnings from continuing operations include the impact of the
previously mentioned funding valuation adjustment, net discrete tax benefit, compensation expense deferral
adjustments and legacy residential mortgage-related matters in the quarter.
On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion. Earnings from
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $928 million. Reported earnings from
continuing operations per diluted share were $0.47 after preferred dividends. Book value, at the end of the quarter, was
$34.62 per share, and tangible book value was $29.63 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $808 billion at December 31, down from $815 billion at the end of the
third quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $134 billion, up $9 billion versus Q3, reflecting the on-boarding of
deposits from Citi and typical seasonal increases in client cash. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $193
billion, compared with $190 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Common Equity Tier 1 transitional ratio
will be approximately 14.2%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.9%. Basel III
transitional risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $423 billion at December 31. Reflecting our best
estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, using the Basel III

fully-phased-in advanced approach was 12.4% at December 31, down from 12.7% in the third quarter. Our pro forma
standardized ratio was 11.7%, flat to the third quarter.
Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $432 billion. We estimate our
pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. final rule to be approximately 5% at December 31, up from
4.9% at the end of 3Q 2014. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.
Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $7.9 billion, up versus the third quarter, reflecting the
significant items I noted at the outset. Compensation expense was $5.1 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by the
change in compensation structure. Specifically, the quarter includes an expense of $1.1 billion, representing $756
million related to the reduction in the average deferral of discretionary incentive compensation awards for the 2014
performance year, and $381 million for the acceleration of vesting for certain outstanding deferred cash-based incentive
compensation awards. This provides us with operating leverage in the upside and reduced liability in the downside, as
best evidenced by the reduced compensation ratio target for 2015 and beyond that James noted. Non-compensation
expense was $2.8 billion for the quarter, up 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased legal expenses.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $3.2 billion,
down 25% sequentially and include a pre-tax charge of $468 million related to the initial incorporation of funding
valuation adjustments. Revenues excluding the impact of FVA and DVA were $3.7 billion, down 15% sequentially.
Non-interest expense was $4.3 billion, up versus the third quarter. Compensation expense was $2.4 billion for the
fourth quarter, up 37% versus the third quarter, driven by the previously mentioned compensation expense deferral
adjustments. Non-compensation expense for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, up 23% versus the third quarter, driven
by increased legal expenses. Including the impact of DVA and FVA, revenues were $3.4 billion.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.3 billion were down 3% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters,
Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs and number two in global announced and completed M&A and
global equity at the end of the fourth quarter. Notable transactions included: in Advisory, Morgan Stanley continued its
leadership position in cross-border and large transactions, including as lead financial advisor to Cubist Pharmaceuticals
in its announced $9.5 billion sale to Merck. In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley, as sole bookrunner, completed a
$4.7 billion H share follow-on offering on behalf of China-based insurer, Ping An Insurance (Group). In debt
underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as lead left bookrunner on Alibaba's $8 billion inaugural senior notes offering.
This was a landmark deal, the third largest debt IPO globally and largest bond transaction for an Asian issuer ever.
Advisory revenues of $488 million increased 24% versus our third quarter results, driven by increased revenues in
EMEA and the Americas. Underwriting revenues of $807 million decreased 15% versus our third quarter results,
driven by Equity underwriting revenues of $345 million, down 26% versus the third quarter, reflecting lower volumes
in Asia and the Americas. Fixed Income underwriting revenues of $462 million, down 5% versus the third quarter,
primarily due to decreases in investment grade loans partly offset by increased issuance in both investment grade and
high yield bonds.
Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were over $1.6 billion, down 9% compared to last quarter. Cash
equities and derivative revenues were down sequentially due to a more challenging market environment. Revenues in
prime brokerage were flat versus the third quarter.
Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $133 million, down significantly
versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting a pre-tax charge of $466 million, related to the initial incorporation of FVA
into the fair value measurements of certain over-the-counter derivatives. Revenue excluding DVA and the pre-tax
charge related to FVA were $599 million for the quarter. Commodities revenues were challenged in the quarter, due
primarily to the decline in oil prices. Credit revenues in the quarter were down versus the third quarter, driven by a
difficult market environment. Average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was $47 million, up from $42 million in the
third quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 1% sequentially. Asset
management revenues of $2.1 billion were flat to the last quarter. Transaction revenues were up 7% compared to last

quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $573 million, up 14% to the prior quarter, driven by a pickup across
most products. Investment Banking-related fees of $173 million, down 23% versus last quarter, primarily reflecting
lower activity in closed-end funds, and trading revenues of $230 million, up 24% versus the third quarter, reflecting
higher revenues from deferred compensation plans.
Net interest revenue increased 4% to $625 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our Bank Deposit
Program and continued growth in our lending products. Other revenue of $67 million decreased 40% versus the third
quarter, primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of a retail property space we discussed in the third quarter.
Non-interest expense was $3.1 billion, up 3% versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $777 million, down
from last quarter. Compensation expense was $2.3 billion, up versus the third quarter, primarily due to the
compensation expense adjustments related to changes in discretionary incentive compensation deferrals previously
mentioned.
The compensation ratio was 60%, up versus the third quarter, reflecting the change in compensation structure. The PBT
margin was 19%, which similarly reflects the impact of the change in compensation structure. Profit before tax was
$736 million. Total client assets exceeded $2 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $20.8 billion. Fee based
assets under management increased to $785 billion at quarter end, representing 39% of client assets.
Global representatives were 16,076, essentially flat to the third quarter. Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were
$137 billion, up $8 billion versus the third quarter. Approximately $128 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
Wealth Management lending balances continue to grow, reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy.
Investment Management revenues of $588 million were down 12% sequentially. In traditional asset management,
revenues of $432 million were down 8% versus the third quarter, driven in part by lower market levels.
In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $103 million were down compared with the third quarter. Merchant Banking
revenues were $53 million, down 38%, driven by the absence of investment gains versus the third quarter. Non-interest
expenses were $594 million, up 25% from the third quarter, including compensation expense of $381 million,
reflecting the compensation expense deferral adjustment mentioned previously. Non-compensation expense was $213
million, down 4% from the third quarter. Profit before tax was a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter. [ph] NCI
(27:33) was $12 million versus $18 million last quarter. And total assets under management increased to $403 million,
driven by higher flows primarily offset by market depreciation.
Finally, our outlook is consistent with data that suggest ongoing growth in the U.S. and the expectation that key
markets outside the U.S. will benefit from central bank support. Both should benefit client activity levels, particularly
in the sales and trading businesses. In Investment Banking, the M&A pipeline is up, driven by continued strength in
large and cross-border M&A, where we are well-positioned given our global franchise. The global equity underwriting
pipeline remains similarly healthy, benefiting from broad-based global activity. The pipeline also includes additional
issuance from transactions that were deferred to the first half of 2015 during the market choppiness of October.
In Wealth Management, which is overwhelmingly U.S.-driven, our outlook is also positive. Our margin target indicates
upside in the business and underscores confidence about the state of and growing contribution from the execution of
our bank strategy. As James noted, lower funding costs continue to provide upside in revenues for our sales and trading
business.
Regarding the regulatory environment, through all the actions we have taken in the last five years, we are
well-positioned to deal with the requirements we face. With the strong capital and liquidity ratios we have built, we
have great flexibility to deliver for clients and stakeholders.
Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your questions.

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Quick question on the outlook and the strategic update, which is much
appreciated. The potential to take FIC RWAs to $155 billion, based on the passive roll-down, what sort of timeline
should we use to think about that?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the target, as we indicated, is $180 billion by year end 2015 and that includes the additional $25
billion of run-off over time. That additional $25 billion will run off through 2018, so that would take us to the $155
billion, unless, of course, we find opportunities to reinvest within Fixed Income as James said. [indiscernible] (30:07)
so that's over 2018.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And how – if you guys find that FIC returns sort of remain at
current levels, so we kind of get this – this current environment proves to be a bit more of the steady state rather than
what many of us are hoping is a cyclical weak point. How low can that number go beyond that, if you find that you
need to allocate more money over to the Equities and the Wealth Management business from a capital perspective?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, we have ample capital and so we are supporting the client demand and activity in the Equities
business and don't want to leave you with the final comment you made, which is to – is there a tradeoff between the
two. So very importantly, given the strong capital positions then and given the strength and the importance of the
Equity business to us, we have ample capital to support client activity there and are.
As it relates to Fixed Income, our approach has been, as we've said repeatedly, to be very clinical about capital balance
sheet expenses and that was the main point that we made here this morning. We've reduced each of those in 2014 and
we remain very focused on how to drive returns in the business. So, being very diligent on that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. All right. Thanks for that. On FIC, there was a change of leadership in the
commodities business. Is that indicative of a new direction for that business? And then also, as we think of the
Commodities business, is it possible that the overall business there has been impacted by the sort of drawn out sale
process of the physical business?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Brennan, I think we put in place a commodities strategy a couple of years ago, which
was completely independent of the regulatory environment we're in, which was essentially we did not want to be a
significant player in physical businesses. The largest physical space we had was in oil, and we completed the
TransMontaigne deal and we're well underway to complete the rest of the sale when obviously it ran into other issues
requiring government approvals. So we're still on that track.
So the management changes were completely independent of that. These are big businesses. Management evolve in
companies of this size periodically, so I wouldn't read a great deal into that. We're well on track with commodities with
where we want it to be.
Did it affect the performance of the business, the fact that we're in the sale process? I can't really say whether it did or
didn't. Certainly, I wouldn't say materially; I think much more material was what was actually going on in the oil
markets in the last several months. We didn't have a good fourth quarter in commodities. It happens, it's our most --
probably our most volatile business segment. I don't expect that to be a permanent state.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for all of that color. And then last on capital markets, you guys highlighted
lower revenues in derivatives and cash. Was there anything episodic impacting those businesses because we heard
some of the competitors highlight some strength in some of those businesses, especially cash recently.
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. I would say that overall, client franchise remains strong and so we're continuing to see good
levels of activity. I know cash tends to be seasonal as you wind out the year. No, I wouldn't call out anything in
particular, choppier markets are more challenging for derivatives.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure. Sure. Okay. That's helpful, and then deferred comp, I think you guys weighed out – I
know that it can sometimes impact both the revenue and the expense line in Wealth Management, changes in the

deferred comp. Did we – can you quantify that for us? And did that impact the pre-tax margin in Wealth Management
this quarter, aside from the noise that was going on in the change in deferrals?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, you just said it. The key point in the margin was really the change in the structure of
compensation, it's usually PBT margin neutral. So, no, it didn't – the main point was the change in structure.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks. So you noted the legal on the quarter. I'm curious if you had handy the all-in legal
cost for the year and if it's right for us, because I am thinking about a lot less next year, given that mortgage [ph] is put
to bed (34:56). You're not a LIBOR setting bank and obviously you have a limited FX business.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the full year legal-related expenses for 2014 were around $600 million.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And you think I'm crazy on my thinking for next year?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, the point we've made consistently is that litigation from the crisis isn't resolved. It remains a
headwind. Appreciate the question. It's tough to forecast, but neither the timing or amount is fully in our control. So,
appreciate the question, but that's about all I can say.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: So I'd like to slide on the lower funding costs and I think lots are benefiting, you're benefiting
maybe a little more than most. Can you put that in a dollar term for us in terms of what it means for next year, the year
after? I understand it's fallen and it's a pretty dynamic conversation. I'm just curious [ph] if it's dollar based (35:50).
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, we realized the benefit over time, given the weighted average maturity of our unsecured stack
is about six years. So as we refinance out of that, we'll leg into it over time. At this point, we're refinancing some of the
debt we issued post crisis and that's why I wanted to give you the trajectory and overall the trend line.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: All right. Two other cleanups. One, clean comp ratio for 2014 for ISG, there's a lot of – ex all
the FVA, DVA and comp charges.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Right, so full year, excluding all of those, it's down full year about a point.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Around to, was that 40%, 41%?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, full year...
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: 41%.
<A - Ruth Porat>: 41%, down from 42% last year.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Okay. And then last one, on the positive front, the fee-based flows were huge. For any
quarter, fourth quarter I don't remember being usually a big quarter for it. Usually think of it as more beginning of the
year, if there was seasonality to it at all. The question is, has anything changed incentive-wise or new product-wise, or
is it just a continuation of the process?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, we had strong flows during the fourth quarter and the full year. There can be some lumpiness
as we talked about last quarter, but continued strength, and as you appropriately said, you look at it full year and it's
very strong and underscores the point that James made, which is that there's a strong secular trend here and we benefit
from it, given the scale of the business we have and the breadth of products, content and service we're providing.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just trying to read into the ROE chart at the end of the strategic presentation. Last year, the
baseline was 9%, this year, the baseline number you build off is 10%. Is it really just that the 10% baseline now
includes higher confidence on capital actions? Is that the main difference or should we be saying that there is a material
underlying increase when all the puts and takes are taken into account?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I'm glad you pointed it out because we do think it's important. There are a number of items that are
reflected in that. I would say the change in compensation structure is a contributor as well, and so James laid out the
various items and, as you know, this is without the benefit from a rising rate environment. So it's – from what we see,
the upside Wealth Management and the banks it's incorporating the revenue benefit from lower funding costs, we're
continuing to make progress in Fixed Income. All that we're doing on the expense side, as I said, that compensation
structure change is important and did allow us to reduce the comp ratio in ISG to 39% or lower.
That's in a flat revenue environment. So with better revenues, we have even further operating leverage, but that's an
important point; and with all the steps we've taken over the last several years, the expectation about continued increases
in return to capital. So we've made some tough choices. Appreciate the complicated some of the comments this
morning but made these tough choices. It did have a negative impact on the quarter, but sets us up well and that's why
we put it in here as we're modeling at 10%.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just add, Guy, that what we've always tried to do is when we've had clarity of
vision on something, is to lay it out there for our shareholders. And we have much more clarity of vision around the
10%, frankly, and as Ruth said, because of all the things that we've checked off and some of the things we put behind
us and the change in the comp and where we are with capital, much more clarity of vision.
So when we see something that we think is clearly achievable, that's what we're going to put out for shareholders. And
we've also identified that there is obviously upside. It's dependent on some things which are less within our control, but
are not unreasonable to expect at some point in the future.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And is that additional upside about the same as it was last year? Obviously, all we have is
hopefully proportional hunk of a bar chart to compare it against, but it appears that that's largely unchanged.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yeah, I wouldn't draw too much into our graphic skills and ratios of bar sizes. No, I
think we're saying we clearly see an improved rate environment. We are in a business mix that we think does well with
the improving global economy and we're over-weighted to the U.S. because of Wealth Management, which as we all
know is doing best among the developed countries on a risk adjusted return basis. And we clearly see additional capital
returns, because we're hitting all the capital ratios that we've talked about.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And just as a follow-up on the capital ratios. Thank you, Ruth, for the fully phased
figures on both advanced and standardized. Why did the advanced come down a little bit?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, as you know, we're governed by standardized [ph] – flat under (41:11) standardized. The
RWAs under the advanced approaches were up for a couple of reasons, primarily due to volatility but also lending
growth and [ph] ops just (41:20) goes in there. So those were up – it was really RWAs up.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. On the oil business, which as you pointed out, ran into a roadblock because of the
Russian situation, in terms of trying to sell it. What's the outlook there? And if it's not sold, would you look to wind that

business down and over what timeframe?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, we do remain focused on selling it as a business, and we'll let you know when we have
something to say on that.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yeah, I mean, we are clearly intent of getting out of the physical oil business. We
made that very clear. We had a contract for sale, we couldn't complete for reasons outside of our control and we will
get out of the physical oil business.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And I guess the question was really around if it's harder to sell in the current environment
and you need to wind down elements of it, what kind of timeframe should we be thinking about?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We actually don't see – if the question is really with lower oil, does that affect the sale of the
business? We don't see it negatively affecting the sale. We have excess storage capacity. So that actually sets the
business up well to benefit from rising oil prices using capacity at these levels and benefiting as oil prices rise. So it
doesn't affect the sale process.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful color. On the FIC target, just with the runoff down to the $155 billion.
And this is maybe a subtle change in what you're communicating, but I wanted to make sure I understand it. I think you
had said previously that as you got down to the $155 billion, $160 billion level from the runoff, you would look to
redeploy within FIC to the $180 billion level. But now it sounds like you are leaving the options open to redeploy more
broadly across the business. Is that right? And if so, what drives the thinking?
<A - Ruth Porat>: That is correct. And what we're saying is, look, there've been structural headwinds in the industry.
There've been some cyclical ones as well. We have a clear plan that includes the reductions in balance sheet capital and
expenses that we've talked about. And we just want – we're being – what we're saying is we're being very clinical here,
which is we're targeting $180 billion. There's another $25 billion that comes off.
And the right, prudent thing to do as custodians of the business is to ensure we put that incremental capital capacity to
support the highest return businesses, across – highest return products. And if that's within Fixed Income, where we
already have some products that are generating attractive returns, such as in Corporate Credit and Securitized Products,
and there's client demand for incremental capital, that's an opportunity. But we will look across the franchise. And so,
you're right. I'm glad you drew that out. It is a change. We just want to make it very clear how we are approaching it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good. Well, I think your shareholders probably appreciate that flexibility. So that's good to
understand. In terms of the reduction in the ISG comp target, is all of that reduction to 39% or less due to the change in
the deferral strategy? Or is there actually a view that in the current environment, you can reduce the comp payout?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It is due to the change in the comp structure. It was an important step for us to take. It gives us, as I
said, reduced liability in the downside, and importantly, operating leverage in the upside by pulling forward future
deferrals. In changing the deferral rate, it enabled us to set that compensation ratio at 39% in a flat revenue
environment, with operating leverage a lower comp ratio in a better revenue environment and, we think, underscores
the importance of that change.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Cool. And then just one final one from me on the legal costs this quarter. Was that
essentially a litigation reserve build because of things for which you had estimable and probable, or was it actually
cleanup of current quarter expenses? And if so, can you give us a little color on what they were?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, reserves, as you just said, are based and estimated each quarter based on FAS 5, so probable
and estimable.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I was looking for more color on slide 15 with the ROE target. Does this imply, going from
9% to 10%, that if you have capital actions it could be 11%, and on a tangible basis, it could be 12%? Again, I'm just
comparing this year's slide 15 with last year's slide 15. And related to that, you talk about having a greater clarity of
vision, but this also comes in a quarter where you missed consensus expectations. So is this quarter a one-off in your
mind or how do you think about all that?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Firstly, the 9% to 10% reflects all of the things that are implied under the – or listed on
the left-hand side of that page, Mike. It also talks about as the last of those receiving non-objection on our CCAR
capital request. And what we've pointed out is that obviously in future years, we see future upside as we make
additional capital returns as we're reshaping the balance sheet and reshaping the businesses. So, when we talk about
clarity of vision, we're one year closer. We've seen real progress in the Wealth Management business with margin
improvement at 200 basis points. We expect progress to continue, which is why we set goals which are currently above
where we're performing.
We see real opportunity in the lower funding costs. It's clear that our bank strategy is being well executed in building
the asset side of the balance sheet and we're continuing to see a roll on of deposits, et cetera, et cetera. So we felt it was
important to lay it out for shareholders.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And the timeframe for this target?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Obviously, we haven't given timeframes on these targets because we can't control the
market environment around us.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Well, some more specifics related to this, in terms of higher interest rates, slide six, you
talk about the margin improvement, and you said your 22% to 25% Wealth Management pre-tax margin does not rely
on higher interest rates. Can you describe your interest rate sensitivity if rates did increase 100 basis points or 50 basis
points?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So you're absolutely right. This does not include the benefit of higher rates. You can somewhat see
the benefit of rates through the roll-forward that we have on the bank slide. We frequently discussed they're a real
positive for us. The factors to consider in that as you're modeling it out is we do generate higher net interest even in a
flat rate environment because we're still in relatively early stages of deposit deployment. I think that's [ph] sounds
(48:46) quite differentiated.
But in a rising rate environment, just the components again, it does drop meaningfully to the bottom line because of the
cost structure of the banks, as James said, we've already invested in the infrastructure required. We don't have bricks
and mortar, FAs are not paid on the grid, all the things that we talked about with you before. And then what we did is
we provided yields and asset mix to help you model the NII upside, and we actually extended out the estimate of asset
growth to 2016 on that slide. Previously, we had it out to 2015 and it builds on the strength of the performance in 2014.
In fact, we ended prior to our estimate for 2014.
And I think the other couple of elements in it that just – no update on that. So given deposits here are different from
retail banks, they're very sticky. Given the nature of deposits, they're more like working capital. We continue to assume
about a 45 basis point increase in deposit pricing with the first 100 basis point increase in rates. We do believe that
model's conservative given the nature of our deposits and structural changes and deposit alternatives. Fed Funds has
continued to be the most relevant rate for our business, and the average duration of bank assets is around a year and a
half. So, again, rising rates benefit us quickly. But the point on this, on the bank slide earlier was to extend it out so that
you can model in the benefit, as you see – as you estimate rising rates.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: What is your efficiency ratio for the bank, since you're talking about that, your expense to
revenue ratio? Because you highlighted the fact that you don't have bricks and mortar, so I assume the efficiency ratio
would be better than the typical bank.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, we don't break that out separately, but you're absolutely right, which is why we said it drops
meaningfully to the bottom line.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yeah, I mean it's obviously better because the whole strategy around the bank is
driving more throughput through an existing branch structure.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, you highlighted compensation. So did I hear you correctly that the
compensation expense should decline from 41% on a core basis in 2014 to 39% or less in 2015? Is that correct?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes. Correct.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then, as far as...
<A - Ruth Porat>: And that's in a flat revenue environment, yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: James, you've been very vocal in the past, and I guess in hindsight, giving a lot of stock to
people at much lower stock prices worked, but can you talk about the tradeoff between paying your people and then
meeting Wall Street expectations? In other words, getting the desired earnings growth, and there's talk about people
from brokerage firms going elsewhere, such as private equity. So how do you manage that tradeoff?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, firstly, Mike, I'm delighted for all of our shareholders that the stock has
appreciated 26%, I think last year, 60-something percent the year before and 25% the year before that, including our
employees who frankly deserved it. They're the ones who rode the boat. They got the job done and they deserved it. So
I have no qualms about the employees benefiting from the rising stock.
And listen, it's a balance. What we did coming out of the crisis was we deferred up to 100% of our employees' bonuses.
We did that for a very specific reason and it's [ph] an unnatural act of (52:06) 100%. We recognized that and we were
working our way down over a period of years to 50% and we decided to bite the bullet and get it done in 2014, and
bring ourselves back where we think the industry will settle, which is at 50% deferrals.
We are still high relative to our competitors, so certainly, from a shareholder perspective, it remains a very friendly [ph]
concept (52:31). It continues to tie our employees into the firm, which is what we want and what they want, as
evidenced by a low attrition. And, no, I'm not concerned about the onesies and twosies who choose to go into different
parts of the financial sector. We get a very attractive employee base coming to this firm and it's frankly just not an
issue.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up quickly on the funding cost trajectory. I
guess, first, is there any – you highlight down 25% by 2016, is that a presumption of the rate environment or is that
pretty much locked in? Just how should we think about that net benefit?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the funding cost reduction reflects the forward curve. So it builds in at those higher rates and
with kind of respect to rate moves, we do swap our debt to floating because our assets are floating, but it's built off the

forward curve.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. But any change in the forward curve would have an impact on that assumption?
Okay.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: And when we think about the funding cost target, if we just look at your interest expense
from last year, which I think was about $3.7 billion, that's how we should think about that 25% reduction off that $3.7
billion?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, there are obviously a number of components in that. So it's not quite as straightforward as that.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: So it would be a little less than that? You're not going to help us?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, well, you do the modeling.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Was there any meaningful CVA this quarter?
<A - Ruth Porat>: CVA was a bit of a drag this quarter, and last year, a positive last quarter, so just a bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks. First question, just on the FIC outlook for the RWAs, just wanted to see if you had
any, I guess, lost revenues related to going from the $188 billion down to, say, the $155 billion.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, one of the points we've made over time is that these are basically call them deadweight. It's
really deadweight capital in that it's supporting assets that aren't generating revenue. We're funding old positions, and
so they're negative ROE now. And as they roll off, they go from negative ROE to neutral, to zero. And the objective is
then to take that excess capital and put it behind client activity in areas that are most accretive to the overall franchise.
But the most important point is they're negative ROE, because of – it's really just the financing costs on these
long-dated positions.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then just on expenses, for the legal, the $284 million, I just wanted to be clear
because it seems like each quarter there's some legal costs, obviously, at the firm. But is this just related to the
residential mortgage matter, or is that everything in the quarter? And if it wasn't, just what was your – kind of your
normal legal in the quarter?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So what we called out was, as we said, related to the residential.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Got it. And then last one, just in terms of where your CE T1 ratio is, just given that
we have the buffers out there, where do you expect to run the ratio longer term? And then based on the Basel NSFR,
any update or any guidance in terms of how you guys stand?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So in terms of the buffer on the various ratios, we're in a very strong position, as I said, fully
phased in, standardized 11.7%, advanced 12.4%, well above requirements even with estimates of what may occur with
the incremental buffers. And at this point, given these are required over time, not going to start quantifying a buffer
above that. But we've got a – we're running substantially above the requirement, which is, again, consistent with our
view that we have capacity to continue to return capital.

As it relates to the net stable funding ratio, we're above 100% as currently proposed by Basel. Obviously, still awaiting
the final U.S. rules . And you probably heard me say all too often that we firmly believe that durability of funding is
imperative, and that's how we run the firm. One concern about the rule is that it actually isn't properly ALM and certain
transactions which create liquidity in practice are consumers of liquidity under the NSFR construct. I think it's notable
that this element of the rule has been left to national regulators to tailor in the final rules. But short answer to your
question, we're in a strong position with NSFR as it stands, and that keeps us in a strong position to deliver for clients.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning. So James, you noted in your discussion on FIC that in addition to
shrinking RWAs, you've also managed to shrink actual FIC balance sheet assets. And when looking at the product-level
commentary or disclosure that you provided, it does appear the businesses that are actually generating returns below
their cost of equity are more concentrated in those areas like global rates, where they're more balance sheet or
leverage-intensive than risk-intensive. I just wanted to get an understanding as to how much more optimization
potential we could see on the asset side of the equation that could help improve returns over the next couple of years.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, let me take that. A couple of points. Year-over-year, we had a sizable decline in our balance
sheet and that is at the same time that we were increasing deposits. We've had this ongoing contractual on-boarding of
deposits supporting our lending business. So what that really reflects is optimization in trading businesses and that's
primarily within Fixed Income. And so, we are continuing to have a tight lens on balance sheet as we go into this year.
There is some growth from deposits and – but we're very focused on making sure, to the heart of your question, that
we're using all assets, all resources where we can drive the strongest return. And that's been part of the optimization on
balance sheet to date.
I think the other point is, as I noted our SLR is at 5%. And so we've been – we're in a good spot. We said we'd be there
in 2015. We're here as we ended 2014. And again that gives us – so we've got ample opportunity, and what we're
looking at is how to drive returns.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Thanks, Ruth. And then, just one more question on ISG. But actually, switching over
to the expense side. I appreciated the disclosure on the comp targets for 2015 assuming a flat revenue environment. I
was hoping you can give us some color as to what the non-personnel ratio should look like ex-legal in 2015, also
assuming that you have a flat revenue environment for the coming year?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I don't have that with me.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then just one quick final one on Wealth Management. I did appreciate the
disclosure on the yield opportunity for the bank, but just given your expectation as to how the funding or liability
profile will evolve, what's a reasonable expectation for what the new trajectory should look like over the coming years,
not just assuming a flat revenue environment but also contemplating the future yield opportunity that you highlighted
on the asset side?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, the reason we laid it out as we did is we wanted to give you the growth. In the slide that James
went through on the bank is we also broke out the split between deposits supporting growth in Institutional Securities
versus Wealth Management. We're seeing growth in both and we laid out the yields so that you could actually – you
could model it out over time.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Understood. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I was just hoping to follow up on the timing of the 10% ROE target. You talked
about relatively stable macro trends in terms of trading, investment banking, so it seems like it's more about execution
and, call it, the passage of time, specifically in FIC. So, I guess, as you think about the timing, is this a 2015 target? Is
this a five-year target? Just trying to push a little bit on this.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Look, as James said, we've given you the key drivers of it and are not putting a date on it. But you
see the key drivers of it and certain other steps that we took as we ended this year. Put a fine point on certain of the
elements that will drive ROE higher. For example, the change in comp structure enabling us to take down the comp
ratio, and some of the other elements that we've delineated. So I'll be repetitive, I guess, we're not putting a date on it,
but you can see the actions we've taken to give you greater clarity about execution against them.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I can promise you one thing, though, it's not a five-year target.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then, in terms of the capital against it, obviously, you've got probably
more than you need on the Basel III ratio, the SLR could be the constraining factor for you guys and the peers. How do
you think about how much SLR you need to run? And is there still some – is there some opportunity to optimize that
more so than, say, the Basel ratio?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, at this point, as you said, we've got a strong excess above requirements on risk-based capital,
and given the SLR's not required until 2018, as I just said, we were looking to get to 5% in 2015. And here we are at
5% now. So we don't view that as a constraint on our ability to return capital. At this point, there continues to be
opportunity to mitigate, as really primarily in reduction of the gross-up in the balance sheet, net long CDS sold and
compression activity. Obviously, the ratio will continue to benefit from earnings but more in the gross-up on the
balance sheet.
And when you look across the ratios, given all that we've done with the business, and given the strength of where we
stand today on capital, that's why our view is we set ourselves up well to continue to steadily increase returning capital
over time. Our philosophy is no discontinuous moves but steady increases over time, and that's what we remain focused
on.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, a follow-up question on the changes to the comp
structure. Am I thinking of it correctly that the – essentially, taking a charge on the cash – the deferred cash piece, that
will benefit you the most in the early years and then less in the later years?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It will continue to benefit us, so, both of them benefit us, and that's why we are resetting the comp
ratio here today for ISG.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
