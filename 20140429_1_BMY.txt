Lamberto?
Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone.
We have a lot to discuss today. First I want to mention our nivolumab [nivo] study in third-line squamous
non-small-cell lung cancer, known as Study 063. I know this is something you're all interested in. We had productive
discussions with the FDA regarding this study, and we will be initiating a rolling submission for this indication in the
next few days. I feel extremely good about it.
Having said that, I will switch to our first quarter results, our good first quarter results. Our non-GAAP earnings per
share improved 12% to $0.46 compared to last year, and our top line performance was meaningful. Excluding our
diabetes franchise, sales increased 5% while our new and in-line brands increased 8%. Our core products performed
well, with double-digit growth in Sprycel 19%, Yervoy 18%, Orencia 13%, and Baraclude 11%. Sales of Eliquis passed
the $100 million threshold, with positive momentum in the U.S. as well as in other markets around the world.
Last year we identified and executed against some key opportunities to accelerate the growth of Eliquis, focusing on
cardiologists, increasing our investments behind medical education, driving improvements in access, and launching
direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. Our increased investments are driving results as we see improvements in
prescription trends in all areas.
Together with Pfizer, we are committing even more resources to Eliquis this year, and we are pleased that the FDA
approved Eliquis for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis [DVT] in Q1 and hope to be able to further expand the
label in both the U.S. and Europe with the inclusion of DVT treatment later this year.
As far as immuno-oncology is concerned, Charlie and Francis will give you details of how we are performing and what
we are doing and planning. Let me just say that I'm glad about how Yervoy continues to grow around the world and
that it had its best quarter in the U.S. since launch, with strengthened demand in our community oncologists.
And I'm equally or even more excited about nivolumab. During the quarter, we added new trials for nivolumab in
monotherapy and combination in several new tumor types. And I already mentioned our decision on the rolling
submission of Study 063.
Also, our earlier-stage portfolio continues to advance through our own R&D efforts and through external
collaborations; as such, as the recently announced agreement with Five Prime.
In summary, we made meaningful progress across our broad I-O portfolio and we continue to build and advance our
leadership position.
Moving to HCV, hepatitis C, we also made good, important progress. In fact, we have potential HCV approvals for
daclatasvir-based regimens in all of the major regions before the end of the year, beginning with Japan and continuing
with both Europe and the U.S. With respect to the U.S., our possible approval is based on the recent NDA submission
that followed the Breakthrough Therapy designation for our dual-regimen of daclatasvir and asunaprevir.
Finally, I will quickly mention our progress in the development of an early-stage portfolio addressing genetically
defined disease, or GDDs. Our focus on GDDs is part of the redefined R&D strategy that we announced in November
of last year. Our research and development teams are currently working to identify key targets to prioritize for future
development, and our businesses development people are pursuing several opportunities in these areas. The just
announced acquisition of iPierian, a company discovering and developing new treatments for certain kinds of diseases
of the brain called Tauopathies [Tau], is the first result of their focused efforts.

Growing our marketed products and continuing to advance the development of our pipeline has been central to our
balanced approach, driving results today while setting the stage for tomorrow. The divestiture of our diabetes business
to AstraZeneca that we completed in the first quarter is allowing us to further improve this approach and accelerate our
evolution to specialty biopharma. Our operating model is getting simplified and streamlined throughout the entire
company. At the same time, we are increasing investments and focus behind our priority areas of anticoagulation,
immuno-oncology, and HCV, as well as certain geographies wherever we can be most competitive.
Taken together, our first quarter results along with the work we have been doing to drive our specialty evolution
signifies a strong start to what should be an important year for us. For some time, we have been talking about our
portfolio of the future. In many significant ways, that future has already started. Many important things will happen for
the company during the rest of the year, starting very soon with a presentation of a lot of data at ASCO and continuing
with all of the other potential developments that I mentioned with respect to Eliquis, HCV, and immuno-oncology.
Some of these developments will lead to increased sales in the near term, while all of them should generate growth in
the longer term. We are working hard to continue to deliver success.
So with that, let me turn it over to Francis.
Francis M. Cuss
Thank you, Lamberto. Good morning, everyone.
Today I'll discuss the progress we're making within R&D, including an update on our immuno-oncology portfolio. It's
crucial for our R&D organization to execute on the near-term delivery of our pipeline while investing to maintain a
robust portfolio of future opportunities.
I'm confident in the progress we've made, including the work we've done to accelerate our hepatitis C program, with
the potential for approvals in Japan, the EU, and the U.S. before the end of this year. We continue to believe that we
have some interesting opportunities in this very large market. Looking ahead, we have some important opportunities
stemming from our decision last year to evolve our strategic focus in R&D and move into areas that support the
company's evolution to a specialty care biopharma company.
One new component of our R&D strategy is an explicit focus on genetically defined diseases. By genetically defined,
we mean diseases caused by a mutation that we can identify and design a therapeutic approach specifically to address
it. By directly targeting the genetic basis of the disease, we believe we have the opportunity to significantly advance the
standard of care.
We're developing an early-stage portfolio that addresses genetically defined diseases through the identification of key
targets. Our acquisition of iPierian and its elite Tau antibody is actually a good example of this approach. IPierian's
anti-Tau approach provides us with an opportunity to develop an innovative disease-modifying treatment for certain
genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases known as Tauopathies. Our initial development focus would be in
progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disease with Tau dysfunction, and this could possibly extend to other
neurodegenerative diseases.
Let me now turn to immuno-oncology. I'm convinced that immuno-oncology could be transformational in the treatment
of cancer with the potential for durable responses and long-term survival, offering significant promise for patients.
Building on the important body of research and the experience we have with Yervoy, we have seen significant progress
in our clinical development programs for nivo and the rest of our immuno-oncology portfolio. Of the more than 35 nivo
trials ongoing in many different tumors, about a third are potentially registrational.
Important data sets are now maturing, and we expect significant data readouts over the next 12 to 18 months. We have
the first such data readout now. We have the data from Study 063. And as you know, this study assessed a highly
pre-treated patient population where there are no other approved or recommended treatment alternatives. Our review of
the results of our Study 063 reinforces our belief in the potential of nivo to offer durable responses and demonstrate an
improvement in long-term survival.

We've had positive discussions with the FDA regarding Study 063, and this study will be the basis for a rolling
submission that we will be initiating in the next few days. We expect to complete the rolling submission by year's end,
which will allow the FDA to consider additional data that will become available in the remainder of 2014. We hope to
present the data at the 2014 Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology in October later this year.
The results of Study 063 mark the beginning of our data flow in lung cancer, where our clinical development program
has made significant progress. Our program in lung cancer addresses multiple lines of therapy, different histologies, the
use of biomarkers, and potential therapy with both monotherapy and combination regimens. For example, there are two
ongoing second-line Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer, one in squamous and one in non-squamous, a
recently initiated first-line Phase III trial with nivo as monotherapy in lung cancer for PD-L1 positive patients, and we
plan to begin a Phase III program to study the combination regimen of nivo and Yervoy by the end of this year.
ASCO will be a very important meeting where we will present data from new studies as well as more mature data from
ongoing studies. Specifically, there will be additional monotherapy and combination data for nivo in lung, melanoma,
and renal, as well as data for Yervoy in adjuvant melanoma. Looking to the second half of 2014, we expect to have data
in house from our second-line lung cancer studies. We're also looking forward to the first presentation of nivo data in
hematological tumors at ASH in December.
Based upon the data, we believe there is significant opportunity for I-O broadly across other tumor types. We've started
potentially registrational trials in follicular and diffuse B-cell lymphoma as well as glioblastoma, colorectal cancer, and
head and neck cancer. We've initiated signal detection trials in pancreatic, gastric, small-cell lung, and breast cancer.
For many of these tumors, we're exploring both nivo monotherapy as well as the combination regimen of nivo plus
Yervoy. We're also pursuing additional I-O assets with different mechanisms in both monotherapy and in combination.
Key clinical-stage assets in our early portfolio include anti-LAG3, Anti-KIR, and urelumab.
In closing, let me remind you that our goal is to deliver to patients the potential for long-term survival across a wide
range of tumors. We'll continue to drive our programs and our trials forward as quickly and robustly as possible. Based
on our investment, our leadership, and our experience in this area, I am confident that we are and will continue to be
well positioned to accomplish this.
Now let me turn it over to Charlie.
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Francis, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good quarter. First quarter revenues excluding
diabetes were strong, led by Eliquis, Yervoy, Sprycel, and Baraclude. Let me provide a few highlights from the quarter.
As Lamberto noted, we are pleased by the progress we are making with Eliquis. The investments that we and Pfizer
made at the end of last year along with additional investments this quarter have accelerated Eliquis's growth around the
world. In the U.S., net sales of Eliquis were $61 million, up 27% from the fourth quarter. We are seeing encouraging
prescription trends, and our new-to-brand share among cardiologists is now over 35%. Outside the U.S., net sales were
$45 million. In the EU, we saw particularly strong performance in Germany and had recent launches in Italy and
France. Japan also had a good quarter, as the prescription limitation was recently lifted.
Yervoy sales grew 18% to $271 million. U.S. net sales were $146 million. You will recall that there was a $25 million
one-time reversal of a sales deferral during the first quarter of last year. On a demand basis, Yervoy had its best quarter
in the U.S. While Yervoy continues to grow at academic institutions, we are also seeing good growth coming from
community hospitals and practices. In the EU, we saw strong performance in both France and Germany, where we have
reimbursement in the first-line study.
Orencia sales grew 13% to $361 million. While we continue to see solid growth, there is increasing competition for
first-line use and switches, which slowed the pace of growth from the prior quarter. We are focused on improving our
execution, particularly in the first-line study.

One final note on sales; our U.S. business during the quarter was negatively impacted by wholesaler inventory
work-down, particularly with the Sustiva franchise and Abilify. This impact was somewhat offset by an inventory build
in Japan. We expect inventory levels to normalize over the next several months.
Let me spend a few minutes on the diabetes franchise and the impact this quarter and the rest of the year. We
completed the sale of our global diabetes business on February 1. Our first quarter results therefore reflect one month of
the historical diabetes business prior to closing and two months of impact to our P&L of the ongoing terms related to
the transaction. Let me provide some color.
Total diabetes revenues were $179 million, including $153 million in product sales during January. The other $26
million for February and March is primarily related to our ongoing product supply agreement with AstraZeneca. We
expect these product supply sales to be about $10 million per month in 2014. We will record royalty income on sales
made by AstraZeneca in the other income line of our P&L. These royalties were $48 million in the first quarter.
We are also providing certain transitional services to AstraZeneca. These service fees were $31 million in the first
quarter and are included in other income. The income from transitional services is expected to taper throughout the
year, and most services should be completed by year end. We will continue to conduct and fund certain predefined
clinical trials in diabetes through 2016. The cost of these trials will be included in R&D expense.
During the quarter, we received $3.3 billion from AstraZeneca for our global diabetes business. We also received an
additional $100 million in April for the approval of Forxiga in Japan. This has significantly improved our cash
balances, particularly in the U.S., which gives us increased financial flexibility.
Now let me highlight a few items from the rest of our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.8% during the quarter, up
130 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of
our diabetes business. Marketing, selling, and admin expenses were down about 4%, as our increased investments in
Eliquis, Yervoy, and our pre-launch assets in immuno-oncology and hepatitis C were offset by reduced expenses in
diabetes.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 23% during the quarter, which is higher than the same period last year. You will recall that
in Q1 2013 we booked five quarters of the R&D tax credit. This quarter does not include the impact of the 2014 R&D
tax credit, as that has not yet been extended.
Regarding guidance for 2014, we are adjusting our full-year 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.70 to $1.80,
which assumes current exchange rates and the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Now that we have closed the
diabetes transaction, we are able to provide certain non-GAAP line item guidance, which you'll have seen in our press
release.
Now we would be happy to address your questions.
John E. Elicker
Okay, Jamie, I think we're ready to go to questions for Lamberto, Charlie, Francis, and Giovanni.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much. I just had two questions here. First on the 063 Study, can you
help frame our expectations for that data relative to the response rates and the survival rates we saw from the 003 Study
at World Lung last fall? I'm just trying to understand how we should be – it's obviously very positive data, but how

should we be thinking about that? And then just on timing, can you just update us on ex-U.S. filing for nivo, any
comments there as well as filing timelines for second-line lung for nivo, just latest thoughts? Thanks very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Chris. Let me just reemphasize. We have productive ongoing discussions with the
FDA. The Study 063 data will be the basis for the rolling submission that we are going to initiate in the next few days,
and we will expect to complete that by the end of the year. You will understand that we don't normally talk about the
data before we present it in a scientific forum, and we are planning to present this data at the Multidisciplinary
Symposium in Thoracic Oncology in October of this year. But what I would say is our review of the Study 063 data
really reinforces our belief in the potential of nivo to demonstrate an improvement in the long-term survival, which we
believe will be important for lung cancer patients. And personally, I'm very happy that we're moving forward with our
first submission.
As far as our program outside the United States, the whole nivolumab program is a global program. The requirements
differ in different parts of the world. And we are looking at providing – we won't be talking about specific timing
details, but we are looking at submissions once we've seen the data from the squamous and non-squamous
non-small-cell lung second-line data, which we believe we will get the top line towards the end of the year. Thanks,
Chris.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great, Chris. Thanks for the question. Can we go to the next one, Jamie, please?
Operator
Yes, our next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Thanks for taking the questions. So the first one around Eliquis, it seems like you are making
some traction there. Obviously, the news around Pfizer and AstraZeneca generate a lot of excitement and interest, just
your thoughts around Eliquis and your commitment there. I think a lot of people are wondering. Would you do
something similar to what you did with your diabetes product in giving it to Astra? Any thoughts that if Pfizer were to
approach you around Eliquis, would you be willing to give that back?
And then the second one, a little more general on the I-O side; I'd like to get your views on Study 063. You've moving
very quickly here. All of your competitors are as well. Just how comfortable are you with the decisions, for example,
with the front-line lung cancer or your move then to Phase III? The amount of data and the amount of diligence you're
able to do before making these decisions to move forward, how comfortable are you with the amount that you have
there relative to maybe other programs or you can take a little more time and do a little more careful analysis before
deciding to make such a big decision? So if you could just talk to that, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So, Vamil, I will start. I have a very easy answer to your Eliquis question. No, we are not
going to sell Eliquis to Pfizer. Yes, we are very committed to Eliquis. We, the people sitting around this table, follow
Eliquis with great attention. We are extremely pleased of how prescription trend is improving. We are looking with
particular attention with new prescriptions being filled by cardiologists because we believe that is our primary focus
now and, by building a solid position of our product in that group of specialists, will generate prescriptions also in
primary care. Giovanni?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me just make a couple of comments to go into some further detail
on the performance of Eliquis in the first quarter. We had a really good quarter across the board in all markets,
specifically with respect to the U.S. As Charlie mentioned, we continue to see really good trends in cardiology. We also
are seeing a significant improvement in trends in the primary care setting. In cardiology, our new patient share is now
at 37%, and in primary care it's in the 25% range. And all of those represent significant growth versus the previous
quarter and really good development. We're obviously ahead of Pradaxa in these settings, and we are continuing to
strengthen our position overall there. That's the result of the investments we made beginning with the second part of
last year that are really generating positive momentum and good results for us.

With respect to international markets, I'll just make a couple of comments there. Germany is clearly one of our key
areas of focus. And we are seeing acceleration of our growth in Germany, where our new patient share now is above
Pradaxa and growing very nicely. And then third market I'll mention again is Japan, where as of the end of February
our limitations in terms of reimbursement were lifted twelve months after approval. We've seen a very significant
acceleration of our growth in Japan, where our new patient share is already above Pradaxa. In the switch market, we
have a leading share of new patients with switches coming from all agents that are currently in the market. And then
obviously, we have a number of countries where we've launched more recently like France and Italy, and the trends are
quite solid in those markets as well.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: And we'll keep Eliquis.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Vamil, thank you very much. I would say we are very comfortable with the work we've put in
our exploratory programs in lung to support the first-line Phase III study. This comes really from the depth and the
breadth of our experience, starting with Yervoy and the very broad portfolio of studies we now have with nivo.
Specifically around lung cancer, as you're aware, we have four Phase III studies – sorry, four registrational studies,
three Phase III studies, two in second-line and one in first-line. And one thing I've learned in my career is that the time
you spend trying to understand the medicine at the beginning of the exploratory phase really does save time later on.
And I would comment around the combination of Yervoy and nivo in lung that the 012 Study continues. It's actually
providing very important information for us to design our trial. And we're on track to start that fourth Phase III study by
the end of the year.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Vamil. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Hi. Francis, just if I could follow up, please, on the rolling submission of the Study 063, it sounds
like, as you said, that FDA will have the opportunity to consider other studies that are ongoing, the Phase III
second-line study. What is the issue, do you think? Because we had anticipated that with response rates, durability
response, safety, plus the ability to supplement Study 063 with the data from Study 003, what is the focus of discussion
with FDA? Is it lack of statistical significance in ORR [Objective Response Rate] given that this is a small patient
population? If you can, just please provide us color on what precisely the FDA is looking at and what additional data
you might be able to supply. And then secondly, do you have strategies in place to accelerate the melanoma indication?
Thanks very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Jami. I do understand your desire to understand our interactions with the FDA.
And I'm sure you'll appreciate that since we have ongoing interactions, I'm not going to talk about the specifics of this.
But what I will say is our review of the Study 063 data does reinforce our belief in the potential of nivo in terms of
long-term improvements in survival in lung cancer patients. And there is considerable data which is going to come
from the nivo clinical development in the second half of the year, which will provide opportunities for the FDA should
they need to see that.
Turning to the melanoma program, we have a very comprehensive program, and it's progressing really well. As you
know, we have three registration studies: a second-line study of nivo monotherapy post-Yervoy; and two first-line, one
with nivo monotherapy and one with nivo and Yervoy combined. All the studies are focused on demonstrating the
value of survival benefits, but we do have additional objective response endpoints in all those studies and the option of
doing interim analyses. When we get the data from our interim analysis, if it should be favorable, obviously, we will be
talking to the regulatory health authorities about that. Overall, I'm very encouraged by the progress of the Phase III
programs, and we are exploring all the opportunities we have for accelerating those filings.

Our next question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Hi. I'm sorry. I'm just going to ask another question on Study 063. Can you at least rule
out that the question at hand here is not related to biomarkers in PDL and expression? And then on your general
approach to looking at PDL and expression, is the current plan to stay with the exact same Dako assay that you've been
using? I'm wondering if it's possible that you might change that assay because the assay so far hasn't really seemed to
show the same types of findings that we've seen with Merck and Genentech.
And then on ipilimumab, once we get Merck's PD-1 on the market, what are your expectations for how ipilimumab
might be sequenced when physicians are trying to decide which drug to treat a new melanoma patient with?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Tim. First of all, let me say we have a comprehensive biomarker strategy where
all the patients in our trials have tumor taken and a positivity for PD-L1 taken. I think it's premature to make any
determination yet about – for any particular tumor about the relationship between PD-L1 positivity and response, let
alone overall response. But our aim is to understand that better so that we can understand both monotherapy and the
combinations across the entire population, not just the PD-L1 positive patients.
As far as the Dako assay is concerned, we are very comfortable with our assay. It's performing well. We like very much
the partnership with Dako, and I think they're very different assays between us and everyone else, and I think it's
premature to make any determination about which is best. Certainly, we are comfortable with ours as far as our data set
is concerned. Let me pass it over to Giovanni.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes Tim, this is Giovanni, just a couple comments on Yervoy. As Lamberto and Charlie
mentioned, we had a really strong quarter for Yervoy around the world. In the U.S., we had the strongest quarter in
terms of sales since launch, and we are seeing continuing growth of the use Yervoy in the academic setting but an
acceleration also of the growth of Yervoy in the community setting. And I think that's clearly the result of all the work
we've done to communicate the value of the data supporting Yervoy.
Obviously, as you know, at the beginning PD-1 agents in melanoma will be used primarily in the second-line setting
post-Yervoy. And so in the short term, we believe that there will be continued growing adoption of Yervoy in the
marketplace. And the trends we are seeing today are quite consistent with that. Obviously, the melanoma market will
change significantly over the next few weeks or few months and the next few years, but we believe there will be
continued need for the use of Yervoy and continued use of Yervoy. Some of it may be in monotherapy. Potentially,
Yervoy can have a really important role to play in combination with other agents in melanoma. And obviously, we will
be presenting some data in the adjuvant setting at ASCO, and that is also a very promising area for us with Yervoy.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Jami. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks a lot, thanks for the questions. So maybe first off, as we think about the prospect
of the survival study that's ongoing in squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and non-squamous, can you just update on
the timing? Do you still expect both studies to complete towards the end of this year in the head-to-head versus
docetaxel study? Can you clarify the primary endpoint in those studies? I realize that they are ongoing survival studies,
but particularly the squamous study is quite small. So I'm wondering if the primary endpoint is response rate there, if
you can just clarify that for us.
And then lastly, as we think about the expectations of what we could see disclosed and discussed as it relates to
CheckMate 012 at ASCO, I think really the question is can you just offer us the reasons why CheckMate 012 did not
make it as an oral abstract session presentation, unlike some of your data in kidney cancer and your data in melanoma?

Thanks so much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Seamus. So as far as the survival of the non-small-cell lung second-line
squamous and non-squamous studies, the primary endpoints were overall survival, although objective response rate is
included in that. As you know, this is an event-driven study, but our projection is that we will see top line data at the
end of the year.
As far as CheckMate 012 is concerned, let me just remind you that this was an exploratory study. It had many ARMs,
as you know. It's actually still ongoing, so not all the data is yet mature for presentation. And we took the view of
separating the different arms with different treatments into different presentations to allow a little more detail to appear
in the presentation. What I would reiterate is that it's a very informative study for us in terms of designing our Phase III
combination study of nivo and Yervoy, and we are on track to initiate that study in lung by the end of the year.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thank you. Thanks, Seamus. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from John Boris of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the question, and it will be really just directed on HCV. I guess a question for
Lamberto. It would appear that you could be in a position to be able to launch not only in Japan but potentially in
Europe and the U.S. Can you maybe just give some commentary on the readiness of your commercial organization and
the importance of this opportunity?
And then more specifically for Giovanni, in Japan, with your product concept testing of the combination agent that you
have there and with the Japanese market being a more safety-conscious market, how are you prepared to potentially
position that compound in that marketplace? The second part of it for Giovanni would be on usefulness pricing. Are
you anticipating premium pricing going into that market, and what's the range that you might be able to attract on
usefulness pricing?
And then lastly, I think you have more than 300 reps in that market. What's the crossover with selling Baraclude in that
market, and are you rightly scaled? Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay, long question. Let me start and Giovanni will continue. I think we have a good
opportunity in HC. I think we have a good opportunity in HC in Japan. But the more I look into the products we have
and the data we have, the opportunities in the U.S. and Europe are significant and meaningful. We are ready. We are
ready to launch in Japan and we're getting ready to launch in all of the other geographies. We are not going to talk
about pricing. This is obviously something that we will talk about only after we launch or the day we launch, but we are
ready and we believe that we have a good opportunity here. Giovanni?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: John, let me expand on what Lamberto said and start from a more general comment about
launch readiness. As you know, we have a very strong presence in virology. We have a global brand with Baraclude
that has given us a lot of experience with working in hepatology and obviously have a commercial footprint, which is
promoting our HIV products. That is really the core of the organization and the resources that we will deploy to launch
the hepatitis C portfolio around the world. But obviously, in every one of our geographies, we will make incremental
investments, strengthen and broaden our teams and investments to launch hep C when we have approval. That's very
much the case in Japan.
As a reminder, Japan is really one of the most successful Baraclude markets for us. We have an extremely high market
share and really good penetration in the marketplace there. And so the sales and medical teams that we have promoting
Baraclude will be deployed to promote the dual when we get approval potentially later this year. We also have
incrementally staffed the organization in Japan by increasing the number of reps and added a team in order to be really
well resourced, and we are ready to launch from a commercial perspective.

With respect to the profile of the product, as you know, we have executed a Japanese-specific development program for
the dual with Japanese patients. We have a strong data set. And at the same time, the thought leader community in
Japan is very knowledgeable about this combination and the profile of the two products. And clearly, we are
conducting testing to be ready for launch, and the results have been encouraging. So we're quite excited about the
opportunity in Japan. As Lamberto said, it's too early for us to comment on pricing.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Andrew Baum with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Good afternoon, a couple of questions. Number one with regards to the adjuvant Yervoy data
in melanoma, do you believe this data is fileable? I just wanted to confirm that you've seen the full data set?
Second, following on from that question, can you provide an update of the real world experience as it relates to
immuno-related adverse events with Yervoy? Obviously, as you move into the non-advanced setting that has additional
relevance.
And then finally just on Japan, my understanding is Gilead is maybe 12 – 18 months behind. Given the existence of
mutations conferring resistance, your regimen in Japanese patient, with the genotype, should I assume that there's only
a window of 18 months for you to monetize before you face significant market share erosion? Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Andrew. As far as the adjuvant melanoma study, we're actually very excited that
this is part of the ASCO press program. I want to point out; this is the first study that's being reported for checkpoint
inhibitor in adjuvant therapy for cancer. And as you know, there are limited other options in adjuvant melanoma for
patients. I think it's premature – we haven't even presented the data yet – to start talking about filing. But we have an
event, an investor event at ASCO, and I'm sure you can look forward to more discussions then.
I don't think there's anything more to add really about real world adverse events on I-O – sorry, in Yervoy. They're very
consistent I believe with what we showed in our dossier. And as far as the Japanese filing for HCV, personally I will
say we're very encouraged about the progress of that filing. We're looking forward to getting on the market. And I think
it's probably premature to start talking about competition. We're very comfortable with the unmet need it meets and the
profile of our dual.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: I'm going to add that it's always interesting to see our company trying to profile our own
products, and maybe we're premature and probably based on lack of information. So we are very excited about the
Japanese opportunity, and we're excited about it long term.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Can we go to the next question, please, Jamie?
Operator
Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. I really appreciate you taking the question. Number one on hepatitis C, I
was just wondering if you would be willing to comment on whether or not your FDA application on the dual includes a
request for approval for use in combination with Gilead's Sovaldi. That would be dac [daclatasvir] plus Gilead's
Sovaldi if possible.
And second, just to build on Seamus's earlier question, just to be really clear on this, will you actually show the primary
endpoint data of overall survival from the second-line nivo lung trials to the Street by the end of the year, or is that
something that we might have to wait until ASCO 2015 to see?

And then finally at ASCO coming up on the CheckMate 012 trial, are we going to see data from the low-dose
one-plus-one arm of the CheckMate 012 trial, or is that arm just still too – it's still just too early to see it? Thanks a lot.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So thank you, Mark. As far as our filing in the U.S. for the dual, I'm not going to go into
details about that because it's under review at the moment. But certainly we will be seeking approval for the dual in
genotype 1b in the United States.
I'm not sure I completely understood your question about the survival data. We will be getting survival data on the two
Phase III studies, second-line squamous and non-squamous, in-house by the end of the year. And as you know, our
custom is to present these data at a scientific meeting before we share it with Wall Street. So I think it's a reasonable
expectation that this will be at ASCO next year.
As far as the CheckMate 012 study and the low-dose, as I mentioned a little earlier, there are a number of these arms
still ongoing. And that's one that is providing important data for us as we design the Phase III study. And it's not mature
yet to present at ASCO.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Mark, just to add one thing on the disclosure of overall survival top line data, we would work
very closely like we always do with our general counsel, securities lawyers, and other people in senior management
before we determine what disclosure was appropriate. So as usual, we would just need to wait and see what happened,
and then we would make the right decisions at that time. Can we go to the next question, Jamie?
Operator
Our next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks, sorry about that. I have a number of questions on the immuno-oncology, but they
should be pretty brief. I guess the first question is should we assume that Breakthrough Designation is unlikely for nivo
at this point?
Second, with respect to Study 063, the primary endpoint was response rate, yet I think you've only talked about
long-term survival of nivo in third-line squamous lung as being encouraging. So can you just review the study design
for us for Study 063?
Third, with respect to the Phase III second-line squamous trial, ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that that concludes in
August. So is that just incorrect, and what is the right date to think about if that's incorrect?
And then finally, with respect to ASCO, the combo lung trial I think has a little bit of over 250 patients with 14 cohorts.
Maybe you could just help us understand how important the nivo plus Yervoy cohort is, assuming that it's less than 20
patients. How should we be thinking about how important that very small data set is, and what weight should we be
putting on that small data set when we see it at ASCO? Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, David. So first of all, Breakthrough Designation, the FDA has many mechanisms
for speeding the developments of oncology drugs. And I think as I've mentioned in the past, we have fast track
designation for lung, for melanoma, and for renal. And in fact, we are eligible for a rolling submission, which is what
was started – which will be started in the next few days.
Study 063, just a word about the study, it's in a highly pre-treated patient population. It has at least – the patients have
at least two lines of therapy before hand. Many of them have more than that. The primary endpoint is, as you say,
objective response rate. But of course, we will be continuing to monitor the patients as the study proceeds.
As far as the second-line squamous and non-squamous studies, as I mentioned, these are event-driven studies. And our
projection is that we will have top line data from an analysis on overall survival at the end of the year.
And finally, I think the way to look at the CheckMate 012 study is that it's extremely valuable for us. I want to reiterate
that it's proving very informative, the different ARMs, particularly around nivo/Yervoy as we come to design our

registrational Phase III study for the combination in lung. Many of the ARMs are not mature yet, so one has to consider
that when you look at the data at ASCO. But we are overall very excited about all the data, and there's a lot of it at
ASCO. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Jamie, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Our next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Just on the base business, maybe you can just give us an update on Sprycel and Orencia, a
little more detail on what was going on there and market share moves and stuff. And you had mentioned Orencia in
your prepared remarks. I was curious if you could give us a little more detail on what you meant there. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Thank you, Marc. These are products that we are very proud of. Why don't you start with
Sprycel, Giovanni?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Let me start with Sprycel. We had a good quarter, as Lamberto mentioned, with Sprycel,
with strong growth across the world, very good performance in the U.S., good performance in Europe, and acceleration
of growth in Japan. We are continuing to see gains coming primarily from the first-line setting in the U.S. and across
both lines of therapies in Europe, depending on the registration and local market dynamics. We continue in the U.S. to
be above Tasigna in terms of our market share and the evolution of that share, particularly in first-line. We have seen
continued erosion of the Gleevec trends in the U.S. over the last few months. But in the first quarter, that erosion has
slowed down, and we see somewhat of an increase of payers paying attention really to managing this category, but we
are in a really good position from an access perspective. And as I said, our performance with Sprycel continues to be
strong.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Orencia?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Orencia also is growing quite nicely around the world. You will remember the launch of the
sub-Q [subcutaneous] formulation, which is really the driver of our growth at this point, happened earlier in the U.S.
and later in Europe and Japan. So the trends of Europe and Japan where you see more robust growth is really
influenced by the more recent launches of the sub-Q formulation. In the U.S., we have seen somewhat of a decrease in
our growth, and our trends have been softer in Q1. As you know, there are new agents on the market that are also
growing and making that space and particularly the first-line setting more competitive. This is a very crowded market
with a lot of action from payers, and so it is a very competitive space.
As Lamberto mentioned, we have good plans in place to continue to focus on positioning Orencia as a first-line choice
in rheumatoid arthritis. We have plans in place to strengthen our execution, increase resourcing the brand, so we're
confident that the good growth trends will continue. But the first quarter in the U.S. was somewhat slower in terms of
the overall trajectory of the brand.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Jamie, can we go to our last question, please?

Our next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, thank you very much for taking the question. First on the competitive landscape,
I'm sure you're monitoring the situation with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Obviously, immuno-oncology is a big reason for
it, and we know it has the potential to be a large competitive market. Do you believe you have the commercial scale to
compete effectively in immuno-oncology if that merger were to go through, or should we expect additional commercial
build-up? And my follow up for Francis, on your recent acquisition, could you comment on the extent to which you
think you would be exploring the Tau assets in Alzheimer's disease? Thank you.

<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So why don't I start? I think that we are more than ready to compete in
immuno-oncology. And obviously, we are not only focusing on the possible new competitor that will come, but the
more imminent competitors that are already there. Yes, we are ready and we are ready in the U.S. and we are ready all
around the world, so nothing more to add there.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: As far as the iPierian Tau monoclonal antibody is concerned, our primary focus is in PSP and
potentially in frontal temporal dementia, which also does, at least in 50% of patients, have a genetic link. Clearly, Tau
may have a role to play in Alzheimer's, but I think in the first instance we are focusing on looking at patients who have
particular unmet needs that we can identify from their genetic mutations. Now the nice thing about this asset is it fits
well into an early-stage portfolio that we're building in terms of addressing genetically defined diseases. And in fact,
we are hoping it will be in the clinic by the end of the year or the beginning of next year. So we're very excited about
this opportunity.
Lamberto Andreotti
So let me conclude with three comments on immuno-oncology. First of all, as I said at the beginning of this call, I'm
very happy that we will start very soon with information for Study 063. We are very much looking forward to ASCO
and the additional data that we will be reviewing in the second half of this year. And finally, we remain as confident as
we've been in the potentials for immuno-oncology, as evidenced by the scale of our program, the unique scale of our
program, and its continued expansion.
Thank you for being with us this morning to discuss our good first quarter and many other things to look forward
throughout this year. Have a good day.
