MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the EMC second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. All parties are in a listen-only
mode until the question and answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have
any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President, Global Investor Relations at EMC.
Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you. Good morning, welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2013.
Today we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci, and David Goulden, EMC President and COO. David will
begin with a few comments on our results and provide a bit more detail and color around the factors contributing to
those results. He will also discuss our outlook for the year 2013. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of
what is happening in the economy and IT and the progress EMC is making with its vision and strategy. After the
prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions.
Today we are providing you with important new schedules that will help you understand the operations and results of
the EMC Information Infrastructure [EMCII] business, VMware, and Pivotal individually and in the context of the
consolidated results. Within these schedules, you will find six quarters of results for each of these three businesses,
including revenues, gross margin, and operating margins. This information is key to better understanding the dynamics
of our business and reflects how we will be discussing our results this quarter and moving forward. The full schedules
are available for download on the EMC IR website, and the summary data is included within our slides today.

We are providing you with our updated projected financial model for 2013. This model lays out all the key assumptions
and discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model
helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated
into your models. This model is available as background in today's slides, available for download in the IR section of
EMC.com.
Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. A
reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release,
supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation.
As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could
cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
With that, it's now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
We're making some improvements to the format of our conference call. We are reordering our prepared remarks to
include our overall results and financial position first. We will then discuss the progress of the three businesses that
compromise the EMC federation and end up with an update on our go-to-market model and our outlook.
As you know, we have comprehensive disclosures with extensive detail on the many aspects of our businesses available
with our release, in the slides presented, and on the web. Rather than cover all these in our prepared remarks, we'll
spend more time on the primary levers of our business and the various puts and takes within the results while still
leaving ample time for your questions. We think this approach will give you a better understanding of the major drivers
of our business today as well as those we expect will be big drivers over time.
The role of solid top and bottom line performance in Q2 continued to demonstrate the soundness of our strategy, the
importance of our federated business model, and the focus and dedication of the EMC team globally. In addition to
delivering a solid quarter, during the last three months we formed Pivotal, including an investment from GE. We
announced a new capital allocation strategy which includes dividend, and we completed a $5.5 billion debt offering, so
a very busy quarter. I want to extend my thanks to the entire EMC, VMware, and Pivotal teams.
We achieved year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter of 6% to $5.6 billion, the results of continued steady growth
from our Information Infrastructure business, double-digit growth from Pivotal, and accelerating growth from VMware.
All four of our major geographies grew as well, with North America up 4%, EMEA up 6%, APJ up 12%, and Latin
America up 12% from last year's second quarter. Our BRIC + 13 markets grew 18%, the result of our focus and
investments within these faster growing markets.
With the increased volume from Q1, consolidated gross margins improved nicely by 120 basis points sequentially to
64.3% and were down 10 basis points year on year. If we exclude the one-time positive $9 million impact from the
RSA charge reversal in Q2 last year, consolidated gross margins were up slightly year on year.
I think you'll find it informative to look at the year-on-year gross margin performance of different parts of the business.
Within EMCII, storage product gross margin came back to last year's levels, helped by ongoing mix shift but pressured
by another back-end loaded quarter. Storage gross margins were down 30 basis points year on year due to higher
service costs. EMCII gross margins were also impacted by the RSA charge reversal in Q2 2012 I just mentioned.
Consolidated gross margin benefited from improved margins and increased mix from VMware. Going forward, we
continue to expect consolidated gross margins to improve quarter on quarter for the rest of the year, so better in the
second half than in the first half. And we continue to expect consolidated operating leverage for the full year will come
from both gross margin and operating efficiency improvements.

Good cost controls and spending discipline held operating expenses in check, and non-GAAP operating margin
improved by 20 basis points from Q2 2012. The increased investment supporting the build-out of VMware's
capabilities around software-defined data center, vCHS, and end-user computing were balanced by major spending in
the Information Infrastructure business. We invested resources in several growth initiatives in the EMCII business such
as XtremIO and ViPR and also in Pivotal as it lays the foundation for rapid expansion over the next few years. These
investments notwithstanding, we were able to expand operating margins from the second quarter last year and grow
non-GAAP earnings per share 8% to $0.42.
First half free cash flow was $2.3 billion, approximately $500 million higher than non-GAAP net income. We remain
on track to deliver $5.5 billion of free cash flow for the year.
We finished Q2 with $17.6 billion in cash and investments. This balance reflects the $5.5 billion debt offering we
completed in Q2. We purchased $700 million worth of EMC stock in Q2, bringing our buy-back to $1 billion for the
first half of the year. This leaves $2.5 billion of buyback to go by June 30, 2013 to meet our 18-month goal.
The EMC ex-VMware U.S. cash balance at quarter end was a little over $9 billion. Over the next 12 months, we
committed about $5 billion of this to debt repayment, dividends, and buybacks. This is part of the larger capital
allocation strategy we announced last quarter, which includes repurchase of $6 billion of EMC shares over the three
years ending December 2015 as well as the initiation of a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend. We are pleased to have
paid our very first dividend just yesterday. Over time we expect to direct about 25% to 30% of our free cash flow
ex-VMware to buybacks and about 20% to 25% to dividends. This framework allows the expansion of our cash returns
to shareholders in sync with the growth of our ex-VMware free cash flow.
In summary, the net effect of gross and operating margin changes on EPS was positive. Various non-operating items
such as tax rates and minority interest in the quarter were where we expected them to be. Note that the increase in
non-operating expense, including incremental interest expense related to our debt offering, was roughly offset by the
reduced share count, primarily stemming from our expanded share buyback. In Q3, the interest expense and fees
associated with our debt offering will be about $35 million pre-tax in non-operating expense.
The net result of all these moving parts in the quarter was an incremental $0.03 per share on our non-GAAP EPS.
Today's results demonstrate our ability to make the required investments for our success tomorrow while still
delivering returns today.
Our ability to deliver on the triple play: to gain market share, reinvest in the future, and deliver leverage, has been
strengthened by our federated structure. By dividing the strategy and executional focus between EMCII, VMware, and
Pivotal, we are better able to focus each entity on their respective missions and set them up to succeed. Very
importantly, this approach offers our customers horizontal solutions and more choice than they get from others. It's a
unique business model that leaves each of the businesses free to build the products, go-to-market capabilities, and
ecosystems necessary to win. And because the three share the same ultimate goal for customers: leveraging cloud, big
data, and trusted IT to maximize control efficiency and choice, their missions are clearly aligned. This is a powerful
combination for customers.
The federation also represents a portfolio of growth businesses that is well equipped for the industry's transition to
IT-as-a-service. This approach captures the solid opportunities and growth of EMC's Information Infrastructure
business, the faster-growing revenues of VMware as it executes on its focus strategy, and the opportunity for
hyper-growth through Pivotal and its play in big and faster data.
Looking at each of these in turn, starting with our Information Infrastructure business, we continue to delight our
customers and win new ones with our market-leading storage portfolio. Storage revenue growth accelerated 4% in Q2,
driven by faster product revenue growth. Our high-end storage continues to shows good growth and share gains.
VMAX features are clearly relevant to a broader set of customers than we have traditionally served. Over three-quarters
of VMAX systems revenue in the quarter came from the 10K and the 40K, and VMAX continues to add net new
customers for EMC.

Growth in our unified and backup recovery portfolio improved from Q1. As expected, performance of our unified
storage business was similar to last quarter. Our unified business was affected by the broad customer anticipation of the
next generation VNX, which is on track for a major launch this quarter. We are confident customers and partners will
be very pleased with its capabilities, so stay tuned here.
The improvement in growth was driven by our backup and recovery systems business, which grew considerably faster
in Q2 than Q1. As the largest data protection company in the world, EMC is creating new standards in the space and
transforming backup so customers can better respond to the demands of their rapidly growing application data
environments. We laid the foundation for this with our Protection Storage Architecture announcement two weeks ago.
And our brand-new line of DataDomain products and new capabilities for our data protection suite, including better
integration with applications, primary storage, and optimization for VMware environments means even greater scale
performance and integration than ever and represents a significant step towards delivering our full protection storage
architecture.
Our emerging storage business grew a very healthy 39% in Q2 due to strong customer demand for our differentiated
solutions, including Isilon, VPLEX, Atmos, and our Xtrem Flash products. These new technologies meet customers'
emerging needs as they build out their cloud and big data environments. VPLEX, for instance, is winning us new
customers with capabilities that it alone is able to deliver, continuous operations for mission-critical workloads over
distance; in other words, full infrastructure utilization with zero downtime.
Isilon's scale-out NAS architecture delivers an unmatched combination of performance and efficiency that makes it
increasingly popular for web scale applications. In fact, Isilon has delivered almost 85 petabytes of capacity to a single
web scale customer this year, demonstrating the value its scale-out architecture can deliver. Isilon's suitability for
verticals outside its traditional customer base is also gaining recognition, with revenue from financial services doubling
year on year in Q2. Isilon's growth over the past year has been truly remarkable. In the first six months of this year,
Isilon shipped over half an exabyte.
Growth of Atmos also contributed meaningfully to emerging storage group's strong growth in the quarter. More
customers are seeking the globally distributed, object-based cloud storage that Atmos delivers, and we're seeing good
adoption.
With the need for higher performance in the face of massive data sets, more customers are implementing XtremSF
flash technology in their server environments. Improving the availability of server-based storage is important to
optimize this underlying infrastructure, which is why we acquired ScaleIO earlier this month. ScaleIO software, which
pools server storage across virtualized and physical environments, will enable customers to build protected shared
storage pools from whatever form factor exists in the server, whether it's SSDs, PCIe flash, or hard disk drives .
ScaleIO will become a key part of our Xtrem software suite.
The Directed Availability program of our all-flash array, XtremIO, is exceeding our expectations, and dozens of
customers are now participating. Several customers have moved beyond the testing phase and have deployed XtremIO
for their production environments. We're encouraged by this positive customer reaction. Our rigorous tests and QA
program is progressing, and XtremIO is on track to GA [General Availability] before the end of the year.
The growth in Q2 of each of our major storage portfolios underscores our conviction that different storage technology
is required to meet the needs of different workloads. Some, like transaction processing, require high levels of
performance and advanced data management services. Some, like social media apps, require minimum service levels
but may need high performance levels; while others, online archiving for instance, may require capacity more than they
do service or performance. At EMC, we are laser-focused on having the best-in-class solution across this spectrum.
And with our market-leading technology across the board, we continued to gain share.
Our software-defined storage platform, ViPR, which we announced in May, adds further value to customers' existing
storage investments from EMC and others. The ViPR controller allows a diverse set of storage arrays to be managed in
a standard and automated way, and the automation the ViPR controller provides drives down IT costs and improves
reliability.

We also recognize that the way next-generation applications will be developed is different from the way that most
traditional apps have been architected. And ViPR provides a set of data services, including objects and ACFS to allow
for the development of these next-generation big and fast data applications, including applications built using Pivotal's
technologies. The beauty of the ViPR architecture is that the control and data services will work with existing EMC
arrays, third-party arrays, and commodity storage, providing investment protection, flexibility, and choice for our
customers.
The early adopter program that is underway for ViPR is in its final round, and we're on track to GA later this year.
Customers in the early adopter program are very happy that ViPR is delivering upon its promise to simplify
management. They're telling us they like how easy it is to deploy and how easy it is to use. They like that it works in
heavy use environments and takes advantage of investments they've made in storage infrastructure, and they like the
vision. ViPR solves the problems they have today and provides them a path to the future.
Just as ViPR is an enabling technology for next-generation and cloud-based architectures, so too is security. The agile
intelligent security technology offered by RSA helps give organizations the confidence to embrace trends towards
mobile, social, and cloud. Overall, RSA revenue grew 3% in Q2 year on year. Our security analytics suite and
compliance offerings show good growth. But overall growth was impacted by two factors in identity and data
protection. The first was our focus on customer migration more than customer acquisition for our new, highly
acclaimed Authentication Manager 8.0 release. The second was due to timing of some large deals. We expect stronger
performance from our identity and data protection offerings in the second half.
The growth of web-based applications, cloud architectures, and mobile computing are driving a transformation of
authentication and identity management. RSA has recognized this trend and is investing in next-generation
authentication and identity access management. The acquisition of Aveksa, a leader in identity and access governance,
is a major step in that direction. And with the addition of Aveksa's technology to our existing strong authentication
portfolio, RSA can develop access governance for risk and activity-based authentication and authorization. The result
for customers is a more effective way to manage access to the business as the line of business owning the data rather
than IT is given the power to make access decisions within the controls, processes, and policies defined by information
security.
Our Information Intelligence business continues to make progress on its transition to more cloud-friendly offerings and
vertical-based solutions. While total Q2 revenue was in line with the comparable period last year, we saw good growth
for our new initiatives. Syncplicity was once again ahead of plan and earlier this month was positioned as a leader in
the most recent Forrester report on file sync and share platforms.
The strong results VMware achieved this quarter speak to the strategic position it holds in customers' and partners' data
centers. The broad success we're achieving across the three strategic pillars of software-defined data center, hybrid
cloud, and end-user computing is due in part to customers' desires to undertake these initiatives with their existing
trusted virtualization partner. VMware consistently garners the highest marks in customer satisfaction and Net
Promoter studies. And with over 500,000 customers using VMware to run almost 40 million virtual machines, this
ability to delight customers is meaningful.
With an ever-growing portion of license bookings coming from products beyond SANware and vSphere such as
vCloud Suite, vSphere with operations management, management and automation, and end-user computing, it's clear
that VMware's expansion beyond server virtualization is getting traction. VMware's recent launch of vCloud Hybrid
Services furthers the opportunity for growth. The ability to seamlessly extend private cloud to public cloud with
vSphere as the foundation is very appealing to customers. And as a result, we've seen strong interest in the early access
program.
While early and still maturing, OpenStack is a framework for customers to construct their own clouds. VMware is
expanding its market opportunity and saw good growth from these customers, with its best-in-class components
integrating into this framework. In particular, VMware's network virtualization platform is the leading software
solution for OpenStack networking.

All this adds up to a fantastic opportunity ahead for VMware and its customers and with the lion's share of ELA
[Enterprise License Agreement] renewal opportunities in the second half and with an exciting set of announcements
planned for VMworld, VMware is highly energized and well positioned for the acceleration of revenue growth we
expect to achieve in the second half.
Pivotal made very good progress since its formal launch as a new company within the EMC family and with a
significant investment from GE. The Pivotal team is building a new platform comprising next-generation data fabrics,
application fabrics, and a cloud-independent path layer. Pivotal announced during the quarter that the first version of
this platform for next-generation big and fast data applications, called Pivotal One, will be launched before year end.
Customer interest in Pivotal remains intense, and we're also actively engaging others in the industry. In fact, this
morning Pivotal and IBM put out a press release on the work that they've been doing with Cloud Foundry and the
intention to work together to expand the ecosystem. Pivotal's existing products such as the Greenplum database and the
Gemfire in-memory data grid continued to score significant design wins, particularly in the telecommunications,
financial services, e-commerce, and healthcare spaces.
These factors all bode well for Pivotal's future growth. As we explained at our Strategic Forum, 2013 will be a year of
transition for Pivotal, and we continue to expect revenues of about $300 million this year as we position Pivotal for
rapid growth in 2014 and beyond.
As we've been building the federation and adding assets to strengthen the offerings across our businesses, we've also
been developing our go-to-market model to enable customers to get the full value from these offerings in their preferred
way. The work we have done, we've converged infrastructures and reference architectures is clearly paying off. As IT
head count is growing at a fraction of the pace of data and all the demands on the data center, customers are looking for
simple and scalable ways to build out IT-as-a-service, and both Vblocks and VSPEX meet these needs.
Customers wanting a complete plug-and-play cloud-in-a-box leveraging best-of-breed technology from VMware,
Cisco, and EMC favor a Vblock from VCE. VCE had an excellent quarter, as demand for Vblocks grew more than
50% year on year, with roughly half the orders coming from repeat customers and the balance from brand-new
accounts just getting started with Vblocks.
We are seeing initial Vblock purchases by new customers growing in size and in number of systems as converged
infrastructure becomes a more accepted paradigm with customers. There's a good mix of service providers and
enterprise data center implementations as the value proposition of the Vblock converged architecture is strong for both.
Customers seeking more flexibility with reference architecture look to VSPEX, and more and more are doing just that.
VSPEX is a resounding success, with over 3,600 VSPEX systems sold since just last April. In other words, in less than
half the time, we had more systems installed than another less flexible reference architecture that has been on the
market for several years. The program makes it easy for partners to sell EMC. And with over a third of the total
VSPEX systems sold coming in Q2 alone, this is clearly gaining momentum.
The EMC Cloud Service Provider Partner program continued to expand in Q2, with more partners added in the period,
and dozens more approved and being onboarded. Revenue growth once again exceeded 40% over Q2 of last year, with
strength across all our major geos. Our Service Provider Partner program is great example of the value EMC brings to
the table when it comes to IT-as-a-service, and service provider continues to be our fastest growing vertical market
segment.
With these different choices for customers, the backing of world-class services, tight integration with VMware, and a
link to brand new possibilities through Pivotal, EMC helps organizations transform confidently towards
IT-as-a-service. When you look across our company, the technology stack we offer is powerful when connected
together, but it's also powerful because it's horizontal and is built to provide the choice that is one of our fundamental
value propositions. We are confident that as customers continue to modernize their IT by leveraging the applications
infrastructures they have in place today and building out new platforms for the future, EMC will be a key partner.

Looking towards the second half, with the recent launch of our new DataDomain line, major launches ahead of us for
VNX, ViPR, and XtremIO, and increasing momentum from VMware, we are reaffirming our expectations for 2013,
namely: that we expect EMC revenue to grow 8% to $23.5 billion; non-GAAP EPS to grow 9% to $1.85 per share; and
free cash flow to grow by 10% to $5.5 billion.
Our robust product roadmaps, the success we are seeing across our go-to-market initiatives, and the positive response
from customers for our market-leading technology have us very energized and highly focused on seizing the
opportunities that lie ahead.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, David. I would like to welcome everyone to today's conference call. Thank you for joining us.
Overall, I am very pleased with our Q2 results and our execution, especially so given the uncertainties that still exist in
the global economy and the resulting continued tightness that exists in micro IT spending. This IT spending tightness
exhibited itself once again in a very back-end loaded quarter. As in the past several quarters, customers are being very
cautious with their IT spend and are subjecting potential IT purchase orders to more scrutiny, tougher ROI hurdles, and
in many cases requiring a higher level of executive examination, resulting in elongated approval processes. The good
news for EMC is that we expected this phenomenon, and as such we ran higher inventory levels, put additional
resources in our factories and in order support, and we had to field pre-configured hardware. Thus, we were able to
manage through a quite late Q2.
The bad news is that these processes are less efficient, more costly, and thus hurt our gross and operating margins. That
said, and again I repeat, I believe we performed very well, especially when one compares our organic growth profiles to
that of our peers. I am very proud of the approximately 60,000 talented people of EMC, VMware and Pivotal. And I'd
like to publicly thank them for the hard work and dedication they exhibit every day.
I would now like to give you a little more color on the quarter. On a geographic basis, we experienced 4% growth in
North America, 6% growth in EMEA, 12% growth in both Latin America and APJ, with growth in Asia-Pacific
excluding Japan at 18%. Japan grew at 6% on a constant currency basis, and they exhibited 18% growth in our BRIC +
13 countries.
Looking at our year-on-year Q2 results from a vertical market perspective, we saw strength and high growth with our
service providers and in healthcare. We had good growth in the public sector markets, including our U.S. Federal
business. Our business with financial services and telco was flattish. Within that, banking were weaker.
As we look into the balance of 2013, we still believe IT spending growth for the full year to be in a 3% range. Against
this 3%, we continue to expect our top line to grow 8% this year while producing some leverage, targeting our
non-GAAP EPS to grow by 9% and our free cash flow by 10%.
Our confidence in 2013 stems from our belief in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of this year. Our
confidence/ability is underpinned by our winning cloud, big data and trusted IT strategy; by our unique innovative
federation model, under which we assure our cloud, big data, and trusted strategies are fully aligned among EMCII,
VMware, and Pivotal; but that each entity is laser focused on a set of clear, defined missions giving each them the
charter to build the products, the go-to-market capabilities, and the ecosystem necessary to win.
To refresh your memory, Pivotal is focused on building a platform for new cloud, big data, and fast data applications.
VMware is focused on building a software-defined data center that will power private, public, and hybrid clouds, and
on solving the demands for end user device management, automation, and security in the post-PC era. And EMCII is
focused on providing Information Storage and protection, information security, and Information Intelligence for
existing and new cloud and big data infrastructures. EMCII's new and exciting initiatives around flash, Scale-out NAS,
Atmos, ViPR, and HTFS position us well to capture these new opportunities.

And the best news is that customer interest in and receptivity of these strategies in our federation model is very high.
Additionally and very importantly, what will give us confidence in our ability to accelerate our growth in the second
half of 2013 and achieve our goals is a strong product portfolio of exciting products, which we will launch over the
next few months.
Again, thank you very much for being with us today, and I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the
Q&A portion of today's call. Tony?
Anthony T. Takazawa
Thanks, Joe. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual we ask you to try and limit yourselves to one
question, including clarifications. We thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Evan, can we up the lines for
the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Yes, sir. Our first question today comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew J. Nowinski>: Good morning, congrats on a nice quarter. You guys are seeing broad strength across
your entire portfolio, including the high end, the midrange, backup; so I guess I was just wondering. Are there any wins
or color that you can provide that support the notion that EMC is displacing the competition at some of the large
enterprise and service provider customers, leveraging the comprehensive nature of your portfolio? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Andrew, let me start. Maybe Joe will add some color. First of all, we absolutely believe that
we're taking share. So you look at us against the industry, we're doing very well. You mentioned all those segments. I
gave you a little bit of color in my commentary about, for example, a web-scale customer that has purchased 85
petabytes of Isilon so far this year, obviously a very major investment on their behalf and a key customer for us. I look
across our major customers and we're in the middle of significant rollouts of all those key technologies. Obviously, a
lot of the customers prefer to not go public with those statements. But I can guarantee you that the number of big wins
that we're seeing is definitely increasing, as you mentioned, across the portfolio, not just enterprises but also SPs. And
also by geography, we're in a pretty strong position right now.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Actually, I think you covered it well, David. You've got to look at applications. There are
applications that need tremendous functionality, high functionality. There are applications which need storage to have
great performance. There are applications which need storage to have just great capacity and low cost. So basically, as
you look at that, you come out with four quadrants. And we're the only ones out there I know that are building
significant products for all four quadrants and building the ecosystem and the set of technologies out of ViPR, out of
FAST to pull those four quadrants of technologies together, and that's a winning formula.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew J. Nowinski>: Great, keep up the good work.

Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks, a question for David and one for Joe. David, on the gross margins, if I look at
the Information Storage business ex-Pivotal, it looks like year on year the first half gross margins have been actually
slightly down. I'm just wondering. I was previously of the view that you could gain share and expand gross margins in

that segment given higher mid-end mix, higher software touch. Have we perhaps peaked out at that point and maybe
from here there isn't that much more ahead, or can you speak about some of the dynamics around why that may
continue?
And then for Joe, various times over the last year you've mentioned that people are maybe under-investing on the
storage side given the level of data growth. Does the reacceleration in growth this quarter maybe present an inflection
and we're going to see some of that under-spending come through in revenues for you guys over the next 12 months or
so? How confident do you feel about that? Many thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: All right, Kulbinder, thank you. Let me start. Obviously, we've given you a fair amount of
color on what's been happening in gross margins. I think it's important to actually look not just at Information
Infrastructure, but with the detail we've given you in the supplementary schedules, you can actually now see by quarter
what's happening in Information Storage, Information Intelligence, and RSA Security. So the biggest factor I think
you're focusing upon is what's happening in Information Storage. As we mentioned in Q1, we saw some pressure on the
product gross margins due to just revenue growth and also the timing of quarter end.
The good news is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter Information Storage product gross margins
came back to almost exactly where they were last year, which is a good thing because we had positive impact from
mix, but we still had the pressures that we had in Q1 related to a late quarter, so I feel good about that trend. And this
quarter within Information Storage we saw some buildup in service costs that brought the overall Information Storage
segment down a little bit. So the good news is that Information Storage product margins bounced back. We saw
positive mix, and we still see the opportunity for mix improvements going forward. We do expect to see margins
improve sequentially throughout the year both in total and in Information Infrastructure and in Information Storage.
The other thing that happened this quarter, as I mentioned in a couple different places, is if you look at the RSA
segments, you'll see that this quarter year on year it looks as if gross margins are down a fair amount, and that's due to
the effect of last Q2 of the $9 million charge reversal as we closed out issues related to the breach. So we've given you
a lot more information to dig into it, and we'll give you more color on each segment as we go through the year.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I think, Kulbinder, you're asking me more of an industry-general than EMC-specific in
storage, and I'll answer it that way. If that's wrong, come on back. Rather, I'll ask you right now. Is that what you're
after?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Yes, basically I'm trying to understand, Joe. There's a perception out there and we have
this as well. There's an underinvestment happening in storage just given the data growth. It has decelerated in the entire
industry and for you guys as well, and I'm wondering. Do you get the sense that with the inflection in growth you saw
this quarter in your business and just the level of underinvestment that may have happened that maybe people have to
do an element on that say catch-up spending as we saw in 2009 and 2010, or are we not at that stage in the industry and
budgets are just going to remain tight for some time?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Sure. I think there are two ways to look at it, and I'll give you both ways. First of all, I
absolutely believe that the economy and the slow growth in IT spend overall is the biggest impact, especially when you
look at what's happening in portions of EMEA and Japan. For sure, we also see customers elongating their upgrade
cycles. They're keeping their hardware longer and trying to get more value out of it that way. Also, the industry has
produced a tremendous amount of technology for efficiency and optimization of storage, things like thin-provisioning,
deduplication, compression of data, our FAST technology, Fully Automated Storage Tiering. All these things are
helping get tremendous more value. The advent of flash helps a lot too because you can – if you take flash and FAST,
that really helps customers a lot get both efficiency and optimization of storage. So there's a lot happening there, and of
course the base information is going to grow over time.
If you look at the environment itself, I think it will be similar to what we saw, but I do expect you'll see a slight pickup
in just aggregate storage. You've also got easier year-on-year compares for the industry as we go into the second half. If
you take IT growth in general in the first half, I'll just take easy numbers. I'm positive IT spending in 2012, in the first
half of 2012 was over 3% And I'm quite positive that IT spending overall in the second half of 2012 was under 2%. I'm

sure there are people that gave you more precise numbers. So obviously, the industry is facing easier compares; so is
EMC. And then, of course, when you look at ourselves, I think what will help propel some of our growth is our product
cycle and exciting new announcements we have scheduled.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Great, thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes, thank you for taking the question. I guess, Joe, building on that last comment about
product cycles and particularly focusing on the upcoming VNX refresh, as you look at the second half setup in terms of
the absolute increase in revenue, how would you characterize this refresh and the ability to reaccelerate that midrange
growth rate relative to what historically had been talked about as being a double-digit growth rate? How meaningful
architecturally is this refresh to you guys in the back half of the year?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I think it's definitely meaningful. Since David runs that business, I'm going to let him
comment, and I'll add a little color at the end.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, sure. Thank you. So we had a couple of things going on this year, both of which are
helpful. So in the first half you've seen that we've had a strong product cycle coming from 2012 into 2013 in the high
end. And that has given us strong growth rates in the high end relative to our long-term trends, which has helped us in
the first half. Obviously, in the second half that's now well beyond a year after that major launch, so that will start to
tail off a little bit. Then to your point, in replacement of that, we've got the product cycles coming in our mid-tier
category. Obviously from a revenue point of view, the DataDomain platforms that we have just launched will be
available for the entire second half, and the to-be-launched VNX that will be available for a little less than the entire
second half, a little bit over four months. So those are going to ramp up as the high end ramps down.
The other thing I'll point out to you relative to acceleration is you've also got another thing going on, which is the
year-on-year compare that Joe mentioned earlier. We expected and we still expect this year to progress normally
sequentially in terms of the contribution from the first half and the second half. So if you look back over time, we
typically do 47% of our revenue in the first half and 53% in the second half. I think if you look actually at what we
achieved in the first half, that is exactly 47% of our goal of $23.5 billion. So you've got these product cycles happening
and they do offset each other a little bit. And clearly very important for the second half is to make sure that the mid-tier
product cycles kick in. Now on top of that, we've got things like ViPR and XtremIO. But in total when you look at the
year, it's actually quite balanced in terms of sequential progression. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color
about the different factors.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, next question please.

Our next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Yes, thank you very much. So your Pivotal segment had a deceleration to 11% from 57% Q1.
Can you talk about your growth expectations in that segment going forward? And separately, can you talk about the
riskier areas to a lot of investors, China, Europe, and Federal? You did well in all three last quarter, but what's your
expectation going forward in the second half? Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'll do the Pivotal and I'll give it to David on China, Europe, and Federal. First of all, I want to
say that Pivotal is performing so close to their plan it's unbelievable. If you're internal, it would almost look like we –
the plan and the actual is almost the same. So we're very pleased with the way Pivotal is progressing. This is a

positioning year for Pivotal. This is a big investment year for Pivotal.
The big thing from the product point of view is to get this Pivotal One platform out, and we're focused on that, a big,
big milestone for Pivotal. If you're watching and I can tell you, I'm incredibly pleased with this one, is are we getting
the lighthouse wins in the big accounts across the set of industries which we think are important? And I can tell you, we
are in spades. PS margins are very low, dragging it down. The reason there is we're building up like crazy, So PS
margins, the more you – you can always put a technologist in, but then it takes you a while to get revenue out the other
end. But we're overstaffing and building the talent because that's how we're going to win. And again, while the future
will be a cloud-based platform, we're still selling a lot of appliances today and we're exceeding the market, so those
appliances are low.
So really the Pivotal growth last quarter was exceedingly good. It's slowed down. I think you've got to look at it the
whole year, and we've told you we expect that to be a little bit over $300 million for the year. I believe that's where it's
going to come in. But the more important thing is are we going to get out Pivotal One? Are we going to get those
lighthouse wins? Are we going to build the team to win? And the answer is yes, yes, and yes. And I think as David
mentioned, IBM joining Cloud Foundry I think is really, really positive for the industry, and that will expand the Cloud
Foundry ecosystem. They'll contribute technology and plan to use a Cloud Foundry in their own application
development there.
So Pivotal – I couldn't be more pleased with Pivotal. I really couldn't. So it's the way we set the plan, not for maximum
revenue growth there, but to get the things I just talked about done. Do you want to talk about China and Europe and
Federal, David?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure. Obviously, we're not going to give you guidance for specific regions, but I will tell you
this. Obviously, the third quarter is typically a strong quarter for Federal with it being the budget year end. Despite the
pressures there, we do expect to see decent success in Federal this quarter.
China is relatively underweight for us compared to perhaps some of the bigger players in the industry, so we're more
impacted by our ability to gain share. Obviously, the macro impacts all of us a little bit, but it's still a region that's
growing one of the fastest amongst the world.
And Europe, we saw some bright spots this quarter. We saw our growth in Europe, which obviously accelerated from
Q1. We saw improvements relative to Q1 in the UK and Germany and Eastern Europe. So those are all markets that
bode well for us for the balance of the year. So I don't want to get tied down to specific guidance numbers by theater,
but I do think we're going to continue to be fairly balanced as we go throughout the rest of the year.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Thanks.

Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great, thanks. Here comes one question. We've been monitoring the SDS software-defined
storage space for quite some time. I think the acquisition of ScaleIO is pretty interesting. But I think the only product
that you guys currently offer from a decoupling standpoint of software from hardware is Atmos. Can you talk a little bit
about what the customer traction is with this strategy of decoupling and ordering just the Atmos software? And perhaps
what are the issues from a qualification and maintenance and service perspective? If you can give any color there, that

would be great. Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, Brian, sure. First of all, before I answer the question specifically, I just want to go back
to that workload chart that we showed earlier on because workloads are very important. After all, storage systems, in
fact all IT infrastructure exists to support workloads. And we've got to understand where the software-defined storage
or the decoupling, as you say, is going to potentially play. It's not going to play up in the transaction mission-critical
workloads because of the tight integration people need and the support environment and the data services. Where we do
see it playing is in some of the new applications of potentially server-based or scale-out environments like Atmos.
So to answer your question about Atmos, it's quite interesting for us and I think quite insightful. We do often have
offered Atmos on either a software basis or basically buying what we call the Hulk hardware, which is basically a very
dense, commoditized package of hardware from EMC. We give customers the choice, and we'll give them that choice
on ScaleIO. We'll give them that choice with the ViPR data services. And we also have things like VPLEX available as
a software-only solution as well. So it's not just in Atmos, but the longest experience is with Atmos.
The interesting thing is in the vast majority of cases, I'd say in the vast combination of cases, customers choose to buy
both parts of the solution from us because they want the support, they want the integration, they want the qualification
that we do. Now some customers do go and buy their own and choose to run it upon hardware they put together. And
obviously, we support them the best we can and we have well-published APIs et cetera to communicate between those
two layers. But our experience is so far that given the choice most customers would like to buy the two together.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Brian. Next question, please?
Operator
Next we have Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks. Maybe it's one question with two parts, and both focus on the gross margin side. Can you
talk about the gross margin in Pivotal longer term, where you see that converging to because it seems like there's a lot
of volatility there? I assume that just by adding the pieces it moved around, but maybe you can help us think about the
longer-term perspective.
And second, David, regarding your comments on the sequential improvement in gross margin in the storage business,
just considering the headwinds that you had on gross margin this quarter, with the extra costs that you had to incur
given the back-ended loaded quarter, should we interpret that commentary to mean that the VNX introduction is
actually going to be very early in this quarter, meaning you're not going to have that problem this quarter?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Okay, let me take the two parts. So Pivotal gross margins, I think as you correctly say, they
are all over the place, and they will be that way as we move through 2013. We're repositioning a lot of the resource. We
have – 1,250 people roughly came into Pivotal. We're a few more higher than that. We're building out a strong
professional services capability. Obviously, we're not fully utilizing all those people, so the gross margins there are not
what they will be when the business ramps up to scale.
From a product point of view, there's a lot of integration and positioning. So we are selling a number of things like
Greenplum and Gemfire, but a number of the other products that are coming in and being repositioned. So you really
shouldn't read too much into any particular line item on Pivotal this year. We're on track for $300 million plus a little
bit of revenue. And as we get Pivotal One to market, which is more of a combined IP platform, we go into 2014, you'll
see a higher mix of the revenues coming from licensing and IP, and also we'll hopefully see ourselves getting better
utilization on the services. So those are the things to look out for on Pivotal. I think you'll drive yourself crazy if you try
to understand in 2013 what's going on, on any particular line item. As Joe said, we're on track. We have a business plan
with Pivotal which requires about $400 million of P&L investment up through breakeven, and we're on track to within
very, very close measures on that.

On storage, yes, we are pleased, as I mentioned, with the sequential increase in margins in storage, in particular in
storage product margins. I would say that obviously, as you correctly pointed out, some of the buildup in inventory at
quarter end was to do with just managing through a back-end quarter. Others were related through due to getting ready
to launch the new platforms. VNX will be available this quarter. It won't be available for the entire quarter, but it will
be available this quarter and expect a major launch. And some of you may have already picked up, we've already
started some of the partner training and internal training around the new VNX launch.

Next in queue we have Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Could you maybe just talk about if you're starting to see
public cloud options like AWS [Amazon Web Services] and Microsoft Azure in the field from a competition
perspective? And if so, maybe you can just talk about what sort of workloads they typically tend to win in. And is that
competition relegated more or less to the SMB/SME side, or are you seeing it encroaching the large enterprises? Thank
you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'll start and David can add color. You see it across SMB in a large [indiscernible] (50:30).
Primarily they're doing things a lot in what we call in shadow IT. They're doing a lot in safe areas like development.
We think our approach that we've launched through VMware called the VCHS, the Virtual Cloud Hybrid Services, is
being well received by customers. Of course, on the Pivotal layer, we're taking an approach to be cloud-agnostic. So it's
obviously a trend; the cloud is going to be a big trend. We believe it will be both public/private, and winning is going to
be choice on hybrid clouds. We think we're well positioned and driving a lot of the change in this industry.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Within the storage business specifically, the service provider segment, people who are
putting up business-class clouds, obviously, at different service levels and in many cases different price points for
Amazon and the others is our fastest growing segment. We believe that customers are going to want a range of cloud
capabilities. There will be virtually a small handful of cloud players who choose to roll their own. But a lot of the
others, in fact the vast majority of players out there with time are going to want to partner with technology companies
for some or all of their stacks. So we're very encouraged by how quickly our part of our business is growing right now.

you give us any more detail about contribution to the overall business, the core business around service provider, and
how you think about things from a field perspective, the shift between an EMC rep selling a service provider service
versus selling the product directly on premise, and how you weigh that in the field?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure, Alex. Relative to the second question, for our partners who are part of our official
service provider program, different classes; we have them at silver, diamond, and then platinum. For partners who are
that program, we actually have our field incented to be essentially neutral, whether the equipment is sold on premises
or via an SP. So we have a program in place. Obviously, we need to know whether an SP has been selling. But if it's in
our partner program then the field is calm to be neutral, which is very important because we don't want to be competing

In terms of the SP business, as I mentioned, our fastest growing vertical again was over 40% growth in the quarter. It

Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay, thank you. You guys have very interesting products coming out on the flash side. I
thought XtremIO was going to be available in the third quarter, but I thought your comment this morning was that by
year end. I know it's out with directed availability. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about that. And also, the
server side, PCIe flash is also extremely interesting. Maybe you've also had some beta testing there. If you could give
us an update on both sides, that will be very helpful. Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Lou, certainly. The XtremSF, the server side flash, is actually shipping, and we've been
really pleased with how that has moved forward. What we're seeing right now from a use case point of view is much
more customers are using it in a caching environment than they are in a primary storage environment. But with the
addition of ScaleIO software providing some additional data services, we do see some additional opportunities opening
up for us in server storage, the primary storage world. But today, most of the PCIe, the XtremSF is being sold with our
storage arrays and is a turbocharged cache tier, which is adding a lot of value.
XtremIO, I don't think we've ever been specific. We've always said second half. I think people may have implied Q3,
but we've never actually given a hard date. What we are doing though, as you know, we have the directed availability
programs. Our customers can actually buy the product today and are buying, but we're basically not saying it can be
used in all use cases. We'll open it up that use case aperture later on in the year, and it will firmly be in this year when
we ship the product to GA. So it is actually in the market today. People can buy it, and expect that GA to happen in Q4.
So we're excited about that opportunity. I think the flash portfolio offers interesting additional markets for us. And
we're excited about that combination of XtremIO, ScaleIO, and the XtremSF flash capability.

<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. I just have a question on workload trends. You obviously address a broad range of
workloads with your portfolio. But are there any particular workloads that are seeing greater growth than others, and
are those shifts having any impact on your other products? I'm curious because in an ideal world, customers are buying
all the storage they need. But in reality, IT dollars are limited. So I'm just wondering what areas are seeing strength and
at the expense of what other areas. Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: This is Joe. If you take look at that matrix that David laid out, the high functionality, the high
performance, the lower functionality, the capacity, we're selling products in all those. I think it's more the timing of
announcements right now that has held us back. This VNXe – VNX2 launch that David alluded to this quarter is
important for us. It fills a gap that we had on that chart. David, do you want to...

<A - David I. Goulden>: Just think about how the products that navigate that chart. Obviously, at the high end,
Symmetrix is very much focused upon the transaction oriented marketplace, top right-hand corner. We're seeing growth
there, as we talked about. As Joe mentioned, VNXe will be – VNX2, sorry, will be a mid-tier, transaction oriented
platform for block and file, and we've not been growing there in the first half. We do expect to grow there in the second
half. We mentioned how well we're doing moving down to more and more of the scale-out in both Isilon and Atmos,
and we're seeing good growth in both of those platforms. We also mentioned that how on the BRS portfolio, that
showed good growth in the second quarter despite not really having the new line that comes to market that's actually
shipping now. Then you've got the performance tiers with flash.
So as Joe said in the first comment, one of the beauties of our portfolio and our strategy that I think it's absolutely
unique is we are the only storage vendor that can take that whole transaction workload chart and put best-of-breed
platforms across the entire portfolio. Then you tie that together with what we do with ViPR, and this is really why I
think customers are sitting up and taking notice that EMC is very different.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: That's great, thank you.
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you all for joining us today. In summary, we across the EMC federation strongly believe that our cloud, big data,
trusted IT strategies are right on, and they're being very well received by our customers and partners. Customers love
the fact that we're giving them choice. Over the next several months, we will launch a significant number of very
exciting and timely new products. We have a great team. We have that all-important momentum going for us. And
there's a lot of excitement in the company about our prospects to grow and take share in the second half of 2013 and
beyond. So again, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in EMC, and I wish you all the
best.
