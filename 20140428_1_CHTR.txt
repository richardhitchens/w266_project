[Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.
Stefan Anninger
Thanks, operator. Good morning and welcome to Charter's first quarter 2014 earnings call. This morning, we issued a
press release over PR Newswire at 6 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results. The presentation that accompanies this
call can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our Investor & News Center.
The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We will not review those risk factors
and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this
morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures
with similar titles used by other companies.
Please also note that on July 1, 2013, Charter completed its acquisition of Cablevision's Bresnan Broadband Holdings
and its subsidiaries, also known as Bresnan. Unless otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to on
this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012. Please also note that all
growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise
specified.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. And with that, I'll turn
the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Stefan. Obviously, we spent a fair amount of time earlier this morning discussing the transactions we've
agreed to with Comcast. On this call and including the Q&A, we would like to focus on Charter's performance and the
impact that our operating model's having in our business. And our first quarter results are noteworthy in their own right.
Nearly two years ago, we reorganized Charter. We assembled a new management team and put in a highly centralized
organizational structure in place that essentially changed every job in the company in terms of responsibilities, how we
measure performance, and in many cases, physical location. At the same time, we changed our product structure to
offer high-quality and competitive products, with pricing and packaging designed to drive new customer relationships
with more product and revenue per household. And we fundamentally restructured the way we sell into the
marketplace.
We have seen positive effects from our operating strategy for at least a year now with faster customer relationship
growth, higher Triple Play selling, lower service call rates, and longer customer lives. It is still early, but Charter has
become a highly competitive service provider. We are winning market share across all our products including video.
Our customer satisfaction levels have increased substantially, and our employees take increasing pride in the quality
product and services we provide.
As you can see in today's release, our customers see the difference, which translates into strong financial performance
as we improve the fundamental blocking and tackling in a high-volume transaction services environment. We're also
positioning our current product set to further distance ourselves from the competition. Before I get into that, a few
comments on the first quarter.
Total customer residential relationships grew by 112,000 versus 61,000 last year, an improvement of over 80%. And
over the last 12 months, our residential customer base has grown by 4.1%, while revenue per household grew by 2.8%.
Residential sales activity improved again this quarter, growing 11% year-over-year, a function of how we put our
products together and go to market. Triple Play selling to new video customers in our legacy systems was 57%, up
from 48% one year ago.
We also continued to see improving levels of unique customer churn, resulting from improved service delivery and
higher customer satisfaction. In the first quarter, we added 206,000 residential PSUs versus 140,000 a year ago, and
each of our PSU categories grew this quarter, including video. Over the last 12 months, our expanded video customer
base has grown by over 30,000 customers.
Our improving video product is enabling us to take back meaningful multi-channel video market share from
competitors. We'll continue to grow market share through our service, operations, and our superior product suite under
the new Charter Spectrum brand.
Compared to last year, revenue grew 7.5% year-over-year, and residential revenue grew to 6.5%, 50% faster than one
year ago. Commercial also continued to be strong with 20% growth. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.3% year-over-year,

a significant uplift from top-line growth and service investments.
Looking beyond a single quarter, a few words on our product set service operations. We're currently at 40% of our
all-digital initiative, and we continue to target completion by year-end. Over the last six weeks, we began introducing
our new product suite, Charter Spectrum, in a number of markets that we've already taken all-digital, including Dallas,
Fort Worth, and Greenville, South Carolina.
Customers inside these markets now have access to over 200 HD channels, with digital pictures, an interactive
programming guide and full Video On Demand capability on every single TV outlet; minimum Internet speeds of 60
megabits for new and migrated Internet customers; and at some markets, like St. Louis, our minimum speed will be 100
megabits and a fully featured voice product, all at highly competitive prices. We're offering superior products at
superior price points, whether on promotion or at full price.
Moving to all analog content, encrypting the signals and placing a two-way box on every outlet in the footprint, brings
significant long-term benefits, but it also is a highly disruptive operational process. We have a solid plan in place, and
it's going very well. In fact, we continue to see a positive impact on our customer growth performance in all digital
markets. And each customer in our new pricing and packaging structure will receive the Spectrum product suite when
the market goes all-digital.
So we're selling more but we're also creating longer-lived customers. We're doing that with superior products and better
service. Our outdoor plan is now in good shape through our investments in call center infrastructure including
increasing the in-sourced workforce and improvement tools. We are seeing fewer calls per customer, faster time to
resolution, and higher customer satisfaction ratings through our post-call survey process. As a result, we're reducing
transaction cost per customer. We also offer better service inside the home as we in-source higher levels of our
workforce, improve their training, and give them the right tools to do their job and maintain a higher focus on
craftsmanship. All of which has led to significantly higher levels of customer satisfaction, fewer transactions, and a
better return on our growth investments.
We continue to move forward with our cloud-based user interface development. Our new guide has been designed to
run on every set-top box we have in the field, offering advanced video navigation to all outlets. It has a consistent user
experience on all screens, and we've been testing the guide in employee homes, and it has worked as designed. We
expect to expand the guide deployment to customer homes in certain markets by the middle of this year to ensure it
scales. We also continue to develop the Charter TV app with more live feeds, video-on-demand content, and other
features in the coming months.
During the first quarter, Charter also independently certified its new WiFi router as providing the fastest wireless
service in the country compared to any competitor. We'll be launching this next-generation router to customers
beginning this quarter.
So over the last 24 months, we've transformed Charter into a company that offers superior service and value across
each of its core product lines of video, Internet and voice. This quarter's results indicate that if we execute properly, our
strategy will win us additional customers and market share, including video, leading to better EBITDA per home
passed and free cash flow for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide more details on the quarter.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. As a reminder, unless otherwise stated, the results we're discussing and showing in today's slides are
presented on a pro forma basis as if we had acquired Bresnan on January 1, 2012. Our first quarter operating and
financial results clearly demonstrate that our business is performing well and as expected. Turning to Slide 4 of today's
presentation, residential PSU net adds grew by nearly 50%, and commercial net adds were also up. We gained 18,000
residential video customers during the first quarter versus a loss of 25,000 last year, a 43,000 improvement.

Our first-quarter residential video customer net adds included approximately 16,000 bulk digital upgrades. These are
existing Charter residential video customers in bulk sales arrangements that haven't had a set-top box or direct-billing
relationship with Charter in the past. As we transition to all-digital, these customers become included in our residential
video customer count. We've provided data in today's trending schedule that shows the impact of listed bulk digital
upgrades on our quarterly video customer net adds.
Excluding the impact of 16,000 bulk digital upgrades in the first quarter and 5,000 last year, we gained 2,000 regular
residential video customers this quarter as compared to a loss of 30,000 on a similar basis during the first quarter last
year. In Internet, we added 136,000 residential customers versus107,000 during the first quarter last year. And we
added 52,000 residential voice customers versus 58,000 last year.
Though our residential base grew by 4.1%, revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.8% year-over-year, driven by
higher product sell-in, rate adjustments including returns and box fees, and higher average dollar step-ups and better
retention and promotional roll-off for customers that we acquired approximately 12 months ago inside of our new
pricing and packaging.
At the end of the first quarter, 75% of our customer base outside of Bresnan was in our new pricing and packaging.
And as Slide 6 shows, our accelerating customer growth combined with our continued ARPU growth, resulted in
residential revenue growth of 6.5% year-over-year. That compares to 1.3% just two years ago.
Looking at Commercial, we added 14,000 PSUs versus 7,000 last year. Commercial revenue grew by 20%, driven
primarily by small business. And excluding the lower-growth video base, commercial revenue grew by 24.5%.
Turning to expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. Programming expense grew by $60 million, accounting for
about 60% of the total increase in operating expense versus the prior-year quarter. Programming costs grew by 11% on
an absolute basis, including 1% expanded video customer growth. The expense growth was consistent with our
expectations and driven by contractual rate increases, including a couple of large renewals, as well as the mix shift in
expanded basic customers over the last 12 months and the lack of video losses generally.
Costs to service customers, which includes field operations, network operations and customer care costs, was flat
year-over-year, as our deferred maintenance program is now complete, and we start to see the benefits of in-sourcing
investment in lower transactions. On a market-by-market basis, as we go all-digital, we see higher activity in the
transition month, but in general, we're reducing transaction costs per dollar of revenue that we generate.
Marketing spend increased by $14 million, up 12% year-over-year, given continued sales channel development and
consistent with the higher sales activity. Other costs grew by $24 million or 15% year-over-year, driven by higher labor
costs to support commercial revenue, as well as some corporate expense. In total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $52
million or 7.3% year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 8, first-quarter capital expenditures totaled $539 million. About 60% of that spend was driven by CPE,
to support our all-digital initiative, and new customer acquisition. Specifically, $119 million of our CapEx was
dedicated to our all-digital initiative, with most of that spend inside CPE. We also spent $59 million on commercial
CapEx, a figure excluded in the all-digital spend for commercial properties.
For the full year 2014, we continue to expect approximately $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Let me put that spend
in perspective. If you take $2.2 billion and deduct the $400 million one-time all-digital spend which makes us more
competitive, it has discreet revenue attached to it, and then you deduct the $100 million of in-sourcing capital
mentioned on our last call, you're left with about $1.7 billion of spend.
If you then took 2013 capital expenditure for our commercial business, about $300 million last year, and just used that
as a proxy, we are now down to about $1.4 billion of capital expenditure for our residential business with an expected
high growth rate. So we're very comfortable with our level of spend relative to our current growth rates and one-time
all-digital.
We generated $74 million of free cash flow in the quarter, combined – compared to $118 million during the same
period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our prior capital spending, and timing and cash paid for interest

partially offset by our higher adjusted EBITDA, with working capital benefit from the timing of CapEx payments.
We ended the quarter with $14 billion of net debt and our leverage ratio fell to 4.7x on an LTM basis, just above our
target leverage ratio of 4 to 4.5x. Our weighted average volume cost remains 5.6%, and as Slide 10 shows, the
weighted average life of our debt is now 7.2 years, with over 95% of that debt maturing beyond 2016. We finished the
quarter with $1.2 billion of available liquidity.
Turning to Slide 11, our tax assets continue to offer significant value, and as I mentioned on the fourth quarter call,
they've actually grown not only from last year's Bresnan acquisition, but we also liquidated one of our tax partnerships,
resulting in the step-up of our tax basis into approximately $400 million in freed-ups and NOL. As a result, absent
M&A, including what we discussed this morning, we do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer until after 2018, a
full year later than our previously disclosed estimate. Today's transactions that we announced are expected to accelerate
that utilization and the present value of our significant tax assets.
As we look towards the balance of the year, we will remain well-positioned to continue to execute on our operating
plan. We also have a lot of lifting in front of us to close and implement the transactions we announced with Comcast
this morning. But as Tom mentioned at the outset, we'd like to focus our Q&A here on Charter's first quarter operating
and financial results, and we will refrain from replicating the call that we had earlier today.
So, on that happy note, we'll hand it over to the operator and open it up for Q&A, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. I'll refrain from asking about the transaction, although it's going to
be tough. Tom, obviously, the second quarter is seasonally weak for you all, but do you believe we're near the point in
your markets where you can sustainably begin growing your video sub base as you take back share from satellite? And
I have a follow-up.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I guess, I'm not going to forecast our video growth for the rest of the year since we
haven't given guidance on it, but as a general proposition, yes, but there is seasonality in our numbers. And we're
growing, but we're not growing that fast yet. But our momentum is good. And so I have expectations that we can grow
our video business on a year-over-year basis and – but with the recognition that there is still seasonality inside of our
business.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Thanks. And then both AT&T and Verizon had very weak first quarter results especially
relative to you all and Comcast. Both have noted that they are going to get materially more aggressive to try to
reaccelerate their growth. Has your competitive intensity changed recently? And any other color you can give us on
trends in the second quarter would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I haven't – I can't describe the market as different. It's a highly competitive marketplace,
and there are a variety of competitors in it who are offering different promotions at different points in time. But we
think in aggregate that we have a very good product that stands up competitively and that our service operation and our
sales function puts us in a pretty strong competitive posture. And we think that gives the ability to grow.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with International Strategy & Investment Group. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thanks. Looks like this is like the first quarter we've seen where we start to see a little operating
leverage. Can you sort of give us some direction? Is this the new path? I mean, have we sort of annualized or
calendarized the step-ups in costs, and this is the run rate? Obviously marketing costs were higher, but cost of servicing
customers have seemed to sort of normalize.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi, Vijay. It's Chris. And with that, I think it may be the first time that you're seeing
it, but we've been seeing it for quite some time. If you take a look at the amount of growth rate that we've had
increasing for several quarters now, that drives additional one-time expenditure for that relative amount of
year-over-year growth, and marketing and sales, reconnects, all that type of activity, all of which is an investment that
we're happy make happen. So it's not just in CapEx; it's in OpEx as well.
We've been describing that that's what's been taking place these past several quarters as we continue to have higher
growth. We still have higher growth this quarter, but all of that builds momentum inside the P&L. And yes, if you just
look simplistically at the face of it, we're starting to see that benefit. There weren't any strange one-time events taking
place inside of Q1 this year.
So I think it's very representative of what we've been doing for a long period of time. But it's also representing in the
same areas, a step-up in growth rates in the expenditure to drive that. So I think the underlying EBITDA, as I
mentioned on the last call, is significantly stronger than even what we show, given the amount of growth that we're
investing in.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: And if I could just follow up. Programming costs per sub seemed like 13%. Is that sort of a
low-double digit number we should think about for the year or was there some timing on some costs?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I'm not exactly sure if you're looking at perhaps too simplistically. Programming costs
year-over-year were up by 11%, but standard basic customer relationships were up by 1%, which means that rate-based
increase in programming costs grew 10%, which is consistent with what we said that we would expect for 2014 to look
somewhat similar to our peers and competitors, the key difference being that we're growing. And if you're growing
you're not only to have rate – there's an increase, then you'll have volume increase. That's something that we should be
all happy about.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Next?
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks very much. Just to follow up quickly on Jeff's question. It looks like your flow share
this quarter must've – against AT&T and Verizon, has improved quite nicely from last quarter. And I'm just wondering
if you could give us a little bit more context on what the shift was from last quarter to this quarter that drove better –
more effective share gains? Was it just the accumulation of all the things that you've been doing in terms of improving
the systems and customer care and the programming packages and the pricing that also showed up more definitively in
one quarter or were there some other specific issues that you can point to?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Jonathan, I think that our competitive posture and our improvement and the ability to sell
has been not a quarter-to-quarter kind of outcome but the result of a consistent approach to the marketplace that has
been building for quite some time. And the results of improved satisfaction, reduced churn, less transactions per
customer, translate into financial performance as you move down the road.

And so the financial performance actually lags the operating performance. And we've been seeing the operating
improvements for quite some time. In terms of flow share, the only thing I would say is that the number of phone
customers who have video inside of our footprint is a fairly small number. The vast majority of the video customers
that we – that are competitive to us inside our footprint are provided by satellite companies.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just a question for Mr. Rutledge. You guys have talked a lot about the number of
changes, the wide array of changes you have made. But I was wondering within your footprint, if you look at the 40%
that you said that's all digital, are those – is that portion of your footprint demonstrably different in terms of the
operational or financial results versus the 60% that is yet to go all-digital? Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: It's different, but not hugely different. And the reason it's not hugely different is, most of
it is relatively recently transformed from the current operating model to an all-digital model. And so yes, we're getting
better results inside the all-digital footprint in terms of growth, but it's relatively recent. And we're getting growth
across the entire footprint.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. A question on CapEx for Tom and Chris. Tom, you said that your new IP guide will be
available on all outlets. As far as I know, that's the first time you've formally committed to that. Does that change your
long-term CapEx expectations for the number of IP-enabled set-top boxes you might otherwise have needed? Chris, if I
take your numbers for the $1.4 billion normalized, that's about a 15%, 16% CapEx-to-sales ratio. How low could that
get? Or is that kind of the long-term run rate?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So let me take the first part of that, Craig. First of all, the idea is that every outlet that
Charter has in its all-digital footprint has a two-way interactive set-top box on it capable of Video On Demand and
other interactive functions. All the new boxes we're buying have DOCSIS modems in them and can display an
IP-based, cloud-based guide.
We're also working, though, on a backwardly compatible technology using ActiveVideo and other software from other
companies like Zodiac and others that allows the already-deployed MPEG boxes that don't have DOCSIS modems in
them to have an interactive cloud-based guide using the MPEG platform. And that's what we're testing, and if that
works, the way we hope it does and the way so far the tests indicate it will, we'll be able to put that user interface on all
boxes without having to buy new boxes.
So, Chris?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So the second question was around capital intensity and, look, we've consistently said
there's nothing structurally different at Charter that will drive the different capital intensity measured as a percentage of
revenue. Other than all-digital, the in-sourcing activities that we're doing this year which is why we've split this out and
separated them, the difference, I think, between the percentage that you'd listed and there were some others have gotten
to is growth.
So the answer to your question is that we can go a lot lower, but I don't think we want to because it would mean that we
weren't growing. And if we're going to be acquiring additional customers, Triple Play customers versus dilution cost

and CPE and all of that and the revenue had attached to it is very good ROI. But absent that growth, yes, you could see
it go lower, but it's not the goal.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: But as a general proposition, capital intensity is coming down for other factors like the
cost of set-up boxes. And we've continued to make improvements in our ability to buy boxes. We have a downloadable
security system that we've developed. We're buying integrated boxes currently. And as a result of that, both the volume
and the technology platform that we're deploying, our cost per digitally deployed box is going down.

<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi. Just wanted to ask on the in-sourcing effort, Chris. Can you just talk about how that
impacts the P&L and sort of when you're absorbing the cost and when you'll start to see leverage from that, and also in
which category or categories is the CapEx related to that effort being recorded? And also wanted to see if I could ask
one other one on churn. Just wondering if you can quantify, even if it's just in rough percentage terms, just how much
you've been able to bring the churn down since you started the turnaround effort? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So the two questions you had on in-sourcing, one is the P&L impact. We've been
in-sourcing gradually for a long period of time, really, since Q3 2012. And the net effect of that as you're increasing
your cost from the P&L perspective is you have higher cost labor, but the offset to that is over time, you reduce the
number of transactions per customers which means that you can have an expensive phone call but have less of them
and have less cost inside of your P&L. And that takes time to build up capabilities and to have it swing from an
investment to neutral, which is kind of where we're at today to turn it into a benefit which is where we'd like to go over
time.
The same exists – the same philosophy exists as it relates to field operations and physical labor. And that's been taking
place similarly since late 2012. Both of those categories as the major categories you asked about have increased the
amount of in-house labor activity that's being used as it goes to offshore or outsourced labor.
And so you can take a look in Q1 P&L, the cost to serve includes field operations, network operations and customer
care, and that's the primary area that you would see the year-over-year flat, despite the fact that we've had substantial
customer and revenue growth. And that shows that the underlying cost to serve is getting the operating leverage despite
the ongoing investments that we're making to continue to in-source.
In CapEx, it's fleet, tools, techs, trucks, equipment and real estate to help those people, and it's all inside the support
line inside of CapEx. And you'll see some chunkiness, for lack of a better word, as you go along as to how trucks are
ordered and how buildings are built, and those type of things. But it's that category that's incurring those $5 million of
spend, so that's on that.
In churn reduction, we don't publish our churn number consistent with our peers, but it's safe to say that month to
month, it varies anywhere from high-single digits to double-digit improvement in terms of churn reduction
year-over-year. We get, as you would expect, blips in market by market as we go all-digital. So really, we're not talking
about that. I'm talking about the normalized effect absent the one-time impact of taking the market all-digital, which is
then offset by higher sales and growth coming out the other side.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Thanks very much, Chris.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Thanks. I have a question on pricing. Can you just lay out the roadmap for ARPU growth? At what
point will ARPU exceed volume growth? And as you roll out Spectrum and all-digital, are you seeing upselling with
your customer base? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: When will pricing growth exceed volume growth? Is that – that's the fundamental
question you're asking?
<Q - Amy Yong>: Yes.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I hope it's a long way away. So I don't think we want to forecast that, but our objective
fundamentally is to create customer relationships with superior competitive products. And you can see already that
we're growing relationships on an annual rate of over 4%, and our actual volume growth is substantially less than that
from an ARPU perspective. And we like it that way. That's a market-share driven strategy.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Amy, your second question was on Spectrum. It's just been introduced. So it's far too
early to really comment or speculate or even measure. So we'll look forward to talking about it generally in the future,
but there's no data as of yet.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. I have two. Chris, on the ARPU front, I think last quarter you talked
about some modest headwinds from migrations of more price-sensitive customers. But I didn't know if that was
material to the Q1 ARPU result, if you could help us think about that. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: The same trend exists. And so as I mentioned at the time, we have the bar bells of
transactions, one is the ARPU that you're acquiring at, and the other one is that once the ARPU of those customers are
disconnecting, that the vast majority of the transactions are taking place in the middle, which is upgrades, downgrades
and migrations. And we've had a lot of that, and I wouldn't try to read too much into one particular quarter's movement
in those middle categories.
The key point is that more of our customers are new pricing and packaging. They have a better product. They have a
better service. They are more competitive relative to other offers, and they'll be longer-lived. So even if it costs us $1 or
$2 for those migrations, particularly in a quarter, you're much better off and that was the point that we were making last
quarter. Some of those trends still continue. So we're now at 75% excluding Bresnan, which starts slow, and that should
benefit us both from churn as well as stabilizing that impact of ARPU over time.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Got it. That's what I was thinking. Okay. And then, Tom, kind of have a
bigger-picture question around over-the-top video in the context of what a lot of people are speculating DISH may do,
and you compete with DISH obviously quite a bit on the video side, but if they launch sort of this $30 skinny video
over-the-top bundle that the Disney contract suggests they might, I'm curious from a Charter perspective how you see
that product versus what you offer. Is there a competitive response you think at the lower end of the market that you
need to do?
And then as an ISP, which this product would be great for your broadband business given how much traffic it would
drive, how do you feel about the position of the ISP in the context of net neutrality and all the sort of buzz around ISP
interconnect, all that stuff if you have a service coming over the top of your own network that drives a ton of capacity
since it's a linear video service? So, know it's a lot, but I was curious. Love to get your thoughts on how you think about

those things.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Okay. It is a lot. First of all, I don't know what DISH is going to do, but my
understanding of their agreement with Disney is that it's contingent on other services being available, and they may or
may not be. And I believe that we have similar opportunities to do the same kind of services with Disney that DISH
has. And with regard to over-the-top, in general, I think on the use of our network, that's a general issue. But we
support net neutrality as a company. And we are able to use our network and its expanding capabilities to make our
Internet service valuable to customers.
And our general view is that while the video business may change through time and products may come in the
traditional cable service, and they may come from on-demand providers and service providers like Netflix and
potentially DISH or anyone else, who – we're comfortable with that. And the fact that we have a better ISP, we think,
for a variety of reasons including our plan capabilities and our service offering and our price. And think that there's an
opportunity to grow our business however the video business evolves.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Denis E. Kelleher>: Hi. This is Denis Kelleher in for James. Two, if I could. First, if you could give us a sense
for subscriber trends in the 40% of your footprint that is now digital? Are you taking share here? And is there any way
to quantify the effect of that on your video net add performance this quarter? And secondly, just any color around the
ARPU pickup you saw on telephony? Thanks very much.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So look, we're not going to get into market-by-market specifics, but we've said that in
all markets, performance has improved year-over-year whether it's gone all-digital or not, in that the performance is
even better, where we have gone all-digital despite the disruption that Tom talked about at the point of transition. So we
think it's all positive.
Your second question is related to, what, telephony ARPU?
<Q - Denis E. Kelleher>: Yes. Just the pickup in growth you saw this quarter.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: In growth in telephony ARPU?
<Q - Denis E. Kelleher>: That's right.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Okay. We're selling a Triple Play package. And so, in some sense, telephony – one,
we don't report telephony ARPU. And so that's going to be pretty telling what we think of that because we're selling a
Triple Play package. And depending on how you allocate the balance sheet and talk about growth in telephony ARPU
or the decline in telephony ARPU, in some sense, it's irrelevant because it's just how we sell that product. It's an
infinitesimally small portion of our base that actually takes telephony on a stand-alone basis, and so it's almost
irrelevant.
I think the right way to think about the business, look at residential customer ARPU, and just the trends and how's that
developing, what's the overall penetration by bundle.
<Q - Denis E. Kelleher>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Thanks.
