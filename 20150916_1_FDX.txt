Frederick Wallace Smith
Good morning and welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. FedEx Corporation is
performing solidly given somewhat weaker than expected global economic conditions especially in manufacturing and
global trade. Our profit improvement plan is on track and delivering expressive – impressive results. Well done to the
Express team. FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight have several anomalies in the first quarter, which will be discussed by
Alan Graf and the OpCo CEOs during their presentations. Overall, FedEx service levels are excellent, our culture
remains strong and our balance sheet is solid.
We remain confident FedEx is well positioned to deliver long-term value for our customers, shareowners and team
members in FY 2016 and beyond. As we've said in the past and reiterate today, we are confident we can continue to
increase margins, earnings per share, cash flow and returns on invested capital in the years to come.
Now, I will turn the program over to Mike Glenn that will talk about the economic outlook and he will be followed by
Alan Graf in his comments on the quarter.
T. Michael Glenn
Thanks, Fred. I will open with our economic outlook and then discuss our yield in each segment along with the pricing
actions that we announced yesterday.
We see moderate economic growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.5% for calendar 2015 and 2.8%
for calendar 2016, led by gains in consumer spending in the near-term. We expect industrial production growth of 1.6%
in calendar 2015 and 2.6% next year. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar 2015 and 2.9% for calendar
2016.
The IP forecast of 1.6% of calendar 2015 is 60 basis points below our June estimate. Weather, port closures, lower oil
CapEx and weak export from the strong dollar slowed production early in the year due to the strong imports we saw
and inventory buildup in the first half of calendar 2015 which will be a drag on IP in the near-term.
Now, let me make a couple of comments on the company's yield performance in each segment. In the domestic Express
sector excluding the impact of fuel year-over-year yield per package grew 2.4% primarily due to rate and discounts.
Excluding the impact of fuel and comparing the year-over-year yield on a gross basis for SmartPost, Ground yield per

package including SmartPost increased 5.5%, driven primarily by changes in dimensional weight rating, extra services
and SmartPost customer mix. In the international Export segment excluding fuel, International Export Express package
yield decreased 1.3% primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange rates which outweighed the positive impact
of weight, rate and discount changes. If you exclude fuel and exchange rate impact, IP base yield was up 4% and IE
yield was up 4%. In the Freight segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 3.3%
year-over-year primarily driven by rate and discount and shipment class.
As we announced yesterday, we'll be raising rates at FedEx Express, Ground and Freight by an average of 4.9% on
January, the 4th of 2016. In addition to the rate changes, FedEx is also increasing surcharges for unauthorized packages
and the FedEx Ground network that exceed the size and weight limits as outlined in the FedEx Service Guide and we're
also updating certain fuel surcharge tables at FedEx Express and Ground effective November, the 2nd of 2015.
We're also well prepared for what we expect to be another record peak holiday season, and I'll note that we're not
slowing or adjusting our service commitments heading into peak. We've been closely working with our customers all
year to understand their peak shipping needs and we stand ready to deliver. We expect to add more than 55,000
seasonal positions throughout the network to help the holidays arrive this year. Based upon our growth expectations
and network expansion, many of these seasonal workers will have an opportunity to continue working with us after the
holidays.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter EPS was $2.42 compared to an adjusted $2.12 last
year and we achieved a 9.3% operating margin. Our results increased due to significantly higher operating income at
Express, the star of our portfolio, the benefit of one additional operating day at all of our transportation segments and
the continued positive impacts from our profit improvement program. These factors were partially offset by higher
incentive compensation accruals, higher self-insurance and operating costs at Ground and lower than anticipated
volumes at Freight. The corporate net impact of fuel was also slightly negative year-over-year.
Looking at Express, revenues declined 4% in the first quarter due to the negative impact of lower fuel surcharges and
unfavorable currency exchange rates. Partially offset by U.S. domestic base yield and volume growth and international
export base yield growth, U.S. domestic average daily volumes increased 1% as both are deferred our overnight service
offerings grew. International Priority volume declined 5%, while International Economy grew 4%. Despite the lower
revenues, Express operating income increased 45% and operating margin grew 280 basis points year-over-year. The
increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher international export and U.S. domestic base yield growth,
the benefit from one additional operating day and lower international expenses due to currency exchange rates. Our
profit improvement initiatives for revenue quality and expense constraint are working and are on track.
Taking a quick look at TNT, the costs related to the pending acquisition of TNT Express were immaterial for the
quarter. We are making timely progress on the necessary regulatory steps required. We have started the planning for the
integration of TNT and Express after completion of the acquisition. This planning includes addressing the issues that
must be ready for day one implementation such as financial reporting, treasury, compliance and governance as well as
the planning for the longer-term aspects of the integration. Our integration plans currently assume that the acquisition
will close in the first half of calendar 2016.
Turning to Ground, revenues increased 29% due to the inclusion of GENCO revenue, Ground's yield and volume
growth and also the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. Regarding the
June 1 change in how we record SmartPost revenue, $240 million of the revenue increase year-over-year resulted from
reporting SmartPost on a gross basis. Average daily volume increased 4% primarily due to continued growth in our
Home Delivery service. Ground's first quarter operating margin was 4.4 percentage points lower, primarily due to
increased self-insurance reserves, which was 1.7% impact, the inclusion of GENCO results, which is a 1.3% impact,
and a change in SmartPost revenue reporting, which is a 1.1% impact. Most of these are one-time in nature, although

the inclusion of the GENCO results will remain for the next 18 months to 24 months depressed due to the integration
costs.
Looking at Freight, operating results declined in the first quarter as salaries and employee benefits expense outpaced
lower than anticipated volume. Salaries and employee benefits increased 10% from pay initiatives and increased
staffing levels to handle higher than realized shipments. Looking at CapEx, our spending forecast for the fiscal year
remains at $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year this quarter primarily due to increased
spending to modernize aircraft at Express. Aircraft and related equipment purchases included delivery of five Boeing
767-300 freighters and one Boeing 777 freighter. We are continuing to invest in our Ground facilities more this year
than last as we expand the network and this will be our peak year for investment at Ground for the next several years.
At Freight, we are modernizing our truck fleet, adding new vehicles with many new safety features.
Now, turning to our outlook. Based on the economic environment that Mike talked about, we project adjusted earnings
to be $10.40 to $10.90 per diluted share for FY 2016 before year-end mark to market pension accounting adjustments,
driven by continued improvement in base pricing, volume growth and benefits from our profit improvement program. I
should note although we are trimming our outlook from June slightly, we still are looking at the midpoint of the range
being 19% higher than what we achieved last year in terms of earnings per share. Our new FY 2016 outlook is
modestly lower than our initial forecast due primarily to higher than expected self-insurance reserves and operating
costs at FedEx Ground and lower than planned volumes and yields at Freight. We still expect strong earnings growth
this year and we remain focused on executing our profit improvement program, leveraging the e-commerce growth and
enhancing our revenue quality.
Our expectations for earnings growth in the second quarter and the remainder of FY 2016 are dependent on key
external factors, including fuel prices and the pace of growth in the global economy, particularly in U.S. industrial
production, as Mike discussed. This outlook does not include any operating results nor integration planning and
acquisition related expenses for TNT Express for quarters two through four. As of August 31, 2015, we have 11.1
million shares remaining for repurchase under our current authorization and we plan to continue buying back shares.
At this point, I'm going to turn the program over to Dave Bronczek, who has the first question from Art Hatfield.
Q&A
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Alan. And this question is from Art Hatfield, Raymond James. With all the
discussion about perceived or real slowdown in China for some time now, in recent news from the Chinese finance
minister that the new normal of 7% GDP growth may last four years to five years, I was hoping to get your thoughts on
your trans-Pacific Express capacity going forward after last reducing flight frequency by two back in late fiscal 2013.
Thanks for the question, Art. Actually, our lanes are balanced around the world, and including the Pacific, and I think
your question, if you can go back and look at several quarters ago, we've actually adjusted our network two quarters
ago on the Pacific. So it actually wasn't the last time we did it in 2013. So right now, we're very pleased with how our
capacity fits for the volumes in the Asia-Pacific network and around the world. A lot of the traffic that we are handling
now in FTN is also benefiting at FedEx Express and our profit improvement. So to answer your question, we're very
happy with our balanced lanes and, of course, for FedEx Express, a lot of our business coming out of China are
multinational companies in the main.
<A - Mickey Foster>: At this time, we'll open the floor for questions.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On the LTL side, I wanted to get your
initial impressions of the recent M&A activity that we've seen and whether you see further consolidation or change in

industry dynamics.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Thanks, Allison. Just based on the recent activity, I would say that the market is right for that
but Con-way just was acquired by XPO. We understand what it takes to integrate a rather large acquisition like that so
we have to stay focused on our strategy and execute what we're doing and that's exactly what we'll do.
Operator
We'll go next to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Thanks for taking the question and congrats at the strong results over at Express. If I could
shift the discussion a little bit to Ground here, I understood the impact on the self-insurance reserve. It sounded like,
Alan, that was about 170 basis points. With regard to the margins, you had also called out in the press release, some
headwinds related to handling some kind of oversized traffic in the network. Can you give us a sense of how big a
headwind that was and how quickly you expect to be able to offset the higher costs associated with that traffic either
through the announcement yesterday about the increases there and perhaps an update related to any costs incurred for
the integration of SmartPost into the Ground as part of the planning to potentially increase economic profit looking
forward?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Rob, I'll start. This is Mike Glenn. I'll start with talking about oversized and unauthorized
packaging. The change that we announced yesterday targeted specifically unauthorized packages and those are
packages where the dimensions and/or weight exceed those as specified in the FedEx Service Guide. If you were to
look at one of these packages, you would more likely to expect it to travel in an LTL network. It is up to FedEx Ground
as to whether we accept these packages but we felt the change was needed in the price or the surcharge if we elected to
do so.
The second category is oversize packages and those are packages that have specifications that are within our current
service guide features of service but have happened to be longer or heavier than a typical package. Those carry a
separate surcharge. With the dramatic shift in e-commerce where more and more e-commerce companies are electing
to ship those packages through networks like ours rather than handle them in the store, we've seen an increase on those
types of packages. We are working with those individual customers that are driving that change. At least the ones that
are having the biggest impact and obviously we always look at pricing opportunities to mitigate that where needed.
So overall, we do an excellent job of handling those packages in our network but it's obviously something we'll
continue to monitor.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hey, Rob. This is Henry Maier. Thanks for the question. We announced on the last call that
we're merging SmartPost into Ground. I would remind everybody that that's a multiyear initiative that offers a number
of potential service and savings benefits. From a service perspective, we'll be able to maximize the use of both Ground
and SmartPost facilities to ensure superior service year round especially during peak. And additionally, the integrated
network will enable more efficient use of our network and line haul assets throughout the year.
We also announced the introduction of a new software program which will allow us to combine packages in the
SmartPost and Home Delivery networks destined to the same residential address on the same day. That makes a
significant difference in our operating expense going forward because of the operating expense of that incremental
package is significantly less than putting it into the postal network. So we are well down the path of implementing this,
but it's going to take a couple of years to integrate all the SmartPost hubs with Ground.

We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, thanks. Good morning. Yeah, two questions, I guess, on the Ground side. In terms of
the self-insurance accruals, how should we think about that lasting as we move throughout the fiscal 2016? I guess so
the question is when does that start to roll off and start to see sort of margin performance come through underneath
that? And then just also on GENCO, trying to understand, the 18 months to 24 months integration seems a bit longer, I
think, than the last time we talked about this, just want to get a rough sense will we see benefits of GENCO as we go
through the peak season this year or is there something we need to wait until fiscal 2017 to see some benefit from it?
Thanks.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Thanks, Chris. Well, first of all, on the self-insurance reserve, we believe we're
where we need to be right now. I think you have to understand on here that one of the drivers of that is our business is
growing, we drive more miles, we put more trucks on the road and there's an accrual based on the number of miles we
drive. It's also largely a backward looking event from an accounting standpoint. In terms of GENCO and I would say
GENCO has exceeded our expectations to date. We are well on track to get the integration implemented as quickly as
possible. There are a number of benefits that come with the GENCO acquisition, namely the ability to sell additional
value to customers. GENCO provides us with some capabilities that customers value highly and frankly FedEx doesn't
provide. So going through time that will certainly pay dividends. As Alan said, we expect this to be pretty much
concluded by the end of 18 months. I don't know what more color I can give than that.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hey, Chris, this is Alan, let me add a little bit to that. First of all, as you well know, the GENCO
business itself is very good but it is not a high-teens operating margin business. Just by definition that's going to lower
Ground segment's operating margin even after integration. That's number one and plus we intend to grow it, it's
performing much better than I had anticipated and we're very proud of what's happening, we're getting a lot of
cross-selling already, taking over a lot of the transportation that we didn't used to have from them. So it's very
beneficial, but again, it doesn't have the same margins as the high-teens that Ground has.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Great. Thanks very much for your time. I wanted to ask just to follow on with regard to that
SmartPost/Ground merger. I don't recall hearing a cost number. Will this merger actually impact cost and can you
quantify that to a certain extent for us?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, Tom, costs are going to be significantly lower. This was why we did it. I'm not willing
to put a range around that on this call. But as you can imagine, if we can combine up SmartPost package with the Home
Delivery package on the same day and deliver them on one vehicle instead of one being delivered on an HD vehicle
and the other being delivered through the postal service, there's fairly significant operating expense savings to that. In
addition, the ability to maximize the use of SmartPost assets and Ground assets particularly at peak provide us with
significant opportunities to reduce our operating expense going forward.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. In regards to peak and the opportunity
you said that that's kind of shaping up well and obviously even though the manufacturing and industrial side of the
economy feels a little bit weak, the consumer side feels a little bit stronger. Can you provide a little bit more color in
terms of some of your customer discussions heading into peak in terms of giving you the confidence of how that's
shaping up better in terms of having another record?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. The best indicator I can give you is the challenges that we have with
capacity management. We're working very closely with customers to make sure we understand their forecast where

necessary. We will have to put some caps in place as we have to do every year and we see nothing different in that
regard and customers are requesting more capacity, not less. So we view that as a good sign and that's why we think
we're well positioned for another record peak.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys, and thank you for the time. Alan, I just wanted to ask
you about the pilot contract if you don't mind. It looks like it's ratified a 10% increase this year and then through the
years increasing so that by 2020, it's a 17% increase over 2015 rates. So an A and a B, one, when do we hear from the
pilots about whether it's ratified; and two, are those cost increases included in your current guidance? And three, does it
address the Cadillac health plan costs that come into effect in 2017? Thanks. I guess you can call this one question.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: It's all related, Helane. We'll take it. I'll do the first part and I'll give it over to Chris Richards for
part two and if Dave wants to add, that's fine. We think it's a win-win contract. It is in our outlook for not just this year
but our strategic outlook that we always present to our board in the fall, where we, as you know, are expecting to
continue to grow our earnings, our cash flows and our returns. Nothing's changed in that regard. Also recall that one of
the key things that we're doing at Express is modernizing our fleet, and the productivity that we get from that
modernization is one of the key reasons that despite a significantly different economic outlook today than when we
talked about our profit improvement plan in October of 2012, you saw Express's results: an incredible increase in
earnings with a decline in revenue. That's only possible because of our cost management. So with that, let me turn it
over to Chris on the specifics and then Dave.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: I'll go ahead and comment real quickly, because Alan's right. In our outlook going forward
is the pilot contract, which we think is fair and balanced and very positive for the pilots, their families, for the
company, the shareholders. But it's very much inclusive of our results and our profit improvement now and going
forward. And of course, the new fleet helps significantly as well. Chris?
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Hello, Helane. It's Chris Richards. As you think about the pay increases included in the
contract, you need to keep in mind that our pilots have not had a pay increase since the agreement became amendable
two years ago. So that time period is included in this overall increase as well as the six-year term of the agreement once
it's ratified. So that total number needs to be considered in the context of that timeframe. With respect to the healthcare
benefits that are provided in the agreement, we've been very pleased that we were able to offer our pilots not only a
continuation of the health care plan they've had in place but two consumer-driven healthcare options, which are
identical to those which are provided to our other employees and have been found to be very attractive to those
employees at a lower out-of-pocket rate on a monthly basis than a high care option. So we're pleased and expect to see
the pilots take advantage of those plans.
On your question with respect to Cadillac tax, the agreement does specifically provide for a process should the Cadillac
tax become of impact during the term of this agreement. It does not provide that the company will pay some particular
portion of that but has a process that will be used between the company and the union should that come into play at the
appropriate time. Given the uncertainty in the sort of the approach on the Cadillac tax nationwide, I have to tell you, I
expect there to be a lot of conversations and a lot of discussion about what's actually going to happen before the tax
goes into effect in 2018 and this agreement specifically allows the flexibility for FedEx and the pilots to take advantage
of whatever benefit might come from those larger national discussions.

<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to ask another one on Ground. I understand
there's noise in the quarter but if I take a step back, we're not seeing the same kind of market share growth the past
couple quarters that we saw for a long time. And now again, I understand some one-time stuff but the margins are not
what people were hoping for. And I want to understand, has the competitive environment changed with either the UPS
or the post office? Or just the nature of the business with e-commerce, is that changing kind of the margin profile of
Ground and do we need to reset expectations here? Or maybe do you think that that's not right and we should get back
to margin expansion and real earnings growth of Ground next quarter or near-term?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Scott, this is Mike Glenn. I'll start and turn it over to Henry. Regarding growth, I think
overall we're generally pleased with the growth at FedEx Ground. It's essentially in line with our expectations. We have
seen a bit of a shift in terms of the type of growth, with more growth being driven by e-commerce. I should point out
that the industrial production forecasts that I noted earlier as well as the manufacturing indexes that have been
published, obviously, those are not great signals for the commercial side of Ground and Ground is impacted by those
numbers. So that's a contributor and we've also seen stronger growth coming from e-commerce. So we have seen a bit
of a mix shift, but overall growth, I would say, is essentially in line with our expectations.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Scott, let me address margins and let me also acknowledge up front that with all the moving
parts at Ground over the last couple of quarters, we haven't exactly made it very easy for you folks to do what you have
to do. So let me reinforce a couple of things. First of all, our business is changing rapidly. E-commerce is clearly
changing the dynamics of the industry and it's driving incredible growth. That's a good thing. I think we are best
positioned to benefit from an e-commerce economy. We make decisions at this company for the long-term. We don't
make them for the week. We don't make them for the month. We don't make them for the quarter and in some cases we
don't even make them for the year, but we look for long-term profitable sustainable growth.
And I believe we are focused on all the right things for today and the future. I think some of the noise you're seeing in
here is a number of one-time events but there are also costs in here that are reflective of higher employee expenses
year-over-year, mainly driven by higher annual incentive comp accruals. There are also higher operating expenses that
are driven by the network expansion we've been going through the last couple of years mainly in the form of higher
rents and depreciation. In terms of that, that's a fixed cost. Those should level out through time as these new facilities
come online and we bring volume on and fill them.
But I will tell you that nobody is more confident about the future of FedEx Ground than I am. I believe that we will
continue to gain market share, grow profitably and provide the fastest and most reliable service in the industry. And our
management team at Ground is committed to high-teens margins. We just have to get through some of these changes
we've made and we've made some significant ones but I'm confident we have a plan to do that.

We'll go next to Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I think FedEx is often thought of as a global economic
bellwether but the majority of your revenue and operating income really does get generated domestically with a lot of
that tied to the consumer. So just hoping maybe you can give us your thoughts just on consumer consumption as it
relates to peak and beyond. And how much of the business is really consumer versus industrial dependent perhaps by
segment? And then on the international side maybe some breakdown you can give us about the Asia and maybe China
exposure because I think that's a lot less than some people might think.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Kelly, this is Mike Glenn. I'll start talking about the consumer impact and then I'll turn it
over to Dave Bronczek to talk about China. I would first say that while e-commerce and specifically consumer related
transactions get the headlines these days, the bulk of our business is still business to business related on a global basis.
Residential deliveries certainly are increasing and are being driven in large part by e-commerce. Residential traffic now
represents about half of the volume in the network in the U.S. That's skewed a bit by SmartPost which is essentially all
residential delivery, so you kind of have to back that out. And the numbers in the Express and Ground network are

somewhat lower than that. But again, e-commerce is a growth driver, but the bulk of our business both in the U.S. and
around the world is still business-to-business. And I think it's important to remember that. And I'll turn it to Dave.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: That's right, Mike. And, Kelly, you're right, it is business-to-business for us. China is a big
marketplace for us, but it's multinational companies around the world and they're big accounts, big multinational
companies. So the impact for us is not very great, you're right. And that's why our yields actually went up across the
board and actually for all of international. So thanks for the question, Kelly.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Just looking at your commentary on the LTL slowdown, how
much worse do you see this market? Do you presume this is spreading to other parts of the business? I guess, I'm
asking do you see this as a leading or lagging part of the economy and within your business? And then also talk to your
profit weakness at Freight if this was company-specific or the industry.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, this is Mike Glenn again, I'll start out talking about the LTL and then I'll let Mike
Ducker have any comments that he might want to add. I think it's important to note that the LTL industry is very
closely tied to industrial production. So when you see a 60 basis point drop in our industrial production forecast, it's not
surprising that we would see an impact on volumes and I would say not only FedEx but the industry as a whole. I
certainly hope we've seen the worst of that and that we're looking certainly forward at a more positive outlook. I think
we've baked in what we've seen. So, I think that's a positive. I would also say in terms of it creeping into other
segments of the business, it certainly had some impact on commercial Ground as I noted in response to the last
question.
So those are the two areas that I think have been most impacted by the lower industrial production forecasts and the
manufacturing numbers that we've referenced today. We're quite confident going forward in our ability to achieve our
goals at FedEx Freight.
Our sales team is working very closely with the operations folks down at the local level and we've seen strong volume
growth in FedEx Freight in key segments like small and midsized businesses. It's also important to note that some of
the softness in the FedEx Freight segment was due to some pricing decisions that we made in head haul, lanes to
balance the network. So some of this, I would have to say, is self-induced and we did it for the right reasons and some
of this is obviously the IP forecast and related issues. So again, we're confident where we sit today in our ability to
deliver results going forward.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay. We have three questions from the Internet. We'll start with Henry.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. This question is from Rick Paterson at Topeka Capital Markets. How should we
interpret your comment that Ground investment will peak this year and then subside in the context of volumes? Do you
expect volume growth at Ground to further decelerate or stagnate going forward?
Well, my comment about peak investment or CapEx peaking this year really has nothing to do with volume, it has
everything to do with the fact that we made some decisions in the 2009, 2010 period with respect to adding capacity in
a very bad economy that put us in a position where we actually got a little bit behind on capacity with the growth in
e-commerce. We have three major hub projects that will come online in FY 2016 which is driving much of the peak in
CapEx. And I'd remind everybody on the call that 100% of our hubs are highly automated and we're moving to a
network footprint where more and more of our stations are fully automated too. So, this year, and I'd call it sort of
laughingly this is the pig in the python year in terms of these projects because it is almost unprecedented that we would
bring three major hubs online in the same year. In addition to that, we have a pretty big project list around automated
stations.

For the benefit of the folks on the call, we get some significant advantages out of automated stations. We are able to
load more points direct and bypass hubs, less handlings occur. When less handlings occur, obviously, we have lower
incidents of loss or damage. We reduced line haul expense because we are going point to point as opposed to going to a
hub and re-handling and reloading those packages. And we're going to be pretty close to 10% of the network stations
being automated by the end of FY 2016.
So, my comment about CapEx dropping 30% to 35% is more a recognition that after this year, we will be in a more
normal capital expenditure pattern. We will be ahead of the curve with respect to having network capacity to meet our
planned growth and we think going forward, we're in a pretty good place in terms of having our CapEx be a little bit
more predictable.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Okay. This is Dave Bronczek. The question came from Ben Hartford, Baird. To what
degree have you already had to take incremental cost reductions during FY 2016 to address the economic uncertainty in
Asia and other emerging markets in recent months, to ensure the Express profit improvement program remains on
track?
It's a great question. Our network around the world, our base powerful network we have in place is balanced around the
world. We adjusted our networks several quarters ago. So right now, we have a very flexible network that when the
volumes go up, we can add costs. When the volumes go down, we take out costs, which is why we've done so well in
our profit improvement program and a lot of the improvement has come from our international part of the business for
exactly that reason. So we're balanced. We've made these adjustments quarters ago in anticipation of this and so we are
in good shape.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Yes. The question from Ben Hartford at Baird, given the softer U.S. industrial production
environment, do you think a 10% plus Freight margin is attainable on a full year basis? If so, what is the pathway to
such a target?
Yes. Ben, we believe that a 10% plus Freight margin is attainable on a full year basis. As has been said in the press
release and some comments this morning, there were several issues in the quarter. First, we staff for a certain volume
level and those volumes were less than expected in what has typically been a pretty busy quarter. So staff size too large
for volume. We were impacted by two other areas on the volume side, some of the heavier shipments which migrated
from truckload to LTL when capacity tightened as a consequence of the West Coast port strike have migrated back to
truckload. There is still tight capacity in the LTL sector.
And then energy, the energy sector and many of our shippers in that sector have experienced traffic declines. We had
several one-time events that affected our quarter that should not be repeated and we see the pricing environment and
the overall market environment still rational.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Ben, I don't want you to interpret that as 10% is our goal at Freight. That is the absolute minimum
bottom of the range. We should have Freight margins in the teens.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thank you and good morning. Going back to a few questions ago, you were addressing
obviously at the lower economic forecast for IP domestically. Specifically to the Ground segment, could you address
how B2B trended throughout the quarter? And if in fact your tempering of the guidance range for the year can be
attributed beyond, say, LTL to the industrial portion of commercial Ground interaction on a go forward basis here in
the year? Thanks.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Scott, this is Mike. As you know, we report Ground as a segment. So I'm not going to get
into talking about specific growth rates and SmartPost versus home versus commercial but I will go back and say that
industrial production and manufacturing numbers have had an impact on commercial Ground traffic. So it's a little

below where we had hoped for, but overall traffic levels are fairly consistent with our expectations.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me just make one comment here. It seems to me that people
are sort of missing about the lower guidance. Had we not had the self-insurance reserve increase, we wouldn't have
adjusted the guidance down by 2% and we would have quote beat the quarter. Of course, we don't make quarterly
estimates, you folks do. So the whole thing about the quarter is one issue. That's the self-insurance reserve. All the rest
of the stuff is just noise and various issues inside the operating company. So it's important that you focus on that one
issue.
Operator
We'll go next to Tom Wadewitz with UBS.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Great. Thank you for the question. You've been asked a lot about the Ground margin, but it
seems to me like that that's a pretty important topic for the call today. I know you had the self-insurance and, Fred, you
just said that that's unusual but it's the second quarter in a row of that being unusual, and I don't – I mean, I guess you're
confident that there won't be a third. What about contractor issues? Maybe there's a lot of noise about contractors these
days, the labor market has tightened somewhat so potentially maybe your contractor costs were up, or are there other
factors in the broader cost drivers for Ground that we ought to be considering here that could affect the Ground margin?
And I guess related to that, when do you think we'll really see Ground operating income grow again? Because in
uncharacteristic fashion we just haven't seen strong Ground operating income growth for a while.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. Alan answered the first part of your question and
Henry answered the second part of the question. So we're not going to go over the Ground again.

We will take our next question from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.
<Q - Donald Allen Broughton>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you'd discuss
the balance of volume in the IP lanes. I know that with the decline in IP, you're seeing – I'm guessing with the decline
in IP, you're seeing the balance of volume in the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific deteriorate. If that's true – or is it
improving, given the strength of the dollar? If that's true, how much is the underlying improvement in Express margins
being understated as a result?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, the answer to your question is the trans-Pacific lanes are balanced. Trans-Atlantic,
actually, we're getting a lot more traffic out of Europe because of the currency. More than we anticipated and quite
frankly that's actually been positive for us. So I think around the world, Donald, that we are in very good shape. We
have a very flexible network now. We've moved the right traffic into the right networks, FTN doing a great job for us
as well and some of our other partners. So around the world, you're probably right, we have a lot of upside to the
Express profitability in the international part of the world.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Donald, this is Alan. As you know, our intercontinental business is by far our most profitable.
We've always had issues in Europe. We're solving that with the TNT Express acquisition. So we're pretty pleased with
where we are and where we're headed and can't wait to talk about TNT once we get it in the fold.

We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, good morning, everyone. And Fred, I don't think it's lost on folks here that

incrementals from here. I would just comment on that as well. But my question is really for Christine Richards. We've
seen this NLRB ruling on the Browning-Ferris Industries come out and apparently they're taking a more aggressive
stance on joint employment. As well as you've had a lot of disclosure around what's going on with your Kansas Ground
contractor case as well, which went to the Supreme Court and I guess the Seventh Circuit Federal Court in the MDL
has made some orders there too. So can you talk to both? And embedded to the NLRB, does it really have jurisdiction
over how you can define employee-employer relationships at the state level? Where does the federal versus state issue
come into play here?
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Well, I'll give it a go. The NLRB has jurisdiction over the tests that are applicable with
respect to when and how employees can choose to be represented by labor unions. And I have to say the recent actions
by the NLRB are of concern and should be of concern to every business in America, whether it's a large business or a
small business. The BFI decision, if it stands, will discourage companies from contracting with many small and
minority-owned businesses, and these are the businesses that are the very heart of the U.S. economy. Add to this the
NLRB challenge to the franchise model that is used by McDonald's and any number of other companies and has been
in place for decades, harms primarily the franchisees, those persons and companies that have bought businesses and are
operating them as a part of their plan to achieve the American dream.
These rulings will ultimately reduce the value of those franchises. I mean, franchising has been a successful model for
many small and minority-owned businesses for decades, and this action should be seen for what it is. It's an assault on
small businesses and basically on decades of valid contract law in the U.S.
Now that being said, the current NLRB decisions are not going to significantly have a direct impact on state law,
because as you know from following the issues not only with Ground but with other companies, the states individually
apply their tests with respect to certain statutes that they have in place. And as you note, we have been aggressively
working on our defense of the contractor model at Ground.
A couple of things, we are currently still engaged with the Seventh Circuit with the 19 remaining cases after they
rendered a decision on the Kansas case. We expect those cases to be briefed and determined individually as we go
forward. So we're looking at additional time and effort there. We also have had mixed results in some other
jurisdictions. The Eleventh Circuit, which took the appeal of the MDL decision, remanded that case for trial by jury on
the classification issue, and we expect to prove as we did in Washington state that the businesses that operate for FedEx
Ground are businesses and we're pleased to have the opportunity to do that.
On the other hand, we've had some recent good news in connection with a case pending in Massachusetts where the
First Circuit overturned another decision and found that the Federal Aviation Authorization Act preempted state
regulations with respect to the situation. And in fact, a decision that had been adverse to Ground has now been sent
back for entry of an order positive to Ground.
So two things. You should expect a continuation of our efforts as we defend the Ground operating process. And the
other thing you should expect is a real increase across the board in this country on joint employment challenges. And
the ramifications of holding one business responsible for the actions or inactions of another business with which they
have a contract are very broad. And I hope that rational minds will quickly conclude that this is not a fair interpretation
of the law, but I think you're going to see a lot more litigation in that area and the ramifications are way broader than
FedEx.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. Let me just make one broader point here. I think most
of the people on the call know this. All of the litigation that Christine was talking about is really in the rearview mirror.
I mean, we bought RPS years ago which was built on a very innovative model that gave people areas as an independent
contractor; you could build your business. I met with one the other day. It just did my heart good. He started off with
one truck. Now, he's got 23 trucks, so he's got a house and a lake house.
And we had to, in relation to the litigation and the state laws, which were essentially directed at contractors that were
performing work for builders that have created this lawsuit cottage industry here. And now, of course, it being reflected
in the Uber litigation and so forth. We moved years ago away from being able to give somebody that kind of an

opportunity. So that today, we only contract with incorporated businesses. We audit them to make sure that they are
paying their taxes and doing all of the things. And I think, unfortunately, it's eliminated a great opportunity for young
people to build the business. But, the litigation Chris is talking about has no relation whatsoever to the business model
that FedEx Ground has today.
So it's just managing these things. And we won this case at the MDL litigation and then it went back to California in
the Ninth Circuit, had an adverse ruling, and we settled the case and moved on. So it's important to recognize that the
litigation that you are talking about, not the NLRB ruling, is essentially a model that no longer exists at Ground.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. I've got an email question from Matt Troy from Nomura Securities
International. Given retailers' willingness to explore creative promotional activities, such as the shipping promotions
during the middle of the year, are you having conversations with larger retail customers about potential activities to
shift or smooth demand in and around the December peak holiday season?
The answer to the question is yes. I would say that many retailers are attempting to do that. That's why it's more
difficult to actually forecast what the peak day is going to be. It was fairly predictable in years past. I think based upon
our experience last year it's certainly more challenging in that regard. We're still dealing with capacity constraints in
our 7-day to 10-day period during peak season, we'll continue to work with retailers and e-tailers in an effort to try to
shift that demand but a lot of that is consumer driven and I think there is a recognition that it's going to have to occur at
some point over time simply due to capacity constraints. But like anything in this regard, it takes longer to implement
than you'd like to see.
Alan B. Graf
This is Alan. Before we sign off, I just felt compelled that I want to talk about Ground just for a second here. Don't get
confused between operating margin versus earnings and cash flow. So the SmartPost change to gross revenue is simply
math and that reduces long-term margins just because of the math because we have higher revenue with the same
amount of earnings. GENCO is a great addition for us in terms of operating earnings, operating profit and cash flow
generation, high ROIC but if business has a lower margin than the Ground business itself, that's also math. It reduces
the margin but it improves earning and cash flow. And as Fred mentioned, the self-insurance reserves, although we've
had two quarters in a row, we had a pretty bad month of May.
We don't expect that to repeat. We're improving our safety record at Ground and so it's a one-time hit that won't be
repeated. So you can look for us to continue to improve from where we are at Ground to rest of 2016 and beyond but
our margin position will be lower because of SmartPost and GENCO. Earnings and cash flows, however, will continue
to improve as we start to reap the benefits of these CapEx investments and productivity improvements and be able to
handle, take line haul miles out, go more direct and continue to improve our technology, we will be improving those.
Thank you.
