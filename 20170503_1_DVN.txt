Thank you, Scott, and welcome everyone. As you can see from our first quarter results, Devon's threefold strategy of
operating in North America's best resource plays, delivering superior execution and maintaining a high degree of
financial strength is working exceptionally well and generating top-tier results.
Our production of the quarter exceeded guidance expectations by a wide margin. Our margins and profitability
continued to expand as we transition to our higher margin product mix and capital programs continue to achieve
efficiency gains as we shift our focus towards full-field development in the STACK and Delaware Basin.
On the call today, I will focus my comments on three key messages. First, we remain very well positioned to accelerate
investment across our world class U.S. resource plays and deliver on our 2017 and 2018 growth targets. By the end of
this month, we will have 15 operated rigs running in the U.S., focused primarily within our top two franchise assets, the
STACK and Delaware Basin. As we progress through 2017, we are on pace to steadily ramp up drilling activity to as
many as 20 rigs by year-end, resulting in a $2 billion to $2.3 billion upstream capital program for the year.
Importantly, providing additional certainty to our accelerated investment plans are our attractive hedge position,
excellent liquidity position and innovative supply chain efforts. With our disciplined hedging strategy, we have
stabilized our cash flow stream by locking in more than 50% of Devon's estimated oil and gas production for the year at
or above market levels. We're also systematically accumulating additional hedges for 2018 and expect to protect the
price on at least half of our production in 2018. Coupled with our investment-grade ratings and $2.1 billion of cash on
hand, we have the financial capacity to execute on our business plan.
On the supply chain front, given the heightened competition for services and supplies in our core basins, we are taking
aggressive steps to ensure that we have the resources and capabilities to achieve our growth plans. With this proactive
work, we have successfully secured equipment, crews, materials and takeaway capacity at competitive prices and at the
bottom of the cycle. Additionally, to achieve the best results for LOE and capital dollars, we are mitigating inflation by
decoupling historically bundled high-margin services and are utilizing a much more diversified vendor universe base.
Also adding to our savings are the continued efficiency gains we are achieving across our early stage development
plays, where the majority of our capital is invested. As we shift to full-field development in the STACK and Delaware
Basin, these efficiency gains will only ratchet higher. As a result of these strategic supply chain initiatives and
operational efficiencies, we have completely offset inflationary pressures through the first part of the year.
Overall, when you combine our financial strength and our innovative supply chain initiatives with the prospects of our
top-tier STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we are highly competent in our ability to deliver the value and returns
associated with our growth plans over the next few years.
The second key takeaway is that we are building momentum across our U.S. resource plays as we head to full-field
development. As we have talked about at length over the past several months, we expect 2017 to be a breakout year for
our Delaware Basin asset as we concentrate our activity in the economic core of the basin within southeastern Mexico.
In fact, the initial well results from our development program in the first quarter were truly fantastic. Our first operated
Wolfcamp well in the Rattlesnake area achieved the highest production rate of any well Devon has brought online in
the Delaware Basin to date, with 30-day rates reaching 3,000 BOE per day. We also tied in three high rate Bone Spring
development wells during the quarter with production rates that exceeded our type curve expectations by 30%.
In addition to our high-rate well activity for the quarter, our shift to full-field development in the Delaware Basin is
now underway. We just completed drilling our first multi-zone development, targeting three Leonard Shale intervals,
and we have as many as four more multi-zone projects lined up to begin in the Delaware over the coming year. This
development approach is expected to have several advantages that will drive higher returns compared to traditional pad
development work, including improving rig and frac crew mobilization times, leveraging surface facilities across
multiple drilling units, increasing per section recovery potential with improved planning, maximizing net present value
with flexibility to add or defer development zones and more efficient permitting process on federal lands. Additionally,
to maintain similar cycle times to traditional pad drilling, we plan to deploy concentrated development and completion
activity across these larger developments.

To position ourselves to accelerate activity across the Delaware Basin and 2018 and beyond, we have recently
submitted four master development plans to the Bureau of Land Management designed to accommodate up to 600
permits. In fact, we just received notification of approval for our first master development plan at the Cotton Draw and
expect the other three plans to be approved by year-end. This innovative permitting strategy will allow us to accelerate
our multi-zone development activity, maximizing returns and per section recoveries from our world class acreage.
In the Oklahoma STACK play, our capital activity also delivered outstanding well productivity. With the Woodford
development program, we have now brought online the majority of the 39-well Hobson Row, with results from this
high-impact row tracking at or above our EUR type curve of 1.6 million BOE per well. The Hobson Row is one of the
key drivers of our STACK growth plans in 2017 and gross production remains on pace to exceed 40,000 BOE per day
by end of the second quarter.
We're also excited about our next Woodford development, the Jacobs Row. We will deploy the learnings attained from
the Hobson Row and leverage larger completion designs across extended-reach laterals which we expect will boost
returns associated with the Jacobs project to among the best in our portfolio.
To the north, in the over-pressured oil window of the STACK, our appraisal work during the quarter confirmed the
potential for up to four landing zones in the core of the play. This appraisal activity will help further refine our initial
multi-zone STACK development, the Showboat project, which is set to spud in the third quarter. While still
preliminary, our plans call for drilling 25 to 30 wells across two drilling units at Showboat, co-developing both the
Meramec and Woodford formations.
With additional appraisal success in the core of the play, we could increase spacing to more than 20 wells per drilling
unit with future development projects. To provide perspective on the scale of our STACK opportunity, we have
identified approximately 400 drilling units that are candidates for multi-zone development work, providing us with a
highly visible growth platform.
Looking beyond the Delaware and STACK, we also had impressive results within our Eagle Ford and Rockies assets.
The initial flowback results from our nine-well diamond spacing tests at Eagle Ford were very strong, with 30-day rates
averaging 2,100 BOE per day. With this pilot, we have confirmed the upper Eagle Ford as a commercially viable
landing zone, adding to our multiyear inventory in the field.
Our initial Rockies drilling work also delivered impressive results. Our first four Parkman wells crushed type curve
expectations by averaging more than 1,800 BOE per day, of which 95% was light oil. Making the Rockies story sizzle
even more for the quarter are the results from recent state and federal lease auctions. Winning bids that offset our
southern acreage position reached nearly $17,000 per acre. As a reminder, we opportunistically secured our leasehold
position in this area for about $1,000 an acre in late 2015.
And my last key message is that Devon absolutely possesses the low-risk development inventory to deliver sustainable
long-term growth. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, which are two of the very best-positioned plays on
the North American cost curve, we have exposure to more than 30,000 potential drilling locations. These world class
assets provide Devon with a highly visible, multi-decade growth platform.
And, as you saw in our press release last night, given the massive growth opportunity associated with our STACK and
Delaware Basin assets, we simply have an abundance of opportunities within our portfolio. This high-quality dilemma
has resulted in our initial step to bring value forward with a $1 billion non-core asset divestiture program over the next
12 to 18 months. The non-core assets identified for monetization include select portions of the Barnett Shale, focused
primarily around Johnson County, and other properties located principally within the U.S.
Looking beyond today's announcement, I also want to be clear that our risked resource base in the U.S. has the
potential to further expand with ongoing appraisal work in the STACK and Delaware Basin. With successful
delineation results, we would evaluate strategic options for additional non-core asset sales in the future.
The bottom line is the divestiture program, combined with our excellent liquidity and strong hedge position, supports
our capital program and places us firmly on track to achieve our multi-year growth targets. Additionally, the certainty

associated with our capital programs uniquely positions Devon to maintain strong operational momentum through the
end of the decade.
So in summary, I believe Devon clearly offers investors a differentiated opportunity in the E&P space. We have a great
collection of assets. We will continue to get the most out of these world class assets with superior execution, and we
have one of the more advantaged capital structures in the E&P space. As we continue to execute on our disciplined
business plan, we are well positioned to generate outsized returns for our shareholders for many years to come.
Now I will turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott Coody
Thanks, Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have
further questions, you can re-prompt as time permits. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering, Dave, if you could maybe give us some more details on
the multi-zone development. You mentioned that you've submitted four master development plans. I was wondering if
maybe you could give us some details on what one of these development plans could look like at Cotton Draw in terms
of the different zones between the Bone Spring, Wolfcamp outline et cetera?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, I can take the first part of this, Arun, and good morning. And then I'm going to turn it
over to Tony, talk about the specific zones that we'd be developing. But talking a little bit about the master
development plan, that's really something that we are one of the first companies to do in the Delaware Basin, and
basically it takes a lot of the risk out of the permitting. As you know, we're developing this on federal acreage and,
historically it's been difficult on a well by well basis to get an inventory far enough ahead of your drilling program to
have the confidence that you can execute on the drilling program.
With this master development program, that essentially gives us a permit for a large area. You see we're submitted four
across, and it's going to give us 600 permits, an average of about 150 per master development plan. We have the first
one in already. And so with that, then all you have to do is get in individual ADPs, which are a much, much shorter
process and are really not on the critical path at all. So this is a great concept that we've been working with the BLM
on. We appreciate their cooperation on this, and it's really a huge step forward for allowing us to go to a much higher
rig count. Now you've seen in our operations report, we said we're making plans now, not initially, but up to 20 rigs out
there, and this is a big part of that. So, Tony, you want to talk specifically about Cotton Draw a little bit?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Yes, Arun, appreciate your question. This is some planning work that we've been
incorporating into the halls of Devon for about the last two years, and again as Dave mentioned, we appreciate the
partnership that we have with the BLM. It's really worked out to our advantage. And so if you look at the concept that
we're describing in these multi-stacked horizons here, we're starting off with some fairly small size, small scaled,
multi-stacked, multi-well pads.
And so as we've just commented on, we just finished the drilling of our Thistle Area 10-well pad. We'll have a 20-well
pad in the Delaware Basin by year-end. We'll gradually transition from fairly small pads in 2017 and early 2018, and
by 2018 and beyond, we'll be a little bit larger in scale. But the benefit for something like Cotton Draw, which has
actually got prospectivity for 2017 that would include the Bone Springs, Delaware, Leonard and the Wolfcamp, we'll
be prosecuting all those areas there. This one design allows us to have larger sized pads, not in a surface area as much
as in well count, and it will have a centralized production facility that each of the pads will be able to flow into.

This starts optimizing the surface facilities, starts optimizing really the manufacturing process that we have. We'll be
able to have simultaneous operations as we go through the work. So it provides a lot of inherent efficiencies in our plan
that, with a deep inventory that we have talked about in the Delaware Basin, we just knew there had to be a better
solution than just a historic two to three wells per pad environment.
<A - David A. Hager>: And I might add, I outlined in my prepared remarks some of the benefits of this type
development. I know one of the pushbacks that we've had is people are concerned, oh my gosh, is this going to look
like a major offshore development in terms of timing with going this direction. Two comments on that. First, as Tony
said, we're starting out small. So you aren't going to see large ones initially. We're going to have 10, 15, 20 type well
size pads initially.
And the second point is, in each of these pads, we're going to have multiple rigs working. And so bottom line is you are
not going to see a significant timing shift as we go from the two to four wells per pad to a larger because of how we're
going to concentrate our rigs on there to keep the timing the same. So that concern is, we have obviously been thinking
about that, and we have alleviated that, and been working on that for a long time.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Great. Thanks. And my follow-up, I wanted to talk a little bit about the four extended reach
wells that you're doing at the Hobson Row, and what are your thoughts around the Jacobs Row? I think you've talked
about a 70-well development with Cimarex. I assume that's just standard laterals, and if these four extended reach
laterals wells do okay at Hobson, how could that influence your development plans for the Jacobs Row?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Arun, on the Hobson Row, we are all the way through the completion as our normal lateral
wells, and as you can see the report, seeing very encouraging results. We've upsized the frac designs, and we decoupled
our operations there. I can talk a little bit more about that as we go through the call, I hope, but great efficiency of
operations. The execution phase is going really well. We're just now getting to the long laterals that we've described in
the plan for the Hobson Row. We're fully expecting that the long laterals are going to be the design of the future, and
that will be what we incorporate into the Jacobs Row.
What I'll also comment on about, we have a 50/50 partnership with Cimarex there, as you mentioned. We're continuing
to work with their technical teams on what the forward plan is for capped allocation, both in Devon and in Cimarex.
Right now, we're expecting to prosecute our three well section in Q4 of this year. We're expecting Cimarex to be close
to that same timeframe. But for right now, we're fully anticipating long lateral design as we go forward and fully
focused on starting our three-well program in middle of Q4 [indiscernible] (20:22).
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Just to clarify, is the Jacobs Row going to be 70 long laterals or single laterals? I wasn't quite
sure.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Arun, it's going to be long laterals. Every time can drill a long lateral, we're going to drill long
laterals. So I think if you look at the layout on the map that we've highlighted here, they're all going to be exposed to
long lateral drilling.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Scott Coody>: Arun, it's Scott. As you know, just the standard length laterals, you're looking at $1.6 million
equivalent on a recovery basis, right. So when you extend these laterals out with the Jacobs, the returns really ratchet
significantly higher, rivaling what you're seeing in the overpressure oil window in the Meramec. So it'll be a great
project for us, and we're pretty excited about our spudding activity which will occur in Q4.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Thanks, Scott.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Scott Coody>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So I wonder if I could start off with a question on inventory, Dave. And I guess it relates also to
your $1 billion proposed asset sale. There's multiple pieces to this question I guess, but just looking at all the data
you've given today, I mean you talk about going to 20 rigs in the Delaware. You talk about 2,000 unrisked locations,
but yet your inventory in the Wolfcamp is still only 500. So when do you basically get a little bit more disclosure, or
what do you need to see to step up the inventory in both the Delaware but also in the Fighting you've got third and
fourth landing zones now that seem to be working in the core of the STACK. It just seems your inventory is
substantially understated. And my related question is what that means for the timing of your non-core disposals as your
inventory extends. If I may, I've got a quick follow-up to that, but go ahead. Thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: Great. Well, I think you're hitting it exactly right, Doug, that we see significant upside to our
risked inventory. We obviously had a great well there with the Fighting Okra, and there's been some great offset wells
to that. We're going to have a significant portion of our appraisal dollars in the Delaware Basin going to additional
Wolfcamp wells here in the second half of the year. We are also going to be doing a lot more appraisal work up in the
STACK. We take the approach so we want to see the actual appraisal results before we really put it into our risked
inventory, but we have every confidence based on our well results and other competitor well results that this is going to
continue to increase.
And we look, as I said in the prepared remarks, we look at this divestiture program as a first step. We think it's an
appropriate first step because obviously commodity prices also have softened somewhat in the past few months. We are
confident that we have a program already that we are planning on in 2018 that's well beyond the 20 rigs that we will in
2017. And we even talked in the last operations report – we didn't put it in this one, but at $60 and $3.25, $60 WTI,
$3.25 Henry Hub, we'd be generating about $3.5 billion of cash flow, upstream cash flow. So prices have fallen off a
little bit from that. But with this divestment program, that certainly gives us increased certainty that we can deliver on
the growth results, even if commodity prices soften because these wells are still generating incredible rates of return
even at somewhat lower prices.
So we want to execute it. Our operations teams are fully prepared to execute on that, and this gives us additional
confidence that we will have the cash to generate that. Now as we further appraise these areas such as the Wolfcamp
and additional landing zones in the STACK, we will consider additional divestments as appropriate, if they are
appropriate. And so I would look at this as certainly a signal for how we're going in the future. We think this is the
appropriate first step. But as we finish our appraisal program, there could be further steps, or continue with our
appraisal program, there could be further steps.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Just to be clear, Dave. So you're basically saying that Devon lives within cash inflows including
asset sales?
<A - David A. Hager>: Essentially at this point, that's right. Yeah.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. My follow-up is really on the relative economics across the different plays, because
obviously, you've got a ton of things that are emerging that are competitive. And what's on the back of my mind is the
Rockies statement you made in the presentation. In order to provide a per-acre value, one would argue that you're
trying to get the market to focus on the value of your acreage. But of course, that only gets realized if you monetize it in
any reasonable timeline. And I guess you could say the same thing about Conoco's recent sale of their oil sands.
Again, they got a big valuation for that and it's probably not getting recognized in your stock. So when you look at the
growth in inventory that you're clearly having in these other areas, how do these relative areas within your business
compete for capital? In other words, where would your incremental first look be to monetize? Would it be Delaware
Slope? Would it be the rest of the Barnett? Would it be part of the Rockies? Would it be oil sands? Just how do you
think about how you would prioritize non-core asset sales?

<A - David A. Hager>: Well, first off, I'd say we're not just trying to highlight it. And we don't think it only
necessarily gets built in when you sell it. I think we can have that discussion over a beer someday I guess, but I don't
think we have to sell all of our assets to get value recognized for it. But what we're trying to say is that other people are
starting to recognize the value that we have, and we think that should start showing up in our stock price.
The most important thing I can say is our conscious strategy here at Devon has been to not only be in some of the best
plays in onshore North America, but to have the best positions in the best plays in onshore North America. These are
big plays and always in these plays, there's good spots to be and not so good spots to be. And we are focused on being
in the best. And so I think when you look at our well level economics, I will stand them up against anybody in the
industry because we are in the heart of the best plays in onshore North America. Tony, do you want to add any
comments from a relative viewpoint on them, the economics? But I can tell you they're all pretty outstanding.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: I think they are. I think one thing, Doug, that we're proud about is we picked up our position,
we expanded our position in the Powder at a time when the industry really didn't understand the potential value there.
Now the industry has recognized that. But if you look at the returns that we had before commodity prices cycled off,
the returns that we had in the Powder were every bit as good if not at the top end of our results in late Q4 of 2014. And
again, if you look at the four wells that we've talked about for this particular quarter, again they're at the top end of our
portfolio. So it's a equivalent capability to the Delaware, the best of the Delaware and the best of STACK. It just
doesn't have the same scale to us as the others. So as commodity prices rise and additional cash flow is generated, it's
going to be a great opportunity for us.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phillip J. Jungwirth>: Thanks. Good morning. A question on the Barnett. Of the $400 million to $500 million of
cash flow expected in 2017, just trying to understand at a high level, does this include the MVC payment? And how
should we think about any upside to Barnett cash flow if GP&T contracts were closer to market rates?
<A - Jeffrey L. Ritenour>: Well, I can certainly handle the first part of that with regards to the cash flow that we put
out there, that's net of all of our transportation and processing costs, so absolutely. And I guess, Phil, could you repeat
the second part of that question? I'm not sure I heard that clearly.
<Q - Phillip J. Jungwirth>: Yes, just trying to understand how much upside there could be to that cash flow number if
the GP&T contract with EnLink were, in your view, closer to market rates?
<A - Jeffrey L. Ritenour>: At that point, Phillip, that's undisclosed. There's confidentiality regarding that, so that's not
a number that we're going to be able to provide for you today. But I think the key takeaway is that these are very
valuable assets that are generating free cash flow. So this isn't like other comps that occurred previously in prior years.
This will be an asset that will be sought after and we expect to have good market depth as we look to market the asset.
<Q - Phillip J. Jungwirth>: Okay. Great. And then there's been a fair amount of Osage activity up towards northwest
Dewey and Woodward County, and we've even had a S-1 filing from one E&P positioned up there. I was just hoping
that you could help frame Devon's position in this area, and is there anything to discuss in terms of well results,
thoughts on the play, or future activity plans?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Phillip, I think we've described that we have about 80,000 acres of what we call the
Northwest STACK extension. We've acquired that position just through a lot of organic leasing and picked up a few
real small pieces. We have some well activity in the area. We're really not ready to disclose that, but we're encouraged
and excited about the opportunity going forward; and so I think at this point, that's where we'll leave it.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Yes. Good morning. And it really feels like you're making progress derisking these
multi-zone pads out in the Delaware. I mean, each of the individual wells you give us data on. As you go to sort of a
sectional development, are you ready at this stage to kind of like give us some kind of overall sectional type curve and
well costs, or is it still too early?
<A - David A. Hager>: Probably the challenge to do that, and good morning, is that it really depends a lot on where
you are. And even in some cases, you'll find that some zones have already been developed and we'll be just developing
other zones as well. So it's a fairly complex thing to try to give you a per section. In some cases, there are, as Tony said,
we have Bone Spring, we have Leonard, we have Wolfcamp, we have Delaware, all of those and other areas, such as
our initial development in Thistle. We're just developing three zones in the Leonard and then there's every other variety
as well. But I guess the key is they're all working incredibly well, but it's not really possible to just give a type curve
per section, I don't think, because of the variety.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Okay. Yes. I think, when I think of the inventory and the value of the inventory, I'm trying
to think of reasons why the shares aren't reflecting that and that sort of uncertainty may be one of them, although we
can see obviously some very good well results.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we said we have just such a deep un-risked inventory, and we are going through an
appraisal program, and we'll certainly lay out even – the bottom line is everything's working, and it's working
extremely economically right now. And so as we continue this appraisal throughout 2017 and even into future years,
you're going to see this inventory expand. We're confident of that. We just want to get the results before we give all the
details.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: The other comments in the ops report around operational efficiency were very interesting.
You talked about unbundling. Obviously, inflation's starting to appear in certain lines, but maybe if you can talk a little
bit about how, any examples you can share of how the unbundling of, say, proppants or pressure pumping or other lines
is leading to savings relative to, say, a year ago or Q-over-Q, however you want to describe it?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Ed, we are seeing tension and cost escalation across the business. We've been very pleased. I
think we've commented in the past that we're going to be able to mitigate about 75% of that cost escalation throughout
Q4 2016 to Q4 2017 with just some good planning and good operational efficiency work. We're seeing that. In fact, if
you look at our capital spend through Q1, we're a little bit light and we feel like we're being able to mitigate any tension
we have on the system.
Our guys are doing an extraordinarily good job right now with the planning, not only the execution, but the planning of
the work that we do. And so when the guys are looking forward, we're already working out into 2018 and 2019.
Planning our work there allows us to go to our providers, give them certainty about the long-term plans. They're able to
make more definitive long-term decisions. That's helping us in a big way. So we like to have control over our destiny as
a lot of companies do.
We find that when we have good plans in place, good partners and control over the project schedule, we can excel
there. So we have actually contracted and secured our 2017 sand for all of our work in the Mid-Continent and also in
the Delaware. We have entered into a contract to secure the 100-mesh sand for all of our STACK work for three years
out. We find that the sand mines are pleased to be working with the end-user, because we have definitive plans.
And also, Ed, we're not at the mercy at some of the larger scale pressure pumping providers, because they're getting
plans from a lot of people that may not be as fine-tuned and as well thought through as ours. And so we would tend to
get shuffled at times. And so if I went back and looked at the look-back on our work that we just completed on the

Hobson Row, I think we've had a total of seven hours of delay not having sand on location ready to pump. Historically,
we would have three times that amount on single jobs at times when we were depending on turnkey type work.
So we've got some outstanding work across the organization that's allowing us to have good relationships. You're
starting to see the OCTG market inflate as well, and we've had some long-term relationships with three providers there,
that we stuck with them during the downturn. They're sticking with us in the upcycle, so we're able to mitigate cost on
the pipe side of the business. And on the drilling rig side of the business, you're starting to see the, I guess I'll call it, the
high spec end market for rigs is starting to diminish, and a little bit more pressure there. But our relationships with a
couple of primary providers there have helped us get through that.
We're also taking the opportunity to contract longer term in some of these spaces. And while we've always had a fair
amount of our rigs under term, in fact right now, I think we have 11 out of our 15 rigs under some amount of term. But
we're also now moving that into the frac space, and so four out of the six frac crews that we have working are on
one-year term as well.
So the guys are continuing to think forward. Our operating team and our supply chain group work extremely well
together, doing some good design work in-house. And so we feel like we got places across the business that we have
essentially are gaining operational efficiency that we didn't have two years ago.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Thank you for the fulsome answer.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Yes. Thanks. Just kind of curious as you look at the STACK play and discuss the opportunities to
get three to four potential formations for these obviously these pad developments that sound pretty exciting. When you
step back, how are you going to delineate the test of how many places have that say third or Lower Meramec available
or the Woodford available? Is that something that you've got a good sense of right now, or is there still a lot of work to
get there?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Scott, I think if you watch the release on where our well activity has been, we have been
appraising around what we call appraisal areas one and two. And appraisal area one will have our first development
that will start in Q3 of this year. We call that the Showboat Development. In and around that particular area, we feel
confident that we understand the horizontal or the lateral spacing per zone very well. We're also getting fresh
information on the vertical connectivity and so we've got a lot of data on what we call the Meramec 200, and now we're
seeing it on the 300 and the 400. That's being included, and that's what's described pictorially on one of the exhibits that
we have in our operating report.
So in the specific area of the Showboat Development, we've got great pilot results in that's giving us confidence to
incorporate parts of three different intervals in the Meramec, and as we continue with this development in Q3, we're
also continuing appraisal work as we start moving to the western portion of the field. So if you look at the latter half of
2017 and early part of 2018, we'll be moving rigs more westerly than they had been to date.
<A - David A. Hager>: We're also going to be learning from our results as we go here, and so the first development
for instance that Tony described here, is in the Showboat area. Our next development will be most likely a little bit to
the west of this so that we can learn from the Showboat and the actual well results, and sometimes there may even be
some questions. And I think on the operations report, one of the things is that we don't have as many wells on that
diagram in the lower part of the Meramec because we think there is a question as to whether these wells are in vertical
communication.
And less wells is good. If you can get the hydrocarbons out with less wells, that's actually good. But we'll learn from
the actual production from that to help us guide our future development when we move back into that area. So we have
a very, very well thought out, very well planned approach to this so that we will be bottom line optimizing the NPV

over I or the capital efficiency that we're going to get from this program.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And I hope this is not putting words in your mouth, but in part where you're looking to
delineate first and move to is part of it sounds like maybe a thickness of the Meramec?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: As you move to the west and to the south a bit, Scott, you are moving into a thicker portion of
the Meramec in the, what we call the 300 and 400 intervals. So you would see more oil in place in those middle to
lower sections there. So you're right, it changes as you go from the eastern part of the field over to the west.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Great. And as a follow-up question, the Barnett Shale potential sale, can you guys give us
a sense of how much net production you all have there? And maybe if you'd even extend that to that cash flow
expectation or estimate that you all have put our there yesterday, what portion would be associated with that?
<A - David A. Hager>: The planned divestments are about 20% of the leasehold production reserves and the cash flow
is a simple way to think about that.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. 20%. That's great. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Good morning, and congratulations on a very interesting quarter.
<A - Scott Coody>: Thank you.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: First going to the multi-zone concept, as you continue to evolve this concept, I was
wondering, is overall pad oil cut versus overall BOE potential a consideration factor regarding which zones might be
developed?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Well, it is, Jeff, and I think Dave was trying to articulate the full matrix of considerations our
technical teams are going through right now. And so, if you look at the different intervals, some are completely
derisked and already in the development phase, and some have very little data, as an example, the lower portion of the
Wolfcamp. We have higher oil cuts in some than others, and some are just more prolific from a production rate
perspective. And so there's a complicated matrix that the guys go through.
I'd have to tell you that we'll be focused on generating maximum present value and returns from each of the
multi-stacked developments that we go into. There's also an optimized size that we look at, and we think that we can
get up towards savings roughly of about 20% on the D&C side of this up to a certain limit of wells before you start
seeing that cost benefit degrade. And also returns will be maximized at a certain point, and then with too large of a
program we'll turn over and also diminish. So the guys are looking at this on a project by project basis. And it's hard to
describe that, but they'll be looking to maximize value and returns.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: No, that was a helpful answer. I appreciate it. And then, this is a little bit higher level one.
Both the Barnett and the Delaware Basin are proximal to the Gulf Coast and growing that gas demand. Ultimately can
the legacy Barnett nat gas compete for capital with what might be viewed as associated nat gas in the Delaware Basin?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the nat gas that we have seen, the dryer gas opportunities in our portfolio for the most
part are not competing for capital as well as our more oily oriented areas that have associated natural gas. Now
everybody likes to talk about these more oily oriented areas. There is in most cases a fair amount of natural gas that
comes along with those. It varies play to play, but there is a fair amount. But I think we have not focused much drilling
and our portfolio on dry gas opportunities. And so that's one of the things that we obviously are thinking about here as
we look at our divestment program.
They are still opportunities that can generate returns well above the cost of capital. It's just our portfolio is so high
quality they may not generate capital within our portfolio. So we think there's a great market out there and there's an

opportunity potentially to move value forward. We're just trying to make those type decisions at the appropriate time.
and I think you saw the first step of it with our announced divestment last night and I described earlier the rationale for
the timing and the magnitude of that.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: All right. Understood. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks. Maybe start out with one on the Delaware Basin. I know you have limited results in
the Wolfcamp right now, but in the past you had talked about your lack of capital deployment in the Wolfcamp as the
view that it wouldn't compete on a returns basis with the Bone Spring and the Leonard. The first well there looked quite
strong. And I mean would you still at this point, based on incremental data that we've seen over time characterize –
how would you characterize the returns competitiveness of the Wolfcamp versus the Bone Spring and the Leonard, and
could this have any impact on how you think about deployment of capital within the Delaware going forward?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Ryan, we're actually have a very positive view on the Wolfcamp going forward and we've
seen some industry derisk the Wolfcamp around us and we've reported on the Fighting Okra well ourselves so we're
highly encouraged that the opportunity in the Wolfcamp will compete for capital as well as our Bone Springs,
Delaware and Leonard going forward. If you really step back about a year, year and a half ago, we didn't have the
infrastructure built in the southern portion of our play there, so that was a learning experience we had.
I think you also saw about that time, we had very high lease operating costs per BOE. All that infrastructure, we've
caught up with ourselves now and so we've got full water being piped. We've got power grid system across our position
there in the Cotton Draw and Rattlesnake area, so we'll have a much healthier commercial answer for our Wolfcamp
development going forward. And if you just look at the areas of focus for 2017, probably about 50% to 60% of our well
activity will be focused in both the Leonard and the Wolfcamp going forward. So we're encouraged by the quality of
the results that we're seeing in the Wolfcamp.
<A - David A. Hager>: I would, more directly to answer your question, I still think the highest returns are in the Bone
Spring and the Leonard has come up. The Wolfcamp is certainly improving significantly and it has the largest upside to
the inventory.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up on the multi-zone developments.
You've talked about some of the drilling and service level improvements and efficiencies that you might see. And I
wasn't sure if you had just said that you could see 20% D&C improvement, but have you quantified what you think the
efficiency improvements might be in a multi-zone development relative to single wells that you've drilled in the past? I
mean are we talking about a 10% improvement in kind of capital efficiency, 20%? Any ability to ballpark that?
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Yeah, Ryan, that's what I was trying to describe a little bit earlier, but we have quantified that.
The guys do a really good job of planning out these developments to maximize the efficiency of the developments. We
think these multi-stacked developments have the opportunity to reduce total CapEx cost by about 20% on a given
section as compared to the historic two to three wells per pad. And I could go through a long list of positive attributes
that these new designs will yield, but we think it's a game changer for the large inventory that a company like Devon
has.
<A - David A. Hager>: And I'll just reiterate will more time, as I said it earlier too, but you're not going to see a
significant timing difference. This is not like an offshore development. Tony and I have worked a lot of offshore
developments. We know what offshore developments look like. You're not going to see a significant timing difference
compared to what you've seen historically, which I think has been some of the concern.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. I appreciate the clarity.

Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Yes. Good afternoon guys, and a lot's been covered. Maybe a bigger picture question. What level of
well performance do you guy factor into your full-year production guidance? I mean is that based on your actual type
curves or something higher? And I ask it, I'm asking the question because you just reported excellent well results across
all three of your major basins, most significantly above those type curves, yet the full-year production guidance
remains unchanged. There's this kind of contrast between the guide and the information in the ops report.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. First off, the well results are outstanding, as you said. There's absolutely no hedging on
that. But have to just understand that the current year well results proportionally to the total production is pretty darn
small, and so there's a lot of other factors that go into your production guidance beyond just the current year well
results. And then, obviously, I think everybody's figured out by now what has shifted between our outperformance here
in Q1 and somewhat lower guidance in Q2 is just the fact that we moved, we were able to get some Eagle Ford
completions accelerated into Q1 production.
And so the full-year guidance is unchanged. It's just that we got production on a little bit earlier and that's on those
wells. But they do go on. They're incredibly economic wells, but they come on at very high rates and have pretty steep
declines. And we'll see some of that in Q2 in the Eagle Ford. So there's just a lot of factors that go into the full-year
production guidance beyond just the type curves that we publish. But obviously, we are pleased that in several areas we
are exceeding type curve expectations.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: So, Dave, could I just?
<Q - Evan Calio>: No, that makes sense.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes. Add in a little more, Tony.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Yeah just, I want to give a little kudos to the work our technical teams are doing on the
completion side of the business that's driving some of this outperformance. And if you remember, Evan, and I think it
was probably several quarters ago that we showed that our 90-day IPs were number one out of the 30 most active
operators in the U.S. space. And that was in 2015. In 2016, you look at that data – and 2015, by the way, the average of
our per-well performance was over 600 BOEs per day. When we look at 2016, our average for new wells brought on is
over 900 BOEs per day.
So we took what we thought was an outstanding performance in 2015, continued to evolve doing some really
sophisticated subsurface modeling, frac modeling, and have increased our 90-day IPs another 50% in 2016. And you
start looking at the Q1 results in 2017, it's a little higher than where we left off in 2016. So the guys are continuing to
put the pedal down and achieve really outstanding results.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Understood.
<A - Jeffrey L. Ritenour>: And just a point of clarity real quick. Those are for 90-day rates. And then also the gas
piece of that production, which is being adjusted on a 20-to-1 basis as well. So that would account for some of the
reconciliation versus some of the 30-day rates you're seeing in our operations reports.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. So we'll look for that in the 2018 numbers, it sounds. And my second question is a follow-up
on the asset sale program, to pick up on your opening comments and some of the Q&A discussion. The asset program
appears to poise to grow as organic location count grows. How do you think about optimal inventory depth that defines
how much is non-core or sold either in years of inventory, regional or return-driven program? And somewhat related, is
the vision to scale asset sales with the ability to redeploy the capital, or is it more paced just with the down-spacing
results? Thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, that's a great question, and it's a really hard question to answer. It's kind of like the old
reserves production ratio. You can have too much and you can have too little, and what's the right number. I can give

you some directional thoughts on that. I don't know that there is an absolute right answer, but I tend to think of
somewhere around a 20-year inventory that would be very economic locations at anticipated prices as kind of a quick
summary of where I would say. I don't think it does a lot of good to have a 100-year inventory, and I don't know if I'd
sleep real well if I had a five-year inventory. So somewhere around that. And is that the exact right number? I really
can't say. But I think that probably gets you somewhere in the ballpark.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. And then the pacing concept, do you think the sales utilize to kind of match ability to
redeploy capital, obviously neutralizing for any kind of commodity change? Or is it just going to run its course with
results and location count?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we see this $1 billion divestment program as just giving us additional certainty with –
we would do it anyway because it's the right thing, because it's the right, given the depth of our inventory. But we also
see that, at the same time, that commodity prices have weakened somewhat. And so this gives us greater certainty
around the fact that we are going to have the cash flow to execute on a very high return program in 2018.
Now, as we see in 2019, we're going to continue to ramp up activity, and again, as we finish more of this appraisal
work, more of it gets derisked. 2018 isn't the end of the game for us. We see continuing ramp-up in capital and activity
as we move forward beyond that that's just going to continue to accelerate our growth into future years. And we will, if
all of the appraisal work works out as we anticipate it will, I think that we would be looking at additional divestments
depending on commodity prices too, how strong those are, but we probably looking at additional divestments to focus
our capital even more.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Good morning, Dave and team.
<A - Scott Coody>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Just first question, I wanted to follow up on a comment around the Upper Eagle Ford
you made at the beginning with the successful commercial delineation. Just curious how that potentially impacts your
view on inventory in the play, and with the new diamond pattern that you're currently piloting, how we should think
about your core inventory over the next few years.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Matt, we're very pleased with the well results that we saw with the acceleration of our
ductwork into Q1. That data is being incorporated both into Devon and BHP's technical thoughts right now. But the
Lower Eagle Ford staggered wells worked extremely well. The Upper Eagle Ford wells that were incorporated into that
plan worked very well. We're drilling Austin Chalk wells at this time. So the technical teams will come out with their
plan, and I would estimate somewhere between 500 and 1,000 locations going forward. The main thing to think about
at this point is we've got two rigs operating right now in the play, anticipate probably three in the second half of this
year. Those will be utilized when the guys have incorporated all of these results into their thoughts.
<A - Jeffrey L. Ritenour>: And, Matt, really just another thought to that is that when you think about the Eagle Ford,
while we do have some very high returning inventory on a multi-year basis that we can execute upon, the transition of
the Eagle Ford really is a free cash flow generator for our STACK and Delaware Basin growth. And I think that's how
you need to perceive that asset with regards to the strategic fit in our portfolio, very high margin barrels, great results,
but it's certainly we're going to harvest that cash flow and send it over to the STACK and Delaware Basin.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Great. And then as a follow-up, just in regards to the PRB. You've highlighted some
fantastic Parkman wells here and the rates of return on a well-level basis are competitive with the Delaware and the
STACK. Just curious from a milestone perspective, what we should be watching for over the next year or two in terms
of opportunities to scale the PRB further in regards to production and capital allocation.

the Rockies will be kind of the question that we evaluate quarter-to-quarter. But we've got the inventory and permits
are coming. We got another good relationship there with the BLM office that is progressing, and we feel pretty good

<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes. Thank you. As you get through these bigger drilling units, Dave, Tony has discussed
some of the efficiencies you're gaining and the fact that vendors like long-term visibility. Do you see a point where as
these drilling units are larger, that you have such concentrated activity, that you're willing to do multi-year deals or that
the vendors would do multi-year deals? And also, would it behoove you, if they're not willing to do that, to be perhaps
more integrated?
<A - David A. Hager>: Absolutely, John, and we've already done that on sand and we do see that as, I think Tony tried
to allude to that, that that's one of the advantages that we see because this does provide certainty of activity and with us
working directly with the sand mines, for instance, they like that because they really know then, okay, we're dealing
with a company that's actually going to drill the wells. And there's a much more certainty of demand than there is
dealing with a service company who is relying on representations from a number of operators. And it's not the service
company's fault, but they may just not know and in as detail whether those plans are going to be true or not, where
dealing directly with Devon, with an outstanding reputation and for following through on what we say we're going to
do. We see that's an advantage and allows them to have confidence to enter into multi-year agreements with us.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Good. With respect to the Eagle Ford, I just heard about the harvest mode essentially
for the Delaware and the STACK. What if BHP wanted to exit, would you be interested in their position, or you would
just consider again the Eagle Ford to be more of a cash flow source?
<A - David A. Hager>: Oh, I don't know. I'd hate to say on any individual asset whether we would be interested or not
interested. I think it is probably fair to say that we tend to like things where we see value gaps, and a lot of times those
value gaps appear because of a perception of what the upside of an asset may be from one company to another. So I
think given the maturity of the asset, there's probably not as much inventory there as there may be in other areas where
there could be value gaps. You always prefer more undeveloped acreage, so I don't think that's a big focus for us right
now. But I never have – we'd have to see how it evolves, but that's initial thoughts.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Thanks very much, Dave.

question, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time, which consists of myself and
