Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered
forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments and our long-term growth and innovation,
the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a
number risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these
forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation
to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information
or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our
results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are
also expressed in a non-GAAP basis – on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to
stock-based compensation. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital
expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP
measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.
Lawrence E. Page
Well, thank you, and it's great to be here, and thanks for taking the time to be with us today. When I look back over the
last quarter, the word that springs to mind is gangbusters. Revenue was up 33% year-on-year and our quarterly revenue
was just short of $10 billion, not bad for a 13-year-old.
I'm also incredibly excited about the progress we've made on the product side. Ever since taking over as CEO, I have
focused much of my energy on increasing Google's velocity and execution, and we're beginning to see results. Look at
Google+. We had 100 features launched in 90 days. The team is really cranking. We had Hangouts on the phone,
Hangouts on air, will.i.am did a Hangout from his concert in Central Park, you can now share Circles, you can search
Google+ and you can play games in Google+ and far most exciting of all, open sign ups, Google+ for everyone.
Looking at the numbers for Google+, I was taken aback. I now want to announce that we passed the 40 million user
mark on Google+. People are flocking into Google+ at an incredible rate, and we're just getting started. The
engagement we're seeing is phenomenal, too. Over 3.4 billion photos have already been uploaded and Google+, but it's
still incredibly early days for Google+ because our goal is actually far bigger than the individual feature launches
themselves.
Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Google experience making it beautifully simple, almost auto-magical
because we understand what you want and can deliver it instantly. This means baking identity and sharing into all of
our products so that we build a real relationship with our users. Sharing on the web will be like sharing in real life
across all your stuff. You will have better, more relevant search results and ads. Think about it this way. Last quarter
we shipped the plus and now were going to ship the Google parts.
The new visual design: beautiful, consistent UIs for search, news, maps, translate and lots of other features is only the
beginning of that process. Last quarter, I talked about focus, and we've made great progress here, too. To create
products that really change people's lives, that they use every day, two or three times a day is really hard. So, we have
to make tough decisions about what to focus on or we end up doing things that don't have the impact that we strive for.
Since we last spoke we've begun the process of shutting over 20 different products, including Sidewiki, Google Pack,
Google Notebook and Fast Flip, and we'll continue to simplify and streamline our products going forward. This
prioritization is crucial if we are to really invest in the extraordinary opportunities in front of Google today.
Let me give you a few examples. Chrome. Usage is going through the roof. We have now had over 200 million users
and still growing fast. Turns out that people really care about getting to the web quickly and securely and having a
whole ecosystem of apps at their fingertips.

I'm super pleased with Google Maps. It's a favorite with our users, especially on mobile devices. In August we
launched in 40 new countries taking our total to 130 countries.
The growth of Android is mind-boggling, too. Over 190 million devices have now been activated globally. I'm super
excited about the soon-to-be released new version of Android called Ice Cream Sandwich. That's right, Ice Cream
Sandwich. You won't believe what we've managed to get done in this release. We're also seeing a huge positive
revenue impact from mobile, which has grown 2.5x in the last 12 months to a run rate of over $2.5 billion.
Generally, I've found that high usage products will make a lot of money over time for well-managed technology
companies, and that's why it's so important to run these businesses for the long-term. That said, we must never lose
sight of the fact that today's revenues and growth serves as the engine that runs all of our future innovation. People are
a crucial part of Google's long-term success. Great companies are no greater than the effort and ingenuity of their
employees.
So our goal is to hire the best people at every level and keep them at Google. The hiring at Google: the hiring has to be
manageable if we are to balance our short and long-term needs. You may have noticed quite substantial hiring this
quarter driven in part by a lot of university graduates. Despite the seasonal affect the total number people we hired was
about the same as last quarter. Our attrition remains low, which is great though obviously it contributes to our overall
head count. As I've said previously, I continue to believe that our head count growth is at the edge of what's
manageable.
Let me finish by saying that we are still the very early stages of what technology can deliver. These tools we use online
will look very different in five years' time. We're building those tools now as Google+, which is why I'm so excited to
be here.
So thank you, and again, we had a great quarter. And now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.
Let me first turn to the specifics of our performance in the quarter from a financial perspective. Our gross revenue grew
33% year-over-year to $9.7 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter. Note that while some currency fluctuation boosted our
revenue again this quarter little bit even in constant FX terms our growth rates remained very strong. Our Google
website revenue was up 39% year-over-year to $6.7 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter with strength across most
major geographies and verticals in fact. Our Google network revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and
4% quarter-over-quarter.
On the one hand, year-over-year network revenue growth slowed slightly due to a few factors, including the search
quality changes that we made earlier this year that we already commented on. On the other hand the momentum of our
Display business, which comprises only part of the network line, continues and I guess we'll have more to say on this in
a few minutes.
Our other revenue was up also 52% year-over-year to $385 million, and that was up 24% quarter-over-quarter. Our
global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 28% year-over-year and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. The
corollary, the aggregate cost per click growth was up 5% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. Remember
too that that's an aggregate number, which includes both google.com and our AdSense properties. As usual, there's
some variability quarter-over-quarter in these metrics, but overall we continue to be very pleased with our revenue and
the performance of our ad system. Again, Susan will give you a few more comments in a few minutes.
So turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and rest of the world are growing at a very healthy pace and our
results clearly reflect that. Even the U.K. continues to show some positive momentum. In our earnings slides, which
you'll find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of
world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs so please refer to those slides for the exact

calculations.
Our revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 55% of our
total revenue or $5.3 billion, up 41% year-over-year, which includes a modest $1 million of benefits from our hedging
program and this is, compared to $89 million benefit in Q3 of last year. The U.K. was up 25% to $1 billion and
year-over-year growth in fixed FX still is pretty healthy and would've been 20% or is 20%.
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition growth and costs were $2.2 billion, or 23.7% of total advertising
revenue, and our other cost of revenue was $1.1 billion, which excludes stock-based compensation of $72 million.
Finally, operating expenses, also excluding SBC, totaled $2.8 billion, and SBC itself totaled $499 million in Q3. So,
our increase year-over-year in SBC is primarily due to the annual equity refresh, which we do at this time of year, and
the increase in year-over-year for our OpEx was primarily due, as usual, in payroll, increased professional services, and
advertising and promotion spend.
So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.6 billion in Q3, which excludes SBC, and our resulting
non-GAAP operating margin of 37.3%. Headcount was approximately up by 2,585 versus Q2, ending the quarter with
31,353 full-time employees. And as Larry already noted, there are two factors at work here: Q3 usually has significant
head count additions and this quarter is no exception due to a bumper crop of university hires. In fact, we had the
second-highest number of university hires in Google's history this quarter. Additionally, acquisitions this quarter added
a large number of people as well.
Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q3, flat with Q2, and the lower tax rate is driven by a mix of earnings between
domestic and international subsidiaries.
Now let me turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $302 million for Q3. OI&E was driven by strong
portfolio management performance, and additionally, we saw lower-than-expected FX cash flow hedging expenses due
to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in September. For more details on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that
accompany this call on our IR website.
Operating cash flow was very strong at $4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter, down from last quarter to $680 million,
and the majority of the CapEx once again in Q2 was related to facilities and production equipment. And as a reminder,
we continue to make these significant investments in CapEx, and these have shown to be lumpy from
quarter-to-quarter, depending on where we're able to make these investments. We're very pleased with our free cash
flow in consequence of all this, which was $3.3 billion.
So before handing it over to Nikesh, I know that many of you have had questions about general economic outlook, and
have been kind of asking us those questions. But what we're seeing is not terribly surprising or different from what
you're all seeing, watching on TV, reading in the press. And while obviously, we don't control the economy or the
exchange rates that fluctuate so much, we do very much control our own operating agenda, and that's why we will, as
always, stay focused on what we control, our agenda for the long term, with a strategy and investments that are not
calibrated for quarter-on-quarter views, but really designed to create, as Larry said, fantastic products that transform
our users' lives, and create significant value for our shareholders.
With that, let me now hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more details on our sales performance in this quarter.
Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I'll give you an update on our business activities. To reiterate what Patrick said, we saw strong
performance across our portfolio supported by the strength of our products. Our sales, customer support, marketing and
partnership activities drove $9.7 billion in revenue this quarter. First, let me talk about results for our advertising
products, then our performance by region, and finally, some highlights from our amazing marketing team.

On search, our core desktop search business maintained its momentum. Google.com growth was faster than one year
ago. Our syndicated search revenue also accelerated this quarter with new, large billable deals contributing to our
growth. We're monetizing clicks better by working closely with our clients to grow the value of search advertising.
What's interesting is, we're increasingly able to link search marketing efforts to both online and off-line sales with
various other media.
This quarter, we worked with our clients such as leading apparel retailer, H&M, to promote sales through [ph] classic
(15:04) search campaigns. Additionally, clients like J&J and Sharpie use search advertising to support large, online
branding campaigns on other media like YouTube and our Google Display Network.
Moving onto Display, growth this quarter was robust, with products like YouTube and Google Display Network, we're
giving advertisers more options to engage with their customers online. What's interesting is we've seen a marked
increas in our average spending from 2009. 2009, our top 20 display deals averaged approximately $2 million each.
Now, our top deals are over seven times larger, averaging approximately $15 million each.
Some of our biggest display campaigns this quarter came from DreamWorks and Disney. We've launched Space Lab, a
partnership between YouTube and Lenovo. It's a video competition for 14 to 18-year-olds in which winners will have
the opportunity to send a science experiment to the International Space Station. So, we keep doing interesting things to
try and keep driving more usage and more revenues for YouTube and our Google Display Network.
We have equally strong traction with our ad agency partners with whom we're very excited about the partnerships
we've developed. Just over the past 6 months, we have signed display deals with agencies, which totaled almost $600
million to help deliver online advertising options to our shared customers, which will form part of our display initiative.
Let's turn to mobile advertising. Larry mentioned $2.5 billion as a run rate. Our revenue growth continues to accelerate
even in mobile, driven primarily by mobile search. This growth obviously is driven both by the underlying expansion
of Android devices and tablets, as well as stellar performance by our sales teams who are working closely with our
customers to help them craft compelling mobile advertising solutions.
Many advertisers have greatly increased the size and frequency of their mobile campaigns. Mobile is becoming a
must-have. This includes clients like Interland, Intercontinental Hotels Group, which spends pretty much across our
entire portfolio of properties, including mobile search, mobile GDN and AdMob.
Moving our sights to enterprise, we see continued driving acceleration on our enterprise business. More companies are
fundamentally going Google. Our apps products continue strong growth with recent app wins to people like Goodyear
and SoftBank of Japan. We're particularly excited obviously also that we just deployed apps to 450,000 teachers in
Morocco. Finally, Chromebooks have been available for purchase since mid-June, and we're beginning to see lots of
interest and good uptake, both from the businesses and educational institutions.
Let's shift gears and look at our country performance. If you look across countries, we continue to see strong business
growth despite uncertainty in the global economy. In particular, North America was broadly stable this quarter. U.S.
revenues have stayed on their growth trajectory and Canada has actually accelerated.
In much of Western Europe we have seen some softness in ad sales. However, in markets like Spain we are seeing that
our sales execution efforts are continuing to keep our revenues stable and in some cases accelerate the revenue growth.
Of course, across Asia and our key emerging markets we grew much faster. Japan's post-earthquake recovery has
continued, and it's been driven primarily by large advertisers. We also see revenue growth in Australia, India, Brazil.
They all are strong, and they continue on a strong growth trajectory.
Finally, let me spend a few minutes on marketing and partnerships. Our marketing and partnership programs continue
to help scale and grow usage of our products. To start we are very proud of our "Get Your Business Online" program.
This is a campaign, which basically we work with our partners. We help small businesses and bring their companies
online. This is great for the business; it's great for the economy, and it's great for future ad spending.
So during Q3 we helped 7,000 U.S. businesses get online in places like Texas, Vermont, Kansas and Missouri. We also
drove multiple customer launches this year. Our teams have helped expand the footprint for Google Offers, our deals

business, to about 11 cities in the U.S. after our pilot last quarter in Portland.
Additionally, we continue to grow Chrome user base, which Larry talked about. The penetration continues to go with
our campaign called Better Web campaign. We've laid the foundation for Chromebooks, which I talked about. If you
haven't had a chance, if you fly Virgin America, you might have the opportunity to surf on a Chromebook in-flight.
Finally, we've been supporting the growth of Google+, which we're very excited about, building richer user experience
by connecting users with prominent public figures and celebrities, including will.i.am, all from right on stage; Britney
Spears, Richard Branson just to name a few.
In closing, we had a phenomenal Q3, and we hope to continue the good work for our customers, partners and users in
Q4. I will now turn it over to my partner and colleague, Susan, who will discuss the product performance this quarter.
Susan Wojcicki
Thanks, Nikesh. Let's start by talking about Search. We had another great quarter for search quality with over 100
launches. We improved our Preview feature, so that when you hover your mouse over a search result, a large thumbnail
of the site appears on the right. We also expanded the Sitelinks feature to include more links, with full snippets for each
link. A good example of this is when you search on Metropolitan Museum of Art. You can see links to exhibits, the
store and general information. What I love about features like these is they magically make Google easier to use.
The same goes for our new Speedy Flight Search option. When you enter a query like SFO to JFK and then click on the
fight link on the left-hand side panel, you can see all the different flight options. You can sort it in a variety of ways:
airline, pricing, non-stop, times and bring up a map, which shows the flight route and other potential destination and
prices. Flight Search combines IT expertise with Google technology. We are still very early with the product. Think of
this first version as the takeoff, not the final destination.
Turning to our Ads business, as Patrick mentioned before, our revenue growth was very strong. We are pleased with
the paid click loads, which increased this quarter while keeping ad quality high. After a number of quarters of strong
CPC growth, we continue to see year-on-year CPC growth. As we have said in the past, these average CPC metrics
incorporate a number of factors, including mix effects, such as mobile and emerging markets, as well as true changes to
keyword prices. It's also important to look at clicks and CPC metrics together since more clicks can often lead to
decreases in average CPC and vice versa.
We also made a number of improvements to our core-advertising product. Starting with the local and the
small-business market, we launched AdWords Express in the U.S. and started product trials in the U.K, Germany and
France. There are a lot of businesses who want to advertise online, and they haven't done so because they're too busy
running their business. AdWords Express makes it possible for these businesses to start running an ad campaign in just
a few minutes. The advertiser gives us some basic information, and we do all the rest. The key words and the bids are
automated. We're excited about this product because we believe it's the first time we've successfully simplified all
aspects of AdWords while keeping its effectiveness for local and small businesses, and the results so far are quite
positive with our advertisers.
With regard to the local market, we also expanded Google Offers to 11 cities. The latest launch was in Miami last
week.
On the other end of the spectrum are large businesses and agencies. We made a number of significant improvements to
Google Analytics this quarter, since we know that when site owners have more insights into site traffic and better
information about how to optimize their campaigns, they tend to increase their spend. This quarter we launched
multi-channel funnels in Google Analytics. This gives marketers aggregate information and insights into the full path to
conversion, including clicks from paid and organic searches and display ads, not simply the last click, so advertisers
can tell, which marketing and ad programs are working.
We also added real-time reporting to Google Analytics so that marketers and publishers can see what is happening on
their site right now. This is especially useful to measure the immediate impact of social media. So, if you put up a new

blog post or you send out a Google+ update, you can instantly see what happens to your site traffic. We also launched a
premium version of Analytics with more data, advanced tools, dedicated support and service-level guarantees.
Nikesh mentioned how well things are going with Display Advertising. From a product perspective, we'd like to
highlight interest category marketing. We completed rolling it out to all advertisers at the end of Q2 and since then,
thousands of advertisers have signed up and the annual run rate has doubled. With interest categories we look at the
types of pages a user visits and associates their browser with relevant interest categories, such as ecotourism, mobile
phones or hybrid cars. Then advertisers can show that user relevant ads across all types of sites. Users can opt out at
any time, but the result of interest category ads is that they are more useful users and more effective for advertisers,
which in turn leads to higher returns for publishers.
We are making it a lot easier for advertisers to set up and manage video ad campaigns on YouTube and the Google
Display Network as well. We began beta testing AdWords for video, which integrates video buying campaigns directly
into the AdWords interface.
The momentum around Google+ is starting to apply to our ad product as well. Users can now Plus One display ads on
the Google Display Network and have had Plus One buttons on search ads and results since the end of Q1. Although
it's still pretty early our data shows us that ads and results that are socially annotated are more relevant for users.
And finally, we shipped Google Wallet to Sprint Nexus S 4G phones and started working with Visa, American Express
and Discover as partners so their cards could be added to future versions of the apps. This morning I bought my latte
using my phone as a Wallet. I'm looking forward to leaving my traditional wallet at home in the future.
That's it for now. Thanks, and back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Susan. So, we'll circle back with Jamie to open up the call and take your questions. Thank you, Susan,
Nikesh, and Larry. So, everybody grab their handsets, and we are ready to go. Jamie, we'll we look for your
instructions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: You noted the proliferation of newer richer ad formats like product listing ads; can you help us
understand the impact on your financial model? Are they more or less profitable to you?
And then secondly, on your comments on Western European ad sales softness, is the softness across all formats or are
mobile and display holding up generally better? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thank you for your question, Brian. I think I'll ask Nikesh to answer that.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, I think we are constantly improving search, as well as improving our ad format. So, if you
look at our revenues, we will always be trying to drive new ad formats to our customers because we believe they
provide better information both to the user, as well as they are good for the advertiser.
Effectively, I'm not going to comment on the profitability of the ad formats except the fact that they're great for users
and advertisers and good ads are delivered, and if users click on them more, obviously, it will have an impact on the
financial. I will let you figure that one out.
In terms of my comments on Western European ad sales it was more of a relative comment vis-à-vis prior quarters as
opposed to an absolute comment about softness. Generally, we're seeing the economic impact in some of those markets

growing up; people are happier with mobile; people are happier in display. We're seeing search query growth. So, it's a
bit of a mix across-the-board, but this is not – this is slight softness, not weakness.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
<Q - Mark Stephen Mahaney>: Thanks. On that paid click growth that's a real sharp acceleration yet the organic
revenue growth didn't sharply accelerate. So, could you just provide some color on that? Is that just market shift
towards mobile searches? What's driving that? And secondly, what's behind that other revenue that really spiked as
well? Think you very much.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Mark. I'll let Susan take that. Susan?
<A - Susan Wojcicki>: Yeah. Hi, Mark. So, there were certainly a number of factors at play in terms of the CPC and
the paid click growth. But the most important thing that I want to emphasize is that it's really important to look at these
two factors together since they often move in reverse from one another. The other thing is there certainly was a mix
factor where we do see changes in our mix, and that sometimes does have impact on how our CPCs are – how the
aggregate winds up being affected.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Just on other revenue, let me comment on other revenue. It really is the year-over-year impact
of ITA. So, Mark, that's really the key issue there.
<Q - Mark Stephen Mahaney>: Thank you very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you. Let's go to the next question, please.

We'll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones if I could. First, Larry, on the $2.5 billion
mobile run rate revenue, could you give us a rough sense of how much of that is mobile search versus display perhaps?
And then the second question relates to the people strategy. Given, Larry, what you said about being at the edge of
what's manageable, should we expect head count growth to moderate in 4Q and into 2012? And are you contemplating
any sort of adjustments to base salaries as you saw earlier this year? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks for the question there. And I think that – I think we're not going to break out
more than we've already given you there. So, we thought it was important to show the tremendous success of that
business, and so we wanted to give a nice milestone for that, but we're not going to break out more data.
And also on head count, like I said, I had already said we're at the edge of what's manageable in terms of our head
count growth and you see our numbers, as I said, were consistent with last quarter. I think we are always running our
business very carefully and prudently and making sure we're investing in the right places, and we make those kind of
decisions every day, and we don't give guidance on what we're going to do in the future.

And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. A couple questions. First, could you discuss the
strategy around video content? It seems to me there's sort of UGC, premium and then all the stuff in between. Is that
how you're thinking about it? And if it is, how are you thinking about emphasizing each area?
And then just quickly on emerging markets you mentioned India and Brazil. Any chance you could quantify some of
that? How fast are these markets growing? How big are they overall? Are these top 10 markets? How big are they in
the overall scheme of the different countries? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, Ben, thanks for your question. I think we think about certainly YouTube is just
tremendously successful, and it's growing gangbusters in every way. And we see that site as redefining the way we
think about video. And I'd also note that it's very small percentage of people's overall video usage still. So, we see
opportunities for tremendous growth there.
I think another interesting thing about YouTube is it really blurs the lines between the kinds of content you're talking
about. You can move from one type of content to another very easily, and we're finding our users don't really think
about it that way. They think about having a great user experience, and we see it as serving our users well and serving
all the content creators well, regardless of their size. And that seems to be working great for us.
And for the second part, Nikesh will take that.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: We're not going to break out numbers for India and Brazil, but what I can give you directionally
is both of them are very, very important markets for us. Our products are successful. You see search traffic continuing
to rise. YouTube is very popular. Chrome is very popular. So, we're very happy with the usage of our products and
really there's tremendous sort of runway in product usage in those markets because of the changing characteristics of
those markets, both from an online penetration perspective and the economic growth perspective of those markets.
So with that sort of tailwind behind us, we have great teams on the ground, which are driving businesses to come
online, and we're seeing tremendous growth on the ad side pretty much across the board in display, search and mobile.
So, we're very, very happy with the success in those markets, the progress in those markets. I'll just give you that as a
directional statement.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question. Let's go to the next question, please.

And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Good afternoon, and sorry for the background noise. I'm at the airport. I wanted to ask if
you could give us a sense for how much growth in mobile impacted paid click growth this quarter, and how sustainable
you think that level is? And also if you could just tell us a little bit on the progress you're seeing in narrowing the gap
between CPCs between mobile and traditional search? Thank you.
<A - Susan Wojcicki>: Hello. Yeah, this is Susan here. So, first of all, we don't really break out how mobile impacted
any specific part of paid growth or CPC. I will say that our ad system is designed to be very flexible. There are always
lots of different factors at play that we see changing in terms of users, queries, advertisers, bids. And so really we are
designing our ad system to be flexible based on what we're seeing at that specific moment.
In terms of narrowing the gap in CPC of mobile and traditional search, we see a lot of opportunity for us to continue to
grow mobile. And for example, advertisers having landing pages that are mobile enabled, we can continue to improve a
lot of our algorithms so we see opportunities for us to continue to improve that over time.

<A - Lawrence E. Page>: I would mention too, Heather, that the mobile phones are just getting amazing and you'll see
our work there and other people's works coming up. But I think that your experience on phone could actually get to be
better than your experience on a computer. I mean, the phone knows where you are and can help you even when you're
mobile, and so on. So, we definitely see that the experience on mobile improving greatly especially with Android.
<A - Susan Wojcicki>: We've introduced a number of formats, just kind of building on Larry's points, so we have
advertisers we can give location, we can actually say if you searched on one specific store, that store is 0.1 miles from
where you're located right now with a map. Or include a phone number when you click on the phone number then that's
like a CPC. So, we're seeing that there are a lot of formats that we can really optimize for mobile, which will make for a
great user and advertiser experience.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question. Let's go to the next question, please, Jamie .
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. Larry, I know you have to be careful because of litigation, but maybe you could help us
understand what steps Google can take to help defend the Android ecosystem on a big picture basis? There's a lot of
questions about some licensing threats out there.
And then secondly, maybe just for Patrick, can you tell us what verticals performed well in the quarter? I know you've
been able to do that in the past, but, which verticals really did well in the quarter and maybe others that might have
been a little slower? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks, Justin, for your question. I think we are very – like I mentioned, we're very
excited about Android, and we see our partners and the whole ecosystem continuing to grow hugely. And while there's
been lots of people trying to attack that, and so on, we see absolutely no signs that that's effective and ultimately we
think that other companies' actions there will alienate their customers and their relationships with the other companies.
So, if anything, we see our strategy as getting stronger there. Obviously, we announced our intention around Motorola,
and we're serious about protecting the Android ecosystem and making sure that, that continues to be incredibly
successful, but we feel good about our efforts there.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: And on my side, Justin, look, we were again quite a reflection of the economy around us. So,
the U.S., some of the verticals that have been stronger: travel, auto. You go to rest of world, interestingly retail, which
is not as strong in the U.S. than it would be in the rest of the world because there's more activity in real estate and retail
in rest of world. In the case of the U.K, automobiles have been kind of particularly strong. And so these are the kind of
verticals. Again, they are a snapshot and a reflection of the economy around us. And maybe Nikesh has kind of more
color commentary on it.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: No, I think you got it. I agree with everything Patrick said. I think the only sort of non-secular
event that's happening is that we are continuing to see strength in the CPG verticals because we are doing well in
Display and CPG are traditionally verticals that advertise more in display so there was a bit of an opportunity there,
whereas search wasn't their prime focus, but those guys are doing really well with the display offerings we have for
them. But I agree with Patrick with everything else.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Justin. Let's go to the next question, please.

And we'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

think you can do differently in the space?
And then secondly, I know this is probably tougher, but just related to MMI, we've obviously seen examples in the past
around CPTN and Intel and McAfee around writing and concessions in certain ways. Is that something that Google
would potentially be willing to do in terms of licensing patents to open source software? And then also delivering
product updates and roadmaps at the same time, as for MMI? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: I think Nikesh will take the first question there.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you for your question. It's early days for Google Offers. As I mentioned we have
expanded from one Portland trial to over 11 cities in the U.S., and we are leveraging some of the sales efforts we
already have with our ads business. We're leveraging our relationships with small, medium sized businesses. Google
Offers for us is just one part of an overall opportunity to work with SMB. So, it certainly is we're very happy with the
progress we've made so far. You might have seen us launch Google Wallet. It is also part of an enablement strategy for
that. So, so far so good. Very pleased with the progress so far.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: As you know, Motorola deal is under review and I think it would be premature for us to
comment about anything we might do with regards to that.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question, Doug. Let's go to our next question, please, Jamie.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Great. Thanks. I just had two questions. In certain areas like shopping, payments, travel,
reviews and mortgages, the company seems to continue to get deeper into the purchase funnel or closer to the actual
transaction. And, Susan, you noted the ITA example on the call. I was wondering if you could talk a little more broadly
about this more vertical approach, the benefits of it and the categories that you're particularly focused on?
And then secondly, non-cash stock-based comp, I think, was up 31% sequential and 50% year-over-year. Patrick, you
noted the annual grant. I was just wondering if this is the new run rate or if there was something one-time? Or
potentially there's been a change in the cash versus non-cash comp? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't I answer the last question first, and then flip it over to Susan. I mean, you're seeing
the full-year impact of our salary raises last year flowing through in all aspects of our compensation. So, when we did
the equity refresh this quarter, obviously it's augmented by the fact that people have 10% more salary and all of the
corollary issues around it. So, it is a one-time item, but you're changing the plateau, if you wish, and then that will flow
through into next year and then it will stabilize itself. That's the best way to think about it. And then on the issue of the
verticalization, I'll let Larry take a crack at it, please.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. I think that we really think about Google as providing the exact right
answers when you need them, and those things are not necessarily particular websites or whatever, they're actually –
you may be actually trying to get a very specific piece of information like you do with an airline ticket for example, as
we were talking about. So, I think we see this as a general instance of a problem of just making search work better
across anything you might want to be able to do. And we're pursuing that in a lot of different areas, and have for our
whole history, basically. So, I think you'll see us do a better job of providing a great user experience on more and more
specific things over time, and that's what we do when we make a better search engine.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't we go to the next question? Thank you for your question there, Scott.

We'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Thanks, guys. I've got two questions. First, a quick follow-up on Android. So, we've seen some
of the Android partners now agreeing to pay Microsoft licensing fees. So, in order to protect the ecosystem, is Google
planning on subsidizing a portion of these fees? Or is there – how does that strategy play out?
And then second question on Google Wallet. Is the long-term plan here to partner with other financial transmitters like
PayPal and maybe the credit card networks for some of the heavy lifting in the payment space? Or does Google plan on
vertically integrating with the banking system to offer customer service and risk management around transactions for
the Google Wallet customers? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Well, thanks, Ross, for your questions. I think that, I'll maybe answer just kind of generally.
Rather than seeing for example, Microsoft compete in the marketplace with their own smartphones, they've really –
they've continued resorting to legal measures to hassle their own customers, right? So it seems kind of odd. And we
haven't seen the details of those total agreements, and I suspect that our partners are making good deals for themselves
there. And so while there's a lot of press around that, we're really looking forward to our announcements with Samsung
next week, which I think will be very exciting, and like I said, we see Android going gangbusters, and we don't see
anything that's going to stop that.
On your second question about Google Wallet, and so on, I think we're very early, we just released a phone with Sprint,
the Nexus S with Sprint that's sold out, and has had tremendous demand, and we think that for customers who've gotten
that experience are amazingly excited about it, and like Susan mentioned, she can buy her coffee that way, and that's an
amazing experience, and we're just at the very early stages of that.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Larry for your answer. Why don't we go, Jamie, to the next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Jeetil Patel with DB.
<Q - Jeetil Patel>: Hi. A couple of questions. Can you talk about in the Mobile business as a whole, how do you
structure some of the revenue-sharing agreements that you have on the advertising side relative to in-browser searches,
and I guess, who is it typically that you're typically paying for that distribution, the wireless carriers, the handset
vendors, and how do you see that evolve going forward?
And then I have a quick follow-up around vertical integration. You've seen companies launch new devices, hardware
wise to layer on top of some of the content and applications they sit on. You've obviously looked at Motorola now and
you're stacking from hardware, OS, into the applications environment. Do you think that, as you look at mobility, the
world – there's a unique opportunity to develop a much richer, deeper relationship, and I guess maybe little bit more
elaboration on the vertical integration there that you're looking at?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, I mean, I think it's an exciting time. There's a lot of innovation going on in different
business models, and so on, and I think we're very excited about our Android ecosystem and the growth of that. And I
think we have very, very successful strategy there, as you see from the numbers, that we talked about over 190 million
devices, and growing quickly. So, I think there's many – you're asking about different kinds of structures, but we're
very, very excited about the structure we have now and about continuing that growth and continuing to evolve that
platform ecosystem.
And maybe Nikesh can take the second part there.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Right. I think – thank you, Larry. I think Larry is right, there are many interesting models out
there. As you know, Android is an open ecosystem and our mobile strategy is a very partner-focused strategy. So, in
many cases, we work with various partners to deliver the experience to the end user. And there are different partners,
there are different value they bring to the equation, whether it's distribution, whether it's making Google Search part of
their services, whether it's allowing us to be an ad serving platform there, so each of the relationships is slightly

different, and they have different negotiated deals with them, but generally speaking, I think we believe there is a fair
value transfer to whoever in the ecosystem brings value to the table, and we get our fair share for providing services in
that ecosystem.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: We're just saying we've been very successful with these models on the web, and we have a
lot of experience with it and I think we're good at doing those kind of deals.
<Q - Jeetil Patel>: It seems like owning content at least in the mobile space seems to be a differentiator. Is that
something that you possibly look at longer-term, is that owning more of the content structure out there?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: I think again, we're not going to comment on what we might or might not do. I think that
we've had very, very successful models for a long time without owning content, and I think in many of the models you
see, don't involve people owning content, but actually selling it or distributing it in various ways, and I expect that will
continue.

Operator
And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason Maynard>: Hi, good afternoon, guys. One of the threads through a lot of these questions on the mobile
market is, how do you increase monetization and kind of where we're at. And I think one of the things I'd love to get
your view on is, where are we at in the process of bringing together some of the disparate local services? How does
Offers intertwine? And when does that sort of take on a little bit more of a unified feel versus sort of a set of one-off
products that a user would use?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. I think that's a great question. I think the first thing to keep in mind is
that we're still very early in the mobile business, and you see it's incredibly exciting business. There's a lot of activity;
the user experiences are getting tremendously better, and just growing like crazy, and there's a lot of economic activity,
and so on.
So we've done well by having a long-term view of that, and I think that we also sort of want to balance having total
integration with really fast iteration and fast progress and experimentation. And I think you definitely – I mentioned our
unified look and feel that we've rolled out on Google, which I'm very excited about, and we'll continue to do things like
that that really unify the experience and make it more intuitive for people, but we're also going to do some
experimentation also on new things, and have a little bit less integrated things, so it's always a mix of that.
I think that Offers specifically, we think about our local business as being, how do we help merchants and users, users
like yourself, get really good information, and help the merchants get the right users at the right time and for the right
amount of money, and so on. And that's a very hard problem across a whole bunch of different areas, basic information
about merchants, interaction between the merchants and the end users, and we have things going on in all of those
spaces. And it's going to be a mix of, again, rapid iteration, and also, the integration of those things into then a more
cohesive whole, and I'm very excited about that space.
Okay. Our next question?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Thank you very much. I have two, but the first question is for Patrick or Susan.
You cited your mobile business as a run rate, which was very helpful. I was wondering if you could do the same for
your Display business? I'm particularly interested in YouTube, and so if you could comment on pricing and volume

trends at YouTube in the quarter, at least directionally, that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-up.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So we – as you know, we don't provide any guidance. We had this extraordinary moment this
quarter in Mobile where we had the confluence of so many things going on, and that we thought it was on a one-time
basis, again, appropriate to kind of provide you a number of users, the Android ecosystem that's going gangbusters.
And therefore, it was we thought appropriate to kind of round it up with a kind of a snapshot of where we stand. So, for
that reason, right, and because of the competitive nature of the environment in which we are, we don't divulge typically
these numbers. And you shouldn't expect us to actually give you more information in the future on them, whether it be
display or mobile or others.
In the case of YouTube, it's the same thing. I mean, as Larry said, we're incredibly pleased about the growth of
YouTube, whether it be the number of videos viewed a day, the revenue growth rates, the performance overall of the
content, and the ad system within it. So, I mean, all I can say is this is the really, really kind of well-growing property
for us in which we're really excited.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Okay. Thanks. And then just for Larry, I'm just wondering if you could comment
on your broader media strategy? Unlike traditional cable providers, the Google platform isn't limited by geography. It's
not limited by the contiguous networks or territories. So, I just wonder – there's been some conversation in the
marketplace about a multi-channel video offering in the U.S. to supplement your media product. And so I'm just
wondering if you could talk a little bit about that? Even just philosophically, that would be helpful.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, it's hard to talk about what we might do in the future again. But I think in general, I
just think there's a lot of opportunity in providing better services for end users around media. And you see that. I mean,
there's tremendous growth in all these businesses that are doing that. And I think we're obviously in a good position to
help users find the content and the media, and so on that they're looking for. And we're in a great position to also help
those companies and publishers and authors and content creators to find the right users, and get paid both through
advertising and directly. And so I think that's just a logical place for us to be, and a logical place where you'll see a lot
of activity in general.
Take the next question?
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jim Friedland with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Jim Friedland>: Thanks. Two questions. First, you talked about shutting 20 products, and you've dumped some
further products in Q1, I believe. Is there any way you can give us sort of a percentage in terms of how much resource
that opens up? Is that sort of a 10% increase? Or any kind of color you can give us there?
And then second, at what level of Google+ users do you need to see material improvement in ROI in search to really
move the needle for the business there, just maybe in terms of active users? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, I think those are great questions, Jim. Thank you. I think that I'm not prepared to give
you specific numbers about projects we shut down or whatever. But I will tell you it's been a pretty significant effort
we've had to really streamline our business. And we've made, like I said, tough decisions about where we should be
focusing, so that we really can generate amazing products and businesses. And those are not easy decisions. So, I think
there's significant resources involved in the kinds of things we're talking about. And it's a fair amount of work also for
us to just go through those, that process. But I'm excited about that increased focus for us.
I think, as I mentioned on Google+, I think we're seeing tremendous growth, which I'm very excited about. We're still
very, very early. It's been out just slightly more than one quarter now, and not even fully open until only for a very
small part of that. And so I think we're very early in that. But on the other hand, I encourage you all to try out Google+
and sign up and [ph] try out (53:02) to it, and you'll find that you will see data on search about what other people are

doing. You'll see someone had +1 something or so on. And I think those things can be very meaningful to you as a
user. So, I have no doubt that there'll be a significant impact from that.
<Q - Jim Friedland>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: We have time for one more question. So, Jamie, could you give us the last question, please?
Operator
Thank you, sir. That final question will come from Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just two brief ones. First on Chrome and
your efforts there to expand penetration. Can you talk about the specific drivers of growing distribution, adoption?
Maybe how we might expect this to impact margins over time?
And then secondly, the growth in the Google site revenues. I wonder if you could add just a little bit of color there on
the specific uptick if that's an acceleration from display on YouTube, as well as mobile? Or is that core search related?
Thanks very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: I'll take the latter and then maybe Nikesh will cover the Chrome. On the latter, the answer is
yes, yes, yes, and yes. So, yes, YouTube, yes, mobile, yes, formats. And that's, I mean, that's why you see such an
acceleration of our revenue, and that's why were so excited about it.
Maybe, Nikesh, if you have comments on the Chrome and our penetration, and how it's working.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I'd love to answer a question like Patrick: yes, yes, yes. But unfortunately that's not the question
[laughter] No, it's fine. As far as Chrome is concerned, as we have talked about in previous quarters, Chrome is very
strategic for us because we believe it is a phenomenal user experience and user benefit. It just improves the user
browsing experience so phenomenally that we believe it's important that Chrome be distributed, shared with almost
every user around the world. And a lot of our marketing efforts and distribution efforts have been focused around
getting Chrome in the hands of our users.
We are doing distribution with partners. Our partners encourage people to download Chrome. We're doing distribution
where we do direct advertising with consumers to get them to download Chrome with a clear user benefit of better
browsing, better video watching and better security. So, we are doing a lot of that. I think another comment on the
margin part, but you have to understand: a great consumer experience from Google as part of Chrome makes users use
more Google services. So, from that perspective we're very happy with the distribution strategy we have on Chrome,
and we don't see any abatement of that strategy.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thanks very much.
Lawrence E. Page
I want to thank everyone for all the time that you spend with us. We had a great quarter, very excited about our
progress so far. And I also want to thank all of our employees who work so hard to make these results that you all see.
So, thank you all very much.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, we'll let you close the call.
