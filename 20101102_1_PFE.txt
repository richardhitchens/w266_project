MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being
recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Charles E. Triano, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2010
performance, 2010 financial guidance, and 2012 long-range targets. I'm here with Jeff Kindler, Frank D'Amelio, Ian
Read, and other members of our leadership team.

Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
Thanks, Chuck, and hello, everyone.
I'd like to start by making five key points: First, for the third consecutive full quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal,
we are reporting solid operating performance. Second, given this performance and our continued confidence in the
business, we are increasing both the top end and the bottom end of our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range.
Third, we are once again reaffirming the financial targets that we've set out for 2012. It's important to emphasize that
we are raising this year's guidance and reaffirming the 2012 targets despite uncertainty in the global economy, strong
competitive challenges, and significant changes in the regulatory and public policy environment across the markets in
which we operate. Fourth, consistent with our commitment to enhancing total shareholder value, we are continuing to
return cash to our owners. During the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased a total of $1 billion in
stock at an average price of $16.40 per share. And finally, fifth, also consistent with that commitment, we are on track
to pay nearly $6 billion in dividends this year. As we have previously stated, barring any unforeseen circumstances, we
expect the board of directors to raise the dividend in December, and we continue to target a dividend payout ratio
comparable to the current industry average in about three years.
Now, on the subject of capital allocation, I want to highlight a particularly important point illustrated this quarter. As
we said we would do, we have continued to deploy your capital in disciplined business development activities that
allow us to shape our balanced business portfolio in order to maximize shareholder value. And I'd like to spend a few
minutes this morning discussing the deals we announced since the beginning of September in the context of the
balanced business portfolio that I described on last quarter's earnings call.
First let me review briefly the context. We closed the Wyeth acquisition just over a year ago, and since then we have
moved quickly to integrate the companies to achieved our planned cost synergies, and to deliver solid financial
performance from the combined company. The people and assets that Wyeth brought to us, together with the changes
we have made in our leadership, culture, and operating model over the last three years, have positioned us to deliver
three important things: One, producing steady, reliable, adjusted earnings growth over time. Two, returning cash to
shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And three, making disciplined internal and external investments in
innovative new treatments and cures that produce good returns on your capital.
The foundation for these results is the dynamic portfolio of businesses, products, geographies, and areas of research
that balances both our risks and our opportunities. That portfolio enables us to advance our strategies of growing our
patent-protected portfolio in priority therapeutic areas, in vaccines and biologics, in Established Products, in Emerging
Markets, and in appropriate Diversified businesses. Now, each of the five actions that we recently announced
significantly advances these strategies and helps us further balance our portfolio, businesses, and products.
And let me show you what I mean. In Primary Care, which currently accounts for about a third of our revenues, we
have identified pain as one of our "Invest to Win" therapeutic areas, because of our strong capabilities in this area and
because of the growing market for this condition of unmet medical need. Our pending acquisition of King
Pharmaceuticals will provide an excellent complement to our current portfolio of pain treatments, which ranges from
Advil and ThermaCare to Celebrex and Lyrica, as well as several promising pipeline candidates. King is a leader in
new formulations of pain treatments designed to discourage common methods of misuse and abuse. King's assets will

provide Pfizer with multiple new drug delivery platforms, as well as potential long-term upside in our Primary Care
Established Products, as well as in our Animal Health business.
Now, in Specialty Care, which generates almost a quarter of our revenues, we have strengthened our presence in the
growing orphan diseases market by acquiring FoldRx, a privately held drug discovery and clinical development
company. FoldRx brings us an oral, once-daily small molecule candidate with the potential to treat a fatal genetic
neurodegenerative disease for which a liver transplant currently is the only available treatment. It brings us greater
understanding of protein misfolding, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying cause in many chronic
degenerative diseases.
Meanwhile, in Established Products, which accounts for about an eighth of our revenues, our alliance with Biocon,
India's leading biotech company, will advance our strategies in biosimilars and will position us competitively in the
diabetes market over time. This is important in the developing world, where patients' uninterrupted access to insulin is
often very difficult, as well as in developed countries like the United States, where the CDC just announced that up to
one-third of the population could be living with diabetes within a generation.
Turning to our Emerging Markets business, which produces about an eighth of our revenues, we agreed last month to
acquire 40% of Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro, a privately held company in Brazil with approximately 250 branded and
unbranded generic pharmaceuticals in more than 400 presentations. This partnership will give us access to a large
network of independent distributors that reach more than 36,000 pharmacies in rural and suburban Brazil and
customers that Pfizer is not currently reaching. This agreement also includes the opportunity to commercialize Teuto's
products outside Brazil, which we believe offers substantial promise for both our Emerging Markets and our
Established Products business.
Finally, within our Diversified businesses, which accounts for about an eighth of our revenues, we announced that we
are reviewing strategic alternatives for Capsugel. I've said before that review of the role, fit, and value creation of each
of our businesses is part of our ongoing review of our dynamic business portfolio. We will continue to optimize our
portfolio of businesses and products in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Capsugel represents a unique
business with strong potential for growth outside of Pfizer, and now is the right time to undertake this review.
It's worth noting that each of these business development actions came about as a result of the speed, focus, and agility
that characterize our business unit operating model. Around here we use the phrase "the power of scale, the spirit of
small." These announcements demonstrated that concept in action. Because our respective business unit leaders and
their teams understand their distinct customers, marketplaces, and competitors, they saw the chance to create value, and
they moved quickly to bring these opportunities forward. For our part, corporate level leadership ensured that the right
hurdle rates were applied, that there was appropriate discipline around price and terms, and that Pfizer's scale and
resources were brought to bear when appropriate. Once the deals are closed, the leaders of the relevant business units
will be accountable for the success of each of these deals.
Now, in addition to our business development activities, we continue of course to advance our late-stage development
pipeline, and we have several important milestones ahead. Next week at the American College of Rheumatology, we
will provide an update on the development of tasocitinib, our oral JAK inhibitor, and we will present Phase III data
from our initial study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we remain on track to submit regulatory
applications for an adult indication for Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and Europe by the end of this year. Pfizer has completed
its Phase III trials in support of these regulatory submissions.
With respect to apixaban, our Factor Xa inhibitor, based on the strength of the preliminary Phase III AVERROES study
data, our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week that the companies have initiated a rolling submission with
the FDA under the trade name ELIQUIS for people with atrial fibrillation that is unsuitable for treatment with warfarin.
And finally, in the first half of next year we anticipate filing with the FDA for crizotinib, our novel, personalized agent
for people with lung cancer.
To wrap up, I believe our results this quarter, like each quarter since we closed the Wyeth deal, demonstrate that the
changes we have been making at Pfizer have enabled us to deliver steady, consistent adjusted earnings results, to return

cash to shareholders and to make disciplined investments in medicines that will produce good returns for our
shareholders. And we are doing so consistently, despite global economic headwinds, currency fluctuations, competitive
challenges, and regulatory and public policy uncertainties. That is because today our company has a dynamic portfolio
of businesses that represents a good balance of risks and opportunities across products, geographies, technologies, and
customers. We continuously review our portfolio. We're relentlessly focused on cost productivity and capital discipline.
And our culture emphasizes focus and accountability. We have the benefits that come with the scale and resources of a
large company, but our business unit operating model allows us to move with the agility necessary to seize valuable
opportunities like the ones I described this morning.
With that, I'll ask Frank to review our third quarter results.
Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Jeff; good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.
Now let's move on to the third quarter financial results. The 4.6 billion or 39% year-over-year increase in third quarter
2010 revenues was primarily attributable to the addition of legacy Wyeth products, which favorably impacted revenues
by 5.2 billion or 44%, partially offset by a 458 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products and a
160 million or 1% negative impact foreign exchange.
The year-over-year decrease in third quarter 2010 reported net income and reported diluted EPS was due to a non-cash
impairment charge resulting from updated forecasts of certain Wyeth assets compared with the fair values estimated at
the closing of the acquisition last year. This pre-tax charge of approximately 1.5 billion consists of IP R&D charges of
about 715 million and brand assets and developed technology charges of approximately 750. These updated cash flow
projections are based on the most recently projected development regulatory timeframes and the current market
environments for brand assets and their planned investment support. I want to point out that we do not expect these
updated projections to have an impact on our 2012 revenue or adjusted diluted EPS targets, which we are reaffirming
today.
It's also important to remember that while there have been acquired assets whose projected values have decreased, there
are acquired assets whose projected values have increased as well. However, these increases are not reflected in our
third quarter financial statements because current accounting rules require that we record asset value decreases or
impairments but do not allow us to record asset value increases subsequent to Day Zero. In addition, reported net
income and reported diluted EPS in the quarter were negatively impacted by a charge for asbestos litigation of $701
million.
The increases in adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were primarily due to revenues from legacy Wyeth
products, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the addition of Wyeth operations, lower aggregate
revenues from legacy Pfizer products, and higher net interest expense. Also, it's important to remember that both
reported and adjusted diluted EPS were affected by the increased number of shares outstanding compared with the
year-ago quarter because of shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
Third quarter adjusted total costs were negatively impacted, primarily by the addition of Wyeth operations, which was
partially offset by a 4% positive impact from foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of
revenue from 15.4% to 18.3% was primarily due to the change in the mix of products and businesses resulting from the
addition of Wyeth operations, which was partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange. The 43% increase
in adjusted SI&A expenses and 33% increase in R&D expenses were also driven by the addition of Wyeth operations.
Also, driven by our continued investment in our late-stage development portfolio, which contributed to this increase.
In the third quarter 2010, foreign exchange had a negative impact of 160 million on revenues and a positive impact of
298 million on adjusted total cost. The net effect of foreign exchange resulted in a $0.01 favorable impact to adjusted
diluted EPS.

Revenues from our Biopharmaceutical business increased 3.3 billion or 31% in the third quarter, with operational
growth of 33%, of which 3.9 billion or 37% was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, which was partially offset by a
468 million or 4% decrease in revenues from legacy Pfizer products.
It's important to remember that Pfizer's annual international calendar ends on November the 30th, and as a result, third
quarter includes international results for June, July, and August. As we've previously stated on our second quarter
earnings call, June was an unfavorable quarter for the euro, and therefore this negative impact was reflected in our third
quarter results. Also, I want to point out that within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer's year-over-year
operational performance continues to be impacted by the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including Lipitor,
which lost exclusivity in Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July of 2010.
Third quarter Diversified revenues increased approximately 1.3 billion or 151% year over year due to the addition of
Wyeth products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues in the third quarter was immaterial.
Third quarter revenues generated in Emerging Markets, which include both legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth
Biopharmaceutical and Diversified operations, increased 66% versus the third quarter of 2009 due to the significant
contribution of legacy Wyeth products.
It's important to note that over the same period, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico, and Turkey contributed a
combined 46% to the overall growth in Emerging Markets. And legacy Pfizer Biopharmaceutical revenues in these
BRICMT markets grew 5% operationally in the third quarter and 10% operationally year to date.
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2010, we are updating the ranges of our 2010
guidance. We are tightening the revenue range to 67 to 68 billion, decreasing and tightening the range of adjusted cost
of sales as a percentage of revenue to 18.5% to 19%, tightening our adjusted SI&A expense range to 19.2 to 19.7
billion, tightening the adjusted R&D expense range to 9.1 to 9.5 billion, expected adjusted other deductions to be
approximately 1 billion, maintaining our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income at approximately 30%,
decreasing the reported diluted EPS range to $0.84 to $0.89, and finally, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted
diluted EPS range to 2.17 to 2.22.
As we previously stated and forecasted, the adjusted diluted EPS range absorbs Effexor's loss of exclusivity in the U.S.
in July, two fewer selling days in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, and Lipitor's loss of exclusivity in
Canada in May of 2010 and Spain in July 2010. In addition, the range now reflects the impact of our recently
announced collaboration with Biocon and the up-front payment that was included. Consequently, we expect these
factors in the aggregate to negatively impact our fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07,
which has been factored into our 2010 guidance.
Based on our confidence in our future business performance, we are reaffirming all elements of our 2012 financial
targets. These targets incorporate the anticipated impact of U.S. healthcare legislation, as does our 2010 guidance. And
our 2012 targets continue to assume a modest level of business development activities, up to 5% of our revenue target.
So moving on to key takeaways. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved solid overall operational
performance while at the same time advancing the integration of Wyeth with minimal business disruption. We have
tightened the ranges of all components of our 2010 financial guidance, including increasing and narrowing the adjusted
diluted EPS range, 2.17 to 2.22. And we have reaffirmed all of our 2012 financial targets. We remain on target to
deliver our anticipated cost reductions, including achieving approximately 50% in 2010. During the third quarter, we
repurchased approximately $500 million of Pfizer shares, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share
repurchases as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are advancing our strategic priorities through our recently
announced review of strategic opportunities for our Capsugel business, collaboration with Biocon and pending
collaboration with Teuto, and acquisition of FoldRx and pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals.
Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck.

Thanks for the review, Frank. At this point, operator, if we could please poll for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Great, thanks very much. Just a first question – I guess a couple questions on Prevnar. First, ex
U.S. it looks like much of the franchise has now converted over to the – or a decent portion – to the 13-valent version
of Prevnar, yet we haven't seen a significant ramp in levels relation to Wyeth legacy levels. Could you just elaborate a
little bit more what's happening with Prevnar internationally, maybe talk about price dynamics, as well as the impact
that Synflorix is having on the business?
My second question was on gross margins. Even adjusting for the FX benefit this quarter, where you picked up a strong
benefit in the quarter considering the loss of Effexor. Was there anything unusual here, or just – are we starting to see
some of the benefits of restructuring – or just anything else we should be aware of? And as a follow-up to that, how are
you thinking about trough gross margins as you consider the patent expiration of Lipitor late next year? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Okay, Ian?
<A - Ian Read>: So Chris, on Prevnar internationally, we're approved in 72 countries. We've launched in 45. We're on
22 NIPs, and there's about, I think, 11 more coming. I think the volume is doing well. In markets where it is the
physician's choice on Prevnar, we have about a 70% to 80% share of that marketplace. And I would say on the overall
Emerging Markets, the only – we're winning where we expect to win and probably the only market where we haven't
won, which is a disappointment, was Brazil, where Synflorix took the NIP in Brazil.
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And on the gross margin question,
Chris, let me just run some numbers, and then I'll answer the question. Our cost of sales guidance at the beginning of
the year was 19% to 20%. We lowered that to 18.5% to 19% this quarter. Now, for the quarter, cost of sales was 18.3%.
If you remove the benefits of foreign exchange that they had on COGS this quarter, 18.3 becomes 19.7. But the overall,
I'll call it strength, in our cost of goods sold is really being driven by our restructuring, our focus on cost reduction, all
of the things that we've been doing to really manage our cost structure. So nothing unusual, to answer your question
specifically. It's really based on the actions that we've been taking.
In terms of beyond Lipitor, the last part of your question, I think if you look at the rhythm of the business and where the
growth is, the growth will put some pressure on our gross margins but not on our operating margins. If you look at our
targets for 2012, we have operating margins in the high 30s to low 40s which is where operating margins are today. So
even though some of that growth will have lower gross margins than it does today, they'll have lower expenses, and we
believe we can maintain our operating margins.
Operator
Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Just to continue on Prevnar, can you talk about – it seemed very strong in the U.S. Was there
anything unusual there? And then on inventories for any of the products just versus second quarter, third quarter, any
major movements? And then maybe also if you could talk about Lipitor a little bit in the rest of the world and the
Emerging Market being a little weaker than we were expecting. Thanks.
<A - Ian Read>: Prevnar in the U.S. was nothing unusual in the third quarter. It is mainly driven by the impact of the
price increase and the impact of the catch-up on demand. So it was pretty much in line where we expected. No major
inventory movements on Prevnar in the U.S. in the quarter. And then -

<A - Charles E. Triano, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Lipitor.
<A - Ian Read>: Lipitor internationally was impacted by the LOE in Canada and the LOE in Spain, and in the quarter
it had about a negative $200 million impact on us. It was slightly faster than we expected. Both those markets have
been traditionally slower to see brand erosion. Spain is a brand-loyal market, and Canada was normally less aggressive
than the U.S. We didn't see that with Lipitor in this quarter, so that was a $200 million impact. And overall in the
international market, it's been somewhat impacted in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia with price decreases.
<A - Charles E. Triano, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks. Next question, operator?
Operator
Your next question from John Boris from Citi Investment.
<Q - John Boris>: Thanks for taking the question. Just has to do with one of the statements in your press release. Can
you just expand maybe a little bit on the price pressures and help quantify what you saw in Eastern European countries
and markets in terms of price pressures? You also indicated that there was some wholesaler purchasing patterns that
honestly influenced the weaker ex U.S. sales results. And then the third part of that same question relates to the
Emerging Markets, which appeared to be flat ex China. Just any additional granularity or commentary on that? Thanks.
<A - Ian Read>: So I might say, Chris – sorry, John. Why don't I take the Emerging Markets first? They were flat in
the quarter. And we've always said Emerging Markets would be volatile. If you look at the, as Frank mentioned, at the
BRIC markets or the BRICMT market, up 5% in the quarter. Up 10% year to date. The impact in the third quarter
across all Emerging Market is really focused in Eastern Europe and Russia, with a little bit of Asia. We're seeing price
increases in Romania, Czech Republic, Taiwan, Thailand. And inventory or wholesale inventory reductions specifically
in Russia as they adjust to the economic situation. We expect to see some softness continuing, I think, in Russia in the
fourth quarter.
But overall when we look at it and take out the price decreases and the inventory adjustments, our unit growth is
running at about 10% in the Emerging Markets. And then when you look at that and you look at – an interesting fact, if
you compare the launch sequencing between developed markets and Emerging Market, we have about 22 launches in
the Emerging Markets that we will do in '11 and '12, which is a very different pattern from the launches in developed
markets.
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And if I could punctuate something Ian
said, that typically in Europe we expect pricing pressure in the low single digits. On the last earnings call we talked
about that being in the mid-single digits, and the second half of the year, that is indeed what we are experiencing. We're
experiencing pricing pressure in Europe in the mid-single digits overall.
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Anderson>: Oh, hi. I'm not sure if anyone's there to answer pipeline questions, but I've got a couple, which
is on the JAK-3 inhibitor, we have data coming up November 10. I'm wondering when the next Phase III is likely to
report out beyond November 10? And also, are we likely to see any interim radiographic data report out in the first half
of 2011? And on Prevnar 13 in adults, I'm just wondering when we might see that immunogenicity data that you'll file
on. And can you reiterate your thoughts about whether FDA will require the capita outcomes study for approval, which
I think Wyeth used to say was not going to be required?
<A - Ian Read>: So on the Prevnar adults, we're filing in the fourth quarter. We expect you'll see the results in the first
half of '11. And we believe we can file that that capita data.

Your next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. A question both for Jeff and to Frank. Jeff, in relation to your plans to consider
alternatives for Capsugel, does this signal a change in your view about keeping the other non-core assets, such as
Animal Health – Animal Health, Consumer, and Nutritionals? And how much time are you giving yourself? I
appreciated your opening comments. It sounds like you are obviously managing the portfolio dynamically. But how
much time are you giving yourself to make a decision with respect to these other assets, especially given where the
multiple is in the stock? And I think that would beg the question that maybe investors don't appreciate some of these
other assets.
And my other question, both for you and to Frank, is that it is very good to see the continued share repurchase
programs, but 500 million still reflects a relatively lackluster pace, especially given your low stock P/E multiple and 20
billion in operating cash flow. So my question is this: Is this the pace that we should come to expect, or do you see an
opportunity to be more aggressive, especially in light of record-low borrowing costs? And I would also like to know
how you think the IRRs on whatever M&A you might be considering would compare to the IRRs on share repurchase
programs? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Okay, Jami, I'll take the first question. As I said
before, my view hasn't changed about this. I said previously, and I said it again this morning, that we are engaged in a
continuous review of the role of each of our businesses, not frankly just even the ones you mentioned. Every business
has to demonstrate on an ongoing basis that it's creating shareholder value in accordance with the strategic purpose of
that business, with the return on capital that it's producing. That it's creating more value inside Pfizer than outside
Pfizer. That can range from all kinds of alternatives. The Capsugel decision, to consider strategic options for it, was the
result of one such review. And that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses consistent with what I talked
about at the last quarter. So my view on that hasn't changed.
In terms of timing about – that's an ongoing process. I think that's our obligation in managing a portfolio of businesses.
And we have had this particular collection of businesses for just about a year. We are continuing to evaluate the
opportunities that having these businesses together may create within Pfizer and exploring the degree to which some of
the businesses you mentioned may create more value together than in other forms. And we'll continue to do that. And
that's an ongoing process, and we'll always be engaged in that process, both in terms of potentially looking at
businesses for strategic review, as well as bringing in businesses, like we did with King. So I think that's just in the
nature of managing what I call a dynamic portfolio of balanced businesses, balanced both in terms of their risk and
their opportunities.
And I'll let Frank address the share repurchase issue.
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So let me just run some numbers first,
and then I'll answer the question. So this quarter we bought back about 30 million shares, $500 million worth of our
stock. Last quarter, we also bought back $500 million of our stock, about 30.8 million shares. So about $1 billion of our
stock has been repurchased. By the way, the average price on that $1 billion is about $16.40. In addition to that $1
billion, we'll be paying out in a dividend this year about $6 billion. So between the stock buyback and dividend this
year, directly returning capital to shareholders in the amount of about 7 billion. And significant unforeseen events
aside, we expect the board to approve a dividend increase at our upcoming December meeting.
In terms of what we're going to do going forward, what I would say is buybacks are clearly something we will continue
to be opportunistic about as market conditions warrant. And remember, we have other potential uses of our capital, like

we did this quarter. This past quarter we committed about 4 billion of cash for business development opportunities,
which are the transactions that Jeff talked about, with the biggest piece of that commitment obviously being King
Pharma. And then in terms of the returns on those business development transactions, obviously they're based on
projections that we have to execute on. But we will execute, and those returns are favorable. So that's how I think about
it.

Your next question comes from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Catherine.
<Q - Catherine Arnold>: As we speak, the FDA is evaluating means for getting advancement in biosimilar pathway,
and so I think that with that in mind, I was wondering if you could disclose what your lead biosimilar programs are and
when you plan on giving more details on this business? And I also wanted to ask you about tanezumab and if you could
comment on the status of that regulatory hold and why other competitive programs may not have been impacted, and
your company's interest in pursuing smaller targeted markets like cancer pain?
<A - Ian Read>: Taking tanezumab first, we're still working through this little hold with the FDA, and I really can't
comment on why other programs – what the consequences of other programs are, Catherine. We'll continue to work
with the FDA through, I think, for three to six months on that and see what happens.
On the biosimilars, I think our biosimilar launch is with Protalix into that space, and then we just signed a deal with
Biocon for the insulin biosimilars. And we're targeting about 10 molecules internally and externally that we want to
develop. We're going to leverage the resources from Wyeth and the expertise. And I expect the first launches from
internally developed molecules to be round about 2015, 2016.

Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Risinger>: Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First of all, with respect to the meningococcal B
vaccine, can you just tell us when you're going to share with the investment community or in some more public fashion
the Phase II data, and also what your plans are for Phase III? And then second, with respect to foreign exchange, can
you just quantify the benefit to EPS in the quarter? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Sure. I'll let Frank handle the foreign exchange
question, and Mikael Dolsten will address the vaccine question.
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So Dave, FX negatively affected
revenue in the quarter by 160 million, total company. Positively affected adjusted total costs by 298 million. Net-net, it
was a favorable impact to EPS to the quarter of a penny, $0.01.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Mikael.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: So, just got some of our Phase II data at the recent Neisseria conference in Canada. And
basically what we have shown is very robust immune responses after two and reaching all our set goals after three
immunizations. And we are in the phase of planning for the Phase III studies based on looking at all the options for
tri-lysine in a adolescent population. And we feel that we have a robust data set with good efficacy signals and
tolerability, and that makes us encouraged to take that decision to go into Phase III planning.

Tony Butler from Barclays Capital, please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Thanks very much. Three brief questions. Two on cash and cash uses. One is, this final
payment to Quigley, has this – this has put Quigley behind Pfizer in total? Second, Frank, if you could comment on
cash uses. You've laid out – or you and Jeff have laid out – comments around share buyback, dividend, and some
corporate development. But what about paying down the existing debt, maybe needing to repatriate less money and the
overall positive effect that may have on tax use? And then thirdly back to mening B. Mikael, if you could actually
discuss the rationale for looking at adolescents versus that of infants at least initially on mening B, if in fact that is to go
forward in Phase III. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Okay. Amy, why don't you start with the Quigley
question?
<A - Amy Schulman>: Sure, thank you. And as you know, we recorded a charge in the third quarter related to
Quigley. And I'd like to just put that in a little bit of context by stepping back and – just to make sure everyone is on the
same page with respect to the Quigley situation. As you know, we had previously submitted a plan to the bankruptcy
court and, as part of that plan, there was an injunction, which remains in place as we work within the parameters of the
judge's September 2010 decision in which, in the context of denying the confirmation, he set forth a roadmap for what
needs to go forward, and we're working within that roadmap. And we believe at our next hearing in December we will
have satisfied the judge's concerns with respect to the reorganization plan. So we think that that contribution will satisfy
the court and the judge's concern, although it is possible that there will be additional amounts or changes to the plan.
But our goal is to move this to finality promptly.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Frank?
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: On the potential uses of capital, Tony,
you have it right. No change in my mind from what I've said previously. There's five or six buckets, I'll call them major
buckets, that we can deploy capital in. Share buybacks and dividends are clearly one bucket. Business development is
another bucket. And debt pay down is another one. The amount of cash that we repatriate is another one. And quite
frankly, investing in the business, whether it be new product launches or R&D, or our inline portfolio, or geographic
and business unit investments or capital expenditures. So all those things are potential areas where we can deploy our
capital. From my perspective, what we try to do, and what I believe we do, is deploy capital in a way that's best from a
total shareholder return perspective over time. That's what we've been doing; that's what we will continue to do. And
consider all those alternatives as we go forward.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Concerning the question on mening B, so there are around 20 to 80,000 people that are affected
every year and 2 to 8,000 actually cases with mortality. And a significant proportion of those in are in the adolescent
population. In addition to that, that adolescent population is the real carrier of the mening B bacteria, not the infants. So
we think for a pronounced reduction of the spread of this bacteria, the adolescent offers both protection for the
individual and reduction in the population. And the final comment is that as I mentioned, tolerability in adolescents is
really good. And if you look at the conference where data from us and one of the competitors are, you will note in
general in the infant, which was presented by another company, there is usually being seen in this field more issues
with particular fevers. So we think we have a really good positioning of this new vaccine.

<Q - Steve Scala>: Thank you, I have two questions. First a follow-up on the Prevnar 13 adult filing. Since the filing
will include capita, would you describe the minimum acceptable efficacy threshold for that filing? How compelling
must have been the difference in the number of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in the Prevnar arm versus the
placebo arm to justify the filing? And is there any regulatory risk given that Pfizer apparently does not have data versus
an active comparator? So that's the first question.
Second question is, what share does Ranbaxy have of the Canadian market with its generic Lipitor? How would you
describe their ability to supply? And what should we learn from that regarding their ability to supply the U.S.? Critical
because of course they're the first-to-file company. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Okay, Ian, you want to clarify about the capita trial?
<A - Ian Read>: Yeah, sorry, to clarify that, Steve, we will not have capita data when filing. We'll file on immune
response, and we believe the data is sufficient to file. And so I think we must have been misunderstanding on the capita
data being available.
And vis-à-vis Ranbaxy, I really can't comment on what they're doing in Canada.

Your next question comes from Manoj Garg from Soleil Securities.
<Q - Manoj Garg>: Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is for Frank or somebody on the mature markets team.
Two questions. So first on Effexor, can you describe how – the pricing strategy there? And anything that you've learned
that would enable or prevent you from utilizing a similar strategy on future expirations?
<A - Ian Read>: The pricing strategy on Effexor was – I think – our pricing strategy was reasonably effective. I think
we retained a reasonable portion of the scripts post the launch. And pricing strategies really vary molecule by molecule
and circumstance by circumstance. So I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all pricing strategy when you come to generic
launches.

Seamus Fernandez, Leerink Swann, please go ahead.

<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: – and on Lipitor and how that could possibly limit U.S. generic entrants post November
2011?
<A - Charles E. Triano, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Seamus, we didn't hear the beginning of your
question. Could you start again, please?
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Oh, can you hear me better now?
<A - Jeffrey Kindler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman>: Yeah, just fine.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Okay. So can you just tell us how you think about the 2016 API patent on Lipitor and how
this could possibly limit U.S. generic entrants post-2011? I know that's the basis of the Ranbaxy settlement. And then
separately, it's my understanding that Pfizer also has a patent on Viagra that runs considerably longer than the 2012 sort
of assumed composition of matter patent expiration. Could you talk a little bit about this patent and whether or not
Pfizer has any plans to prosecute it? Thank you.

<A - Ian Read>: So I'll start, and perhaps anybody want to add. Our full expectation is that we will have generic
Lipitor into the marketplace post November 2011.
And on the Viagra patent, from memory, the composition of matter patent goes in '12 and we have a use patent which
we believe is effective and in place in the United States through '16. So we'll see how the market dynamics work on the
strength of the use patent post the composition of matter patent expiration.

for one more question, please.
Operator
Your final question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi there, I've got two questions. Firstly is can you just talk a little bit more through this
revenue range tightening? We've lost $1 billion from the guidance range this year. Just go through the factors a bit
more that drive that, and how we should think about 2011 and 2012 growth an targets in light of this. How do we have
the confidence in the 2012 range when we have the 2010 range being cut? And then just thinking a bit longer term
strategically, I see you're committing to not really pursuing large-scale M&A prior to and during 2012. Does that mean
in 2013 potentially Pfizer might be looking once more to large-scale consolidation in your long-term strategic
planning?
<A - Frank D'Amelio, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: On the 2010 revenue range, to your
point we tightened the range from what was 67 to 69 billion to the latest guidance update, which is 67 to 68 billion. So
that's the tightening that you're referring to. Please remember, when we gave that 67 to 69, that was the end of January,
early February. We did not have factored into the guidance at that time the impacts of healthcare reform in the U.S. or
European pricing pressures. Despite that, we were able to maintain our guidance range that we showed at the beginning
of the year, but we did tighten it. So from my perspective we did exactly what we said we were going to do. We did
tighten the range, but we absorbed in that range two items that were fairly significant, neither of which was in the range
when we initially disclosed it back at the beginning of the year.
In terms of our 2012 targets, the revenue targets for 2012 now are a range of 65.2 to 67.7 billion. And we've said that
point they assume a modest level of business development, up to 5% of the total. And so if you do the math, 5% on
that, call it 3 to 3.5 billion, we got about half of that done this past quarter, particularly, or primarily from the King
acquisition. We've said – although we never rule out anything – we've said our objective is bolt-on acquisitions and the
couple, the billion-dollar space, focused on Emerging Markets, Established Products, and our Invest to Win areas. That
is our strategy. That continues to be our strategy. So that's [inaudible]
