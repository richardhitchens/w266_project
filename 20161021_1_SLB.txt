Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per
share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of
$0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $237 million of pre-tax merger
and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million non-cash inventory
purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs, as well as a dedicated integration
team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016
and into 2017.
Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced
activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter
revenue actually increased 1% sequentially.
Pre-tax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each
group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost reduction initiatives, as well as the effects of
last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation.
Operational highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7
billion increased 5% sequentially, while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was
primarily driven by increased testing services and WesternGeco activities. Margins improved sequentially across all
Reservoir Characterization technologies, but most noticeably in wireline and testing services.
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins increased by 241 basis points. The
margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and reduced losses in Venezuela due to further
alignment of our resources in the GeoMarket to match the reduced level of activity.
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially, while margin improved 41 basis points
largely due to strong SPM activity.
Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pre-tax
operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%. The revenue decline was driven by the decreasing backlog that
has significantly impacted the Drilling Group line. However, strong project execution in OneSubsea combined with
cost control initiatives across the group limited the margin decline.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the third
quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Going forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of
earnings.
During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2016,
we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of
approximately $117 million during the third quarter, and paying $800 million of severance and one-off
Cameron-related transaction payments during the first nine months of the year.
Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and
investments of $11.1 billion. During the quarter, we spent $156 million to repurchase 2 million shares at an average
price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of
$69.64 per share.
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on
SPM investments, $160 million of multiclient and $700 million of dividend payments.

R. Scott Rowe
Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we're six months
into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter despite
the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog driven by this prolonged downturn.
In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold
operating margins at 16%, which is 19% decrementals off a nearly all-time high margin performance in the second
quarter of this year. The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project
execution in our longer cycle businesses.
We have now experienced seven straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace. And
Cameron's shorter cycle Surface and Valves & Measurement businesses have experienced the full effect of the reduced
activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity. Despite
the duration of the downturn, these two businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we have
managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range
from three weeks to nine months, and we expect to see revenue flatten in future quarters and begin to grow again in
mid-2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world.
In our longer cycle businesses, OneSubsea and Drilling Systems, we have been extremely successful in expanding
margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and Drilling remain accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group.
In fact, OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share
gains over the last two years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea. The Drilling and OneSubsea
teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving costs out of projects and products,
and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offering.
Going forward, these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes. These
two businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for seven straight quarters. We
are now entering the phase of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18
months.
On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these two businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was the highest
ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility into revenue growth into 2018. The Drilling
Systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rigs are nearly nonexistent,
and our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure control
equipment.
Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we are positioning OneSubsea. We now have
eight paid FEED studies, and we are working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I
fully expect to win a small tieback award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7's installation capability
before the year is over. We see the tieback market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking
to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. OneSubsea is uniquely
positioned with our standardized subsea tree, our single well boosting system, our unified control system and our
partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity. We also have the capability to integrate this further
with the deepwater drilling and production teams of Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators
who are looking to tie back these assets.
The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to
confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter, as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300

million synergy target in the first year of the combination. In the third quarter, we booked $139 million of
synergy-related work which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. One notable award in the quarter
was an integration project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging
services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services, as well as the supply of barite. This is a great example of subsurface
and surface integration across three different Schlumberger groups.
While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and
capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger. We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in
the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and
relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies.
In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle, and how we are
capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created.
I'll now turn it over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After seven quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business
environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have indeed reached the bottom of the cycle.
Our third quarter revenue still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in
activity at Cameron as the product backlog continued to decline.
Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East,
Russia and Australia. Since the start of this downturn and as it deepened into uncharted territory, our entire
management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully
navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share, and also by proactively
removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through head count reductions, internal efficiency improvements
and strong supply chain management. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pre-tax
operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx
investments, as well as our ongoing dividend commitments.
We continue to carry forward this strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results where we delivered 19%
decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other three groups
combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges. These results which represent a small step on our
path towards first restoring and subsequently exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns are
mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements with so far only a minor impact from pricing increases and
highgrading of our contracts portfolio.
Going forward, it is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past two years to
allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operation quality and efficiency,
which are all key enablers of our customers' project performance. As indicated in July, we have, during this quarter,
started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base. While there is a general
understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during the
quarter, but with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened.
Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to
contracts and basins that meet our financial return expectations in the same way our customers allocate capital to
projects in their portfolios. Currently, a noticeable part of our contracts do not need these financial return criteria, and
this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital,
capacity and expertise.
In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will in the coming quarters also aim to restore proper payment
schedules from our customers in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts to address the payment delays we

today are seeing from many customers around the world. Still, in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow
generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million, as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly
managed.
Next I will review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations and I will focus my comments on the
Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups, as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group.
In North America, revenue for the Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups increased 3% sequentially, as solid
growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada,
impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S., where the Q3 rig count increased
significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin. The increased drilling activity is
reflected in our Drilling & Measurements product line, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the
second quarter.
At this stage, we are seeing a growing trend in U.S. land towards even longer horizontal laterals, or super laterals,
aiming at further increasing reservoir contact. One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources, with a
record lateral length of 18,500 feet, using our industry-leading PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system. This
emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the offtake of our high-end drilling technologies and has
also provided our Drilling Group with a clear path towards profitability on land. We have therefore shifted focus from
maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our Drilling business in North America land.
In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher drilling activity and
also by customers now actively depleting their DUC well inventory. Still the fracturing market continues to be
completely commoditized and significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players. In addition, the
significant increase in sand volume pumper stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution
costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability.
Today, the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance, and this,
combined with the short-term market outlook, means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share.
Instead, we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating
areas. Still we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely and we are ready to deploy our significant stacked
capacity on short notice, but only when the market environment can support positive contributions to our earnings.
So the main takeaway for us from North America land is the emerging technology trend linked to drilling longer and
more complex horizontal sections, or so-called super laterals. This trend is already creating significantly higher demand
for our unique drilling technologies, and we are, at this stage, sold out for PowerDrive Orbit and in the process of
adding further capacity from overseas and from manufacturing. This drilling technology trend will also add to the
opportunity set for our Rig Of The Future, where we plan to have two first generation rigs in operation in U.S. land in
the fourth quarter.
In the international markets, our revenue excluding Cameron was down 1% sequentially, as increasing activity in key
countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and Australia was offset by continued weakness in Sub-Saharan Africa,
the Far East and Latin America. As we now prepare for the recovery also in the international markets, several trends
have emerged over the past two years, adding further complexity to these already technically challenging markets.
First, in pursuit of improving project performance, many customers are now more actively pursuing the technical limit
of the equipment and workflows we deploy in our operations. This poses additional challenges with respect to the
expertise and technology we use in both the planning and execution phase of our work, and further elevates the
importance of our global support network, including engineering, maintenance and distribution. While we are well
prepared for these additional technical demands, this trend is clearly redefining and elevating customer expectations,
and we see this as an excellent opportunity to further extend our market leadership position in the international markets.
The second trend emerging in our international customer base is the growing interest in more commercially aligned
business models, from time-based performance contracts for individual wells, all the way to production incentive
contracts based on a fee per barrel. As an example, we are today engaged in various stages of SPM discussions in 20

countries around the world, spanning all customer groups and all four operating areas, which clearly demonstrates the
momentum this contract model now has within our overall offering. While this trend is very encouraging, I would like
to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering, and that we will continue to actively
pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement.
As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have two major
advantages. First, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly
adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demands from our customers, while ensuring safe and
consistent quality in our operations; and second, by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 years to
90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us a natural
partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships.
With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we are seeing in the three international operating areas. In Latin America,
the combined revenue for the Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially, due to
continued reductions in E&P spend and activity throughout the region. However, the two-year activity slide was clearly
slowing during the quarter, and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. The
sequential revenue growth came entirely from the Drilling and Production Groups, while the Characterization Group
posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multiclient seismic sales in Mexico.
Here, WesternGeco has shot 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deepwater acreage that will be
included in the upcoming bid rounds, with the first taking place December 5 of this year.
In Mexico, drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both Pemex and these
successful players from the shallow water bid rounds that has already taken place.
In Ecuador, activity remains solid, driven by our SPM projects, and we continue to progress in line with our field
development plans, both for with respect to work scope and production levels.
Elsewhere in the region, activity remains subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers, however, we
are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries.
In Argentina, there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps
to further encourage E&P investments in the country, as they seek to reduce the oil import dependency which should
have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017.
In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos Basin and is considering opening
up for new and more commercially-aligned business models with the service industry, which could include fee per
barrel contract.
In Venezuela, operations remain largely shut down, outside the work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we
are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism, and we
are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months, and that operations could start in Q1.
And in Colombia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters as Ecopetrol and
several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017.
Revenue in Europe/CIS and Africa declined 3% sequentially, excluding the Cameron Group. While strong sequential
growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in
activity throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. The drop in revenue was driven by the Drilling and Production Groups, while
the Characterization Group posted solid sequential growth.
A large part of the growth in the Characterization Group came from Russia, as summer season activity peaked both on
land and offshore, and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger ruble. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to
see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather, while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be
strong.

The North Sea posted sharp sequential revenue following a summer season where activity in Norway was particularly
strong. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter
weather sets in. Still, exploration success in Norway and several large project startups indicate stronger 2017 activity in
the North Sea.
Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deepwater
exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region, with a
5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the Eastern Med in the
early parts of 2017.
North Africa activity remained stable with flat revenues sequentially, while we expect moderate growth in activity in
Q4 partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for Sonatrach.
The market challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa continued in Q3, with yet another significant drop in activity and with the
rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014. However, with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the
bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4, with the exception
of Angola.
In the Middle East and Asia, Characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially, as
strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the Characterization
and Drilling Groups posted growth in the third quarter, while Production Group revenue was slightly down due to a
temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East.
In the GCC, the underlying drilling and rigless activity remained strong, with solid revenues reported in all countries.
In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait, which represents another
exciting growth opportunity for us.
In Australia, revenue increased in the third quarter after seven quarters of decline, driven by additional land activity for
the Drilling Group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the Characterization Group. While in China,
Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter. And at present, there are no
signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region.
Turning now to the oil macro, the supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance, as seen by the flattening
global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent draws towards the end of the quarter, in particular in North
America.
In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels
per day for both 2016 and 2017. At the same time, global supply is plateauing, as non-OPEC production continues to
experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September.
Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat, as any production
upside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base.
Given the projected demand growth, this means that the [ph] call on (29:07) OPEC will decrease from the current
record production levels, suggesting that the production upside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the
markets in balance.
All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over, and that market sentiments should soon
change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and, subsequently, E&P investments. There is also a case to be
made for a more rapid draw on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price, in the event of a
lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran; OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts; or a
steeper decline in non-OPEC production.
In terms of 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However, we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely
given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still, we do see upsides in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East
and Russia, and we are making sure we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and, importantly,
turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions.

With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver
incremental margins north of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75% which, going forward, will give us

Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go
ahead.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James West>: Paal, you've talked a lot in recent quarters about the need for increased industry collaboration, and
it looked to me with the press release that you cited a number of examples of, of course, ISM projects but also projects,
that looked to me, that signal more collaboration. Is that catching on on a global basis?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I think we are seeing a growing interest in this. It varies a little bit amongst the different
customer groups. But I would say overall, there is a growing trend of a desire to collaborate closer, and also to
implement more commercially aligned business models which I alluded to in my prepared remarks. This goes all the
way from the basic models linked to either time of production for a well all the way up to full field management around
the SPM concept.
<Q - James West>: Got you. And then one market where we haven't seen a lot of collaboration, historically, has been
the U.S. land market, but you highlighted, I think, three or four different wins there. Could you talk – I know you talked
a little bit about the evolving super laterals in North America, but could you talk about the collaboration in North
America, what you're seeing there and what the next steps are, if that collaboration could lead to more technology
improvements or technology advancements and use in North America?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, we cited a few of these examples in the press release. So we are seeing signs of that
taking place in North America land as well. But I would say on a percentage basis, it's obviously a lot lower occurrence
than what we have internationally. But it's still encouraging to see stronger collaboration both on the drilling side,
linked to drilling more complex wells or these super laterals, as well as on the production and completion side around
how we optimize completions using formation evaluation and a bit more sophisticated approach to fracking. So we are
seeing it happening, but still, in fairness, it's a fairly small part of the business volume.
But these technology opportunities, both on the drilling side and on the completion side, is really why we are in this
market. We're not in it for the commodity side of it. We believe that ultimately technology will play an even larger role
in the North America land market, and we continue to promote these capabilities and this part of our offering because
we ultimately believe it's going to bring a lot more value for our customers.

<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So, Paal, as a follow up to James' question, so on the SPM, certainly a growing market and
important to Schlumberger overall, so could you talk a little bit about where you see the investment opportunities and
the pipeline of opportunities over the next one year to two years? I assume that's growing. And are you seeing an
increasing number of IOCs that want to partner up with Schlumberger on some of these projects?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, for SPM, we are seeing, I would say, a significantly growing interest across all customer
groups. So far, in terms of the discussions that are most advanced, I would say, are generally with the NOCs and the
independents and even start-up companies, but we have had discussions with IOCs on this contract model as well.
But in terms of the opportunity set, it is growing and it's very significant. And as I quoted in my prepared remarks, we
are today engaged in various stages of discussions in 20 countries around the world, covering all the four operating
areas. So while this model used to be contained to a handful of countries, we today see a rapid expansion of the interest
and we have obviously staffed up significantly in our SPM product line to make sure that we can pursue all these
opportunities, turn them into projects and subsequently execute the projects in line with our plans. But it's a significant
growth opportunity and something that we are actively pursuing in all four operating areas.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: All right, all right. Fair enough. And then on the international side, you talked about the price
concessions and some of them oil-based triggers and some time-based. And so does it happen as you hit a certain oil
price or there's time bound concession that initially it moves into play, or you have a conversation first with these
NOCs? And how much of those do you think will actually be retendered in the end?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, the whole discussion around pricing, first of all, is going to take a little bit of time. We
indicated in July that we are firmly putting this on the agenda and we have done so in the third quarter. We've had
engagement and discussions with most customers around the world.
I think there's a general acceptance from the customer base that ultimately prices are going to have to come up. Not a
lot of movement as we expected in the third quarter, but I would say given the increase we've seen in oil price over the
past month or so and the potential trajectory we could see going forward, I think there's a much stronger basis for
having these discussions at this stage. And then we will have discussions individually with our customers, depending
on the contract – the model and the contract situation we have with them.
It could be at some stage that some of these contracts will be a rebid. And if that's so, then we will obviously participate
in that. But I think in many cases, there is room to negotiate within the existing contract framework to come into a, I
would say, mutually agreeable solution which will be acceptable both for us and for our customers.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: All right. Thanks. I'll turn it over.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Please
go ahead.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah, morning, morning. So let's go back to West Texas again, you highlighted that you see
growth in Middle East, in Russia and in North America land. Middle East and Russia, you're clearly very well
associated with that, maybe North America land not so much. So you talked about – so how do you first of all see your
positioning? And you talked about mobilizing equipment in big – or ability to drill longer laterals. Can you talk a little
bit about pricing and tightness and whether you get paid for this mobilization?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What we're mobilizing are drilling tools, which isn't excessively expensive, right. So we do
that and we also will take some from manufacturing, and this is all manufactured -or partly manufactured in the U.S. as

well. So in terms of the reason for mobilizing more equipment into the drilling side is clearly that we have a clear path
towards profitability.
So given the unique technology offering we have and the technical challenges of drilling these very, very long
horizontals, we are able to get pricing, which is going to give us, I think, ultimately, the returns that we're looking for.
And this is why we are prepared to put more capacity into play on the drilling side of what's going on in West Texas.
As I said on the fracturing side, still there's no clear path towards profitability, and this is why we are still maintaining
presence and basically holding the fort until we believe we can justify putting more capacity into play going forward.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thanks for that. If you look at 2017, we've heard out of Oil & Money in London, companies like
Total, talk very aggressively about stepping up activity next year, taking advantage of low oilfield services costs.
Others like BP have been very vocal also getting going. Yet you highlight Russia and Middle East areas where these
type of companies are typically not all that active.
So does that mean that you have a different view or you don't believe that kind of that type of IOC will step it up? Or is
it that they're coming from a very low base at the end of the year and sequentially will be improving from here, but
year-over-year be kind of flat? Can you help us a little bit with making sense of some of those statements?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, as I was trying to cover in the fairly detailed description I gave of the international
markets, we believe that there's early signs of recovery in most places around the world. If you look at next year for
internationals, we expect solid growth year-over-year in the Middle East and Russia on a full year basis. But we also
see, I would say, an uptick in investment and activity in Latin America and in Europe/Africa. The only place where we
don't see any signs of recovery at this stage is in Asia.
But I would say the uptick in Latin America and Europe/Africa is more going to be from current kind of Q3 activity
levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those
regions, which [ph] are growing (40:48) higher activity.
So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying and we welcome, obviously, more activity and higher investments
from them. It's just that the main kind of very clear investment increases we are seeing are still going to be in Russia
and the Middle East. But there are early signs of things picking up from bottom also in the rest of the world, excluding
Asia.

Your next question comes from a line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: A question for Scott. You highlighted the 0.8 book-to-bill, which I believe was for OneSubsea
and that this foreshadowed growth into 2018. The shorter cycle businesses like Cameron should be expanding at this
point is well, at least that's our forecast. However, when I look back at a recent investor presentation, the high case for
Cameron revenue in 2018 is actually flat and the midpoint looks like it was down a bit. Has the outlook for Cameron
now improved? Is there line of sight to growth in 2018, assuming the short cycle businesses kick in over the course of
2017?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: Yeah. No – thanks for the question on Cameron. And I'm just to clarify, right, we are – in the
earnings press release, we're giving the OneSubsea and the drilling bookings and backlog. And what you can see there
is – on the book-to-bill, the 0.8 was meant to be for both drilling systems and OneSubsea. So actually, OneSubsea is
Company Name: Schlumberger
Company Ticker: SLB US

higher than that and we're just below 1 on the OneSubsea side.
But on the 2018 general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group, it really depends on those short
cycle businesses and when activity returns. And so there is a path for growth in 2018 but it depends on that land
business in V&M and in the Surface segment. We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We're highly
focused on growing in Midcontinent there in the United States. And if we can see continued rig count increase, then we
do have a path for growth.
Now obviously, the Drilling business with the backlog there will continue to decline. And OneSubsea, quite frankly,
has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn which started in 2014. And so we won't lose a
lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from Drilling, and then the offset is the shorter cycle business
growth on land markets.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. And then unrelated follow-up on the expanding opportunity in SPM. There's been a
willingness to take on some oil price risk in SPM and link at least a certain number of payments to oil price. Paal, can
you shed some color on just what percentage of the SPM portfolio has an oil price linkage now and will you be
comfortable taking that percentage over time?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at our contract structure today, I would say the lion's share of this is basically
a fee per barrel, which is – obviously the project has a link to the oil price, but our compensation is generally linked to
the incremental production times a fixed fee per barrel.
Now at this stage at the bottom of the cycle, we are, in some cases, considering a share of production times the oil price
rather than the fee per barrel times the entire incremental production, but that's based on the individual projects. But I
would say the portfolio, as it stands today, is generally fee per barrel, not directly exposed to oil price. But we are
considering, in some of the cases today, to take a bit more oil price risk. If we can make the project work at current oil
prices, we are fairly comfortable opening up and balancing the portfolio with a bit more oil price risk.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Will it always remain a minority of the book?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I would say generally that would be the philosophy, yes.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

over 2016, which has thus far been a pretty big year.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think it's too early to say. I would say, as a starting point, I would say probably not, maybe
somewhat in line. But I think it's going to depend on the opportunities that we have in front of us. Obviously, there is a
broad range of discussions. I think for the right opportunities, I'm prepared to invest more into it, but I think we will
have to do that on a case-by-case basis.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And then secondly, at this stage given your outlook for global E&P CapEx, which
frankly sounds more constructive than I was expecting, which is good, do you think that Schlumberger's revenues in
2017 overall are going to be up?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, it's a bit early to say. We're still in Q3. The absolute E&P investment numbers for next
year, I think it's still early to comment on absolute numbers. I can give you some direction on I think in terms of where
we see the trends going, and what the absolute number is going to be is going to be more a function of how the
numerics of these trends play out. But we do expect, on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America
land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place.
We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels – not necessarily on the full year basis but from current
levels – in Europe/Africa and Latin America, and the reason for this is that there are many significant oil-producing
countries in these two regions which have record low investment levels at this stage. And we see signs that at least
we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth is too early to
say, but at least an increase from where we are today.
And really, the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So all depending on what
the various numbers on these three main trends pan out to be, there is a chance that revenue could be up. Obviously,
that's what we're hoping for and that's what we're going to work towards.
And obviously, market share and some of the other things that we are working on specifically around the land rig
introduction, around SPM and some of the early production facility work that we do, we have opportunities, I would
say, to come in with higher revenue in 2017, but I'm not going to commit to this as of yet. I think we need to work out
the details of the plans over the coming two months, three months, then we can give you a further update in January.

Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Hey, thanks. Hey, Paal, in your remarks, you had commented that you have two Rigs of the
Future the fourth quarter in the U.S. That seems well ahead of schedule. I'm also a bit surprised to hear they're deployed
in the U.S. So just two questions. One, are you in fact ahead of schedule on this technology? And two, can you talk
about kind of where, what types of field this is going into? I'm a little surprised it was going to be in the U.S.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: So I would say that generally, we are on track with both the engineering and the manufacturing
of the Rig of the Future. So these two rigs are, I would call them pilots, pilot versions. They don't have all the features
of the Rig of the Future, but they have a significant part of it. And we are also going to be operating them around the
overall software platform of how we want to do Rig of the Future going forward, right?
So they are manufactured in the U.S., and that's why we would like to basically put them out to – in operation close to
home at this stage to make sure that we can get all the support and all the feedback from their operational performance
and feed that into both the engineering and manufacturing work that is going on for the, I would say, the complete
version of the rig, which is going to be rolled out, a number of them, in 2017. That's already in the plans for both the
CapEx and the manufacturing for next year.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. And then also in your release, you talked about the continued free cash flow conversion
and your ability to reinvest in the business. Can you expand a bit on what that means? I mean, obviously, you're
reinvesting here – you're putting money into the Rig of the Future, but are there other areas that you're kind of focused
on to reinvest here? Is it a product? Is it a geography or is it something else you're talking about?

<A - Simon Ayat>: Okay. I'm going to take this question. As we always said that the utilization of cash, the priority
will be for the growth of the business. As you know, we are – we ended the quarter with about $11 billion of cash on
the balance sheet. And today, we are weighing our growth opportunities compared to return of capital to shareholder by
– through buybacks.
Our investments, the three elements are the CapEx, which remain to be very well tightly controlled, we are investing
today almost 50% what we used to be at the height of the business, and SPM and multiclient. So there is no other
opportunities other than our inorganic growth if it proves to be a viable proposition economically and the future of the
business. But right now, our priority is the growth of the business, and other than that, we will return it to shareholders.

Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great. Hey. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, Paal, you – commentary here in the press release and the results seem to be incrementally
positive, at least on the Reservoir front, driven by multiclient, it appears. I know in your prior commentary on the cycle
recovery, the Reservoir piece of the business would probably lag in growth. Is there a shift underway, subtle or
otherwise, in seismic activity that might push Reservoir up a little bit further on the recovery curve?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: So, I don't think there is yet a big turnaround, I would say, in the exploration market or in the
seismic market. But I think we have positioned ourselves very well in both of those markets. Whatever growth there is,
I think we are able to generally pick up on the exploration side. And I think on seismic, as I again said in July, the
performance of WesternGeco in a very, very tough market is quite commendable.
We do quite well on both marine and land, and we are being quite opportunistic on the multiclient side to make a
significant investment in several basins around the world, in particular Mexico, but also Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. part,
as well as overseas. And obviously, at this stage, we are able to generate revenue and profits from these investments,
which you see very clearly in our results.
So there's no, I would say, significant market turnaround, but I think it's a strong performance from the
exploration-related businesses that we have, including seismic. And also, within the testing services product line, which
sits in Reservoir Characterization, we have won a series of early production facility projects where we have combined
the capabilities that we had within the testing services prior, with the processing capabilities that Cameron had. And
this is again really strengthening the offering we have in this market, and we see that also as a significant growth
opportunity within Characterization.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: That's great. My follow-up is, you said earlier about – if I understood it correctly – that you are
in a position to potentially go for some market share in North America. I wasn't quite clear on the perspective on the
international front. So I'm just wondering if you just might be able to go through the thought process on the market
share dynamics, and how you see that opportunity vis-à-vis pricing and profitability.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I would say in international market, we have, I would say, actively pursued market share
for the past, I would say, 12 months to 18 months, I think, with reasonable success. I think if you look at
Characterization, Drilling and Production combined, take away Cameron, we have pretty solid revenue evolution in all
three international operating areas in the third quarter, and I'm quite pleased to see the progress we have made there.
Whenever you start aiming to increase your tender win rates, which we now been focusing on for a good 18 months or
so, it takes a bit of time before that translates into actual revenue, but you're starting to see some impact of that.

So there's really no main shift internationally. The main thing I was pointing out for North America is that on the
drilling side, we now have a clear path on – in U.S. land towards profitability based on the technology uptake we're
seeing linked to these super laterals. And as soon as we can turn a profit, we are very keen to grow market share. And
we have basically shifted the playbook from holding the fort to going for market share in drilling in U.S. land, but we
have not yet done that for fracking because at this stage, it is highly dilutive to our earnings. And at this stage also,
we're not seeing a clear path towards profitability.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Mexico. You've been shooting seismic there coming into this downturn. They had changed
the constitution more quickly than a lot of us had expected, have been through several different rounds, and now, you
talk about there may be some light at the end of that tunnel in 2017. That was always a market of fabulous potential and
their budget had rivaled Petrobras's in the past. Can you talk about how you see Mexico evolving over the next year or
two years, please?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I think I share your view of the potential of the market, and I also think we are pretty
much close to the bottom of it, right? We have had – we have seen a significant reduction in Pemex activity over the
past couple of years, and while this whole industry reform has been taking place, that reduction has not been, I would
say, compensated by additional investments from the emerging international players.
But as these bid rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the first deepwater round coming up now in
December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again, it might not be a dramatic comeback and we won't be
back to, I would say, 2013 levels or 2014 levels any time soon, but I think there is a momentum shift coming in
Mexico. It's partly linked to the seismic work that we're doing and the related exploration activity with that, but I think
also activity linked to the previous rounds that we've seen both in shallow water and on land, as well as the basic
Pemex activity should pick up in 2017.
<Q - James Wicklund>: So a more enduring recovery. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes.
<Q - James Wicklund>: My follow-up, if I could, one of the first comments you made on the call, Paal, was you're not
allocating assets to work that doesn't meet your return hurdles, and you said the process has started. We've seen a
number of companies decide not to participate in markets where product lines or with customers, where they don't
generate an adequate return. Can you talk about a little bit, level down on granularity what exactly that means and what
we should expect to see in that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. So, first of all, when you're in a cyclical business, you will have to be pragmatic when
you are near or at bottom of the cycle, so – which we are. And we are basically maintaining our presence pretty much
everywhere in the world at this stage even at bottom and even though we have a number of contracts, which, at this
stage, does not meet our medium to long term return criteria.
But what we're saying though is that as we now are starting to come off bottom as oil prices are starting to move
upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers where we have these type of contracts, and try
to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those
financial return criteria at the same time as our customers can also meet theirs.

So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved overnight, but we are very clear
on the fact that if we ought to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it. And at the bottom,
we are willing to compromise, but as we come off bottom, we need to basically restore the return expectations that we

<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Thinking about OneSubsea, how are we seeing opportunities for larger projects shaping up
for next year or do we see it as mostly a brownfield, tieback-boosting type of market for 2017?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: Yeah, let me – we'll just – it's a good question and it's a market that's in a state of change right
now, but let me just talk about deepwater in general. It's continued to be challenged, and in this quarter, we saw five
additional rigs get stacked during Q3, and deepwater rig utilization dropped to 65% in the month of September. So
expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%. And when we think about that for OneSubsea and
projects as we go forward, we think this year, tree awards is significantly under 100. And when we look at our project
list, we're tracking anywhere between five and eight awards that could happen in 2017. And those would be the
larger-style awards that we've seen traditionally.
But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market, and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I mentioned our
eight paid FEED studies with Subsea 7 where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side. And what we think there is
that with a standardized subsea tree, which is at a significantly-reduced cost, a single-well boosting system, which
we're the only ones right now that have that single-well boosting system, and then combine that with our unified
control system and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back one and
two wells in the existing host facility. So we're in a lot of discussions around that, and really, it's almost creating a
market right now. And so we hope that we can get some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition
into 2017, and then as these big projects kind of progress and move forward, we're offsetting that with this expanded
tieback market.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Got it. Thank you, Scott. I appreciate that. And then just thinking about capital deployment
going forward and the free cash flow profile of the business, is it fair to say that following transformation of the cost
reductions, the capital intensity of the core services business should remain below historical levels? When you just
think about – how we think about – could capital deployed for that part of the business stay below D&A next year as
well?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. So, I think – based on what we are focusing on from the transformation standpoint, we
still have a long run rate to go in terms of driving asset utilization for the existing asset base, and also, what we have
doing in our engineering programs as well to also engineer and manufacture less-expensive assets is also a key part of
it. So both the utilization and the cost per asset I think should lead to a lighter capital intensity of our business going
forward. I think you've seen the signs of it in the past two years, three years, and we are going to continue to work very
hard on further improving on that.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Great. Thanks, Paal.
