MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2013
Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will
conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded
Thursday, May 02, 2013.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Randy Arickx
Thanks, Operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the first
quarter of 2013. Our press release was issued earlier this morning and the conference call materials are available on the
Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet.
Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of
the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors'
Chairman and CEO will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Dan Ammann,
Senior Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some brief
closing comments. After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the lines for questions from the analyst
community.

In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens,
CFO of North America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Akerson.
Daniel Francis Akerson
Thank you, Randy, and thank you all for joining us. As we do every quarter, I'll review some highlights and then Dan
Ammann will take you through a more detailed presentation on our results. Before I do that, I want to let you know that
the segment reporting we are showing today reflects the successful implementation of what we call Country of Sale
financial reporting. What this means is from now on our automotive segment report – segment revenue and profits will
be reported in the geographical regions where the vehicles are sold.
This new approach will give us improved visibility into our profit and revenue across the individual markets and
product lines, which in turn will help us optimize capital allocations and drive improved results. As we walk through
the numbers, you'll see that what we are providing you with a apples-to-apples set of comparisons to prior periods,
using this new approach.
Let's turn to slide two, which summarizes our performance. Despite the mix of red and green arrows, this was a solid
quarter for GM and we are much more of a formidable competitor now than we have been in more than a generation.
We are very much on plan financially, as well, despite the competitive landscape, the volatility we have seen in several
currency markets and Europe's ongoing challenges.
I won't read the entire slide, but I would like to draw your attention to a few key points. First, we increased our global
market share to 11.4%, which is up two-tenths of a point year-over-year. The gains were concentrated in North
America, Europe and International operations. And what you're seeing is the result of several new successful product
launches.
In addition, we're reporting EBIT adjusted of $1.8 billion, which is down $400 million compared to a year ago. When
you look at the regional detail, you can see that Europe actually improved its EBIT adjusted results year-over-year.
North and South America were down slightly and both GMIO and GM Financial were essentially flat. Market
conditions at GMIO outside China continue to be challenging.
You can also see on the slide that our adjusted Automotive free cash flow was down quite a bit year-over-year, which
Dan will cover in more detail. As he'll explain, we were impacted by lower cash earnings and the adverse timing of
various items, which you expect to reverse in the balance of this year.
Now let's' turn to slide three, which is a summary of other first quarter highlights. Let's begin by recognizing GM
Financial. GM Financial already helps us meet the financing needs of customers and dealers in strategic and
underserved markets in North America, all with very good risk-adjusted returns and a smaller balance sheet than other
captive automotive finance companies.
As we look at our global growth strategy, we saw a significant opportunity for them to help us with cars profitably
around the world as well, that's what's drove us toward the acquisition of Ally's international operations.
We recently completed this acquisition in a majority of markets, and we expect to close the remainder in a timely
fashion. Going forward, GM Financial will be able to provide financing in markets that represent roughly 80% of our
sales volume. Of course, our customers are the final arbiters of success and our momentum is building with each new
launch.
In China, GM and its joint ventures had a record first quarter sales and March was the second best month ever. We also
began domestic production of the Cadillac XTS in February, which marks the start of our drive targeted to triple
Cadillac's annual sales in China to 100,000 units by the end of 2015.

In the United States meanwhile, Cadillac's 38% year-over-year increase in the first quarter was the largest of any
volume brand, and Buick's 28% increase was number two. The driving force at both brands is great new products like
the Cadillac ATS and Buick Encore, which are both in segments where we didn't compete heretofore.
Another success story is developing in the United Kingdom where Vauxhall grew in its first quarter sales by 19% a
year ago. The entire UK market was up less than half that amount. Strong early sales of Opel Mokka and the Opel
Adam also helped drive these results and both vehicles are off to a strong start in the rest of Europe as well. In fact we
now have more than 100,000 Mokka orders and more than 30,000 Adam orders on the books.
Finally in Brazil, the new – all new Chevrolet Onix helped Chevrolet deliver a 3.2% first quarter sales increase, almost
more than double the market. Progress in Brazil helped offset challenges in Venezuela due to a geopolitical situation.
As we move forward, we're going to keep the pressure on.
In China, our 2013 capacity is about 20% higher than last year and we're introducing redesigns of the Buick Excelle
and the Cadillac SRX. Our strength in China offsets weaknesses in our other GMIO consolidated operations.
On the other side of the world, the production of the all-new Chevrolet Impala has begun at our Oshawa Ontario plant.
This car is designed to shift our sales mix from roughly 70% fleet to 70% retail over time.
At Cadillac we unveiled our new CTS at the New York Auto Show to rave reviews and we also unveiled redesigns of
the Buick LaCrosse and Regal. These new cars will give Buick an essentially all new U.S. showroom by the end of this
summer.
Perhaps our most important product news was the announcement of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 will launch with
carryover pricing and V8 fuel economy that's one mpg better than Ford's EcoBoost V6. Together, the Sierra and
Silverado are a winning combination that should drive our average transaction prices through a combination of
improved series mix and option penetration, along with lower incentives. The crew cab models are in production and
we'll bring other light-duty models on line later this summer.
Finally, we cemented our global leadership in connected vehicles in February when we announced the automotive
industry's largest deployment of 4G LTE mobile broadband. We're going to roll out 4G LTE across all GM brands and
regions starting in 2014 in the United States and Canada.
What makes our approach so innovative is we'll offer built-in connectivity. In other words, you won't need a tablet or a
smartphone to access 4G LTE in a GM product. There are many more examples of GM's progress that I could cite, but
I think the message is clear. We're a very healthy company that's getting stronger each quarter, and in the product arena
we're playing offense and competing to win.
Now in the interest of time, I'm going to turn the call over to Dan Ammann who will review our quarter in detail. After
that I'll return to some closing comments. Thanks.
Daniel Ammann
Thanks, Dan. Slide four provides a summary of our first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the
period was $36.9 billion. The decline from the prior year was partially due to $400 million in unfavorable foreign
exchange translation.
In addition, while our deliveries to end customers were higher, our wholesales, which drive revenue, were down. Our
GAAP operating income was unchanged at $1 billion. Net income to common stockholders declined $100 million to
$900 million, and our fully diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58.
Our Automotive net cash from operating activities was $500 million, a $1.8 billion decrease from the same period in
2012. For our non-GAAP measures EBIT-adjusted was $1.8 billion in the first quarter and the EBIT-adjusted margin
was 4.8%. Our adjusted Automotive free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion for the quarter, the decline from 2012 due
to lower earnings and timing related items we'll discuss later in the presentation.

Slide five identifies special items for the first quarter that had an impact on our earnings per share. At the top of the
slide, our net income to common stockholders was $900 million and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.58. As
we advised in our 2012 calendar year earnings announcement we had a $200 million impact from the devaluation of the
Venezuelan bolivar in the first quarter. This charge plus the net effect of a few smaller items had a $0.09 unfavorable
impact on earnings per share.
On slide six, we remind you of our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we
list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our operating income margin for the first quarter of 2013 was 2.6%,
which was equal to the same quarter in the prior year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin decreased one percentage point to
4.8%.
We next display the recent history of our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales which were 1.6 million vehicles in the
first quarter, slightly lower than the prior year. We'll discuss our new disclosure of this volume metric momentarily.
Our global market share increased 0.2 percentage points to 11.4% for the first quarter.
On slide seven, we provide an explanation of the $400 million decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT-adjusted.
We earned $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Volume was $200 million unfavorable, primarily due to lower
wholesale volumes in North America and Europe. Mix was $100 million unfavorable. Price was $200 million
unfavorable in GMNA, and total costs were $300 million favorable due to lower expenses in Europe. Other was $300
million unfavorable due to foreign exchange.
On the next slide, slide eight, we discuss our transition to Country of Sale reporting that Dan previously mentioned.
Beginning with this quarter's earnings announcement, we will now report revenue and profitability in the Automotive
segment in which we sell our vehicles to our outside customers. Previously our segment results included the impact of
intersegment sales and profits.
This new approach improves the profit and revenue visibility across our markets, which will be helpful for managerial
purposes. Chevrolet Europe financial results will continue to be recorded within the IO segment to be consistent with
how we manage the business. This new approach of reporting Automotive segment financial performance does not
affect our consolidated results.
We will also now report wholesale vehicle sales volumes instead of regional production volumes. This change fully
aligns our disclosed volumes with our new Country of Sale reporting.
Slide nine gives a summary of 2012 calendar year revenue and EBIT-adjusted on a previously reported and on a
Country of Sale basis. Please note that under our revised methodology, we will generally no longer have revenue
recorded in our Corporate and Eliminations, as the segment results reflect only sales to outside customers.
Slide10 gives a similar comparison of the two methodologies for the first quarter of 2012. The Country of Sale results
for the other quarters of the previous year will be displayed on our upcoming segment charts.
Slide 11 gives our year-over-year EBIT-adjusted performance by segment on a country of sale basis. North America
was down $200 million to $1.4 billion. Europe improved to a $200 million loss. The performance in IO was flat at $500
million and South America recorded a breakeven performance, down $200 million for the same period in 2012. GM
Financial continued to deliver solid profitability with $200 million in earnings before taxes, and our corporate sector
was $100 million expense for a total of $1.8 billion EBIT-adjusted for the quarter.
We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 12. For
the first quarter of 2013, our total U.S. market share was 17.7%; our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis are
higher than the prior period.
On a percentage of ATP basis our incentives for the quarter were 111%. This puts us at 116% of industry average
levels for the first quarter of 2013. The increase from the prior year is largely due to increased incentives on full-size
trucks as we manage the transition to our all-new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra.

Turning to slide 13, we show North America's EBIT-adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the
slide, revenue was $23 billion, down $200 million from the same quarter in 2012. EBIT-adjusted margin was 6.2% for
the first quarter, down 0.9 percentage points from the prior year.
Our U.S. dealer inventory was 744,000 units at the end of first quarter. The increase from the prior year was primarily
due to our recently launched vehicles in new segments. GMNA's wholesale vehicle sales were 829,000 units for the
quarter, a 19,000 unit decrease from the prior year, due to production downtime we've taken to prepare for upcoming
launches. North American market share came in at 17.1%, which was an improvement from both last year and the prior
quarter.
On slide 14, we provide the explanation of the $200 million year-over-year decline in North America's EBIT-adjusted.
EBIT-adjusted was $1.6 billion for the first quarter of 2012. Volume was $200 million unfavorable due to the lower
wholesale vehicle sales. Mix was $100 million favorable due to our recent launches of the Cadillac ATS and XTS.
Price was $200 million unfavorable, due primarily to higher incentives as we manage our full size truck transition. Cost
had no net impact as the $100 million in reduced pension income was offset with $100 million in decreased material
and freight costs. This nets to EBIT-adjusted of $1.4 billion.
On slide 15 GME reported an EBIT-adjusted loss of $200 million for the first quarter, a $100 million improvement
from the prior year. Revenue was $4.8 billion for the quarter, down from $5.3 billion in the prior year period.
EBIT-adjusted margin in this segment was negative 3.6%.
GME's wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 249,000 units, 17,000 less than the first quarter of 2012. Our
European market share in the first quarter was 8.3%, a small increase from the prior year.
On slide 16 we provide the major components of GME's $100 million year-over-year improvement in EBIT-adjusted.
Despite the lower number of wholesale vehicle volumes, volume rounded to zero impact. Mix was $100 million
unfavorable due to continued vehicle downsizing and unfavorable country mix. There was no impact from price,
although we continue to see competitive pressures in the European market. Cost was $300 million favorable, due to a
$100 million in lower depreciation and $200 million of savings between engineering expense and other fixed costs.
Other was $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange, primarily the weakness of the British pound. This totals
to Europe's EBIT-adjusted loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2013.
We now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 17. In the first quarter of 2013
EBIT-adjusted was $500 million including equity income from our joint ventures, approximately equal to our
performance from a year ago, as strength in our China JVs offset weakness in consolidated operations. At the bottom of
the slide GMIO's revenue from our consolidated operations was $4.8 billion. The $200 million decline from first
quarter 2012 was partially due to $100 million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation.
GMIO's EBIT-adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 1.4%, down 3.7 percentage points from
the prior year. This was due to pricing pressure in Australia related to the devalued [ph] yen (19:50), the 12% industry
decline in India, as well as unfavorable mix and volume in the Middle East. We expect some of these factors to
continue to pressure the performance of our IO consolidated operations in coming quarters.
Our net income margin from our China JVs was 11.7%, a 1.5 percentage point increase from the prior year. GMIO's
wholesale vehicle sales were 243,000 units for the consolidated operations and 841,000 units for our China JVs. And
our market share in the region was 9.6%, a 0.2 percentage point improvement from last year. Our market share in the
China market remained a very strong 15.2% for the first quarter.
Turning to slide 18, we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume had no net
impact and mix was $100 million unfavorable due primarily to unfavorable country mix. Price was zero because we
were able to offset pressure in some markets with increases in Korea. Cost also had no impact as lower material and
freight costs offset an increase in depreciation and amortization. The change due to other netted to zero, as the $100
million increase in equity income was offset by unfavorable FX in our consolidated operations.

On slide 19, we look at South America's EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue
was $3.7 billion in the first quarter, a $200 million decrease from 2012, which is more than explained by unfavorable
foreign exchange translation. The EBIT-adjusted margin in this segment was a negative 1%.
GMSA's wholesale vehicle sales were 233,000 units, 4,000 units less than the first quarter of 2012. South American
market share was 17.2% in the quarter, a 1.1 percentage point decline from the prior year, although as Dan mentioned,
our market share in our core market of Brazil was favorable year-over-year.
On slide 20, we look at the components of the $200 million decline in profitability in our South America segment. The
impact due to volume was zero as reductions in wholesale vehicle sales in Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina were
offset by gains in Brazil. Mix was zero as an unfavorable country mix was offset by favorable product mix driven by
our new vehicle launches. Price was $100 million favorable as we took action in Argentina and Venezuela to partially
offset inflation in those markets.
Cost had no impact and other was $200 million unfavorable due to $100 million unfavorable foreign exchange in Brazil
and Argentina and the absence of a gain from a 2012 acquisition. This totals to a breakeven performance for South
America in the first quarter.
Slide 21 provides our walk of adjusted Automotive free cash flow for the first quarter. After adjusting for
non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to Series B and deducting GM
Financial, our Automotive income was $1.1 billion for the quarter.
We had $200 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was a $1.4 billion expense.
Working capital was a $1 billion use of cash reflecting typical working capital seasonal trends. The $300 million
decline in this category year-over-year was primarily a function of timing impacts of lower production in North
America. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $300 million in the quarter. Other was an $800
million use of cash, a $700 million change from the prior year due to fewer vehicles in service with our rental car
customers and the timing of cash payments related to prior quarter incentive accruals.
This totals down to Automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $500 million. We had $1.9 billion of
capital expenditures in the quarter and a $100 million true-up contribution related to our 2012 salaried pension
annuitization deal, for a total adjusted Automotive free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion.
On slide 22, we provide a summary of our key Automotive balance sheet items. We finished the first quarter with $24.3
billion in cash and current marketable securities and $11 billion in available credit facilities for a total available
liquidity of $35.3 billion.
Our book value of debt was $5.2 billion and the book value of our Series A preferred stock remained at $5.5 billion.
Our U.S. qualified pension plans are now underfunded by $13 billion and our non-U.S. pensions are underfunded by
$13.3 billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability was $7.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.
Slide 23 provides a summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial reported their results this morning and will
be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the first quarter came in at 7.7%, a
modest decline from the prior year and closer to the industry penetration. Our U.S. lease penetration increased 8
percentage points to 20.6% in Q1 as we took advantage of our higher residual rates and new Cadillac launches to
significantly close the gap to competitive leasing levels. Lease penetration in Canada was at 9.6%, up 0.7 percentage
points from the prior year.
GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations rose to 51% and GM Financial's percentage of GM's
U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 26% in the quarter. GM Financials' annualized net credit losses
remained lower at 2.6% and earnings before tax was $180 million for the first quarter, similar to last year.
On slide 24, we're updating our estimate of the company's full year effective tax rate to be closer to the high 30%s in
percentage terms. Please note, we calculate the effective tax rate on an income before taxes and before equity income
basis and also exclude the impact of special items. Our effective tax rate was 35% for the first quarter of 2013 and 12%
for the prior year period. The rate for the entire 2012 calendar year was 15%.

Now, I'll turn it back to Dan for his closing remarks.
Daniel Francis Akerson
Thanks, Dan. We've covered a lot of ground this morning, but I hope you can see that we are systematically and
successfully implementing our plan to grow profitably around the world. There is a new vitality here at GM and it's
represented in all of our brands. We're aggressively addressing issues that have held us back. We've maintained our
fortressed balance sheet and improved our financial flexibility, and our new products are connecting with customers.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Randy.
Randy Arickx
Okay. Thanks, Dan. Operator, we're ready to start the Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed with the analyst portion of the question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yes. Good morning, Rod.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: A couple of things; one is, I was hoping you can talk about Europe a little bit and cost savings.
In Detroit, you suggested that you'd have about $600 million of lower depreciations. That's maybe half of the $300
million cost reduction that you had this quarter, but you also indicated about $300 million of other restructuring
savings. It looks like, in this quarter at least, it was maybe twice that. So any thoughts on the outlook for costs. And
also related to Europe just any additional color on how you expect the year to play out. Is the inventory correction
behind you, and so forth?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Right, so just starting at the end there, we came into the year with the company inventory in
pretty good shape, but a little bit heavy on the dealer inventory side. So we have worked through a good chunk of that
in Q1 here. And in terms of the more general trends in the business, I guess what I'd say is that we are very much on
plan with the actions and objectives that we laid out back on our third quarter call last year, both in terms of what we're
trying to do on the top line as well as on the bottom line.
The cost performance in Q1 was quite strong. I'd say that there are some timing items that came into Q1 that amplify
the cost savings that you're seeing there and we'll see some normalization as we move through the year. But everything
that we've talked about in terms of our objectives on the cost side and on the product side, we're achieving. Obviously
that's what we control. The things we don't control are the overall market environment and the overall industry there
and that remains quite challenging.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. And just secondly, if you can talk a little bit about – the China JVs obviously are showing
some pretty good profitability at this point and you've talked about some very aggressive growth and spending plans
over the course of the quarter. Does that – the mix of those two, how does that kind of play out vis-à-vis dividends? Are
you able to sustain the historical policy of dividending the prior year's earnings or will the capital spending acceleration
have any impact on that?

<A - Daniel Ammann>: I would say as a general matter, we'll be at or near the prior year's earnings going forward. So,
no fundamental change to that at this point.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. And just one last thing, you still expecting improvement in South America for the full
year?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. The first quarter, the story there was really a function of Venezuela and everything
that's been going on there. Venezuela, as I think you know, is a profitable market for us and others. We had very little
production in Venezuela in Q1 due to geopolitical obstacles, if you like. So, that impacted the Q1 result. We see a path
to get back that on track. And importantly the business in Brazil, which is really the biggest market there, obviously has
performed well and is picking up a fair amount of the slack there. So, bottom line, we expect to build, as we've said
before, build on last year's progress for the region for the year.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hey, thanks, everyone. So, you called out that your Chinese capacity should be up 20%
year-on-year. I was wondering if you could give us a similar figure of how much your capacity will be up in North
America year-on-year and how much it will be down in Europe year-on-year?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah. Hey, Adam.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hi, Chuck.
<A - Charles Stevens>: From a North American perspective, I guess the biggest driver on any capacity change
year-over-year would be what's happening with the truck plants. And as we've talked about before, that's going to be
relatively flat. So, I don't see a significant change in capacity. As a matter of fact, if you look at Q1 with some of the
downtime that we had in Arlington, our capacity utilization was a bit below 100%. So I don't see a fundamental shift in
our overall capacity as we go through this year.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: And I'd say on Europe, I mean obviously the main action in terms of installed capacity there
will come at the end of next year with Bochum. At the moment, we're optimizing shifts and so on to keep the manned
capacity, as opposed to the installed capacity, optimized for the volumes that we see. So, no fundamental change there
either.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay. And if I can follow up with a question about the Japanese yen, the topic came up yesterday
in the sales call a little bit, kind of seeing some initial signs of some aggression in terms of discounting and price
reductions. I believe, Dan Akerson, you were on the tape earlier today also pointing out that that's an issue. Maybe it
was you, Dan Ammann. Can you give a sense of how much your market share may have benefited over the past few
years as the yen has been so strong and perhaps how much of a headwind this could be as the Japanese either improve
their product or the value proposition?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: It's – I'd say it's really hard to go back and try to – we've sort of gone through the exercise, but
it's hard to go back and divine exactly how much market share movement is attributable to what. So I mean the way we
look at it is we compete in the marketplace every month, month-in and month-out. We obviously keep in – we have our
strategies, we have our vehicle portfolio, we have our launch activity, we have all the things we're doing. We keep a
close eye on the competitive dynamics, whether it's currency driven or something else driven and adjust course as we
need to on a month-to-month basis at least at the tactical level. So we'll keep an eye on what people are doing here.
The market share dynamics through the first four months of the year, I mean, you've clearly seen them, as we have,
which have been favorable to us and to some of our domestic competitors. We'll see how people react and how they
play it out. So it's too soon to make a call really.

<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay.
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Adam, this is Dan Akerson. I think it varies by market. For example, in the U.S.,
where some of our Japanese competitors are manufacturing a lot of product here in North America with the – and their
supply chain will be to some extent, and it will vary by competitor, sourced in North America. And where you see, and
where I'm particularly vigilant is where does – how did it impact us into lesser developed countries, emerging market
countries, where both U.S. and Japanese competitors are exporting into, out of a base that might be in Japan or might
be in Korea or China or whatever. So it's – as Dan said, it's hard to isolate this and give it a broad brush. It's very
specific to -- by country by region.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks, Dan. And just one quick housekeeping follow-up. With your change of your reporting
structure of revenues where vehicles are sold, rather than produced, can you confirm where you now recognize
royalties from the China JVs, the imported cars into China and spare parts into China? Can you tell us, are those then
accounted for outside of the China JVs in the regions or are they – has that been moving around? Thank you.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: There's no real change between what's in the China net income or China equity income line
versus on what's in the balance of the business. Royalties are part of the overall engineering expense that are allocated
around the segments based on revenues and so on. So no change between China and the rest of the company.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: And spare parts also in the regions as well.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Same story.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about price in North America. It was a
headwind in Q1, but you mentioned as the new trucks ramp-up, you should get some improvement in ATPs. At what
point do you think we'll see price flip to a tailwind in North America?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah. As we talked about back in January and most recently in March, as we think about
2013, we expect price on carryover products to be a headwind, primarily related to the transition on truck. So I would
expect that headwind on carryover products to continue through the sell down period in Q2. But as we start to come out
with new products like the Impala, the K2, which we're launching, just started production earlier this week, we'd start to
see some offset with pricing on new product. And I would expect to see some of that rolling in in Q2, but really be
more second half weighted.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then I guess kind of a related question, if I understood your discussion about the
cash flow correctly, the $800 million of other that was a negative was cash going out the door for incentives where you
had accrued previously, so it wasn't in the P&L. Are we going to see that effect happen in subsequent quarters as you
move trucks off the lot that have these heavier incentives on them and the cash goes even though they've already been
accrued?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. I'd say that the cash flow cadence -- some of the $800 million was attributable to what
you described. I'd say the cash flow cadence is going to be a little bit back and forth more than usual as we move
through this year because of the unusual production cadences. If you look at the Q4 to Q1 to Q2 production cadence,
usually it's up and then up again, and this year we've had a different cadence on that. So that moves payables around, it
moves receivables around, it moves incentive accruals and cash amounts around. So there's fair bit going on in terms of
cash flow timing.

<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. I'm sorry. Can you run through that again? What is the timing that you expect and how
does it differ from your typical seasonality?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, typically Q1 is our seasonally weakest quarter for cash flow. That remains the case this
year. In fact it's exacerbated this year due to some of the production cadence timing. Obviously we had lower earnings
in the quarter so they did translate straight through to cash flow. But the biggest chunk of the impact relates to some of
these timing items, which will reverse during the course of the year.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then just one last item on Europe. I think you mentioned that you drew down
inventory. Does that mean you're going to be building some in the future which helps earnings in subsequent quarters
relative to Q1, or now you feel like you are at a more comfortable level?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: I think we're about where we'd like to be and again, obviously it's a function of what the
market does over the coming quarters.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of quick ones. First on North America
capacity, just taking a multiple year view, I think on a straight time basis IHS has – you had about 80%, and I
understand that not everybody looks at it on a straight time basis. But starting with that, how are you thinking about the
capacity needs as you get to peak volumes? It sounds like you are not looking at too much in the way of new facilities.
But, how should we think about that impact on incremental margins as you roll out third shifts, overtime and that sort
of thing, taking sort of a multi-year view?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah. Perhaps IHS's capacity utilization was on a three-shift basis. Right now on a two-shift
basis, we're running at about 100%. As we go forward and think about industry in the U.S. at 16.5 million, 17 million,
we would expect to be able to meet that by increasing the number of our facilities on three shifts. Today, we have 8, or
about 50% of our facilities on three shifts. Obviously we have the capability to take that up.
Our expectations would be to be running at a 120% to 130% utilization rate going forward, as measured on kind of a
two-shift basis, or closer to 100% on a three-shift basis. Obviously that has a significant impact on thinning fixed costs
if you can run your facilities on three shifts versus two shifts. I'm not going to provide an estimate of that on a
go-forward basis, but that would be clearly what we'd want to do to get more fixed cost utilization going forward.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay and then it sounds like there is a lot of variable costs that has to come into the
system, obviously, if you are increasing these shifts, but it would be dwarfed by the efficiencies on the fixed side. Is
that kind of the right way to think about it?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Absolutely.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay and then one follow-up if I can, just really quickly, on Europe. The pricing,
which was flat year-on-year, I mean can you just give us a little bit more on that? Is that sort of an indication that things
may be stabilizing at, albeit, fairly low pricing levels in the region, or is there product and other things in there that are
helping that?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Certainly there's product in there that's helping that for us. The pricing environment remains
quite competitive, as you would expect given the situation there. We're working product line by product line, market by
market to optimize our pricing, make -- taking price where we can, giving it up where we need to in order to optimize.

Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering, when you show the walk for North
America costs were flat year-over-year. But you do have the K2XX rolling out. Why is that flat given I would have
thought that'd been up given the size of the launch? And should we think of that maybe being a headwind from a cost
as we go into Q2 and Q3? Is there any color on maybe how that launch cost plays out through the year?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah, let's start by talking about the calendar year. Again, consistent with what we talked
about back in January, we expect year-over-year fixed costs to be up, primarily because of incremental D&A,
incremental marketing, some pension income headwinds and some manufacturing costs, pre-production and startup. I
would expect most of that to roll through in Q2 and Q3 as we really start to ramp up the K2XX in the plants through
the rest of the year and start the marketing activities.
Specific to Q1 we had, as Dan mentioned earlier, a $100 million headwind related to pension income. We also had a
$100 million headwind from a fixed cost standpoint on manufacturing, primarily related to the downtime in Arlington.
Those were offset by favorable performance in variable costs, $100 million in material and freight and on the round
$100 million in warranty related costs as the quality and base vehicle warranty gets better for us. So, good performance
on the variable costs. We still had fixed cost headwinds, as we expected, and I would expect the fixed cost headwinds
to increase as we go through Q2 and Q3 and hit the real launch cadence.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. Thank you for that color. And looking at Europe, I mean, I guess there is an optimism to
annualize the Q1 results. How should we think about the cadence? I think you touched on this before, but I think you
mentioned that you expect Europe losses to be reduced by a third to a half. Is this still the right range to be thinking
about or do you think you are maybe doing a little bit better given how Q1 came in?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: As I said, I think, earlier the – we laid out a plan in Q3. We gave some perspective back in
January for the year. What we've seen in the first quarter is on plan and consistent with the execution of those
objectives both in terms of the top line and the bottom line. As I mentioned earlier, cost performance was a little
stronger, attributable partially due to some timing benefits that came into the first quarter.
So I'd say we're on track relative to the objectives that we've previously laid out. But this is the first quarter into the
year and there are huge uncertainties obviously in relation to the European macroeconomic environment and how that's
going to unfold. So where we end up will be a function of the things we do control, which we feel quite good about,
and a function of the things that we don't control, which are quite uncertain.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And just two last quick questions. What will the -- part of Ally has closed, I mean, what is
the – any estimate of the impact that should have and the timing of when we'll see that impact? And also in terms of the
tax rate, I mean it seems to be in the high 30%s for this year based on your guidance. Is that normal or should we think,
when we go past this year, it comes back down again based, I think you said mid-30%s in the past?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, on the Ally piece, the results will roll in consistent with the closing, so we closed the
biggest chunk of this back in – on April 1, so that'll come into the second quarter results. The overall outlook and run
rate that we've talked about previously still holds in relation to that.
On the tax rate, we gave the perspective for this year, obviously we'll see as we move through the year how that
evolves and how that rolls into next year. But I'd point out, importantly, our cash tax rate is unchanged from –
essentially unchanged from last year and will continue to be in that sort of 10%-ish range from a cash tax point of view,
notwithstanding the fact that the accounting GAAP tax rate will be in the upper 30%s.

Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Good morning.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just a first question on the change in the reporting, presumably this isn't just an accounting
exercise. And I'm just trying to understand as you shift to the Country of Sales methodology here, what the shift
internally is as far as accountability and targets are for your sales organization and really sort of what this means as far
as measuring performance internally and driving the business.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, the main reason we are doing this is for internal managerial purposes. I mean, as you've
seen in what we've laid out for you this morning, the external, at the segment level, the changes aren't that dramatic
between the previous approach and this approach. When you get below that to the country level and to the product line
level, we now have dramatically improved visibility by market, by product line from a profitability point of view. And
that will allow us to get much more focused on decisions ranging all the way from capital allocation to sales
accountability, profitability accountability. So, this is a much greater and more significant internal impact than it is
externally and we're seeing significant benefits from the improved visibility already on an internal basis.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: That's helpful.
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: And Dan, I would say, if you go back a couple of years in time, we weren't quite sure
where some of our products were in terms of profitability. I know that may sound a bit strange. But we did not have the
clarity and therefore we didn't have the accountability that we have now. So, this in my opinion, in terms of managing
the company, is a huge step forward.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: It's incredibly encouraging. I appreciate that. Second question just on raw materials in general.
If we look back over the last year, there is about a $1,000 drop in raw mats going into a vehicle. Suppliers that we talk
to all are pointing their fingers at the auto makers as taking the benefit because there is indexing and escalators and all
that stuff. I'm just curious what you're seeing on the raw mat front, if you're getting the benefit from that already or
when that ultimately should come and particularly given there's such a severe pullback through the beginning of this
year.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. We are seeing the benefit of that. We've taken some of that benefit in Q1. It really
depends commodity by commodity, supplier by supplier, agreement by agreement, and as to how much is indexed
versus how much isn't, what the lag time is and so on. But we certainly had some benefit in Q1. And based on where
current spot rates are we would expect to continue to have some benefit. But commodity prices have proven to be very
volatile. I think they're all up again today from where they were. So that's a spot driven, market driven element; we'll
obviously keep a close eye on it, take the benefits where we can and try to mitigate increases if and when they come.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay and then just lastly, I mean if we look at the current consensus EPS for 2013, it's in the
ballpark of $3.35. I'm sure that will change today. But then if we think about really the cash earnings it's at least $4.35,
if not greater. I think one of the confusions around the stock is that it looks like it's trading in north of nine times
earnings, but in reality it's trading south of seven times earnings on a cash EPS basis. Would you ever consider
communicating maybe more explicitly a cash earnings number so the multiples would be more comparable to history,
because I think a lot of people are being confused by the simplistic PE and not understanding that the actual cash PE is
much cheaper than it is, than it looks like?

<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, that's something that we would hope that the sophisticated sell side community would
help to educate the investors on. But I – hopefully we're being quite clear about the difference between – and one of the
main drivers obviously is the GAAP versus cash tax rate. We've tried to be as explicit as we can in helping people
understand that. I would say from dialogue with our larger investors, we haven't seen a whole lot of confusion on that
front. But it's a useful perspective and we'll take that into account.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Yes, good morning. I'd like to hear from Dan Akerson on a point he made on an early
slide about the 4G connectivity. Basically, I'm looking for what's the business case, not just the vision around what you
are doing with connected car with that, because at least at first glance you have other competitors avowing just to use
the consumer smartphone as their link into the cloud. And on a kind of cost per vehicle basis you can certainly see the
argument for that. So, what is really the business case you see for this move?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Well, we think going forward that this new demographic coming into the marketplace
--please recall, I have children now that, I have grandchildren, I should say, that have only grown up in a world with
smartphones, and in our estimation instead of waiting for trends to overwhelm us, try to look over the horizon, having
come out of the technology and communications area. The bigger the pipe, the more you're rewarded into the future.
So, when we look at what we can do with a 4G pipe into a car, you can change the business model almost entirely. You
may be able to have a real revenue generating opportunity into the car with – when you come up, for example, what
happens if when the logo shows on your screen and -- says brought to you by Allstate? How many times is that going
to pop and how much can you get from Allstate or -- I don't want to pull out one insurance company.
Children, as you take them to school -- of course, you got to watch distracted driving, we are very aware of that -- but
in the back seat you can literally go from your living room, the children can pick up the same show that was on
television or watch anything they want, because this is going to deliver incredible amount of downloaded capacity in
different formats.
So at very little marginal cost we open up, what I think are potentially lucrative lines of business that don't exist in kind
of a safety and security, or what you see on a -- that's not integrated into other forms of media that exist in the
household that can transition right with the car. So, it's a different model, but you have a different demographic that is
different than you and I, that's going to – we already see it in some of our market research, that put this high on their
scale of – on their list of what's important in buying a car.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: And have you made any progress with your former colleagues in telcom on bundled
data plans that would include the SIM card in the connected car?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Yes.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: At a modest additional cost?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: I don't want to get into the contract. But I will tell you, having come out of that
industry, the change that we've affected between these two and the modules we'll be putting in these cars, it will affect
-- it will be a 4G LTE combination that will allow us to switch our entire fleet overnight. We've never been able to do
that. So we have flexibility that allows for our service providers to have to compete for our business, not only in terms
of price, but features and functionality.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my call. There was a
question earlier on your strong China JV margin which, 11.7% looks to be the strongest in a couple of years now. But,
can you maybe help us a bit more on the drivers of that improvement, because previously I think, we'd been hearing on
these calls about modest margin compression on a tougher pricing environment over there? So, what accounts for that
nice rebound in 1Q and was there may be anything lumpy to report in there?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. I'd say first of all, it's one quarter. But second of all, the business continues to grow
over there and as you understand as well as we do, this is a business that has meaningful fixed costs and a fair amount
of operating leverage to it. So if you can grow the business and keep some control from a pricing point of view, you do
get operating leverage and that's some of what we've seen. How that market shakes out over the balance of the year,
we'll need to watch. Clearly people are adding capacity and it's a very competitive marketplace, but we've grown –
we've outgrown the market there for the last little while and we hope to continue to do that.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay, then on slide 16 you mentioned that the cost in Europe was a $300 million positive
swing, helped just $100 million by the lower D&A. So can you talk about the Non-D&A savings there? I know you've
taken out a lot of salaried people in Rüsselsheim, et cetera. Is that the primary driver or are there other structural cost
reductions to report? And then just second to that, is there anything you can say now in terms of savings from the
Bochum closure now that we have a better idea of how that's going to shake out?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: We're not saying anything about the Bochum closure at this point in time other than to refer
you back to the overall fixed cost reductions that we've previously talked about. In relation to the first quarter Europe
cost performance, some of that, a bit over $100 million of that is the D&A reduction as a result of the impairment we
talked about last time. There is a good chunk of fundamental cost savings in there between engineering and some of the
other manufacturing items. As I mentioned earlier, there are some time – other timing items that fell into this quarter,
which further helped that number.
But I'd say more fundamentally we are in aggressive cost control mode in Europe, frankly across the whole company,
hopefully as you've seen in our results. But in Europe in particular it's a very tough market environment. Ultimately we
don't totally control the top line, but we do control what's going on cost wise and we're staying aggressive on it.
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Let me just jump in there. First of all we're pleased with our progress, but we're still
losing money in Europe, a lot of it. And so, we have a lot of work to do. Our objective is clearly to break even and then
profitability. But I think we said from the outset, it's – okay we had – we have to match production with demand. But
we also have to reduce cost across the board in everything we do, whether it's in IT, advertising, human resource cost,
across the board. And that's, we're trying to do that globally. But we're particularly focused on it given the situation in
Europe, the uncertainty over the next year or two on a macroeconomic basis, we have to protect the business as much
as we can. And so, although I think this is good progress, we have a lot of work to do yet.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Thanks. Then maybe just my last question. It could be much ado about nothing, but
it looks like you filed an S3 last Friday. Is that just a generic shelf or is there anything you can tell us, more about it or
what it might imply? And then second to it, it seems that the registration, of course, does not encompass any primary
shares, and there will be no proceeds to the company. But it does say in one location that proceeds received from the
exercise of warrants could be used for general corporate purposes. So, can you also sort of maybe remind us on the
procedure of warrant exercise here and whether you could instead use the net share settlement method or otherwise use
any cash proceeds from such exercise to repurchase stock as is sometimes the case? Thanks.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: The ability to net share settle the warrants is a function of the individual warrants and the
warrants that are referenced there are those that are held by the selling stockholders. And, so the registration statement
more generally, this was a procedural issue. We wanted to put that up. As we said in a press release concurrent with
filing that shelf, that we're not aware at this time of any specific plans by any selling shareholder to execute an offering.

But we just wanted to take that mechanical step to have that ready.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Congrats again on the better results.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one more quick one your – can you just – you
mentioned that volume was flat despite wholesales down, it looks like they were down 6%. Can you just explain that a
little bit, what exactly – how did that happen?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: It's because we look at it on a country-by-country basis and aggregate it up that way. So while
total may be down it's country-by-country in terms of the financial impact.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. And then just one more on Europe, is it possible to give a day's inventory number across
all of Europe?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: It is – I don't have that number right at hand. I guess what I'd say to you is that -- and I think I
mentioned it before, we came in the year in good shape on a company-owned inventory basis, a bit heavy on the dealer
inventory side. And I'd say we've worked that down so that we feel, based on the current market environment at least,
that we're in a reasonable place on both.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay and then last one for me, back in Detroit for GMIO you said EBIT absolute would be up,
margin would be down and just given the change in reporting structure, it looks like GMIO actually had the largest
change, so is that still accurate or is there any change to that outlook for the year?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, we're not updating our outlook specifically here on this call, but I guess what I would
say is that the – we did have some challenges in the consolidated operations in Q1 as evidenced by the result there. In
Q1 those were offset by strength in China. We're one quarter into the year; we'll need to see how those relative trends
shake out over the balance of the year.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Thank you.

Our final question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to the 4G LTE conversation and
hoping you can talk about how OnStar fits into that rollout. And is this an opportunity for you to perhaps significantly
grow OnStar's global subscriber base? I know it's done very, very well in China and here in the U.S. and Canada. And
could that be a segment that you may consider eventually disclosing separately perhaps, so investors see just a
subscriber based business and potentially high margins there?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Quite honestly, I hadn't thought about it because this doesn't happen until end of 2014.
But that's a good question. We do want to change this from primarily a safety and security business to one that's much
more feature-rich, and where we get some real money from it. And we've never been properly compensated, in my
opinion, having come out of this industry, in terms of what we provide to the carriers.
For example, as – with the new contract, when it kicks in, every time we implement we get $20. We used to get
nothing. And we'll actually revenue share in usage on that service. So this is a little bit different than the model of just
having the carrier plug into your jack in the car, the carrier gets all of it. All of the sudden, we're part of the solution
and not just an intermediary, where we start to share revenue in different ways with the carrier.

So, we're not in the wireless business. But we're facilitating a customer and we're facilitating content. So, there is a
whole new front here for us that I think we'll have margins that will exceed what you typically see in a manufacturing
business.
