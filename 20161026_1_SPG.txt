David E. Simon
Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened several significant
redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continue to
achieve strong financial results.
Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of
the year. Based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our
full-year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87, which was higher than our original guidance of
$10.70 to $10.80. Our increased range also reflects a potential charge of $0.08 per share with respect to our likely
decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower due to the rapidly rising construction cost and
our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.
Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center, as well as the development
of the Southwest Corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping
experience for our guests and retailers, and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston and will be completed
by summer of 2017. Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the
tower in the future as market conditions warrant.
Now, let me turn to the quarter. FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year. For the first
nine months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 10.1% compared to the prior year period. We continue to see
strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our malls and premium outlets ended the quarter
at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Leasing activity remained solid. The mall and
premium outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share – per foot, an increase of 10.9%. Given our high
occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing were not as well located, continues to produce
healthy re-leasing spreads. And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases where we
choose to work with retailers in certain situations pre or post bankruptcy such as PacSun.
Base minimum rent was $50.76, up 4.5% compared to last year, reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of
13% as well. Now, just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth, and I believe this is the most important
metric for the investment community to focus on. Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the
quarter, third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million.
Our results to-date keep us on track for our full year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio.
On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of
growth that contribute to our portfolio NOI, with the diversity of sources fueling our NOI growth, is unique to Simon.
Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter.
Our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our
tourist spending in our centers, are active in – the extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as
we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences
at our properties, and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of
our highly – of our very high end portfolio.
Total retail sales per square foot at our malls and premium outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period.
Reported retailer centers continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist oriented malls and
premium outlets. Reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist oriented centers are stable. Reported sales
also include initial dilution from newly opened space, and importantly, we're beginning to anniversary some of this

decline, as you can see, our recent sequential quarters, Q2 to Q3, of our sales productivity is basically flat.
The end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our
platforms; our share, approximately 1.1%. We opened, as you know, King of Prussia, which connected the Plaza and
the Court. We finished Fashion Centre at Pentagon City. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of
120,000 square feet in North Texas, and in the next several weeks, we opened 60,000 square foot expansion at the
Outlets at Orange. And we also are opening our expansion in Venice, Italy with our partner, McArthurGlen, of 67,000
square feet. So, we continue to add value across the portfolio.
Now, on new developments, just so happens tomorrow, we're opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets. The center will
offer a great retail lineup. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington DC Metro area. We currently have five, that's
right, five outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia; four in the international markets, including France,
South Korea and Malaysia and Canada. All of these will open in 2017. And even though we're opening a new outlet
next week, the week after, we're actually opening Brickell City Centre in Miami, it's anchored by Saks. It's got a great
retail lineup with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family.
And as part of a landmark mixed used development, we look forward to managing the retail, and as a reminder, we're
only investing in the retail. And construction continues on the full price development of Fort Worth, The Shops at
Clearfork, anchored by Neiman Marcus opening in the fall of 2017. And these eight new projects represent around
$765 million of spend, our share.
And let me turn to Aéropostale. We're pleased to have partner with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco and Gordon
Brothers to acquire Aéropostale. In addition to the existing management team, the ABG Group will add significant
operating experience to Aéro. We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions, and after
reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment will prove to be yet another opportunity for
our company.
It's also important to keep this investment in perspective. You've all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you
to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers, and not by our
buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group, of which our share is $33 million,
including working capital, and the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make
money. If our model is right, we think we're buying this company at one time to two times EBITDA with future growth
opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be a astute investment. And for some of you who
don't know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout
the years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J.Crew, just to name a handful.
Also during the quarter, we acquired our partner's interest with McArthurGlen in our two outlets in Naples and Venice.
We continue to focus on our industry-leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the
quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing costs, increased our debt maturity a term, our current liquidity at $6.5
billion. And finally, on our dividend in 2016, we will have paid $6.50, that's an increase of 7.4% compared to $6.05
that we paid last year. That's a lot. I'm ready for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask on the leasing spread topic, I know you touched on it,
and it's been a popular point of conversation here. Since, it's a trailing 12 months number, are the results we're seeing
now in terms of lease spread just a pull forward and extension of something that happened, a slowdown in 2Q or did
the third quarter slow to realizing that it does include lease amendments?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we have had – look, let's just put this number in perspective, number one. We do include
lease amendments, and that's having the biggest impact of the growth slowing. Yet, if you look at our average base
rent, you can see we're doing new initial terms, we're doing very well. And some of the expiring leases also were a little
bit expiring at a little bit higher level. Now, our investors know that over a long period of time, we've always felt like
the $5 to $6 spread was kind of always in our – always part of our model. The fact is we've done a tremendous job of
outperforming that, but the long term, we've always kind of felt that, that $5 or $6 spread is kind of where we think the
market is.
We had a couple of years of significant outperformance, but we're not backing off our inherent value that we have in
our leases as they roll over, and we're just getting back to kind of more of a normalized environment. But for us, I don't
know about our peers, but for us, we include lease amendments, and the bottom line is that is having some impact on
the leasing spreads. But that $6 to $7 is maintaining itself, and that's kind of what we've told investors year after year
after year, and we feel very good about that.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. And then, just also you mentioned that right now, as you lease space, given the high
occupancy, the remaining space might not be as well located. So I guess my question is, since you have that high
occupancy, what are kind of the thoughts behind making these lease amendments and working with companies such as
– and you pointed out, PacSun?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's literally a case-by-case analysis. I think we're as sophisticated as anybody. I think
when – Aéropostale is a great example of our ability to analyze what the right trade is in these deals. And in some
cases, we're going to take the space back; in other cases, we're going to help the retailer go through the hard time. And
it's really a case-by-case – it's a case-by-case analysis, but there is nobody, I think, in our industry that's more
sophisticated in our ability to kind of maneuver through those situations. So it's case-by-case, anything can happen,
well, sometimes will work, sometimes we'll get the space back.
And certainly in the Aéro case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a
vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing. Amazon makes vertical investments, the cable industry
makes vertical investments, and again, I would encourage – we decided to make vertical investments when we decided
to franchise Starbucks locations two years, three years ago. That's the nature of our company, is that we're going to be
nimble.
We're going to – we have the right judgment when to make a deal with a retailer, when not; when to make vertical
investments, when not; when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley and when not, and that's why
we're in the position we are in today, and each and every case will be one-by-one.
I do appreciate, and I hope I'm right with you, okay, and I do appreciate you waiting to write until we have our call.
And I do think that's important because the other reason we have these calls is for – not every – there is not every
scenario where you can understand the nuances about what's going on in our business. So, I do appreciate your patience
to hear our story and then, obviously, you write whatever you want to write.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: I guess, is there a way for you to try and help separate out for us, the impact of these amendments
on the numbers, meaning PacSun and Aéro were having as big an impact as they are. Is there a way to sort of strip them

out and give us a sense for kind of what the remaining lease spreads look like, because obviously, this is kind of the
biggest number that people are focusing on? And if these two leases or tenants are having a disproportionate impact, it
might help to separate out those figures for us.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I don't – look, our business – Steve, I hear you. If we need to, we might, but the fact is
you got to look at our business in totality. You can't look at it on one operating metric or not because what I would ask
you to look at is why – let's talk about the three – we have grown our portfolio NOI, $300 million years-to-date. Let's
talk about that. Do you want to talk about that? That, to me, is more material than any one operating statistic
quarter-by-quarter. So, yeah, we could – we can slice and dice this anyway, but if we can spend more time talking
about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI, there are many REITs that don't have $300 million of NOI, yet we
grew that in nine months.
So, I would rather talk about that, it's more material than the fluctuations that have – that are occurring with operating
metrics. We could talk about sales. Sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and
the strong dollar. That doesn't mean that's going to last forever. And but again, the – there's this high desire to make
that be all and all – of all these metrics. And again, our number is clean, the results are the results. We can't speak to
anybody else, how they do it, but I – as I said to you, if you want my opinion on what's important, it's the $300 million
NOI growth. If you don't want that, I got it, but that's what I focus on.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: No, I get it. And I don't think people are dismissing your ability to deploy capital, whether it's
through developments or expansions, but clearly, there has been more pressure on the mall business. So, I just think
anything that you can do to assuage the fears about the internal growth prospects going forward. And perhaps, it's just
that a $6 to $7 spread on a roughly $60 or $61 expiring rent means that normalized leasing spreads should be 10%, and
maybe that's where we're going to head to. There's a new normal in the business, that's okay. I think people are just
trying to get comfort with that.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think that's a good point. So, let's talk about that and I'd mentioned that a little bit
in the first question. I think if you asked our investor group, we would've told them for 15 years, 20 years that our
re-leasing spreads are $5 or $6 a foot. Okay? We have had a long period of outperformance on that.
We've gotten better at what we've done. All sorts of reasons that we don't have to bore you. And you're right, we may
be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I
don't think from our standpoint, we ever guaranteed outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We
always said, look, it's $5 or $6, one year, it might be $8, one year, it might be $4, but that's kind of a – that's kind of
what we see the long-term trend, and I still feel comfortable, but that's the basis now.
It's no surprise that retail generally has come under pressure, lots of different reasons which we could go into, but let's –
unless you want to, let's not. But the fact is – and we are impacted, as I said to you before, by our general GDP growth.
And today, our retail generally is there's no inflation and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we're growing our
comp. So, I mean – and if nominal GDP, there is some inflation, so maybe real GDP growth is, I don't know, 50 basis
points. We're still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI, that's not bad.
It's not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it's still in the scheme of being able to grow our business,
that's not bad, and we're – I'm not defensive about it. I mean, that's kind of what I think we should expect when we have
essentially a real GDP growth of 1%, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more. And I think that's what you've got
to put in perspectives.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Well, I appreciate it. Thanks for the time.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

<Q - Christy McElroy>: Hey.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. How are you?
<A - David E. Simon>: Good, thanks.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So, David, wonder if you can talk a little bit about putting capital into your stock.
Last year, you had bought, I think it was like $315 million led by $180 million, probably see the stock with some of the
sell-off, as well as some of the retail headlines may have come off 20%. We spent a lot of time talking about something
you spent $30 million on, I was wondering, you got a $2 billion share repurchase program, how you feel about putting
money into your stock.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think at the end of the day, the best thing we can do is invest in our product,
okay, because the stock will go up and will go down, but by investing in our product – and I think what – unfortunately,
what I've seen with a number of retailers is they've not invested in their product. Okay? And – or they've chased the
holy grail of Internet sales to the detriment of what they should be doing with their physical product. Still, people want
to go physical shopping. And when they go physical shopping, then you've got to have a nice physical environment.
So, we have spent a lot of years wanting to invest in our physical product. And I think that's our number one focus,
continues to be, we're well through that. The good news is we have been contrarian in that. We started that in 2010.
And as you know, we're finishing projects, so it's not just talking about projects, but it's finishing on, on the projects.
So, I think as that wind downs, then the opportunity to buy stock back is always there. And I just don't think it's a high
priority, but that could change depending upon kind of where the world is and what the stock does. But I think my job
is the number one job I should be doing, is investing and making my product better. And that's my number one focus.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: And you talked in the opening comments about your deal making over the years and
always taking a proper risk reward and thinking about the capital committed to whether it's a project or whether it's a
venture investment. As you think about investing in Aéro, putting $30 million in, where is there sort of a health limit
that you'd want to have in those sorts of investments relative to the whole? And where would it fit within the Simon
organization? Is it more within the venture side or is there another sort of area – I don't know, if it's in the David Simon
bucket. I don't know, where does it fit within the organization?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, even though I'm older, I can always learn new things, and I've learned a lot
actually going through the Aéro deal. That's – it's – we're going to act as an investor, we're going to give them a
strategic direction as a board member. Authentic Brands, I'd encourage you to look at the brands and the history of that
company, they've done a great job of – they are brand builders, they are entrepreneurs. So we're not going to be running
the business. We're going to help strategically like we did. It will be – but we're helping – so I've got my IT guys
helping with their IT systems.
We've got our lawyers helping with their license agreements. So, it – we have a lot we can bring to the table and that's
what makes us unique. And – but it's not going to overwhelm anybody's particular time. They've got a good
management team that with our strategic help, I think we'll continue to make that profitable. And, look, if – based on
the numbers, I think it's going to be a compelling investment, but it's not without risk.
I mean, it is there are – there is risk out there whenever you make a venture like investment. But I can't think of a better
team between Gordon Brothers, Hilco, ABG, General Growth to all put our collective judgment to bear to make this a
profitable investment.
I don't think – going back to your first question, I don't think this is going to be the wave of the future. I mean, AT&T, I
mentioned vertical because I just try to put certain things outside of real estate in perspective, okay? So AT&T was
buying going vertical. They're spending $100 billion, okay? I go vertical, I spend $33 million, okay, million not billion,
$33 million. And again, I'm not comparing, I'm just trying to put these things in perspective. I'm not comparing our
business to AT&T or anybody else.
Amazon, what's made Amazon great is they've had the latitude to go vertical. They've gone vertical, they've gone
content, they've gone distribution, they've gone retail, and that may be the future of corporate America, is that you're

not going to pigeonhole these – if we want to just talk about leasing a Sears box that we get back, I mean that's okay for
some companies, but that's not what we're about.
So again, there is no – we have no bucket, it's not going to take away from what we're doing, my number one priority is
to make our product better any way that we can, technology, digital investments, look and feel, better retailers, different
mix, redevelopment, whatever, however that transpires. And making a vertical investment here or there is not going to
overwhelm us. But I want the latitude, too, and I think the investment community should want us to. At the end of the
day, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we're buying a business that ought to be valued at six times
EBITDA, and we're buying it at one time to two times, and I think that's a pretty good trade. But we got a – we're not
there yet, and that's the goal, but that's what we're trying to accomplish.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Hey, David, it's Christy. Sorry, but I have three questions. Just bigger picture, the consortium
has talked about a 300-store base to 400-store base count for Aéropostale. There's been a lot of talk about store count
rationalization among national retailers generally and how many stores do they actually need to serve their customers in
their market today. Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like Aéropostale and what does that imply for
your view of the need for other retailers to close stores, especially now that you're looking at these issues through that
Aéropostale lens?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, it's very – I think you've pointed out something that's very unique, is that we are
getting a lens at a much granular level on retail. So, it's very interesting. Sourcing – look, there are five or six things
that really make a retailer click, sourcing, obviously, rent expense, store expense, the merchandized quality of it, the
packaging. All this stuff that I think at the end of the day, are going to make us better real estate owners, but that
remains to be seen.
Aéro, look, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but since I like you, I'm going to tell you. Right now, we're
looking at around 500 stores in the U.S., is kind of the model. And based upon – we expect every one of those stores to
be profitable. So, it's a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment. We were thinking we could
justify our investment in a much lower store base, the fact of the matter is we found out there's a lot more store
profitability out there than we thought.
So, it's going to be around 500 stores, give or take. But I think store closings, it is the pressure for – that retailers – to
invest in the Internet, to close stores from their investment community is great. I would question whether that's the right
strategy because some of these stores are very profitable. Yet they feel like the headline closing stores is the answer,
and then all of this investment into the Internet is going to pay all these dividends.
Fact of the matter is, there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think all of us
can't lose sight of that, and that's where we should be investing. So, I do think there will be more pressure on store
closings. Unfortunately, over our history, we're prone to that. I don't need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we
went public with in 1993 no longer exist in 2016, and we will be able to deal with it. It's much easier to deal with it
when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have, but it's the soup of the day.
And so, I don't think it needs to be 300 stores or 400 stores or 500 stores, I think there are a lot of profitable stores that
retailers are feeling the pressure they've got to do something. And I would like them to invest in their stores, is the
something I would like them to do, but I don't always win that argument.
So, we're equipped to handle that, that's what we do, and – but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now, what we
did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. So put that – Christy, it is up, so put that in perspective. We
also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in 2016, it is down. We had much greater in 2015. And we
basically more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in 2015 in a flat to tough retail environment. And I
think everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay? So – but that doesn't mean we're doing cartwheels here. It is
we're grinding, we're as good as it gets when it comes to grinding, and that's the environment that is presented to us,
and we'll have to deal with it.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Thanks so much for the color.

Our next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I'm also here with Craig Schmidt. I guess, David, if we
could just talk a little bit more about the current environment. Let's say it continues – it persists through 2017, even
2018. How should we think about these rent amendments? How are you thinking about it when you're laying out your
budget for next year? Is this just something that we should get used to as we transition here, as the retailers invest more
money in their stores, we see more store closings? How should we think about that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think, again, it's a retail-by-retail perspective. We are seeing a stabilization in our
sales business. If you want to go focus on retail sales, quarter Q2 over Q3 is basically flat. And if you take out tourism,
you take out one retailer that's had decreases in sales, it's actually up. So, we're not like – we're – there is no huge
concern here. But we just – we are a product of the overall U.S. economy and quite – Jeff, what's the real GDP growth?
You tell me. So in that environment, where do you think it is, the real one, real GDP growth? What would – Merrill's
got a bunch of smart people, what would they say of this?
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: I think we're saying around that 1%, 1.5%.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. So, I mean, I – we're good. I'm not that good, but I got a lot of people around me that
are good. That's a constraint, so – but it is what it is. We'll sort it through, and I do think in that kind of environment,
we're going to have certain deals where we will go back and then we're going to have a lot of other deals. Frankly,
we're going to take this space back. And my mood's changing a little bit that maybe we're better off taking the space
back. I think we did play ball a little bit more with the bankruptcies in 2015 and the early 2016, and that's showing up
in the lease spread.
And I'm thinking sales are okay, stabilizing, maybe the world gets over all of this stuff that's going on out there, maybe
we stabilize – a lot of people feel like we're headed for growth, so maybe we take more space back. But we've kept the
buildings full as evidenced by the occupancy, there is a trade-off. We're on our target for comp NOI increase. So, it's
not all that bad. So just put in perspective, 2017 will transpire and we'll do a combination, sometimes we'll play ball,
other times, we're going to take the space back, and it's all a function of retail-by-retail decisions, space-by-space,
retailer-by-retailer.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Okay. Thanks, and I think Craig has a – one question.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Great. Thanks. Maybe I could do a little bit of a pivot here. Looking at your new
developments for the outlets, four of the five projects are international. Can we expect to see continued good growth in
new projects on an international scale? And then maybe more specifically, what your longer-term plans are with
McArthurGlen.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we just had a meeting with – I had a meeting with our partner Friday, last Friday, and
their business is very good, very solid. Provence is opening in spring of next year, which will be fantastic. We're very
close on getting the potential to build in Normandy, which we think will be a great – which will basically cover the
Western Parisian market. That could be fantastic. We've got a couple of acquisitions that we're working on, extensions
that we're on. So, I – it's all good there, it's been – the teams are working well together. Couldn't be more pleased with
the investment, and I think, Craig, it's just kind of business as usual. We'll see development – new development growth,
very pleased just that we've been able to create that partnership and create that relationship going forward.
In Asia, the team is working in a couple of other markets that I'm hopeful over time, that we'll be able to build the
premium outlet product there. We've got a couple of big expansions in the works, Gotemba is an example that could be
a landmark extension. So that business is – we're not slowing by any stretch of the imagination internationally in our
outlet business either with McArthurGlen or with our Asian partners.

The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: Oh, good morning. Good morning, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you doing?
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: It's – just fabulous, it's earnings season, life's great. So just a few questions here.
Let me start with an easier one before I ask one on the favorite same-store topic. Here in New York, obviously, a lot of
– sorry, the demand for street retail has gone down a lot, so a lot of vacant spaces, articles about global brands
rethinking their street retail needs, especially with where rents are and store profitability. Have you seen – as those
brands have dialed back, have you seen them, I don't want to say shift back, but have you seen more interest in going in
malls where they are profitable, or from your perspective, they've always been running street retail, their investment
there, separate from their decision to open up in the – in malls?
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't think there is a generic answer to that. I think it's brand-by-brand. And generally on the
luxury side of those brands, their business is actually – they're starting to anniversary some of the strong dollar stuff,
and we are – obviously, we are as well. They – and I meet with a lot of the folks, I mean, there are certainly some
brands here and there that are pulling back, but I'd say generally, and you're starting to see the numbers like from
LVMH and Kering that are posted recently, their business is good, pretty good. I think New York is – this is a novice
because we have no street retail, but New York is a little confusing, Tom, because you got Fifth, you got Madison, you
got Downtown, you got different – you got new development, you got West 57th Street, so they're all trying to sort that
up.
I think in the – in our business, it hasn't changed, and if anything, I'd say the mood is generally better than it was six
months ago. If you want a generic statement, and I think New York City itself is just different because they're all trying
to figure out where they need to be given the – what's going on in New York, but we don't have a dog in that hunt. And
I think Brickell is going to be – I mean, we'll – we have a little delay with the hurricane and – it isn't really – technically
wasn't a hurricane or not, I'm not really sure, but Brickell, I think, is going to be – a lot of the retailers will open in the
first quarter of next year, but I think that mix there is really going to be great and cool. I think the Saks store is going to
be great. And the demand on that just continue to pick up, right, Rick, over – month-after-month, and I think that's a
good indication that if you have a good product or you have a good scheme, retailers will come.
Rick, you want to comment on Brickell?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And I think Brickell is certainly going to show that there is going to be a great mix of
designers, food, international retailers, and right now, we're 91% leased. And as David said, the opening is going to
take place over – we're going to have a big slug over the next few weeks and another big slug over the first quarter of
next year. The only other thing I would say is that we are seeing the international retailers like Zara, like H&M,
accelerating their focus on our properties in the United States because there is demand to grow in this market and we
are seeing that.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I would just say, we've got just to finish the whole thought and then you can ask me if it's
on comp NOI, it's not a tough question, I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm thinking.
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: You don't know the question yet, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right, but – all right. I hope it's – bring it on.
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: We don't give our questions in advance.

<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Okay, good. Thank you. That's what I like about you, Alex. So, – but just to finish
the luxury – people that would populate street retail in New York, we say luxury, we're – not that it's easy, but we're
making progress with Clearfork, and that's in Fort Worth, Texas. We're going to have those kind of brands, not a lot of
them, but the right ones. We opened King of Prussia with – in the connection, and again, a lot of those are opening, but
the results from those high end brands have been fantastic.
So, that part of our business is different. I think it's interesting, it's actually starting to do better than maybe what you're
seeing and whatever has been talked about in New York street retail. But I really – I don't know. I don't really have a
dog in that hunt.
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: Okay. Then the second question is, it sounded like you said that bankruptcies and
the issues really peaked last year, and that you guys are more accommodative with retailers trying to restructure. And
therefore, seems like this year, we're seeing the impact in the same store metrics. At the same time, I think you said that
the tourism impacts, strong dollar is also anniversarying. So, it almost sounds like next year, we should expect same
store metrics to get a positive bump as these trends sort of anniversary. Is that fair or as you guys look into your leasing
for next year, we still should see some of this impact, whether it's on re-leasing spreads or same store NOI, et cetera?
Should we still see that in 2017 or is 2017 going to be a little better because this stuff anniversaries?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I – look, our – I think the big unknown is just what's going on in the overall – all you
have to do, and you're a smart financial guy, look at our P&L, right? You could see – put the leasing spreads aside, put
all these other stuff aside, I mean the reality is the comp NOI is really a function of our overage rent. It's right there on
the financial statement, okay? It's down, can't help it. I mean, and it's really a function of the fact that we got these great
tourist centers where we're having – we're suffering from that impact. But I don't think that's a long-term impact, but it's
starting to anniversary and it shouldn't continue to get worse, okay?
But, Alex, it could get worse because no one knows what's going to happen with the dollar. The international tourist
market is volatile. At best, we live in an uncertain time, but we're – I think we're doing – to deliver this 3.5% and
deliver over 6% portfolio growth I think is reasonably good. It's not great, but it's reasonably good given some of the
constraints that we're dealing with that are a little bit out of our control, a little bit. Now, we're going to take
responsibility for a lot of that stuff, but a little bit out of control. So, I think it's too early to tell you on 2017.
Unfortunately, I say this because it starts not next week, the week after. Rick, when are property budgets?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah, a week after.
<A - David E. Simon>: Week after where we go one-by-one, space-by-space, and we'll report back early next year
what our view of that is. And it's a little – there's a little more volatility and being able – the standard deviation is
probably a little bit higher than it used to be just because of the environment that we have that we're operating in.
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: Okay. And just confirming, eighth year taking an $0.08 charge, that's in guidance
for Copley and...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I'm glad you asked that and the answer is yes. That is in guidance, so that is – if we had
not taken that charge, our guidance would be up another $0.08.
<Q - Alexander David Goldfarb>: Okay. Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: No worries. Thank you.

Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Hi, good morning. Just to follow on, on that, so that will be $0.13. I mean, is there
anything you could point to as a driver of kind of that kind of guidance increase in late October?

Page 11 of 15
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, generally, look, we're producing the results we want to produce. So, I know the
operating metrics are not perfect. I'm not – we're not going to deny that. I mean, we – but we told at the beginning of
the year, this is the plan, 3.5%, 6%, and we're producing a little bit better on that front overall, and that's where it rolls
up to. And so we're being very cautions on Copley.
We have made the final decision on that, but I think it's likely that we're going to do that. But I – but we've got – I got
to run it through the board and we – but I want the market to know that, that may be off the table going forward at least
for the time being. And we could – look, we could have kept it on our books and waited, but you know what, I think the
right thing to do if we, in fact, decide to do it, will be to take that hit.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Okay. And then, you mentioned in terms of the same-store number, not just the PacSun,
but then also – I think you said intentionally kind of reducing the specialty leasing program and the common area at
some of your high-end malls. I mean, is that a material impact and kind of what's sort of the thought process behind
that? And kind of maybe if you have a number you've given us in the past, kind of what the – that program is as a
percent of NOI?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think it's material and that it does affect the comp number, the comps would be higher
had we not chosen. But, look, part of what we have to do is listen to our clients, our clients – and our clients, to some
degree, especially in certain areas of the mall, very concerned about that. So we want to be receptive, we've got
competition in some of these markets that we've got be responsive to, and we just think it's the right thing to do.
Did a lot of research on the consumer, consumer really doesn't care, but on the other hand, we have to – when it comes
to the property business, we've got to listen to our clients, i.e. the retailers, et cetera, and we obviously have to be –
listen to the consumers. They diverge here, but in this case, we want to be as sensitive to the clients as we can. And
some are very sensitive to us, and we don't want to keep that from bringing the right mix into some of these centers,
and that has hurt us over the years. We've thinned out on the very high-end properties.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Has this been...
<A - David E. Simon>: But I – yeah. Go ahead, go ahead.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Go ahead. I was just going to say, it has – I mean, has this strategy been kind of
accelerating recently is why you mentioned it in terms of same-store number this quarter or can it be ongoing over the
past period of time?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think it's been – look, we didn't really do it last year because a lot of these projects were in
the state of development, but it's clearly been beginning – it's clearly been throughout 2017.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: And remember, this stuff builds.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: So, it has more of a – as you go later in the year, it has more of a back-end impact, okay? So it
kind of builds, it's less important in Q1 and Q2 just because seasonality of our business.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Great. And just last question. I appreciate all the color on the Aéro economics and just
wanted to ask, I mean, there have been dozens of similar bankruptcies over the years, and you probably could have had
opportunities to do something similar then. I mean, could you point to anything outside just the economics of it that
makes you think differently about this, and then just going forward? I mean, I know you had the kind of the macro view
about vertical integration, but anything more kind of in your narrow business driven where you didn't do this for years
and now it looks interesting?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think that's a very good question, and I would say this. I think as we've gotten to know
Authentic Brand Group, we now have – for us to have done this without their involvement on how to stabilize and then
grow the brand, I mean, that would – we – I might have that expertise a couple of years from now, maybe. I mean, I say

I – we, I'd say we. I doubt it, but maybe, you never know. And I think having – and if we have talked – it's very
interesting. I have been talking to Authentic Brands over – for a year about other brands that might fit into this model
that we've – are creating, but they didn't come to fruition for whatever reason.
But I think we finally – we have, over this last year, been able to develop kind of an operating model and platform.
They're great at brand building, having General Growth as part of that and their ability to bring their real estate and
their thoughtfulness to the table in terms of how you operate a business was very helpful. So having the liquidation
angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical.
So it was really the long – in a nutshell, it was really because the partners were able to do it. The partners brought so
much to the table that this was the right deal. If it were just us on our own, I'm not – I'd be the first to tell you, I don't
know that we would do it. I'm – now, we've done Starbucks franchises, but that's – we did – by the way, and I
encourage everybody that goes to Del Amo, go to Pink's Hot Dogs, that's owned by your company, Simon Property
Group. I'm so excited about that franchise that we own. It's great hot dogs, it's an institution. That's – we've got a small
group that kind of runs that business, this is a little bit out of the ordinary. And I would say, simply put, the fact that we
had this partnership that was able to navigate all of the complexities of this. And so, I think that's the important
determinant of why we did this versus not doing others.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: And the partner see it as not necessarily just a one-off, but something that could be
replicated?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, but what's – we've got to walk, crawl, before we run.
<Q - Paul Burton Morgan>: Great. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Richard Hill>: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time this morning and always appreciate the transparency. I want to
just ask a quick question about the lease amendments maybe in the context of your broader portfolio of malls. You
have obviously the luxury of seeing across the productivity spectrum. So when we're thinking about lease amendments
in maybe your higher quality malls, is it maybe the case that some of these tenants are paying above market rents to get
into the best quality malls, and therefore, you might still be incentivized to make a lease amendment, maybe reduce
their rent, but recognizing it's still a pretty attractive rent overall?
Is that the right way to think about it? And then maybe if you could provide some color, if any, about how you're seeing
lease amendments on malls doing $700 a square foot versus maybe those doing $350 a square foot. But I do appreciate
that it's mall-to-mall.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean that's the bottom-line. Certainly, we have some of those cases, but it really is
mall-by-mall, space-by-space and what the retailer relationship is, and what we think the retailer future is. I wish there
were a simple straight-forward answer, but there is not. We try to use our business judgment in figuring out what the
right is. It's also, do we want to be conservative or do we want to be aggressive, what's our mood of the future.
As you know, last year, we had a lot of bankruptcies, and we gave direction to like, okay. We're starting to change our
attitude a little bit. I can't tell you that it's going to be a complete reversal. We try the right – make the right judgment
call. Now, I will tell you these amendments are like anything else. They – once you do it for one retailer, don't kid
yourself, you hear about it and it goes everywhere else.
<Q - Richard Hill>: Yeah. Of course.

<A - David E. Simon>: Part of our job is to contain that. And – but we've experienced this before. We did do this in
other economic times. And again, our business is fine, but it's not – it's – we're trying to be accommodating, but we
could shift our strategy pretty quickly. And we try to evaluate it one by one. Rick, do you want to add anything to it?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I would say to you, the most important consideration for you to realize is these lease
amendments are not forever. One of our considerations is do we have a better replacement tenant, but that tenant won't
be ready to open for a year, or where it is in the project and what is the project. So all of those factors come into play as
to how we want to deal with a specific room and how we price the room, and how we interface with that tenant.
Then the only other point I would make is that – and it gets lost sometimes, but today, our portfolio has never been
stronger, never been better, physical condition, never had a better mix of small shop tenants, better mix of boxes, better
mix of restaurants, better set of amenities. So, we are, on a continual basis, taking share and that's our focus, to make
our properties as compelling as they can be, and that helps us in dealing with all the things you've been talking about.
<A - David E. Simon>: And again, let's – the business, we are 96.3% occupied. And as an example, Macy's announced
100 store closings. They're closing – Macy's is leaving one of our malls. They're leaving one of our malls, we think, in
a very small mall that has basically no financial impact to us at the end of the day. So there is this narrative and the
mood, but the fact of the matter is go back to 7.3% NOI growth, that's $300 million, let's put it all in perspective, okay?
<Q - Richard Hill>: Okay. That's' very helpful. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Great. Thanks. Can I – could you give a brief update on what's happening with your
Seritage JV?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We are basically in the same position that we articulated in our last earnings call. We have
indentified users for our boxes, we have plans for our boxes. We are not going to proceed with that redevelopment.
And so we have a firm understanding of our returns and the costs of downsizing the Sears stores. There are
conversations going on right now regarding those costs. And as soon as we have a clear understanding of that, we are in
the position to proceed to try and execute on some of those redevelopments.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: And that would include the Primark at Burlington Mall?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: That is independent. That is proceeding, as is the addition of Primark at South Shore in a
portion of Sears, which is not in Seritage. The Primark lease at Burlington was existing at the time we did our joint
venture, and that is proceeding.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Great. Thanks, Rick. David, a question for your in terms of how sustainable do you – I
mean, you're talking about the 6.6% to 7% NOI growth. But if you put that in perspective, you do that for a decade,
you've doubled NOI. I mean, is that realistic for $100 billion company?
<A - David E. Simon>: We're working to achieve that, okay? I can't – I'm not that clairvoyant to look out that far.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: But do you see anything near-term that's going to break that streak?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think we're going to lead our industry and portfolio NOI growth, but we've done it for
so long, I don't see any reason why we can't continue.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.

Next question is from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Hi. I guess going back Aéro for a second, you discussed this as being more of an
opportunistic investment. But out of curiosity, when you first thought about it and got into it, was it more a defensive
play to control store closings or how did you look at it initially?
<A - David E. Simon>: Not at all. As I said in my opening comments, I mean, no one would put new money into a
business that we didn't think would have an exciting future. And that's evidenced by kind of the group that we have
bind – bought the company. So, we certainly get the benefit of Aéro paying rent, but that's not a reason to invest in the
business. We could re-lease those spaces and that's not – that was – that's not a factor in putting new money into a
investment.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. And on the outlet side, you talked about international expansion. Can you
just talk about the U.S. and what the opportunities are that you see over the next five years, 10 years, just what does
that pipeline look like?
<A - David E. Simon>: In our outlet business?
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah, outlets.
<A - David E. Simon>: I think we'll – the pace may not be as hectic as we've done over the last three years or four
years, but Norfolk, we open next year. We're going to actually start another outlet in the spring of this year – spring of
2017 in a very good growing market. We've got another one under serious examination. So, I don't think it'll be as
maybe as active as we've had over the last two years or three years, but we'll selectively do some stuff, at least one a
year on average, maybe two. We've got some, I think, some unique opportunities. We're also very focused on
expanding with the Allen deal. Let me – adding 120,000 square foot to a center that does, I don't know, $600 plus a
foot, and the outlet business is very attractive. So, there is a lot to do with our domestic portfolio as well.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay, that was it. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thanks.

Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. So, David, just wanted to go back to something you just said just about a minute ago.
As you deal with retailers like Aéropostale and PacSun and go through lease negotiations, how do you really contain
the risk that somehow, leverage doesn't move more towards retailers that might be in trouble, that might come back to
you and try to do similar deals going forward?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, as I said, when this happens, you get – you do get a – it does tend to spread. On the other
hand, it's very simple, we'll say we're not going to do it. So that changes the dynamics pretty quickly. So, look, again,
we don't – this is a space-by-space, retail-by-retailer decision. It's not pervasive throughout, but it's – and again, I
explained to you our rationale for why we kind did it 2015, 2016. But it's something that we'll – we evaluate everyday
with every retailer, and my instinct is that we could be changing how we dealt with kind of the 2015, 2016 stuff
already, but we'll – it will be a case-by-case basis.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. And just going back to your development pipeline, you have about $3.5 billion worth of
projects. Just given that some of those projects or a lot of them were probably started at a time where maybe the view
of the health of the retail environment might be a little bit different, how should we think about the overall arc of
capital deployment? Is it reasonable to expect that number to come down going forward?

<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I – there is nothing in our redevelopment that we're not doing other than potentially,
Copley. And Copley was – I mean, I would encourage everybody to study what's going on in construction costs and
what's going on in supply and demand there.
And we did not want to be – unfortunately, the build there is longer than it should be because of the nature of how we
have to reinforce the structure. And we spent a lot on it because – to get approvals and to make sure we have the
engineering to do it. But the reality is, when we started seeing the construction cost, it's just not the right time to do it
with all the supply and the costs there.
We don't see that anywhere else in the portfolio. So we've got a lot of very interesting stuff to do beyond what we're
doing now, and like I said, we've done some really good work in the field and King of Prussia, being part of Brickell,
Clearfork. We've got plans to expand Fashion Valley. And I can go through the whole list, but that part of the business
is unabated because we think investing in our great real estate is what we should do for a living, and that's not
changing. But we do have to worry about supply and demand. And I'm not worried about supply and demand in our
retail portfolio. In the case of Copley, I got nervous about it, I'd be the first to admit.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay, thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
