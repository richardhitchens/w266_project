Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As you guys saw in the press release today, UTC reported Q1 earnings per
share of $1.58. That's up 20% versus prior year and up 7% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items.
Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $0.07 in the quarter, which equates to about 5% on year-over-year
earnings. So, a good start to the year. We also benefited from a few timing items that Akhil and [ph] Paul (1:53) will
walk you through in a second.
Sales of $14.5 billion were up 3% organically led by solid growth at Climate, Controls and Securities and UTC
Aerospace Systems, which were up 6% and 7% respectively on an organic basis. Segment operating margins expanded
by 20 basis points to 15.6%, despite a 40 basis point headwind from pension. For the full-year, we continue to expect
earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.05.
With that, let me turn it over to Akhil and [ph] Paul (2:21) to take you through the results in detail, and I'll be back and
give you some thoughts on the quarter and the remainder of the year before we get into the Q&A.
Akhil?
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. Turning to slide two, organic sales grew 3% in the quarter and that's on top of the 5% organic growth we
saw in the same quarter last year. In the commercial businesses, we saw 6% growth in the Americas, helped by the
ongoing U.S. economic recovery. Asia also grew by 6% and Europe was up slightly in the quarter.
On the aerospace side, defense sales were flattish and commercial grew by 3%, with aftermarket growth of 2% at Pratt
and 4% at UTC Aerospace Systems. Sikorsky's commercial business was down 26% as lower oil prices negatively
impacted demand for helicopters and aftermarket in the oil and gas segment.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide three, and just a reminder, we've talked to the commercial business
orders on a constant currency basis, as we usually do. Although there are some puts and takes, overall macro trends
continued to support our expectation of 3% to 5% organic sales growth for the year.
In our commercial businesses, we continued to see growth in the U.S. Despite a harsh winter in many parts of the
country, the outlook for commercial construction markets remains encouraging and ABI trends have been positive 10
out of the last 12 months. We continue to see that in our orders at Otis, where U.S. new equipment was up 14%.
At CCS, America's commercial HVAC equipment orders were up mid-single-digit. Residential equipment sales were
up 3% in the quarter, and that's on a tough compare. Recall that resi sales were up over 20% in Q1 2014.
As many of you know, Carrier's U.S. resi business is primarily a book-and-ship business and starting with this quarter
we will include resi equipment sales on this chart with orders for other long lead CCS equipment businesses. This gives
a better representation of market demand and removes noise from things like last year's SEER-14 change-related
preorder. We've adjusted the historic data for comparison as well.
Moving on to Europe; we see the economic environment trending positively as quantitative easing measures take hold
and a weaker euro supports export growth. Eurozone manufacturing activity expanded in March to its fastest pace in 10
months, driven by Germany, Italy and Spain in particular.
At UTC, Otis new equipment orders were up 37%, reflecting broad-based strength. Commercial refrigeration orders in
Europe were also up 10%. In Asia, economic output in China is moderating. As we all know, this is not new news. Real
estate investment, new construction starts, floor space sold are all slowing. Otis new equipment orders were down 12%
in the quarter. Now Q1 is our most difficult compare there, but construction activity in China has clearly been slowing.
Shifting to commercial aerospace; as Dave Gitlin said in March, UTC Aerospace Systems had a soft start to the year in
the commercial aftermarket, where sales were up 4%. This was driven mainly by a tough prior year compare on
provisioning, but parts sales were strong, up 12% in the quarter.

At Pratt & Whitney, commercial aftermarket sales were up 2% with growth in transactional spares partially offset by
lower engine service revenues. In spite of the slow start, we continue to be encouraged by the strong fundamentals of
sustained 5% to 6% air traffic growth and healthy airline profitability projections.
Taking a closer look at the first quarter results on slide four, total reported sales decreased by 1% as 3% organic growth
was more than offset by four points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Segment operating profit was flat in the
quarter, with five points of headwind from foreign exchange.
Operating margins of 15.6% increased by 20 basis points, led by CCS where we saw solid drop-through once again,
leading to margin expansion of 120 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.58 was up 20% in the quarter, driven largely
by the timing of restructuring and gains. Recall that the first quarter of 2014 included $0.09 of net restructuring
charges, while we saw $0.07 of net gains in the first quarter of 2015.
Absent the impact of gains and restructuring, earnings per share were up 7%, about $0.10 higher than we anticipated
based on earlier than expected finalization of some discrete items at CCS, Pratt, UTAS and Corporate.
Free cash flow in the quarter was 67% of net income, driven largely by seasonal inventory build and higher receivables.
Free cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant net outflow in the quarter at Sikorsky.
Share repurchase was $3 billion, including the benefit from the accelerated stock repurchase that we announced last
month, so we are pretty much done with the share buybacks placeholder for this year. We are maintaining our
placeholder of $1 billion for M&A and continue to expect free cash flow to net income of 90% to 100% in 2015.
We also continue to anticipate $300 million in restructuring this year, all offset by one-time gains. The recorded pre-tax
equivalent gains of $0.14 in Q1 and expect the remaining $0.09 in the second half. We spent $93 million on
restructuring in the first quarter and expect gains to equal restructuring for the first half.
As we think about first-half earnings, we expect organic revenue growth to be in line with the full-year guidance of 3%
to 5% and reported EPS growth to be slightly above the high end of the full-year expectation of 0% to 3%.
Let me stop there for now and turn it over to [ph] Paul (9:03) to take you through the business unit results in more
detail.
Unverified Participant
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So, turning to page five, Otis profit improved 1% at constant currency on 2% organic sales
growth. Overall foreign exchange translation was an 11-point earnings headwind and a nine-point sales headwind.
Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contributions from higher volume and productivity initiatives in the
Americas and in Asia. This was offset by a decline in profit in Europe due to lower volume and continued pricing
pressure in the service business.
Sales in EMEA were down mid single-digit with declines in both service and equipment sales. Both the Americas and
Asia regions were up 7%. The Americas had nearly 20% new equipment sales growth and low single-digit service
growth, while Asia had high single-digit growth in new equipment and mid single-digit growth in service.
Sales in China were up 7%, driven by the conversion of new equipment backlog and strong service. But that plus 7%
was softer than the 10% growth we expected this year.
New equipment orders were up 8% in the quarter at constant FX and continued to be strong in the Americas, where
orders were up high single-digit. Orders in EMEA were very strong, up 37% with broad-based growth across the
region.
Asia orders, however, were down mid single-digit driven by weaker demand in China, which saw a 12% decline on
some large projects. On a unit basis, orders were essentially flat. Q1 was a tough compare for China. Recall that last
year orders were up 25% in the first quarter, but as Akhil said, activity clearly has softened. We continue to watch

China and Europe's service; and for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $100 million to $150
million of profit growth for Otis.
On slide six, Climate, Controls and Security had good traction in the first quarter with 6% organic sales growth led by
Transicold, which grew high teens following the strong order intake we saw in Q4 at both container and North America
truck/trailer.
We saw mid single-digit growth in the Americas, led by commercial HVAC and the fire and security product
businesses. EMEA grew low single-digits, while Asia was down low single-digit with declines in commercial HVAC,
most notably in China and in Southeast Asia, partially offset by growth in fire and security field.
Operating profit was up 14% at constant currency, driven by drop-through on the organic volume growth along with
benefits related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a joint venture and a property sale. FX translation was a
six-point profit headwind.
Overall, operating margins were up 120 basis points from prior year to 16.3%. Order growth at CCS was led by
double-digit growth in refrigeration on a very strong Transicold, up nearly 25%, along with better commercial
refrigeration, where orders were up mid single-digit.
Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid single-digit with strength in the Americas offsetting weakness in Asia.
Fire and security product orders were flattish, while field orders declined by mid single-digits.
As Akhil mentioned, CCS equipment orders were up 6%, in line with our full-year mid single-digit organic sales
growth expectation. With solid results in the first quarter for CCS, we continue to expect profit growth of $200 million
to $250 million on a constant currency basis on mid single-digit organic sales growth.
Turning to aerospace on slide seven; Pratt & Whitney sales were flattish organically, with military engine sales and
commercial aftermarket both up 2%. Just a comment on that 2% up commercial aftermarket, it's a bit misleading, as the
large commercial engine transactional aftermarket business was up 6%, with spares up nearly 10%; this signals healthy
airline activity. Aftermarket shop visits were down in the quarter which, with our fleet management programs, means
engines are on wing longer. That's good for the airlines and good for Pratt over the long-term.
Commercial OE was down mid single-digit, driven by the timing of engine shipments. Pratt operating profit was flat,
and headwinds from higher negative engine margin and pension expense were more than offset by favorable
aftermarket mix and performance, along with lower engineering and development spending. The quarter also benefited
by $0.03 from a favorable contract termination. Margins were up 10 basis points to 13%. For the full year, we continue
to expect Pratt & Whitney's operating profit to be down $50 million to $125 million.
Turning to slide eight; UTC Aerospace Systems profits grew 4%, on 7% organic sales growth. Sales were driven by
double-digit growth in commercial OE and a 4% increase in commercial aftermarket, which were partially offset by a
softer military business, which was down mid single-digits.
Commercial OE sales benefited from a change in arrangement that added around $50 million of pass-through sales with
no margins. As Akhil noted earlier, we signaled a slow start to our commercial aftermarket business, and we saw that
with lower provisioning and maintenance volume in our repair shops. But, we continue to be encouraged by strong part
sales, which were up 12% in the quarter.
Year-over-year profit growth was driven by benefits from contract settlements, continued cost reduction efforts, and
additional licensing income. These were partially offset by higher pension expense and FX. Operating margins were up
10 basis points at actual FX, to 17.4%. For the year, based on anticipated improvements in the commercial aftermarket,
we continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $275 million on mid single-digit sales growth at UTC
Aerospace Systems.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine; sales were down 7% organically and operating profit decreased by 11%. The
year-over-year sales decline was driven by lower commercial volume, as well as continued softness in both military
and commercial aftermarket.

We are seeing pressure from the oil and gas segment. Not only has new capacity been put on hold, the number of
offshore working rigs has also come down, which puts pressure on fleet expansion and the existing fleet's aftermarket
business.
In the quarter, Sikorsky shipped seven fewer S-92 and S-76D aircraft. Although Q2 should be better, we'll likely see
continued pressure in the back half of the year. Softer shipments were partially offset by growth in development
programs, which were up significantly as we ramp up on both the presidential and the combat rescue helicopter
programs.
The operating profit decline was driven by the impact of lower commercial aircraft volumes in the Canadian Maritime
Helicopter program. Although margin from the higher development sales did provide some offset, development sales
come at a lower margin rate than commercial, where we saw the largest declines.
This was a slow start for Sikorsky. It's too early in the year to point to a guidance change, but we're clearly seeing
pressure in commercial from steep spending declines in the oil and gas industry. During the quarter, Sikorsky started
ground testing on the first 53K [CH-53K] flight aircraft, as well as on the first S-97 RAIDER prototype aircraft, and
expects first flight of the RAIDER in the second quarter. These are major milestones for two key programs.
With that, let me turn it back to Greg for wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Thanks, [ph] Paul (17:26). Let me wrap up with just a few thoughts. So, a good start to the year with 3% organic
revenue growth, solid earnings growth, and continued margin expansion. Order trends and end markets are broadly in
line with expectations, with a few exceptions. China is clearly softer for our commercial businesses. However, the
stimulus programs which were announced yesterday should help.
On the other hand, the U.S. is slightly better. HVAC is up in the U.S., fire and security products are up, and Otis new
equipment orders are up again, and have been strong now for quite some time. So the U.S. feels pretty good.
Although in the past we've been disappointed by a lack of growth in Europe, I'm encouraged by the signs of growth
we're now seeing. Six months ago, we wouldn't of thought that Otis new equipment orders would ever be up almost
40% in the region, so great traction there this quarter.
On the aero side, a little slower than expected start in the commercial aftermarket, but we continue to expect growth to
improve as we move through the year, as the benefits of lower oil prices makes its way into the airline purchasing
activity and compares get a little easier. And while lower oil prices are putting some near-term pressure on Sikorsky,
the benefits from lower oil costs in other segments will provide some offset. So as I said, a good start to the year. We
continue to achieve significant milestones on our programs, continue to secure key wins, and position the portfolio to
drive long-term shareholder value.
At Pratt & Whitney, Geared Turbofan has now completed more than 16,000 hours and 31,000 cycle of full-engine
testing, including 3,500 hours of flight time. In addition to the A320neo flight testing, we're also powering flights on
six CSeries test aircraft. Our new engines are meeting or exceeding technical expectations and customer commitments,
providing a glimpse of the significant value these engines are expected to deliver to customers following entry into
service later this year.
You recall back in January, we consolidated our Aerospace Systems business from a two-P&L structure to a single
P&L. Dave Gitlin and the team have done a good job over the past three months of bringing these two structures
together, while staying focused on supporting our customers and delivering best-in-class margins.
As you saw a few weeks ago, we welcomed Bob Leduc back to UTC as the President of Sikorsky Aircraft. He started
earlier this month and has hit the ground running. Across the aerospace industry, Bob is recognized as a prudent leader,
and he has the vision and experience necessary to lead Sikorsky today and into the future.

The Building & Industrial Systems business had another solid quarter delivering mid single-digit combined organic
sales growth for Otis and CCS. Integration activities continue to progress well with the team finding ways to serve our
customers more efficiently. BIS continues to also strengthen its presence in emerging market, with several new and
expanded joint venture relationships including the commercial HVAC in China, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The latter two were recently expanded to include the broader BIS product portfolio. We also completed the acquisition
of CIAT, which is a European commercial HVAC manufacturer, and we began consolidating its results in Q1. BIS also
expanded its relationship with Toshiba, including the launch of a new Variable Refrigerant Flow, or VRF, line of
HVAC products in the U.S. market.
So good momentum. As you heard from the Presidents in March, each of our businesses is well-positioned in our core
markets. This, along with continued product innovation, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable organic growth.
And we're making progress on our corporate-led initiatives as well.
Akhil and the team are making headway towards a simplified corporate cost structure and we're on track to deliver
about $100 million in run rate savings by the middle of next year. As Akhil mentioned earlier, we launched an
accelerated share repurchase program in March, which accounts for most of this year's $3 billion of share repurchase, a
lot of value in UTX at these price levels.
And lastly, we continue to make progress on the evaluation of strategic options for Sikorsky, including the potential for
a spin. We have nothing new to share today on that topic, but we'll let you know when the evaluation process is
complete, which I now expect to be roughly mid-year. So again, for the rest of 2015 at the UTC level, no real changes
from what we told you last month.
With that, let's open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We are asking that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first
question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned on Sikorsky that the guidance may look a little bit shaky.
But just on Otis, the EBIT was down over $50 million year-on-year in Q1. The guide for the year is I think down $100
million to $150 million and the currency effect is pretty stable through the year. So, maybe give some color as to why
that should rebound in the second half. Is it to do with European aftermarket or cost savings coming through?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. So, Julian, I think what we are looking at is the improving signs in Europe to some extent
which will help buffer the back half. The two-watch items for us, as [ph] Paul (23:04) said in his comments, was
Europe, pricing in the service side and also the China equipment. I think because of the backlog that is coming into the
year, the China business will still grow this year. Service business continues to grow very nicely, grew almost 20%
again this quarter.
So, yes, a little shy off the expectations on new equipment in China, but these trends in the Otis Europe new equipment
orders should hopefully offset a little bit of that. And America continues to be strong. So, we are watching those two
items. The pricing pressure in Europe and the China new equipment market, but broadly we still feel we can get to the
low-end of the range at least.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thank you. And then my second question is just on Pratt & Whitney, the commercial
aftermarket business. You gave some helpful color around sort of the underlying trends versus what was reported at the
plus 2%. But maybe just how quickly do you think the underlying versus the kind of headline number will come
together? Do you still think in Q2 you could see low single-digit commercial aftermarket sales growth?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Julian, I think, again, we expect an improving aftermarket as we go through the year.
And, again, as we talked about, these lower oil prices that phenomenon should play out even more strongly I think in
the back half of the year as it takes six months or so to get people to change purchasing behavior. But, again, I think it's
all kind of out there within the guidance. It started out slow. Dave Gitlin, I think talked about that for the Aerospace
Systems group back in March, kind of a slow start. But, again, all of the signs are there. The RPMs continue to be very
strong, especially in the emerging markets. And we expect we'll see the engines come back and we'll see the parts go
out the door.
<A - Akhil Johri>: The important thing to focus on, Julian, there is the transactional spares numbers that I think [ph]
Paul (24:57) talked about, right? Once you strip out the spares used in our own fleet management programs, the spares
we sell to airlines or the spares we use in time and material jobs collectively are up about 10%, right? And that's the
number which essentially we watch carefully. If the FMPs are lower, actually it's good news in the long-term. So, I
think we're focusing on the right thing here, which is the transactional space.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just first quick one on China and the order number. Just kind of digging into that with a little
more granularity, if you were to take a look at that either by residential versus commercial infrastructure, or maybe by
brand if it were OCL versus [ph] Shiza (25:52) or any way you'd like to cut it, is there a difference in the trends that
you're seeing there on the order front that you could highlight for us?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So, the residential is a little slower than we expected. That's a big headline first, right? So, in terms
of the brands, I think the Otis brand is doing well obviously on the [ph] Shiza (26:12) side, which is more in the
residential side. We see a bigger impact as you would expect because that's the part of the market which is a little
slower than we had anticipated. That's probably the broad comments I can offer on that.
But units, just as a reminder, the units were flattish for Otis, right? So, even the dollar numbers feel like down 12%, but
in unit terms the orders were flattish.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And are they seeing any change in the backlog conversion? I know you guys have talked
about that, carrying that backlog into this year.
<A - Akhil Johri>: No, that still feels okay. And I think as Geraud said in March, just the conversion of the backlog
into sales this year should give you about 5% to 8%, 5% to 6% of sales growth. And then it will all be a function of
how many orders we get this year and how much of that gets converted. And that's the math which will get the ultimate
new equipment sales in China.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. And then on the Sikorsky front, I wondered if you might give us some color around
the commercial spares orders and how much the oil and gas impact may have influenced what you saw there in the
quarter.
<A - Akhil Johri>: The commercial aftermarket for Sikorsky was down double-digit in the quarter, right? So, some of
that is just a function of the fact that even the rigs which are operational, actually some of the working rigs have been
coming down as well. So, it's not only the impact associated with the expansion, which impacts the OE side more,
we've seen some impact on the aftermarket.

Now we do believe that aftermarket will actually do better as the year goes through, because production is still
continuing in these oil rigs. The watch item is more the S-92s or the OE deliveries that we need to make for the year.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks, Akhil.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Could you just elaborate or provide detail on kind of the size of the discrete items in the other
segments? So, I assume the one in Pratt at $0.03 is the largest as you articulated that. But, can you give us a little bit
more color there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Jeff. So, I think, it was, at CCS, we talked about the property sale and the fair value
accounting associated with the transaction there. The collective impact of that was a little over $0.02 there, and then the
current item was about, also about $0.02 in the UTAS business, the licensing arrangement that [ph] Paul (28:53)
referred to.
On top of that, there was probably $0.02 you will see in the elims line, in the corporate elims line, which had to do with
some adjustments for a disposed business that shows up in those lines. So, net-net, it's essentially timing, Jeff. It's just
stuff that we had always assumed would happen in the plan. We've just assumed it would happen actually later in the
year and it got pulled. By chance it all ended up happening in Q1, which is why I think when I spoke in March, we
were expecting slightly lower numbers, but I think we came in stronger just as a result of timing of some of these
discrete items.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And then just shifting gears, could you just come back to Otis Europe? You mentioned
pricing is a watch item and we all know that's been tough for a while. But, are you seeing some change? Is it declining
at a decelerating rate or has there been some trend change there? Just what do you see going on there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Jeff, it's still the same, I would say. In Q1, what we saw, the pricing decline was consistent with
what we saw in Q4 and Q3. So, there is no either increase or decrease in the deceleration rate, as you said. What is
encouraging, though, is I think Philippe talked about that in March a little bit and showed a chart that the first sign of
change comes from strength in the new equipment market.
And, in fact, if you go back and look at that chart, there were countries where new equipment had done better either in
terms of less decline or started to recover. Pricing on service was doing better in those markets as well.
So, with the strength we are seeing broad-based in the new equipment order rates this quarter, our expectation is that
that starts to get better on the service side, in terms of pricing as the year progresses. Now whether it happens quickly
enough is something we have to watch, but definitely that's the first sign, which would then release a little bit of
pressure on the pricing.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hello.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys. So, a quick question back on the engines again. There's
been a fair amount of discussion in the trade press that your competitor's engine, the LEAP-1B, is having some issues
getting to its performance targets. So, there has been some talk that it's missing its targets by maybe 4% or 5%. Just
curious, have you heard anything from your customers yet that are maybe looking more seriously at the PurePower
family of engines if the LEAP engine doesn't seem to be getting where it needs to go?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think we've all read that same speculation in the press, but I'll tell you, Ron, it really
hasn't impacted any of the competitions that are going on today for engine orders. I think the competitor, GE or CFM,
is going to commit to the same kind of performance improvements that we're seeing on the GTF family. I would expect
that they will eventually get to those same performance targets that they've committed to.
So, there might be some short-term pain on those engines; but again, I think long-term, we like where we are with our
architecture, we think the architecture is fundamentally better; we're going to operate at a lower temperature, that gives
us some improvement in terms of not just part count. but also maintenance costs long-term. So, we'll see what happens.
Those engines are going to go into service at the end of the year on the neo, and that will be the ultimate test of
performance is how we do in the field. And we feel very good about where we are.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Sure, sure. And then maybe one last one here. You've already executed on some buyback
for the year. And given, where the share price is and it looks like it's pretty darn good value, are you open to buying
back a lot more stock?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: A lot more, no. I think at the current price, it is a good value. We did the $3 billion, $2.5
billion accelerated share repurchase last month, and I think that was well executed. And it gives us about a $0.05
benefit for the year by having all those shares retired early.
But right now, I still think there's things out on the M&A side that we want to do, and we're going to keep our powder
dry, and we spent $250 million in the first quarter on M&A. We got a good business in CIAT in France, which Geraud
and team are working on, and I think that's indicative of the kind of things we'll probably see throughout the year, is
some smaller deals. But we're going to continue to look for bigger things too, and I just don't want to commit to a
bunch of share repurchase when there's opportunities out there to do some bigger M&A.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: But, could we expect to see some more than what you've already done? Are you done for
the year, I guess, is the question?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, yeah, we guided to $3 billion for the year. I think as we go through the quarters here, if
we don't see additional M&A, or if we see some significant weakness in the stock, I think we're always open to that,
where we see value, and we're going to keep that in mind.
But again, we're going to return more than 70% of free cash flow back to investors this year, probably more than –
almost 80% with the $3 billion on top of the dividend, so we feel pretty good about the capital allocation decisions
we've made so far.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hi, there. Just wanted to come back to the good news on the European Otis orders on the OE side.
And when you're coming off a trough type of number, you can get some pretty big numbers. I just wondered, can you
maybe just characterize the breadth of the strength that you saw in the OE orders and perhaps comment on the front log
activity you're seeing? And whether the strength that we're seeing in Otis is also – has been seen elsewhere, such as
within Carrier, and also fire and security?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. Sure. So, I think the Otis strength was purely broad-based. You're exactly right, Nigel. The
numbers have gone down, so it is off a smaller base, but still, even on that smaller base, we saw a decline last year. So,
the fact that it is up, and up nicely and it is up broad-based; almost every major country saw up orders in Otis new
equipment, that is an encouraging sign for us, right? So clearly, that portends well for all the stuff that is going on in
Europe, in terms of the stimulus that is being put in place there, in terms of the euro weakness that is encouraging the
export-oriented growth there, so all those things are hopefully resulting in some better economic activity.
Commercial refrigeration in Europe, as I said earlier, was up double-digit as well. That was nice to see, and HVAC is
up, although at a smaller scale, but it was up as well. So overall, we see some improving trends in Europe, that's
definitely certainly true in this quarter.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: That's great news. And then maybe just perhaps a bit more color on the CCS margins, up 120 bps.
There's obviously a lot going on here with the Transicold mix and the BIS integration and perhaps some price rules
benefits? Maybe just add a bit of color in terms of those drivers?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So, I think the mix definitely, as you point out, is good. Transicold grew very strongly, and
that's one of our high-margin businesses. There is broad-based, cost-related conversion that we see very nicely at CCS.
That's been a story which has been there for a period of time. We were obviously also helped a little bit by those
discrete items that I talked about, and that came from the two items that I highlighted earlier.
But overall, it's great conversion on the organic growth, right? I mean organic growth is up 6%. And if you hold gross
margin and you control the cost, that's a recipe for good conversion, and Geraud and team have been doing that for
several years now.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And then very quickly, on the raw materials, are you seeing the benefit right now, or is that coming
through in the second half of the year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Not as much in the first quarter, Nigel. I think there was a little bit of benefit from copper. But as
you know, we kind of tend to have longer-term agreements with our suppliers, so we'll see some benefit a little more in
the second half, but probably even more than that in the next year, if the prices stay at this level.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: That's great. Thank you very much.

opportunities in our core markets to do some things.
But, at the same time, we're trying to be disciplined here in term of the criteria that we've laid out. And we say we need
to have IRR north of 10%, it's got to be accretive in year two, it's got to have an ROIC north of 10% by year four.
Those are some pretty high hurdles with the valuations that we see out there today.
So, there's some fixer-uppers out there that might be attractive to us. But we're not going to overpay either, because
that's the best way to make a good deal a bad deal, is to overpay. You can never recover from that. So, we're continuing
to look. We've got Mike Dumais and the whole team focused on looking at various properties, and we're just going to
be opportunistic.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on foreign exchange, I'm just wondering why you didn't
use this opportunity to maybe bring your forecast for the foreign exchange hit down a bit. And whether foreign
exchange has had any impact in terms of market share or other issues overseas?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. I think when we guided back in March, we talked about euro at 1.10. Today it's at 1.07.
If it stays here for the rest of the year, I think it'll average about 1.09, so it's not just a very big impact versus what we
talked about a month ago. Obviously, if we see euro go towards parity with the dollar, that'll put pressure on the
guidance and probably take us towards the lower end. But I think it's important, while we don't hedge transactional
FX...
<A - Akhil Johri>: Translation...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Translation FX, we do hedge transactional FX. So, to the extent we've got a sales contracted
in one currency and cost in another, we're hedging that on a regular basis. And I think the other important thing, from a
market share perspective, we're not really disadvantaged by currency. We manufacture in Europe. We manufacture in
China for those markets. So, not really impacted very dramatically by – or disadvantaged. And then keep in mind too,
more than half of the businesses is aero, and that is all U.S. dollar denominated. So, we're neither advantaged or
disadvantaged in that market by the currency.

<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Greg, just one follow-up to the M&A question there. Are you comfortable doing acquisitions
while you're still evaluating the overall portfolio? Or do you need to get through everything you're contemplating with
the portfolio before you know which acquisitions make the most sense?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We know which markets we like. We know which product lines we like. And as you think
about this portfolio review that we're doing; as I mentioned last month, we've already divested $8 billion of business in
the last five years. If we spin Sikorsky off that'll be another $7 billion. So, we'll have done $15 billion in portfolio
shedding by the end of this year and there's just not a lot of other big pieces left that we don't think are in attractive
markets and there might be smaller things on the margin. But, I think for the most part, we like the hand that we've got
now in terms of the ability to grow the business long-term organically. And so, we're going to look to find pieces that'll
fit into that puzzle that we've got today and really not try and stretch to find other things outside of the core.

<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. Great. And then just going back to the aerospace aftermarket, just I guess as a
clarification, the comments that the year was off to a slow start in headline numbers I guess made it seem like the actual
underlying ongoing business was a little weak. But, it sounds like actually – given the numbers you've given us
excluding provisioning, that it's actually maybe quite strong and the slow start was entirely the provisioning
comparison. Is that a fair comparison or a fair assumption or is there something else?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think that's exactly – as you think about the Aerospace Systems business, right, the
provisioning was down but parts were up nicely almost double-digits for the transactional side.
And same at Pratt on the transactional side, we saw almost double-digit increase in spare parts sales. So that piece of
the aftermarket is actually doing nicely. What we have not seen, of course, is provisioning. That'll come in the back
half of the year as some of the new aircraft like the A350 and A320neo enter into service we'll see provisioning pickup
in the back half of the year.
So, a little slower than what we expected overall. Shop business were down, but again to Akhil's point, that's actually
good news as most of these are on FMP. And the longer those things stay on wing, the more profitable those contracts
are.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: And GE said, they're seeing some restocking of inventory from the airlines. Are you seeing that
specifically?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Well, I think, you know the issue we have, which is some of our legacy engines, the PW2000 and
PW4000, have this issue of legacy spare parts availability and surplus parts available in the marketplace and
retirements. So, we see declines there. In the engine, which is doing well for us, the V2500, actually on a transactional
basis, we even saw sales up over 30% on the transactional spares. So, that was consistent with what you probably heard
from the others. So, we saw the same phenomena, we just have to deal with this declining issue on the PW2000 and
PW4000.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg, just I guess, it's follow-on to Noah's question
on the aftermarket. Are you seeing any differences from a geographical standpoint? You mentioned a lot that China has
been slowing, but are you seeing any trend over onto the airspace side out of Asia?
<A - Akhil Johri>: No.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, no, no. In fact, Asia's probably the strongest if you think about where the aftermarket is.
I mean, the RPMs there are up more than 30% I think year-over-year in China. So, we continue to see very, very strong
growth out of that market. It's really to Akhil's point. It's these legacy PW2000, PW4000 engines where we're really
seeing the slowdown.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And just my follow-up also is on staying in aerospace on Pratt & Whitney. You
mentioned the kind of timing of engine shipments. Pratt & Whitney Canada engine volume was down 10%
year-over-year. Is that all timing, or is there something else going on there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Pratt Canada engine shipments, Peter, were largely driven by the helicopter end market. That's
where we've seen the big decline. The business jet engines were actually up.

<A - Akhil Johri>: But largely attributed to the helicopter segment. On the other large Pratt side, it's more to do with
the military engines, where we saw a little bit of delays in a few of the engines there, which hopefully will pick up back
in Q2.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to pursue first cash flow, the conversion at 67%. I know you
mentioned Sikorsky, and maybe that's some of the helicopters from the oil and gas business. But last year's first quarter
we were at 80%, and we wound up the year at 90% free cash conversion. And this year, we're starting off at 67%, and I
think we're hoping to get higher than 90%, at least 90% to 100% from what you say. So, what goes on here? This
quarter, we saw sizable increase in inventories, maybe 5% or so. So, can you kind of just walk through from where we
are to how we get maybe to the 90% to 100% you're talking about for the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: First quarter cash flow is not ever going to probably be close to 100%. Last year, we had a
benefit of a $200 million advance at Sikorsky, which certainly helped. This year, if you take Sikorsky out of the
equation, cash flow was almost 100% of net income. So, again, really I would point primarily to the Sikorsky cash
outflow; but at the same time, inventories were up, working capital was up, specifically receivables. And again, though,
some of that is just timing as we work through.
Geraud's business, it's a seasonal business on the residential side, so there is some natural inventory build in the CCS
business. But overall, we're also seeing some inventory on the ramp on the GTF, so Pratt's inventories were up. UTAS
inventories were up for the same reasons, they see these new aircraft going into production.
So again, I think this will get better during the course of the year, but we clearly need to focus more on inventory turns,
because I think overall inventory turns for us were about 4.5, and this really is just not very good. So, there's work to
do.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And just one point to add, George, to clarify your comment on the inventory side. We always see
buildup in inventory in Q1. In fact, if you pass the numbers for last year Q1, inventory had actually gone up by $660
million in Q1. This year, it was only $470 million. Only $470 million is still a big number, and certainly not we are
happy with, but that's part of the seasonality that we have in this. And as Greg said, we have a lot of work to do on
inventory, but still the Q1 57% does not give us any concern about the ability to meet the 90% to 100% for the year.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And, Akhil, my follow-up is if you – you commented about transactional spares
being down should be good news. At what point – I assume a lot of that's related to your power by the hour contract.
So, at what point do you conclude that you can make a higher margin on that power by the hour stuff because the
reliability is running somewhat better than you might have been projecting?
<A - Akhil Johri>: George, just one clarification first. Transactional spares, which I define as spares sold to the
airlines and used in our time and material jobs, are actually up double-digit, right? What is down was more the spares
used in the FMP program, right?
So, there to your point, we evaluate the programs on a quarterly basis, at least on an annual basis for every FMP,
quarterly for the large ones, and look at the estimates based on our actual experience and then update the [ph] ESCs
(48:36), which result in some kind of adjustments periodically that we see.
So, I think, over the long-term, this will definitely be the good news on the margins at Pratt. How it comes into the
P&L exactly is a function of the length of the FMPs, the period which is left, and the experience that we have achieved

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I wanted to talk about UTAS and in particular just where you stand now on the savings
from the Goodrich integration. You're in presumably the more challenging time here with supply chain and facilities
opportunities.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. So, I think we are tracking very well, Doug, on that – on the synergies side. As you know
from the original estimates of $375 million, we've taken it up to over $500 million for this year. Expectation was about
$100 million, and we think we are very much on track for that. In fact, if anything, we may have a little upside there,
given the work that Dave and team have done on eliminating the costs associated with the dual structure that Greg
referred to in his comments. So, these synergies are moving very, very well.
I think what is left still in front of the team there is not so much the supply chain-related, the supply and
negotiation-related stuff, but it is more about moves to low-cost sourcing. We still have many, many factories in UTAS,
nearly 100 manufacturing locations. There is work that the team is doing in creating centers of excellence in lower-cost
locations such as Poland and Mexico, India, et cetera, and as work transitions to those lower-cost centers of excellence,
we will see further improvement in the cost structure at UTAS.
Now obviously at some point, we have to stop and get off this synergy word. It becomes matter of course cost
reduction like any other UTC company does, and that's where we are heading now. So, I think we can certainly declare
we have done the synergies that we expected to achieve and now need to continue to get regular cost reductions.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Well. And so, that's really where I wanted to go. So, as you head beyond the synergy
word and look at the opportunities here, I know there has been a focus on reducing R&D, reducing costs in general in
UTAS. Can you give a sense of how much margin opportunity you see going forward? If we go over the next few
years, I mean is this a business where we should expect some pretty good margin expansion?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You know, Doug, there's always opportunity for margin expansion. I think what we have to
keep in mind is as always new aircraft come into production there's headwind from negative margin not just at Pratt,
but also a little bit on our Aerospace Systems business.
And so, I think Mr. Gitlin and crew are going to deal with a little bit of that, which will keep some of the margin
improvement at bay for a time yet. But clearly there's opportunities out there. I think we've talked a couple years ago
about this being a potentially 20% margin business. That's still the target, I would say, for five years out. So, there
might be 50 basis points a year of margin upside here, but we need to keep in mind at least in the short term as all of
these new products come to market, the margins that are going out are not positive on most of this new OE equipment.
So, that's going to hold margins down a little bit.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

equipment growth. I mean, it would look like service was down some 3% to 4% result, which is the weakest number I
think I can ever recall. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's happening in the service market and how
quickly you might see an improvement in pricing in Europe as a result of the very strong new elevator orders this
quarter? Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Cai. Just for clarification, Service was flat overall. It was not down. And in fact, where we
saw the pressure was more on the modernization side, particularly in Europe, where service – the modernization
revenues were down in sort of mid-teens level. And that's a function of our regulation-driven, modernization effort that
was going on in France, particularly, and a couple of other markets.
Again, I think maintenance contracts, the number of contracts under maintenance for the quarter were up sequentially
when you exclude Russia, which was an exceptional situation. But everywhere else, I think our maintenance contracts
were up. Pricing pressure, as I said earlier in response to Jeff's question, is stable. It's still down, but it is not getting
down any further. And as the new equipment market starts to improve in Europe, we expect, certainly, to see the
pricing pressure a little bit relieved on the service side as well.
So, service was good in Asia, grew mid-single digits there, particularly in China, which was up nearly 20%, and it's
growing in Americas as well. So, just the continuing trends that we have seen in Europe, which hopefully get mitigated
as new equipment improves.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great answer. And maybe a little bit more color into Jeff's question. It looks like there is
$0.09 of kind of discrete operation – non-operating or whatever they are, items within the operation. You mentioned
you've got some favorable timing. Were all those $0.09 pull-forwards from succeeding quarters? And maybe give us
some color as a result of the kind of quarterly pattern we should expect for the year.
<A - Akhil Johri>: I think, as I said, Cai, those items were in our plan for – most of them for Q2. So there is a little bit
of timing thing. You never can call exactly whether something which is a function of negotiation discussions in some
events with other parties. It can happen exactly in March, or April, or June, so I think a little bit of that pattern is there.
I did say that our first-half, we expect the earnings to be at the higher end, or up slightly ahead of the 3% mark that we
have for the full-year, the 0% to 3% on a reported EPS basis. So, that would suggest that probably Q2 by itself would
be down on a reported basis, and that's understandable, given the pressure we have on FX and pension and the
restructuring, which will be in excess of gains in Q2, right?
In Q2, we'll have $0.07 of restructuring and no gains, so that's one reason why the reported numbers start to look a little
bit different in Q2. But in reality, when you exclude pension FX and restructuring, we should still see mid single-digit
type of growth in Q2 EPS, which is slightly below our full-year expectations, given the strength we saw in Q1.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great answer. Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Cai.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Greg, it looks like you started out CapEx below trend. Have you been
able to get a handle on that to the degree you're satisfied? Or is there still more work to be done?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: There is still more work to be done, Howard. I think, again, we saw CapEx for the quarter a
little bit up from last year, about $15 million actually, year-over-year, so we spent, I think, $348 million. It's below the

full-year run rate, I'll give you that. But there's still work to do. And I think all the guys understand, the people
understand, we need to be focused on constraining CapEx, just like we are every other dollar that we spend, so there's
work to do.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then on the second item, research and development also was down a little bit. And
sometimes that's timing. Could you provide a little more color and granularity on a couple of the development
programs, specifically GTF, both for the variety of items you have, whether it's neo or the other customers?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. E&D is starting kind of a natural decline at Pratt, as we complete some of the testing
on the neo and some of the other engines out there. CSeries is completing its flight testing this year, neo will be done
hopefully this summer or early fall. And so just, E&D just naturally wants to come down. So if you remember, [ph]
Paul (57:47) said he's going to take E&D down about $100 million. It was down $17 million here in the first quarter, so
I think naturally you're just going to see a reduction. And not much changed across the rest of the business. I think
Geraud's off a tiny bit. He continues to invest in some new products, and Aerospace Systems are still on track to
probably spend about $800 million for the year, so not much change there.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning. Can I just go back to Transicold, which you haven't really talked a lot about?
I thought this was probably the toughest compare of the year and yet you did pretty well. Can you talk a little bit about
how much of that was container versus truck and trailer, and maybe price now, versus where it was last year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sam, so container – as you know, Transicold is a little bit of a lumpy business, right? So, you get
some large swings and large numbers there, but it was great to see the 18% or so growth in the quarter there. A lot of it
was driven by container, which was up over 30%. North America truck/trailer was up nicely as well, and in fact the
orders in North America truck/trailer are very, very strong. And so that's a precursor sometimes to the U.S. economy
and how things are doing there. So that's certainly very encouraging, and we see good strength there. So, both I think
container and North America truck/trailer were the big drivers. Europe was also up, and nicely up as well.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thanks. And then, in terms of the Geared Turbofan, is there any way you can kind of
help us in terms of planned shipments or anything of that sort, how it looks this year and kind of the ramp into next
year? Just in any way you can kind of help quantify and the volume and that OE headwind that we're going to see as
that ramps up?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So I think for this year, we've got somewhere in the range of 40 to 50 GTF engines which will be
shipped, between the NEO and the CSeries, to some extent. And I think that number wants to go up to about 200 for
next year. So, that's the kind of magnitude of shipments, and that's the ramp we talk about, which has been putting a
little bit of pressure on our CapEx keeping CapEx above 100% of depreciation. So, that's the ramp we have ahead of
us.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Thanks, Sam.
