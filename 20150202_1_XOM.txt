MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury.
Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings call. As you
know, the focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2014.
I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.
Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our fourth quarter and full-year
performance. ExxonMobil delivered earnings of $32.5 billion in 2014 and fourth quarter earnings of $6.6 billion. These
results highlight the value of ExxonMobil's integrated business model, which enables us to produce solid financial

performance throughout the commodity price cycle. The corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset
sales of over $49 billion in 2014, and free cash flow of $18 billion, an increase of over $7 billion from 2013. We
completed a record of eight major upstream projects during the year, and achieved our full-year plan to produce 4
million oil-equivalent barrels per day.
Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth moderated in the fourth quarter. Expansion in the U.S. continued, but growth slowed relative to the third
quarter. China's economy decelerated, while Europe and Japan showed continued signs of economic weakness. As you
know, energy prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter, and U.S. refining margins decreased significantly, while
Chemical specialty product margins improved on lower feed and energy costs.
Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on slide five, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings were
$6.6 billion or $1.56 per share. The corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends
and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion were used to purchase shares. CapEx was
$10.5 billion in the fourth quarter, whereas cash flow from operations and asset sales were $7.7 billion. And at the end
of the quarter, cash totaled $4.7 billion and debt was $29.1 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased
from $5 billion to $4.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital, and other items in our
ongoing asset management program yielded $7.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included
net investments in the business of $9.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion. Debt and other financing
increased cash by $7 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $1 billion in the first
quarter of 2015.
Moving now to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings of $6.6 billion
were $1.8 billion lower than the year-ago quarter. Lower earnings in the upstream and downstream and higher
corporate expenses were partly offset by higher chemical earnings. Results were favorably impacted by approximately
$1 billion of non-cash effects that included U.S. deferred income tax items and the recognition of the 2012 award by
the International Chamber of Commerce [ICC] for expropriated Venezuela assets.
In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased by $1.5 billion, primarily as result of
lower upstream and downstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to
$700 million per quarter.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, upstream earnings in the fourth
quarter were $5.5 billion, down $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.4
billion, as worldwide crude oil prices declined almost $32 per barrel. Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased
earnings $400 million, driven by higher-margin production growth from the U.S. and major projects in Canada,
Angola, and Papua New Guinea. All other items increased earnings by a net $640 million, including adjustments to
deferred income tax balances and recognition of the gain from the Venezuela ICC award received in 2012. The ICC
award was recognized, given the favorable fourth quarter ruling of the International Center for Settlement of
Investment Disputes.
Moving to slide 10, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil equivalent production
decreased by 0.7% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 80,000 barrels per day,
driven by major new projects and work programs. However, natural gas production was down over 650 million cubic
feet per day, as reduced entitlement volumes, lower weather-related demand primarily in Europe, and field decline
were partly offset by major projects in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia. In short, our volumes performance continues
to demonstrate the progress being made to high-grade the portfolio mix with higher-margin production.
Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11, upstream earnings decreased $948 million versus the
third quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion, driven by sharply lower worldwide crude prices, which
declined over $27 per barrel. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $140 million, reflecting higher-margin
volume growth. All other items had a positive impact of $1.1 billion, including the previously mentioned deferred tax

items and Venezuela ICC Award. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter were just over $15,
excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes, and is down due to lower crude prices.
Moving to slide 12, volumes were up 223,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, or 5.8% sequentially. Liquids production
increased 117,000 barrels per day from higher entitlement volumes, improved facility uptime, and work programs.
Natural gas production was also up 639 million cubic feet per day, driven by higher seasonal demand, primarily in
Europe.
Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the
quarter were $497 million, down $419 million from a year ago. Earnings increased $40 million due to stronger
marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, mostly offset by weaker U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $20 million. And all other items decreased earnings by $480 million, primarily from higher
maintenance activities and unfavorable tax effects.
Turning to slide 14, sequentially fourth quarter downstream earnings decreased $527 million. Lower U.S. refining
margins, partly offset by stronger marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, decreased earnings by $360 million.
Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by a further $20 million. And all other items reduced earnings by $150
million, reflecting higher maintenance activities, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange and other effects.
Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 15, fourth quarter Chemical earnings were
$1.2 billion, up $317 million versus the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher non-U.S. product margins on
lower feed costs. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million. And all other items, primarily
unfavorable foreign exchange effects, reduced earnings by $110 million.
Moving to slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings were essentially flat, as stronger specialty product margins were
offset by volume and mix effects and increased maintenance activities.
Now I'd like to provide a summary of our full-year results shown on slide 17. 2014 earnings were $32.5 billion or $7.60
per share. The corporation distributed $23.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $12 billion were used to purchase shares. CapEx in 2014 was $38.5 billion,
which was down $4 billion from 2013 and is also down $1.3 billion from our 2014 guidance. Cash flow from
operations and asset sales remained strong at over $49 billion, which included $4 billion from asset sales.
Moving now to the full-year cash flow statement as shown on slide 18, during the year cash decreased from $4.9 billion
to $4.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset
management program yielded $49.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments
in the business of $31.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $23.6 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash
by $5.4 billion to fund our commitments, including working capital requirements.
Moving on to slide 19 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2014 earnings were essentially flat with 2013
results. Higher upstream and chemical earnings were offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate
expenses.
Turning now to the full-year comparison of upstream results starting on slide 20, upstream earnings of $27.5 billion
were up $707 million from 2013. Realizations reduced earnings by $2 billion, as crude oil prices declined almost $11
per barrel. Importantly, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings by over $500 million, reflecting investments in
higher-margin assets and our continued focus on profitability. Volume contributions from major project startups in U.S.
onshore liquid plays were partly offset by lower weather-related downtime and unfavorable entitlement impacts. All
other items, primarily asset sales and deferred tax effects, increased earnings by $2.2 billion. Upstream after-tax
earnings per barrel for the year was $19.47, up $1.44 from 2013 despite declining crude prices.
Moving to slide 21, as indicated, volumes ended the year on plan at 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Excluding
the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, volumes were down by 1.7% or 71,000 oil-equivalent barrels
per day from 2013, reflecting lower gas demand in Europe and asset sales. Of note, liquids production was up 44,000
barrels per day or 2%. Volume growth from work programs and major projects in Canada, Angola, and Papua New

Guinea were partly offset by field decline and divestment impacts.
Our natural gas production was down 691 million cubic feet per day driven by lower weather-related demand,
entitlement and divestment impacts, and field decline partly offset by major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and
Malaysia.
A full-year comparison for downstream is shown on slide 22. 2014 earnings were over $3 billion, down $404 million
from 2013. Lower refining margins reduced earnings by $230 million. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by
refinery optimization activities, increased earnings by $480 million. All other items, primarily unfavorable foreign
exchange and tax impacts, decreased earnings by $650 million.
On slide 23, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2014 earnings of $4.3 billion increased $487
million from last year. Higher commodity product margins, partly offset by lower specialty margins, increased earnings
by $520 million. Positive volume and mix effects on higher demand were offset by all other items, driven by increased
maintenance activities.
Moving now to an update on our cash flow growth shown on slide 24. As mentioned, annual cash flow from operations
and asset sales was $49.2 billion while net investments in the business totaled $31.2 billion. Resulting free cash flow of
$18 billion increased $7.3 billion compared to last year and supported total shareholder distributions of $23.6 billion.
Debt and other financing along with a reduction in our cash balance provided additional funds to meet our
commitments.
Moving next to the fourth quarter business highlights beginning on slide 25. Over the past year, ExxonMobil completed
a record eight major projects demonstrating our world-class project execution capabilities. We added more than
250,000 barrels per day of net capacity across a broad range of resource types and geographies. The higher margin
production from these projects underscores our focus on delivering profitable growth.
We completed several projects over the last quarter. In Russia at offshore Sakhalin, the first well at our Arkutun-Dagi
field reached target depth in December with first production in early January. Daily gross production from the field is
expected to reach 90,000 barrels and will bring total gross production at Sakhalin-1 to more than 200,000 barrels per
day. Arkutun-Dagi is the last of three fields to be developed by the Sakhalin project. The other two fields, Chayvo and
Odoptu, began production in 2005 and 2010 respectively.
In Canada, initial steam generation at the Cold Lake Nabiye development started late December followed by injection
into the reservoir in early January. After steam soaking, the first bitumen production is expected later this quarter.
Production will increase over the balance of the year with gross rates expected to reach 40,000 barrels per day. Nabiye
is an expansion of the existing Cold Lake field, which started up in 1985 and produced almost 150,000 barrels per day
in 2014.
In the greater Hadrian area of the Gulf of Mexico, the Lucius project was essentially completed in December with first
production in January. Gross production from Lucius is expected to be around 80,000 barrels of oil and 150 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day once the wells have fully ramped up.
The Hadrian South subsea production system and flow lines were installed and connected to the Lucius spar host in late
2014 and will be brought online once Lucius production is stabilized. Hadrian South is ExxonMobil's deepest subsea
tieback at more than 7,600 feet. Daily gross production from Hadrian South is expected to reach approximately 300
million cubic feet of gas from two wells.
In offshore Abu Dhabi, Upper Zakum is one of the world's largest oil fields with a resource estimate of 50 billion
barrels. Together with our joint venture partners, we are progressing the field redevelopment to raise gross production
capacity to 750,000 barrels per day. The joint venture is utilizing extended reach drilling from four new artificial
islands and deploying proprietary ExxonMobil technology.
So the works are now essentially complete on all islands. Drilling is ongoing from two of the islands and first
production started in November of last year. Facility additions and drilling will continue over the next three years to
reach the targeted production plateau.

And finally the Kearl expansion project in Canada continues to track ahead of schedule. Site construction activities are
now largely complete and commissioning activities are ramping up. The project incorporates the learnings from the
initial development phase and will double Kearl's production capacity to 220,000 barrels per day in the next several
decades.
Turning now to slide 26 for an update on our broad exploration program. Drilling operations are ongoing at the Pelican
South wildcat well in the Neptune block offshore Romania. Following this well, additional exploration targets in the
area will be considered.
In Argentina, we successfully drilled and tested two ExxonMobil-operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta. The La
Invernada X3 well flowed at an average rate of over 600 oil equivalent barrels per day and is currently on a long-term
test. It is among the best-producing wells in the Vaca Muerta. Our active program continues with additional drilling and
testing in 2015.
Recently, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse exploration portfolio. ExxonMobil expanded its
presence in the Canadian North Atlantic by 1.6 million gross acres, capturing three blocks offshore Newfoundland and
Labrador. These blocks are in a proven oil-prone hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. This new
opportunity will build on our 17 years of success with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron.
ExxonMobil also recently added significant acreage in West Africa, building upon a strong position that stretches from
Liberia to Angola. In Cote d'Ivoire, we added 2.3 million gross acres by successfully completing negotiations for
production sharing contracts on two deepwater frontier blocks. These captures mark the return of ExxonMobil to Cote
d'Ivoire, where we produced the country's first oil 30 years ago.
In Equatorial Guinea, we completed PSC negotiations to acquire an interest in another offshore block encompassing
160,000 gross acres. The PSC is subject to final government ratification. This additional acreage builds on almost 20
years of ExxonMobil operations in Equatorial Guinea. And in the UK North Sea, we were awarded a 50% working
interest in two licenses that are a part of a proven hydrocarbon province near producing fields. ExxonMobil and Shell
bid jointly for these licenses, which cover more than 250,000 gross acres.
So in conclusion, our full-year results underscore the value of our integrated business model. In 2014, ExxonMobil
earned $32.5 billion and we achieved our full-year plan to produce 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. We
maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach by selectively investing in attractive opportunities, thereby
improving our production mix.
Unit profitability increased from just over $18 per barrel in 2013 to about $19.50 per barrel in 2014 despite lower
prices last year. The corporation generated free cash flow of $18 billion, an increase of over $7 billion when compared
to 2013 and we maintained strong shareholders distributions totaling $23.6 billion. In summary, we delivered on our
commitments and we remain resilient through the cycle.
Finally, I'd like to mention two upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we'll be releasing our 2014 reserves
replacement data. And second, as many of you may know, our upcoming Analyst Meeting will take place at the New
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 4, with a live webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. We will
provide an update to our business strategies and our investment plans during the meeting. Presentation will be led by
ExxonMobil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rex Tillerson.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.

<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Jeff, because the company is so diverse both functionally and geographically, your
commentary on global economic activity has always been pretty helpful. And based in your remarks at the beginning, it
seems like economic trends in the OECD and China weakened materially during the second half and specifically the
fourth quarter. So my question is whether or not you have additional color or updates on those areas, and also any
commentary and/or color on economic activity trends that you're seeing in the non-OECD as well.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Doug, thanks for that question. I'd say broadly speaking, I'll fall back on our overall
assessment of what demand will be doing across the globe, particularly in Asia-Pacific. We are forecasting that demand
– and of course, as I've said previously, that demand assessment that we do on an annual basis really underpins our
business strategies and our investment plans.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So as we look forward, we see oil demand growing at about 0.8% per year. That's
underpinned by transportation and chemical needs. In the gas sector, we see gas demand growing by about 1.5% –
1.6% per year. And that's primarily underpinned by power generation and industrial demands.
Now overall demand growth is largely underpinned by the non-OECD growth. So when you think about our business,
the scope of our business and how we lay out our business strategies and our investment plans, they really are focused
on the long-term expectation around energy demand.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And then also specific to the company, how much of the $1 billion noncash effect
was related to the arbitration ruling with Venezuela? And also, is this entire amount accounted for in the upstream?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So, Doug, on the $1 billion – nearly $1 billion, about 70% of that was associated with the
adjustments to our deferred tax accounting.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: And then about 30% of that is associated with the Venezuela award, and that was in the
non-U.S. component of the upstream.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Doug.

We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Hey, good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Phil.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: So just to start off on the CapEx side, last quarter Exxon indicated that it did not plan to cut its
CapEx in 2015 versus its initial target. So I know you'll give a more broad update at the Analyst Day. But just generally
speaking, has your view changed at all, or are you still deciding at this stage? And obviously, you pulled the buyback
lever there, so I'm just wondering more broadly how you're thinking about that.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, Phil. I can certainly appreciate a lot of interest given this climate that we're in right
now. I'll tell you that right now we have no CapEx guidance. As you may recall, we had signaled a further reduction in
CapEx to under $37 billion in 2015. As we normally do, we'll provide an update on both our business strategy and our

investment plans next month, as I indicated. As you are aware, we have been reducing our capital spend since 2013 due
to several reasons, including the completion of several major projects, our ongoing intense focus on capital efficiency,
and of course our disciplined investment planning given the economic parameters.
I guess, Phil, I'd like to emphasize a couple of points, recognizing that I'm asking you to hold off until next month.
First, regardless of where we are in our business cycle, this organization has a very strong culture of driving down our
cost structure. Whether it be self-help in our operating costs or capital efficiency in our project execution, we expect to
lead the cost curve in capturing savings, especially in downturns like we're experiencing today. Second, we challenge
all of our investments to ensure that we are creating long-term shareholder value through the cycle. And remember, we
are price takers. We don't assume price growth into future, but we really focus on those things that we can control like
costs, liability, and of course, our project execution. So, Phil, we'll keep a close eye on our cash flow, maintain our
investment discipline, and of course, our commitment to our growing dividend and where necessary, we'll leverage our
balance sheet to meet our commitments as appropriate.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Sure, okay, and then just a question on the buyback. Obviously, it could have been any number
between $0 billion and $3 billion, but just wondering why you specifically picked what you did. Are you trying to cut a
target a certain leverage level assuming the strip, or just how you're generally thinking about it? And more specifically,
just wondering what would make you change it up or down from here again.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, Phil. Obviously, it's a number of factors. Our share buybacks have always been a
flexible part of our capital allocation program. The buyback pace has been determined each quarter considering the
company's current financial position, our CapEx requirements, our dividend requirements, as well as our longer-term
business outlook. And we'll continue to manage our business in a prudent manner throughout the cycle, as we've said
many times, and that buyback decision will be really an outcome of our cash flow management. So I just again
emphasize that we remain committed to our investment program and of course paying our growing dividend.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Phil.

We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
<Q - Jason Smith>: Yes, it's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason Smith>: Just coming back to the one-time items, in U.S. refining, your earnings looked a little bit weaker
than your peers that have reported so far. You called out some year-over-year tax and maintenance impacts, but it
seems like that was not part of your $1 billion. Can you maybe just give some color around those and maybe quantify
the absolute impact for the U.S.? And I'm just curious if there's anything else going on in U.S. refining beyond that.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure. Let me just give you a broad summary on the U.S. refining. Fourth quarter
downstream earnings were impacted by lower realized refining margins and a negative crude lag impact as well as
higher maintenance activities at some of our largest refineries on the Gulf Coast. While earnings were marginally
negative over the quarter, our full-year results were solid at just over $1.5 billion, despite the pressure on refining
margins and a heavier maintenance year than normal. Overall, our U.S. refining footprint is just very well positioned to
benefit from advantaged feedstocks and from the investments that we've made that focus across a number of areas to
further advance our profitability in those assets, such as feedstock flexibility, logistics capability, increasing the
higher-value product yields, and reducing our fundamental cost structure, and most important, capturing the most value
from our integrated business model.
<Q - Jason Smith>: Got it, thanks. And maybe just on PSC impacts, you gave some color on the sequential
improvement; I think it was 78,000 barrel a day positive. With oil down significantly from 4Q, can you maybe just give

any color around the incremental impact at prices down here?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You can appreciate that each of our contracts are unique and associated with the
commercial arrangement. It'd be really tough to give you a rule of thumb because we do have in that category price
impacts. You've got spend impacts. We have temporary volume impacts that are associated with the fiscal agreements.
Broadly speaking, you're correct to assume that lower crude prices will provide an uplift, as you saw in the sequential
comparison, but that impact is largely complicated by the multiple contracts, cost recovery, and other effects that we
have in our operations.
<Q - Jason Smith>: Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet.

We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey, good morning. How are you?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: My first question, maybe CapEx from another angle. Net debt is up $7 billion in the quarter. I know
you reduced the buyback guidance. Yet how willing are you to flex the balance sheet through a down cycle? Maybe
discuss limitations on that side which would either take that lower – the buyback lower or reduce CapEx. And maybe
just lastly on CapEx, I presume you already have a 2015 CapEx number and it's more of a guidance question, or just
functionally, how does that work? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Evan, so I'd get you to think about it from a – it's fundamental in how we manage our
cash and the consideration and balance of all the variables that we need to address, the inflows, our commitments to
fund investment plans as well as our dividends. I don't have any specific guidance for you on debt capacity or our
plans. As you know, our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding, as evidenced by the reductions
that we have taken in CapEx and, as you've heard, the reduction planned in the first quarter on share buybacks.
We'll continue to be disciplined in our investment approach throughout the cycle, but we won't forego any attractive
opportunities. We have significant debt capacity, but we will maintain our financial flexibility, and we'll assess the cash
and our funding options under a range of outcomes and take a balanced approach to meet those obligations, as I
indicated. So in short, I'll come back to this message throughout our discussion that we remain committed to an
investment program that delivers on an attractive return, but also to pay a reliable and growing dividend.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great, that's helpful. Maybe second is a smaller issue, just a question on the quarter. Is there an
asset sale loss, or did I miss that, which would affect the lower tax rate for the quarter? If you can, talk me through that,
please.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So the lower tax rate that you're focusing on really has three components. One would be
the gains on deferred tax items that I mentioned already. The second would be changes to the portfolio mix given the
income streams that we get from our U.S. and non-U.S. And then third would be on-going asset management activities.
But I'll tell you, Evan, that our guidance of our effective tax rate is still consistent at about the mid-40%.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Got it. Got it, okay. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Evan.

<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Could you update us on what's going on in Russia as from your point of view if
anything? And further to that, which I know is a JV that was very important to your longer-term reserves and
production plans, could you talk about how you would define the attractive opportunities that you've mentioned? I
assume you're referring to M&A, and whether you would be more attracted to oil, I would assume as opposed to gas
reserves more attractive maybe in the new world order to U.S. reserves maybe within the U.S.? If you could fill us in at
all about what you would consider and how you would define an attractive opportunity. That would be great. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Paul. Let me – starting at Russia, broadly speaking, I mean there's really
nothing new to report on that. As you all know, the sanctions are still in place and we will continue to fully comply. As
we said previously, that does not apply the Sakhalin-1 which, I'll just take this opportunity to say that we've had
extraordinary success really, thanks to a very talented organization and a highly effective joint venture. We're very
pleased with the successful startup of Arkutun-Dagi but in terms of the rest of the business, we just need to wait to see
how the sanctions play out. I'll remind you that ExxonMobil does have a very long-standing and successful business in
Russia that's – I'd say is built on an effective and mutually beneficial relationship with our partners.
On the second item around attractive opportunities in M&A, broadly speaking, and we've talked previously about our
asset management program and we really think about it on – for the full scope of how we high-grade our portfolios
through asset management, and that may be obviously have an ongoing component of divestments of non-strategic or
lower value assets, but also bringing in through acquisitions some new opportunities, and those may be bolt-on
acquisitions, there may be new entries that are synergistic to our business, but Paul, we stay very alert to value
propositions, we're watchful where we can capture opportunities to high-grade our portfolio, whether it be oil, whether
it be gas, onshore, offshore, but I'll be clear that the real focus here is creating value and we'll pursue only those
acquisitions that we think that have ultimate strategic value and are accretive to our longer-term returns.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: And I guess within that, you're primarily interested in long-term reserves, right? I mean,
obviously, you don't want to buy someone's decline curve, so it becomes a question of 2P and 3P, I'd assume.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, so, Paul, it'd be a focus on – again if we can get synergistic benefits like some of
the bolt-ons that we've brought into XTO over the last couple of years have been very beneficial but they do have a
very significant component of development potential where we can apply our resource capability expertise and how to
develop that or proprietary technology and our strong balance sheet but yeah, we don't want something that's already on
decline and doesn't have potential, we're really looking for something that really can upgrade our overall portfolio and
add future potential.

lower this year?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, I would tell you that as we look at our overall investment program, we've been –
we focus on every asset that we've got regardless of whether it's, as you've indicated, a longer-term investment which is
quite frankly, a core component of our investment program, as well as the shorter cycle investments and study work.
Nothing is really sacred in there. As I indicated, we have a very strong culture of driving those cost structures down.
We've been very actively engaged with our service providers, and we fully expect to capture savings across the
spectrum of our business, from rig rates to labor and services, as well as commodities.
But I'd be clear that we're probably in the very early innings of this effort. There's a lot of strong reaction to the current
price – business climate and we think that with that, it – presents a number of really good opportunities to capture
incremental savings, lower the overall cost structure of the business, as well as position us for some other opportunities
as we go forward. The thing that I would really point out that distinguishes us is that, as we've said many times, is that
we can invest through the business cycle, and it presents some opportunities that will able to lower that cost structure
and improve our overall longer-term returns, given the financial capability that we have.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And then a quick quarter question. Asia natural gas production and Australasia as
well, downticked in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and I appreciate there's lots of different demand drivers
across the big business, but is there anything specific you'd call out for that stepdown?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, I would say that a component of that had to do with demand in Australia, but
remember that there was a very healthy increase associated with Papua New Guinea over the year. Sequentially, you
don't see as much of an increase. There was a slight increase in Papua New Guinea, though.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: But in Asia, there was – well, because you had a much larger business, but that was
also down, generally?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. It was generally, some facility performance downtime.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Okay, great. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first question's on Venezuela. I know
you mentioned the arbitration ruling. Could you just kind of confirm that that finalizes this process, or are there any
additional legs to kind of move forward on there?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Blake. On Venezuela, there's actually two separate arbitration proceedings. One
was International Chamber of Commerce that I mentioned that we recognized the award on. The second was the World
Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. What we recognized was the first one. I'll note that
both of those decisions did confirm that the Venezuelan government failed to provide fair compensation for the assets
that were expropriated. We will recognize the second ruling at the time that we receive payment and when all legal
proceedings have concluded.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay. Great. I hope this doesn't get too in the weeds, but the second question is on the
impact of the strong U.S. dollar. I'm just curious if you could talk around how that's impacting your business with the
rapid moves we've seen, and maybe what's been embedded in the quarter as a result of FX?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: In terms of ForEx, obviously as you're probably very aware, that it has opposite impacts
across our business in the upstream, it primarily ends up being a margin benefit due to local denominated OpEx,
whereas in the Chemical and Downstream, it tends to have a negative impact due to our dollar-denominated crude
payables. So in quarter-on-quarter, it was a slight hurt to earnings of under $50 million, although sequentially, it
actually was a positive of over $200 million.

We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Brad.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: I was wondering if you could just go through maybe Exxon's current thoughts on the global LNG
market. You have several potential projects that haven't FID-ed yet. Do you think maybe the global market needs to
take a pause at this point?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, Brad, again, as we talked a little earlier, our investment plans are really founded on
our outlook for supply and demand. We show, as I said, projected gas demand to grow about 1.6% per year between
now and 2040, and that really provides the business case for our LNG projects. Broadly speaking, our existing LNG
facilities are a key component of our portfolio, a very important part of our margin generation. As we see demand grow
in the future, we expect supply will grow in line with that demand. Obviously, these are capital-intensive projects, so
we'll need to ensure there's a sufficient price structure in place to underpin those investments. We have gotten a number
of projects across the globe that are in place. They are positioned to go ahead and compete for that demand profile.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Okay, understood. Thanks. Just thinking about gas in a different way. Certainly in the U.S.
you've been somewhat minimizing gas drilling over the past couple of years, and the market certainly has its own
challenges right now, but has the downturn in oil caused you to think any different about what specifically you're
drilling for in the U.S.?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Not really. I tell you that it's still based on our demand projections. We've got significant
drillable gas potential within the U.S. and, as you know, that's generally a short cycle-type investment. We can get on
capacity pretty quick. So we're very well-positioned to do that should the demand grow and the pricing support it. I'd
also say that from a chemical perspective, our chemical business is very well-positioned to take advantage of the lower
commodity prices. Particularly in the U.S., our manufacturing sites are highly flexible and can run across a wide range
of feedstocks, from ethane all the way to gas oil.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Okay, understood. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Brad.

We'll take our next question from Jason Gammel with Jefferies.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thank you. I've actually got follow-ons to both the questions that were just asked. Just in
terms of how you're managing the Lower 48 business in the pricing downturn, Jeff, are you keeping a relatively steady
rig count, or have you been laying down rigs the way that the rest of the industry has as well?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: It's a good question, Jason. I'd casted it from a – if you will, a historical perspective that
we've taken a very measured pace in how we've developed our Lower 48 unconventional resources. You did see over
2014 a number of operators really ramp up their rig counts significantly. We did grow our rig count. In fact, we are up
in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, but at a very measured pace to make sure that we didn't outrun our
headlines. We wanted to make sure that we had good understanding of the resource performance, and importantly, we
wanted to make sure that we were fully integrating all the learnings back into our advanced program.

So we've been very measured how we've moved forward. Going forward, we'll consider all the factors including the
business condition, infrastructure capability, as well as our demand projections. But going forward, we've got – I just
want to reinforce that we do have a very robust inventory of opportunities even in this price environment.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Got it, thank you. And my second question is on the LNG business. Can you remind us how
much, just as a percentage of your overall LNG output is committed under long-term contracts and how much is
actually put into the spot market? And then on the spot market, are you seeing significant demand weakness that
potentially would even lead to reducing facility utilization?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, so on the LNG business, I'd say that the majority of our LNG, our current LNG, is
under long-term contracts. Very few that have spot sales. Of course, we did take some spot sales in Papua New Guinea
given the early startup. And also note that in our LNG contracts, we have potential to divert cargoes as well, which
gives a lot of flexibility.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.

We'll take our next question from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks and good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Asit.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Two unrelated questions. First, on the issue of supply chain costs and your prior successes with
that. I was wondering if you could quantify annual third-party costs globally for the organization. Some of your peers
have highlighted multi-billion dollar opportunities and further reduction. And also, any high-level thoughts on
recently-announced oil service industry consolidation? Has anything changed on the ground for Exxon?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Broadly speaking, I don't have specific numbers. As I said previously, we are – as a
mainstay in how we manage our business, we are constantly working on that cost structure. We're very active with our
service providers. As I indicated, we're probably in the early innings of that. We are seeing decreases in rig rates and
labor and service costs, as well as starting to see commodity changes as well. But we watch that space – more is to
come in that area. On the second question, remind me, was there...
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: On the oil service industry consolidation, any thoughts on that, how things have changed?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, there's really nothing I have to say on that. We access all of the service providers and
competition is good and we have a very strict standard on what we expect from them in terms of quality performance
and service costs.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Okay. And Jeff, my follow-up is on U.S. onshore. Last quarter, you had highlighted that Bakken
was Exxon's most active unconventional play with, I think, 13 rigs running. Could you update us on activity levels
currently and perhaps provide an update on Woodford and Permian as well?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. So across the three main liquid plays that we've got, we're producing in excess of
220,000 barrels a day gross and we're running currently about 44 rigs. I'd say we're active in all three of them. That rig
count, if you compare back to what I said last quarter, has increased. But very, very encouraging list of opportunities,
and we're making great success in integrating our learnings and driving down the cost curve.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hi, Jeff. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Two quick questions. I don't know whether you have any number you can share. In your supply
cost, when we're looking at the contract, is there a number you can share in terms of the percent maybe for the
countries is over two years still remaining? In other words, I'm trying to understand that what is the percent of your
supply costs that if we do see a substantial deflation in the industry cost structure, it's going to see a relatively quick
pass-through into you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Paul, I don't think I have any guidance on that.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And secondly, did you say that in the downstream you have a crude lag purchase effect
that is negative?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Can you quantify? How big is that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Broadly speaking from a crude lag – I want to be clear, Paul. When we see a decrease in
prices like we're seeing right now, we have a negative crude lag effect. In fourth quarter absolute, it was just over $600
million. Likewise, in an environment where price is increasing, you'd have the opposite effect.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: You are using LIFO accounting, so why do we have such a big negative crude effect? And also,
I thought the price finalization related to your Saudi contract in a declining oil price environment, so that should be a
favorable positive impact. I guess that I am just totally wrong on that then.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So the crude lag effect is primarily associated with pipeline supply contracts, standard
terms, to how the pricing is done.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Can you speak – so this $600 million is primarily in the U.S. then, I presume?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I see. And is there any other tax impact in the quarter other than, say, the $700 million U.S.
deferred tax in the upstream?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Paul, is your question relating to our overall performance or specific to the segment?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: If you can say looking at all the other segments that we know that you have $700 million of
U.S. tax benefit in the upstream. Is there any other tax negative impact or positive impact in the other segments?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That is in essence the most of it.

opportunity to cut cost relative to other areas? And I guess I'm thinking more along the lines of project type and in
specific regions relative to your other ones.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, Allen, I think broadly speaking we always feel like we've got opportunity to become
more cost efficient. From a capital perspective, it's around upfront planning for execution to make sure that we're most
effective in utilization of services as well as commodities. In terms of our day-to-day operations, our fuel costs are a big
component. You have to manage that appropriately, in terms of energy efficiency of your facilities. As I commented
on, the capital program, I'd say that nothing is really sacred. We continue to identify additional opportunities to make
our cost structure more efficient.
<Q - Allen Good>: Great, thanks. And then on asset sales, I would assume that you guys are more opportunistic on
that level. And I think if I recall you said the approach of, if it's worth more to us – or worth more to the buyer, we'll
sell. Has activity around your assets or at least interest that you may have seen six months ago declined into today? And
should we expect maybe the asset sales to slow down over the next year to 18 months?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We've got such a diverse portfolio of assets. I really couldn't characterize for you whether
the interest has increased or decreased. The assets are so unique in their own right. And we recognize that these are
years of planning to assess when the right time is to go ahead and monetize that asset in a different means. We've been
very successful in capturing incremental value from our assets that we don't believe – no longer has a strategic fit for
our business. So I'd leave it at that.

We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe one follow-up question on U.S. liquids
production, it was quite strong in the quarter, strong sequentially and strong year on year. Can you talk a little bit about
what assets are primarily driving that growth? Is this your big three onshore plays that you were talking about, or is
there a little bit of everything?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, so this is good opportunity to really talk more about it. In terms of our fourth quarter
versus the third quarter performance, we're up quite significantly on our volumes, primarily driven by our projects.
Quarter on quarter, projects are up about 130,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Those volumes are coming from
Angola, primarily the CLOV project, in Canada associated with the Kearl project, in Papua New Guinea associated
with our LNG project. We had an increase in project volumes associated with Malaysia, Telok, and Damar, as well as
we had a very nice build in our U.S. work program due to our active drilling program in the three main liquid plays.
The other thing I'd point out is that we've also made great progress. The team has done an outstanding job in reducing
our downtime in our facilities. 2014 was a very successful year, and that brings very high-value volume to the bottom
line.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great, thanks, and then maybe one more on LNG. I guess a couple parts on LNG, which is there
any risk to the price in terms of your existing LNG contracts in the current environment from periodic reopeners in the
contracts? And would a longer duration of this moderate environment change the pace or effort at all around U.S. LNG
exports?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, again, these are very large capital-intensive projects. The investment is underpinned
by our long-term gas demand projection, and that's really the business case. As I said earlier, our existing LNG projects
are a very significant part of our margin generation.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: All right, great. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess maybe follow up on a couple things that have been hit here already. But as you look at
the major projects that you outlined in the earlier presentation, I'm just curious what the incremental 2015 impact is. A
lot of these projects started up at the end of 2014 and roll into 2015. If you could, give us an idea of maybe the volumes
impact there.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So for our 2014 program, just to recap, we added about 250,000 oil equivalent barrels per
day. As we look forward for 2015, we'll need to provide you an update at the March analyst meeting.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess I was just wondering for the ones that were highlighted in the presentation, or it's a
March event and we'll wait for that, I guess.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, for 2015. I shared with you how those investments in the presentation will ramp up
to their peak production. As I said, Arkutun-Dagi ramping up to 90,000 barrels a day, Nabiye ramping up to 40,000
barrels a day, Hadrian South ramping up 300 million cubic feet per day. Beyond that, we'll be more specific in next
month's analyst presentation and have a discussion about it.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. And then earlier in some of the Q&A you mentioned specific to dealing with the cost
structure, the accounting, it sounded like to me both internally and your third parties. Any comparisons, contrasts you
can do with previous downturns in terms of contracts that you have fixed here? Another way of asking the question,
any change in the flexibility Exxon has to address the cost structure today versus several years ago or in prior
downturns we've had?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, I wouldn't highlight anything that's changed. As I've said a couple times, it's a very
intense focus on capital efficiency and lowering our cost structure in our business across the areas that I talked about
previously.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: So no particulars on rig contracts or anything like that are more onerous than in prior times?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No. And I don't want to get into specifics on our commercial arrangements, but we've got
a very large, sizable operation and that positions us well to go ahead and work with our providers to put in place a very
effective cost structure.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Roger.

We'll take our next question from Iain Reid with BMO.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Hi, there, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Iain.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Just got a question on your pre-sanctioned pre-FID projects. A couple of your partners have been
talking about pushing these out due to current cost pressures and waiting for lower service costs, et cetera. I'm
specifically thinking about projects such as Tengiz and some of the Australasian and Canadian LNG projects. Is that

something, which you're also kind of factoring into with your longer-term production and your CapEx outlook in terms
of pushing these kind of more marginal projects down the road a little bit?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: It would be a consideration. Broadly speaking, we've got a very large and diverse
inventory of opportunities. We are very careful as we move these things forward that one, not only have they reached
technical maturity, but that we have tested the economic viability across a full range of economic parameters, including
commodity price.
So while we don't forecast or expect a price growth in order to make these investments go forward, we want to make
sure that we go into this eyes wide open and that we have a good handle on how robust these investments are. So when
we do have this commodity volatility like we're seeing right now, we're comfortable about the investment plans that we
have in place. Quite frankly, our investment program is really driven by a long-term projection, and we just don't
overreact to volatility in the market.
But we're mindful. We're mindful about implications on the business climate, implications on our cash flow
management, and then the overall supply/demand projections. So all of those variables are considered in how we set up
our investment plans but given that it's based on a long-term projection in demand and they have been tested across a
range of economic parameters, there won't be a whole lot of change. I'm not suggesting that there will be no change,
but there won't be a whole lot of change to our investment plans.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay, all right. That's understood. Can I just ask a quick question on chemicals? Your numbers
there seem to be holding up pretty well. I'm just wondering what you're thinking about chemical demand in particular
outside of the U.S. going forward? Because you're going to be seeing very much lower naphtha prices now. So what do
you feel about the pricing and demand side of that business?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Very well positioned. It's a great business. We've got the chemical facilities positioned
throughout in North America. We're benefiting from the lower feed costs. We've got advantaged assets there. In Europe
and Asia-Pacific, our steam crackers really benefit from the lower price environment we're in right now, particularly
our newest cracker in Singapore, which can process an unprecedented range of feedstocks ranging from crude oil –
including crude oil, which is really an industry first.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: I'm just wondering about the industry dynamics you're seeing out there in terms of demand and
pricing. I know you're well positioned but what are you seeing in terms of Asian demand, European demand?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, our global demand – I'm sorry, Iain, our global demand is expected, based on our
assessment, expected to grow above GDP driven by Asia.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. All right, Jeff. We'll see you at the Analyst Meeting.

We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Hey, Alastair.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Can you just come back to the deferred tax benefit and just explain what's going on with that
mechanic please?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So we periodically will review our deferred tax accounts to make sure that we've got the
right reserves in place. And sometimes that results in an adjustment, what you're seeing this quarter.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: It's not related to commodity prices in any way?

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No. It's just a prudent review of our deferred tax accounts.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Okay. And my second question, some people have alluded to the lag effect on pricing. Could
you discuss on LNG what the typical lag effect is and when do you think we'll see bottom prices given where oil prices
are today?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, there is a crude lag effect on our LNG contracts. We're not going to discuss the
specifics of those so you will see some impacts going forward. It really does vary by contract.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Okay. Put sometime in first or second quarter would be reasonable, do you think?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: It depends on what prices do.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet.

We'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question. First on the balance sheet, is it still the case that you are
targeting maintaining A AAA credit rating? And if so, how much debt do think you can take on and still keep the
AAA?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, so as I said earlier, Pavel, we don't have any specific guidance on debt capacity or
our plans. We will assess our cash and funding options around a range of outcomes and we'll take a balanced approach
to meet our obligations. But as I indicated, we have significant debt capacity but importantly, we'll maintain our
financial flexibility.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. In relation to your top three U.S. liquids plays, you said that the rig count has
actually increased from three months ago. Can you name any geographic areas, either North America or otherwise,
where the rig count has dropped in the last three months?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, I'd just say broadly speaking, at the level that we'll share with you all, our overall
rig count globally is running just under 100 rigs. About 60% of that is in the U.S. and we continue to assess the value
proposition of maintaining our rig activity. I'll leave it at that there.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay, fair enough. Appreciate it.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Okay.

We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for fitting me in at the end here.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Guy.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: You highlighted the improvement to your underlying upstream margins for 2014 despite the
lower year-on-year commodity pricing environment, which you all have been very focused on for some time and I
think was a very important accomplishment for you guys. Setting aside the commodity, as we look to 2015, I was just
hoping you could comment on just bigger picture expectations for the trend and underlying upstream margins, and what
you think perhaps the biggest drivers and biggest opportunities may be? And I'm thinking evolution of major project
mix and ramp-up costs or focus portfolio moves. I was just wondering if there was anything specific you could share

there that we should be focusing on? And then I had a quick follow-up.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good question, Guy. I'd say I appreciate the recognition of the progress that we've made
over 2014, and I'd say that, that's a result of several factors. One is this intense focus on capital efficiency and lowering
our cost structure. Two has been the higher-margin production that we've been adding to the portfolio due to our major
project activity, and our U.S. onshore drilling activity predominantly in the three main liquid plays that we've talked
about. Both have been a significant uptick to our overall unit profitability.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: That's very helpful. And then my follow-up was with 2014 now in the books I was wondering if
there is any update you could share on base portfolio decline, how that performed versus expectations? And then big
picture, does Exxon expect an increase in global decline rates just for the industry given some base spending is perhaps
being cut and is that an important component of your oil price fundamental outlook?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So our overall base decline in 2014 was about 3%. We have continued to offset that with
our work program activity as well as the major project adds. Obviously, in our unconventional, you see a higher decline
rate earlier on and then it flattens out and that will have an impact and we offset that with a very active work program.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Thanks very much.

We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, Jeff, just two very quick follow-ups. Do you have an under-lift or over-lift in the quarter
for your upstream production versus the sales versus the production?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. So the over-lift and under-lift, we have a – my recollection was that we did have an
under-lift in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: How about that versus the actual production?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, that's what it is.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Under-lift versus the production.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Can you quantify what is that number?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Sequentially it was about 90,000 barrels.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Paul, I'd just highlight though, while we see that variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis,
I'll just note that it was essentially flat year on year.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And do you have – I think that very little asset sales, just wondering, is there any asset
sales gain in the quarter?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: For the quarter, on the asset sales, it was very small, Paul. It had some small upstream
assets in the fourth quarter and very small downstream as well.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay, all right. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: All right, Paul. Thank you.

And it appears we have no further questions at this time.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
To conclude, I'd like to thank everybody for your time and your questions this morning. As you know our business
model is designed to be successful in a business climate known for commodity price volatility. And that's really why it
always comes back to the fundamentals: prudent cash management, operational reliability and efficiency, this intense
cost control I've talked about a couple of times, and obviously excellence in project execution.
And we really do look forward to sharing more with you in March with an update on our business strategies and our
investment plans. So until then, everybody, take care and we'll see you in March. Thank you.
