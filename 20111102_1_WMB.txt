MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell
Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter call. As always, thanks for your interest in the
company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also yesterday,
Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about our results, the new guidance and growth opportunities. That
audio commentary and the slides are available on the website. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to
find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon: the earnings presentation with audio commentary and a
podcast by Alan; the data book that contains our usual information we make available each quarter; the press release of
our third quarter results; and our analyst package. Also for your information the third quarter 10-Q has been filled as
well.
Because we had commentary yesterday, this morning's call will be fairly brief. I know there are number of other
companies hosting calls this morning, so we'll go quickly in your questions. So this call should be fairly short. In a
minute, Alan Armstrong, our President CEO, will make some brief comments after which we'll open the lines for
questions.
Be aware, as always, all of our business units heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's
remarks. Here with me today are Ralph Hill, who heads the E&P company; Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream; and

Randy Bernard who heads our gas pipelines. Also Don Chappel our CFO is here and available.
On yesterday's presentation there were forward looking-statements on slide number two and three and the disclaimer on
oil and gas reserves on slide four. Those are included in our data book. Those are important and integral to the
company, so you should review those. There are also non-GAAP numbers included in various presentations. Those
have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules are also
available and follow all of our presentations.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning and thanks for joining us. First of all, great quarter, solid performance and
significant growth in all of our segments and certainly we're excited that our continued better than expected cash flows
in our infrastructure business have now provided us with the option to go directly to a spin without an IPO if we don't
see the markets become more stable and supportive of IPOing.
In the quarter, certainly you started to see the benefit of a lot of our projects that we've invested in the last couple of
years really starting to kick in, really across the board. Certainly the Bakken's kicking in for E&P, the Perdido Norte
project really started to pick up volumes and helped to fill up our Markham facility. And as well, our Echo Springs
facility that's now just had its one year anniversary of the new train being built there. We actually had a record in the
quarter of 41,000 barrels a day and are now operating a little over that. So you should expect to see more of this to
come as these projects that we've been investing in continue to kick in.
Finally, our business really is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of this U.S. turning to natural gas. I think you're
going to continue to hear more and more about that. Our infrastructure will be very well positioned to help arbitrage the
tremendous spread between natural gas and oil based products. And as well, it's positioned there to provide services to
get natural gas into the critical markets and provide critical access. We're certainly starting to see a lot of strains on the
infrastructure in some of the growing basins like Marcellus where infrastructure has become critical to getting the
production on. So, we're very excited about where we're positioned right now and excited to talk to you about the
quarter.
So, with that I'll turn it over for questions. Christy?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jason Gilbert from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason Gilbert>: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a quick question, post the spin of WPX, you're going to be left
with the Williams holdco. It's going to have very few assets other than the Canadian Midstream and Olefins and then
the ownership in the MLP. And I was just wondering, what's your ultimate vision for how this holdco structure is going
to look, and is there a need for Williams holdco down the line or can we expect that to be collapsed at some point?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'll take that. Well, certainly Williams holdco will hold the general partner, obviously, for
WPZ as well as a large number of units for WPZ. And as we've explained in the past, eliminating that would come with
pretty significant tax realization. And so we really don't see much reason for doing that. We also see an ability to
continue to incubate and use Williams Companies in acquisitions as well when things aren't a perfect fit. So, we like
having that vehicle there and there's certainly a lot of good financial reasons for leaving the holdco in place.
<Q - Jason Gilbert>: Great; thanks. That was my only question.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: We're hitting for you from both angles. The – it looks like your CapEx in the Midstream &
Canada guidance is up a decent amount for '12 and '13, but you didn't really lower '11. At first I thought it may be a
timing issue, but maybe just talk to – I think these numbers are higher than what they were at the analyst day.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. I think most of that change – this is Rory Miller -- most of that change is a result of us
having better definition on the capital projects. We've advanced some of the engineering on that and those particular
projects that are in guidance are in those negotiation tables have been pushed up. We also have in that same set of pie
charts the Geismar expansion. I know you [ph] asked (6:50) specifically about Canada, but the Geismar expansion is in
those numbers as well.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Right. Sorry. Yeah, I was asking about the whole segment, so I guess would you say most of the
delta is just Geismar or is there other Canadian spend as well?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. I don't think we've added any new Canadian things, it's really just more of refining the
cost estimates.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: This is Don Chappel. I just, again, note that on analyst day we spoke to Geismar but it was
not yet included in our guidance. So this is the first time we've included the Geismar expansion in our guidance
members.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then if I could just shift over to a couple questions on E&P. I think your last release,
you'd said you were planning to run eight to nine rigs in the Marcellus by year end 2012; you're now saying six to
seven. Was that just lower rig count just a function of your lowering your gas price forecast, or is there anything else
going on there?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: This is Ralph. It's a function of a little bit lower gas price forecast and living within our means
and also we're much more efficient with our new fit-for-purpose rigs than we thought we would be.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just thinking about the Bakken as those volumes come up, how
should we think about your – I guess, your takeaway there? What kind of realized prices we should expect, maybe
discount to WTI or what kind of realizations there?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: We'd planned for approximately about a $10 discount and what we're actually seeing is less than
that in last few months, is more in the $5 range. But we continue to plan about on a $10 – $9.80 I think is what's in the
actual data book. And we are – at this point through rail, through pipe, through trucking, we're keeping up with our
production. And we think we have sufficient capacity continue with our build-up of volumes.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay; that's great. And then last one from me kind of related to Jason's point, was just do you
anticipate making any incremental debt paydowns now that you're not doing the IPO at the WMB level or are you just
– you're comfortable with the debt balances that you have staying in there at holdco? Just be curious about that and
where are the rating agencies coming out as well.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: We're continuing the look at potential debt paydown with proceeds from notes offering
that would be transferred up from Williams. And we are in regular communication with the agencies regarding our
plans and, again, we expect to maintain our investment grade ratings.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay; thanks. That's it from me.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Thanks.

And we'll go next to Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Actually maybe the first question just for Ralph, there was a
mention perhaps of cost pressure going on in the Bakken and that your oil service relationships were helping the hold
the line, but I was wondering if you could give us any additional color there.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Well, we've established a relationship with Halliburton for our stimulation services; it's dedicated
to us, also for our directional services. We've also contracted for a whole new fleet of rigs, fit-for-purpose rigs, and
we've contracted for a rig moving company. So, we're taking a lot of the model that we had in the Piceance and applied
it up there. So, while there are cost pressures, since we were so new to the basin we feel we've really started to
overcome a lot of those. And as that model kicks in, we think we'll continue to drive our costs down. So, we're -there is
lot of pressure up there, no doubt, but we feel with our relationships with our vendors and our alliances with them, we'll
be in good shape.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Is there any way to quantify that as far as what your expectation is on cost pressure, if you will,
maybe 2012 just over today in that region?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Well, I think our data book basically is we're talking about $9.5 million wells. We were – we
initially planned on those to be less than that. Some people are talking about their well costs are over $10 million, $11
million, and we don't think we'll see that. So, I guess, and we'll be able to hold – we think we'll be able to hold it flat at
the $9.5 million is where we are now. And we hope to – we'd like to see that driven down, but we're not sure yet. But
we've been able to reach the $9.5 million, we've already got a couple new rigs up there. We also have the alliance with
our stimulation services.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. And then just a question, if I could, on Midstream Canada, kind of continue to get our
arms around it. I know this is kind of a smaller piece of the business, but one thing we noticed that, excluding
depreciation, the operating costs had a bit of a spike. And again, this is small part of the business, but I don't know if
there was any additional color to be had there.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Yeah. We did have more planned maintenance both up in the north and down at Redwater. So I
think it was about – I think around $10 million of additional maintenance capital that we had in the quarter, so that's
probably accounting for what you're seeing.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then last question and, Alan, you knew it was coming, so just to go
ahead and ask it. With respect to the Kinder El Paso M&A, the things we've seen in other company filings, is there any
additional commentary to add to the whole Southern Union situation or should we just kind of take prior comments as
is?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I'll clarify, but they're not going to be different than prior comments. We continue to
be very excited about the infrastructure play here as the U.S. starts to really take advantage of natural gas and we think
that the infrastructure assets are going to play an important role in that, so we continue to be very interested in that. We
think we are very well positioned as a company to grow in that space and we'll continue to look aggressively at any
opportunity we see out there to do that. So I think you should expect to see us to be – continue to be aggressive in that
space.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great, thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi, just following up a little on Carl's question about the M&A environment, perhaps, Alan or
Don, if, A, if you all can take a step back and just talk about the broader competition in the market for assets; and, B,

the potential impact on your near-term capacities, now that perhaps you might have give or take maybe a billion plus
less cash because you may not do the IPO?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, this is Don, I'd say that lack of IPO proceeds has certainly been something we knew
was a possibility during this entire period. So we're not at all surprised by that. And obviously, it does make a
difference, but I don't think it's going to make a strategic difference in terms of what we pursue, but obviously it is a
factor. But beyond that, we'll continue to look at assets. I think as Alan has said before, we're disciplined in our
approach. Obviously, it's a market where there's a lot of competition for assets and we'll look where we have unique
advantages. And we have a lot of such advantages and we'll look to use those.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: It seems that most are looking at acquisitions being, if not immediately accretive on a cash flow
basis at least neutral and then accretive very soon thereafter. From a strategic standpoint in terms of the M&A
environment, are you all willing to look at things that perhaps in the first year may not help with dividend distributions?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I think certainly there are assets that would be large growth assets in areas that would
fit that profile, but for the most part, those are going to be smaller kind of assets that are emerging assets that we would
pursue, but we certainly will work to those kind of growth assets in basins like the Marcellus where we feel like we've
got great opportunities moving forward and we think we can build a great business there and a great franchise here. So
we will look at those kind of investments in those areas.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Holly Stewart from Howard Weil. Your line is open.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Good morning. First just on, just kind of following up on the M&A, sorry to beat a dead horse
here, but we did notice in one of the ETE filings that you were having some conversations to buy some of Southern
Union's assets. Is that door now closed?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I wouldn't say that the door is closed, but I would certainly say SUG has been clear in
terms of their position on that and in the immediate term. So, I think in the immediate term, that may be the case, but I
don't think for the longer term necessarily. But I would just tell you – we'll continue to be very disciplined on that and
we think we know what they're worth. We think we're the right buyer for a certain portion of those assets and we'll just
see where that falls out ultimately.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Perfect. And then maybe one for Ralph. Ralph, kind of just looking at my previous notes, I think
you saw that Marcellus would get to 25% of production within the next couple of years. You had some delays on the
infrastructure side and you've tweaked your rig count. What's the latest thought process there in terms of Marcellus?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: I think, we'll still to get to that level in a couple years. We feel very confident especially their –
our results are just starting at Susquehanna because Laser is still in the startup phase, but we – even with a little lower
rig count, we think we'll be at those levels. We're going – I think we're going to be very pleased with the Susquehanna
drilling in particular. And our Westmoreland and Clearfield and Centre counties are also doing better than we thought.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Have you had to break rig count out today up in the Marcellus? Where are those rigs distributed?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: They are going to be probably – well, we'll get to four in Susquehanna. It'll be – it's rising from
two to four and then the Clearfield – or the Westmoreland County will have two, but we may move one down from
time to time to the Clearfield and Centre County area. So really four in the northeast area and two in the center part.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. All right; great. Thanks, guys.

And we'll go next to [ph] Jeff Coviello with Tellinger. (18:16) Your line is open.
<Q>: Hi. Good morning. It's actually [ph] John Kiani. (18:20) How are you?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<A>: Hi, [ph] John. (18:23)
<Q>: Can you talk a little bit about your level of comfort or confidence in eventually moving up to an investment grade
rating at the Williams legacy or stub company post the spin, with the leverage you see there versus what you would
have expected in an IPO scenario? And then second part to that question is, with the spin being what the current plan is,
is there a range or certain area of the growth rate range we should expect for the dividend that's 10% to 15% in the spin
scenario based on what balance sheet and leverage you see versus the original IPO plans? Thank you.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I'll start with the latter part of your question, again the 10% to 15% is our guidance on
dividend growth regardless of spin versus IPO. We don't think that that really moves the needle. And two, in terms of
credit rating targets, we're committed to maintain investment grade ratings. The actual ratings will obviously be
determined by the ratings agencies. But we think in terms of both business risk and quality of assets as well as leverage
and the like. We consider ourselves to be in a very strong position. But, obviously, the ratings agencies will decide
where they come out based on their own views, but again we're committed to those ratings. We've seen continuous
improvement and we'll see where we go from here.
<Q>: I appreciate that. On the dividend growth rate range of 10% to 15%, my question was really, does the spin put
you in a different area of that range than the IPO would have?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: No – no, it does not.
<Q>: Okay you feel pretty comfortable with the midpoint in either the spin or the IPO scenario?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yes we do. Thank you.
<Q>: Great. Thank you.

And we go next to Kevin Smith from Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Hi, good morning, gentleman.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: With Laser Pipeline starting up, is all of your Marcellus shut-in production essentially online
now or where are we at in that space?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: No. This is Ralph. Only a couple wells are online and we have a number of other wells that will
be becoming online as we prepare our facilities and they prepare the startup. So we actually just are in the process of
turning on our second well. So we have, I think, we're reporting -- we think we have about 80 million a day of
production that will be coming on over the next several weeks to a month as the Laser goes through full startup.
<Q - Kevin C. Smith>: Okay, fair enough. But by year end are you expecting to have essentially no shut-in volumes
other than just maybe the normal amounts from drilling and completion?

and we will take our last question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning. It looks like Enterprise has secured the commitments for ethane pipeline out of
the Marcellus. Maybe, Alan, if you could talk to how maybe this project would impact the need for blending projects
that Williams is contemplating and also support for the Atlantic Access Project.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, this is Rory. I'll take that. Our strategy I think, as you alluded to, in the Marcellus is to
actively use blending in the basin particularly with the pipes project that we've got proposed, Atlantic Access. We see
that as probably the most cost effective way to do things. But we do have a project, I think we've talked about it some
at the analyst day, our Confluence Pipeline that we're proposing as the Williams ethane solution. And it's something
that would build the runway to a more complete answer, be it some petrochemical crackers up in the Northeast or be it
a line such as the one that Enterprise is proposing. So getting those kind of solutions up there we see generally as a
good thing. If there's a way to unlock value on the ethane commodity for producers up there, they're going to be drilling
more. And as a gatherer and future processor up there, that's good to get the drilling going. So I see that – I see any of
the solutions up in the Northeast as just a positive for the area.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay and I guess based on your volume projections, do you think there's room or necessity for two
or more of these projects to actually get completed?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: For the long-haul ethane pipelines, is that your question?
<Q - Sharon Lui>: That's correct.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, well, right now I think that's a – I think one is a big first step, probably the pipeline to
Sarnia, I think that MarkWest is working on, is probably the first tranche of ethane that gets cleared from the area. If
we get one of these long-haul pipes to the Gulf Coast, that's probably even a bigger tranche of ethane that's cleared.
If you do the math, if you look at the Penn State study where they were forecasting, I think, up to 17.5 Bcf a day out in
2020, yeah, you can start doing the math and you probably could get to two pipeline projects. But I think that's a long
ways down the road and probably so far out in the future that that's not much of a concern right now.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And any update, I guess, in terms of securing commitments for the Confluence Pipeline?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: We're talking to a number of producers right now. As with any new project, we don't have any
definitive agreement signed. We are getting lot of interest. It's something that I guess I would say generally is being
well received in the producer community up there. So, more to report on that.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, great. Thank you, Rory.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Thank you.

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Just a quick question on the – do you have any well results at all from some of your activities
in South America?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Just the standard – we haven't done any Vaca Muerta yet, if that's what you're asking, we're doing
our standard drilling in our three concessions in Entre Lomas but we do not have – we have a couple of vertical tests
we are going to do in the Vaca Muerta but there's no other – they're not done yet, so not yet.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, roughly when will those tests be done, do you think?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: We'll do some in the early next year, I believe, and – but we're actually kind of monitoring the –
since we have all the acreage already, we're monitoring the progress of other producers and trying to learn from what
they're doing. And then we'll enter into our program probably at a later date and a more robust program.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: So, we have a couple of vertical wells we'll test, probably early next year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, got you. And then I think previously you guys had talked about kind of a target
production rate in the Bakken of 20,000 barrels equivalent a day. Where do you think you guys are in that sort of ramp
up?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: In what timeframe, I'm sorry?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I think it was 2013 or so, I think – when you guys first made the transaction, it was something
along those lines, but maybe I'm mistaken?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: I think that was it – I think we would – currently, we're slightly behind due to delay and the
winter we had and the startup from all that. But we would expect to gain on that and get close to that level. I don't
remember the exact date of that, but we feel confident in our production profile going forward.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. And just a question on Gulfstar, now with that – with the Tubular Bells
being sanctioned, I mean how does that project kind of move forward for you guys and what – is there any sort of
update on what that will cost and what kind of contribution that could bring the Midstream business?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: This is Rory. I'll take that question. Well, we had a reimbursement agreement in place with a
customer many months before the definitive documents were signed. So, the project is well underway, all of the major
contracts for fabrication and heavy lift and installation on the pipelines, those contracts are all signed and in place. So
we're well on our way, steel is in the yards, things are progressing nicely. So that total cost I want to say is under $1
billion with the pipeline interconnections. I think, as we noted, we are still looking at taking on a partner for that, so
that's probably something that we just want to reiterate. But I don't know if you've got anything else on that?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: No. That's fine. Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.
