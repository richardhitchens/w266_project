North America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan Akerson.
Daniel Francis Akerson
Thanks, Randy. Every quarter in these calls, we talk a lot about what it takes to go from being good to great at General
Motors. Fundamentally, I believe there are three drivers: building great products, satisfying our customers better than
anyone else, and making sure the company has good bones. In my book, good bones means a fortress balance sheet and
a strong organizational – an organization with capabilities in everything from IT to HR, the marketing and finance. All
of these things, from products to people, the technology have to come together to build a sustainable competitive
advantage and they're doing just that, as you can see it in the numbers we are posting this quarter.
Looking at the top of slide 2, you can see that we increased our third quarter global delivery by 5.5% and grew our
global market share by 0.1%. Net revenue increased by $1.4 billion and EBIT adjusted was up 15% to $2.6 billion.
This $300 million increase was driven by higher earnings in North America and South America, a small increase in
China and a smaller loss in Europe and another very solid quarter for GM Financial.
GM Financial, I'd like to point out, has now surpassed $2 billion in cumulative pre-tax earnings since we acquired the
company in the second half of 2010.
Two of our automotive operating regions also deserve special recognition. First, the team in North America has done a
great job in executing a very aggressive product plan. We're talking about more than a dozen Chevrolet, Buick, GMC
and Cadillac launches so far this year. Combined, they represent more than 1 million sales on an annualized basis.
In particular, the launches of the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra have been nearly textbook perfect. Since the
first quarter of 2013, GM incentive spending on light duty trucks has been trending down and the average transaction
prices have been trending up. The pace of improvement definitely picked up in the third quarter, which reflects an
increasing mix of 2014 models, which are now about 75% of sales, and stable – and in this period stable incentive
spending on our old 2013 models.
In other words, we're very much on plan. Meanwhile, the team in Europe has been tending the green shoots we talked
about last January. Specifically, GM Europe has managed to stabilize key metrics like volume and pricing in an
extremely challenging market. In fact, they increased their revenue year-over-year for the first time in two years.
Finally, adjusted automotive free cash flow was a strong $1.3 billion, that's net of roughly $1.9 billion in capital
spending in the quarter. Now before we walk through our GAAP and non-GAAP results in more detail, I'd like to
spend a few more minutes reviewing some other highlights in the quarter.
They're summarized on slide three. Of course our cars and trucks are the tip of the sphere and product excellence is
once again a GM hallmark. Let me give you a few powerful examples. In July, Consumer Reports magazine named the
2014 Chevrolet Impala as the best sedan in the market, period. This shocked many people, because no American car
has ever come out on top. Then just two months later, the magazine named Chevrolet Silverado the best truck. The best
news is that Consumer Report is not an outlier among auto critics.
For example, the Buick Encore, the Cadillac CTS, the GMC Sierra, and three Chevrolets, the Impala, Corvette and
Silverado, are all on the short list to be the next North American Car or Truck of the Year. No one has never stacked
the deck like this.
But what matters most, more than trophies, is our consistent execution to high standards. That's what changes the
conversation about brands. The product roll we're on, especially in North American is creating tremendous value,
which you can see in our EBIT adjusted margins, which topped 9%.
We're going outside of our home market as well. If products like Onyx in Brazil help Chevrolet sell 1.25 million
vehicles in the quarter and achieve another global sales record. Indeed, Chevrolet is on quite a run. The brand has now

delivered 12 consecutive quarters of higher year-over-year global sales.
Cadillac is also on an accelerated growth trajectory and the brand hit products that play key roles in our global market
share increase. In the first nine months of the year, the brand's global sales were up 31% versus 2012, thanks to
launches of the ATS, CTS and XTS in North America and our expansion in China.
If product discipline is one-half of the coin, the other is financial discipline. Our financial goals are just as well-defined
as our product and customer strategies and we are equally systematic when it comes to execution. For example, during
the quarter we refinanced a substantial portion of our Series A preferred stock in September to reduce interest cost and
simplify our balance sheet. All of this progress opened the door for Moody to return GM to investment-grade status in
September, something we're very proud of. The upgrade recognizes our progress. And it's emblematic of the potential
this company represents. If anything, I think we're just starting to scratch the surface of what we can accomplish.
With that summary, I'll now turn the floor over to Dan Ammann. Dan?
Daniel Ammann
Thanks, Dan. Now on slide four, I'll start with the summary of our financial results for the quarter.
Net revenue for the period was $39 billion. The $1.4 billion increase includes an $800 million unfavorable impact from
foreign exchange translation. Our GAAP operating income increased to $2.3 billion. Net income to common
stockholders was $700 million. The decline from the prior year was due to stronger operating performance being more
than offset by an incremental $500 million in tax expense and the $800 million charge we took to redeem a portion of
the Series A preferred stock during this quarter. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.45 and our automotive net
cash from operating activities was $3.3 billion, up $200 million from 2012.
For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $2.6 billion in the third quarter and the EBIT adjusted margin
improved to 6.8%. Adjusted automotive free cash flow increased $100 million to $1.3 billion for the third quarter.
Slide 5 lists the special items for the quarter. Again, net income to common stockholders was $700 million and our
fully diluted EPS was $0.45. We took another impairment of goodwill in the GM Korea business that was less than
$100 million. In addition, we booked an $800 million charge for our recent redemption of Series A preferred shares.
These charges had a $0.51 unfavorable impact on earnings per share.
On slide 6, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five quarters. Our 6.8% EBIT adjusted margin is our
highest in nine quarters. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.6 million vehicles in the third quarter, a slight
increase from the prior year and our global market share increased to 11.7%.
Turning to slide seven, we explained the $300 million year-over-year increase in our consolidated EBIT adjusted. As I
just covered, global wholesales were essentially flat resulting in no change in earnings from volume. Mix was $500
million favorable, due primarily to vehicle mix in North America. Price was $800 million favorable, due to strong new
product in GM North America and price actions we took to offset FX impacts in South America. Cost was $200 million
unfavorable due to increases in North America and IO, partially offset with savings in Europe. Other was $700 million
unfavorable, primarily due to FX impacts.
Slide eight gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segment. GMNA increased $500 million to $2.2
billion. GME improved to a $200 million loss. The performance in IO deteriorated by $500 million to $300 million for
the quarter, and in South America, we improved to $300 million. And GM Financial again recorded $200 million in
earnings before taxes. Our Corporate sector rounded to $200 million of expense.
I'll now review the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide nine. For the third quarter of 2013, our
total U.S. market share was 17.3% and our retail share was 16%. Retail share increased 0.3 percentage points from the
prior year, as our fleet market share decreased due to the repositioning of the Chevy Impala and generally lower rental
sales. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.2% of average transaction price, which put us at 114% of the industry
average.

Slide 10 shows GMNA's EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. Revenue increased $1.2 billion to $23.5
billion despite flat wholesale volumes. GMNA's EBIT adjusted margin was 9.3% for the third quarter, demonstrating
clear progress toward our mid-term goal of 10% margins.
Our U.S. dealer inventory declined to 670,000 vehicles as we worked through the launch of our all-new Chevy
Silverado and GMC Sierra. North America market share was 16.7% in the quarter. The primary drivers of the $500
million increase in GM North America EBIT adjusted are on slide 11. Volume had no net impact. Mix was $400
million favorable, due almost entirely to our new vehicle introductions including full-size pickups. Price was $600
million favorable as the $1.1 billion favorable pricing from our recently launched vehicles was partially offset by $500
million in unfavorable carryover pricing.
Cost was $400 million unfavorable due to $500 million in increased material and freight expense, and $200 million in
increased engineering expense, partially offset by a $300 million reduction in unfavorable policy and warranty reserve
adjustments. Other was $200 million unfavorable due to FX headwind and non-operating income items, which are
largely non-recurring.
GME on slide 12 reported an EBIT-adjusted loss of $200 million for the third quarter, a $300 million improvement
from the prior year. Revenue improved 3% to $4.9 billion for the quarter, marking the first year-over-year revenue
increase in at least two years. The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment improved 6 percentage points to minus 4.4%.
GME's wholesale volumes for the quarter stayed relatively constant at 253,000 units and our European market share
improved to 8.6%.
On slide 13, we provide the major components of GME's $300 million increase in EBIT adjusted. Volume had no
impact. Mix was $100 million headwind and price was flat. Cost was $400 million favorable, due to $200 million in
lower depreciation and amortization expense and $200 million savings in other areas.
I'd like to remind you that we plan to close our Bochum assembly and powertrain operations by the end of 2014. We
will disclose in our 10-Q that we expect to incur significant restructuring costs as a result of this action and some of
these charges may affect our results as early as the fourth quarter of 2013.
We now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 14. EBIT adjusted was $300 million, made
up of continued strong equity income from our China joint ventures of $400 million, partially offset by $100 million
loss from our consolidated operations, which includes approximately $50 million in restructuring charges. GMIO's
revenue from consolidated operations was $5.3 billion. The $400 million decline from Q3 of 2012 includes $200
million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation.
The EBIT adjusted margin for our consolidated operations declined to negative 2.8% from a year ago, as we again
experience industry and competitive pressures in this segment of the business. We expect these challenges to continue
to affect our performance in the fourth quarter. In response, we have strategic reviews underway in select markets, the
results of which may lead to future charges.
The net income margin from our China JVs came in at a solid 9.4%. GMIO had wholesale vehicle sales of 267,000
units for its consolidated operations, and 761,000 units for the China JVs. GM market share in the Asia Pacific region
improved to 9.6%, reflecting our strength in [audio gap] (16:14 – 16:16) to grow faster than the rest of the region.
On slide 15 we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume had no impact. Mix
was $100 million unfavorable in GMIO consolidated operations, and price was $100 million headwind. Cost was $200
million unfavorable, due to $100 million decline from our parts and accessories business, and higher manufacturing
expense, offset by some favorable material and freight items. Other had no impact, as $100 million on unfavorable FX
was offset with a small increase in equity income.
Slide 16 provides a look at GM South America's performance in recent quarters. Revenue improved $100 million
year-over-year to $4.4 billion despite a $600 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation.

The EBITDA adjusted margin in the segment rose to 6.5%, 2.8 percentage points higher than the prior year. GM South
America's wholesale vehicle sales were 282,000 units, a 14,000 unit increase from the prior year period, and our market
share in the region declined slightly to 17.8% despite a higher share in the Brazilian market.
On slide 17, we'll look at the drivers of the $100 million increase in EBIT adjusted. Volume had no impact. Mix was
$200 million favorable due to country mix and the successful introduction of new vehicles in Brazil, including the
Chevy S-10. Price was $300 million favorable due to actions we've taken in response to inflationary and FX pressures.
Cost had no impact and Other was a $400 million headwind because of foreign exchange. This totals the $300 million
EBIT adjusted in South America in the third quarter. While we're pleased with South America's improvement in
profitability this quarter, our performance in future periods will likely to continue to be impacted by currency and
regulatory actions, particularly in Venezuela.
Slide 18 provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the third quarter. From our net income to common
of $700 million, we add back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the Series A redemption
and then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income of $1.5 billion. We had $100 million in
non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was $1.4 billion.
Working capital was $100 million use of cash. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $200 million
in the quarter. Other was a $600 million source of cash, a $200 million increase from the prior year, which can be more
than explained by an increase in deferred tax expense. This totals to automotive net cash provided by operating
activities of $3.3 billion. We had $1.9 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, giving us an adjusted automotive
free cash flow of $1.3 billion.
The positive cash flow helped to improve our liquidity position on slide 19 to $37.3 billion, including $26.8 billion in
cash and marketable securities. The debt increase to $8.4 billion is due to our recent $4.5 billion refinancing
transactions. $3.2 billion of the new debt was used in the third quarter to redeem Series A preferred shares that had a
book value of $2.4 billion. The remaining $1.2 billion was used after the quarter end to retire the Canadian healthcare
trust notes. This transaction will be reflected in our fourth quarter earnings announcement.
Our U.S. qualified pension plans were underfunded by $12.8 billion and our non-U.S. pension plans were underfunded
by $13.6 billion. The $500 million increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange
translation. Our unfunded OPEB liability declined to $7.3 billion as we modified retiree life insurance benefits for our
U.S. salaried population.
Slide 20 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial released their results this morning and
will hold their conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the third quarter declined 0.3 percentage
points to 7.8%. Our U.S. lease penetration experienced a year-over-year increase for the sixth consecutive quarter to
21.3% in Q3.
Lease penetration in Canada improved 1.5 percentage points to 8.1%. GM as a percentage of GM Financial loan and
lease originations rose to 67% and GM Financial's percentage of GM's U.S. consumer subprime finance and leasing
was 20% in the quarter.
GM Financial's annualized net credit losses were 1.9% and its earnings before tax were $239 million for the third
quarter, including the profitability of the recently acquired international subsidiaries. On October 1 after the quarter
end, we closed the acquisition of the Brazilian business of Ally International.
To summarize our financial performance on the final slide, we had strong third quarter results with revenue up, market
share up, EBIT adjusted up, margins up, and cash flow up. We also continue to strengthen our fortress balance sheet by
refinancing a significant portion of our preferred shares and debt at lower costs.
The continued focus of this management team is to deliver great new cars and trucks to our customers with a
compelling value proposition and great quality. And our third quarter results further validate that we're consistently
delivering on our plan.
Now, I'd like to pass it over to Dan Akerson for his closing remarks.

Daniel Francis Akerson
Thanks, Dan. For all the success we enjoyed in the third quarter, let me make one thing perfectly clear. We have a lot
of hard work ahead of us, especially in our focus areas of complexity reduction, material cost, logistics cost, and
quality. I can assure you that the team is very focused on making steady progress. Consistency is the name of the game.
Given how far we've come and what is just over the horizon, we're all pleased with our position and feel we're well
positioned for the future. And when we have great products that are wedded to a competitive cost structure, I think
we're in a unstoppable position.
Now, we'll be happy to take any questions you might have. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed with the analyst portion of the question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Good morning. I want to just focus on an overall strategic question. We can later on drill
into the details afterwards. But, there seems to be an emerging market SUV boom going on, sales up 45% in China,
other emerging markets gravitating towards SUVs and even the Europeans showing signs of following the SUV craze.
A couple of questions, one, where do you think GM is positioned on that now? Two, quickly can you beef up your
product lines in key markets for SUV CV? And then three, what kind of factory flexibility do you have to be able to
pivot between sedans and CUVs as perhaps gas prices fluctuate or tastes change?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Sure. Well, I think, first of all, we would agree with the general observation of the market
trends. Our precision relative to that trend differs by market around the world. There are places where we're at the very
forefront of that trend, like in Europe with the Mocha, I think we're really redefined that segment there as an example.
There are other places where we're not exactly where we want to be from a product timing point of view. And so, we're
obviously working to make sure that we're going to capitalize on the trends as we see them emerging.
And then finally, from a plan flexibility point of view, as you know, I think, many of the SUV programs, both for us
and for other manufacturers, are car-derived from an architectural point of view. So we have a pretty high amount of
flexibility from a manufacturing perspective to meet that demand once we have the product localized. So, it's clearly an
opportunity. It's clearly a longer term trend, and like I say, we feel good about where we are in parts of it and we're
working to capitalize on other places.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Oh great. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you give any color on the reported production
or supply issues around the new pick up? I mean, I think there was news that certain engine components were running
or a bit constrained, and then, there were some axle issues. I mean, will that impact you at all going forward in terms of
sales or production as we go into Q4?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah. Excuse me, this is Chuck. We've had some short-term issues with American Axle
around some specific components. We're working very closely with them. It has had a small impact on production in
the month of October, but we expect to make that up here yet in Q4 and have no impact on the full size SUV launch, so
a lot of focused attention being given to this and we expect it to be resolved here in the relatively near term.

<Q - Colin Langan>: And what about the reported issue with some engine components? Is that impacting your
availability of some of the V8s?
<A - Charles Stevens>: No. The biggest issue is really around some axle components right now that impacts the mix
of the V8s.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And so we should – with the ramp rolling out, we – pick-up production will likely rise from Q3
to Q4 as two of the plants are online?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Well, I think those are two different questions. One, we lost some units thus far in the month
of October because of some part shortages, which we expect to make up. Secondly, I think there will be a seasonal Q4
versus Q3 impact on full size pick-up and SUV production as well as others, specifically because we'll have holiday
shutdown in Q4 and we didn't shut down any of the plants in July during the changeover.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. That's very helpful. And any color on – any update on the Peugeot alliance? Obviously, I
think they were out saying that some parts of the alliance are under review. I mean, how does that impact your
restructuring plan in Europe and the potential $1 billion in savings that the alliance is supposed to – was aiming to
achieve eventually?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: I think it's fair – this is Dan Akerson speaking. It's fair to say that we still are working
with regard to specific platforms that we see potential benefit for both companies. We are watching the situation
carefully, their apparent need to raise additional capital and how that might fit with our plans. But I would say there is
nothing new to report until we ascertain precisely what comes out of their capital raise endeavors.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: The only thing I would add to that is, a year ago on this call, when we outlined our plan to
breakeven in Europe by mid-decade, we said then and I'll reiterate it now that, that plan did not include any assumption
of material synergies from the PSA alliance.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much for your help.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with the question.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning everybody. On North America, you just did 9.3% margin in what is, at least
historically, it's been a relatively weaker quarter. I would imagine maybe it comes down a little bit in the fourth quarter
with the heavy duty truck plant down and seasonal costs, but can you talk a little bit about, if we look at this level of
profitability, what happens from here, as we look out to next year? Is it conceivable that you might be able to get to that
10% target a little bit sooner?
<A - Charles Stevens>: I think Q3 this year, that 9.3%, highest quarter since Q3 2011, obviously favorably impacted
by the K2 launch, as you indicated. I think, from a seasonal perspective, there will be a fall-off in Q4. And I don't think
you can necessarily extrapolate these Q3 earnings over a calendar year. I would say this, that we're at an inflection
point. We're executing to the plan that we talked about earlier this year to drive the organization to 10% EBIT margins
and I would expect on a year-over-year basis to see some pretty significant margin growth next year.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. And just one last one, you're sitting on $26 billion or $27 billion of cash. You've got
obviously plenty of liquidity of above and beyond that with the revolver. Could you just remind us what you're
targeting as a normal level of cash going forward? And what your priorities would be above and beyond the
reinvestment in the business?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, I'd tell you, we're comfortable or more than comfortable at our current levels of
liquidity. Recall that at the quarter end, there was $1.2 billion sitting there, which we've now redeemed the Canadian
Healthcare Trust note with in October. So, the balance sheet was slightly grossed up as of the quarter end.

The priorities for cash reinvestment haven't changed. We're obviously focused on reinvesting in the business, making
sure we got a winning product portfolio going forward and our capital expenditure levels, I think have reflected that
and have been consistent with what we had previously articulated.
My view is that we've come a long way with the balance sheet and we have it in very good shape. We obviously had a
very, I think, compelling refinancing transaction that we executed in September, taking advantage of the market
window there to clean up some nearer-term and expensive obligations and replace them with longer-dated and much
more efficient funding and so that puts us in a good position going forward.
As we look to next year, we obviously still have the remaining portion of the Series A Preferred that we will clean up at
the end of next year when that becomes actionable from the terms of the security point of view. We still have
shareholders working their way out of our ownership structure and that's something that we're keeping a close eye on
and obviously our priority over time is to return cash to shareholders and that's something that we continue to evaluate.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on the North American margin question that
Rod just posed. I mean, we're staring down the barrel of the K2XX launch, which is going on right now. You have the
HD launch, which comes after that. And then as we look over the next couple of years, you got your small CUVs and
large CUVs and the markets doing pretty well and you're doing cap, you have 96.4% right now. It looks like that'll
improve over time. And you're posting 9.3% margins now. Is 10% a ceiling, Chuck? Or is that something you think
you can do over the cycle? Is there a period of time where you could potentially be higher than that?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Our objective is to drive this business to 10% plus EBIT margins by mid-decade. And really to
generate those kinds of margins at mid-cycle volumes is, as we've talked about before, which would be an industry
level of 15.5 million units, 16 million units. We're at the early stages of executing to that plan. The product portfolio
and launch cadence is the first part of it and we need to continue to drive complexity and cost out of the business to get
the cost savings that we need to take the next tranche. So, is there a point where we could be above 10% EBIT margins
during the cycle? Possibly, but our commitment is to get to 10% by mid-decade. Once we get there, we'll worry about
the next step.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. Seems like you're almost there. And maybe just one...
<A - Charles Stevens>: As I said John, we shouldn't extrapolate Q3 over a calendar year. There is ebbs and flows
within the quarter.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Absolutely. But it's impressive so far. And maybe just one second question for Dan Akerson. I
noticed that your hiring trends on the hourly side were not that aggressive, but on the salaried side, it looks like you
hired about 5,000 workers, and it looks like it's a focus on ramping up your IT. Is that an effort really just to clean up
some of the in-house stuff? Or is there an opportunity to start mining data and marketing consumers more intelligently
or some big data push here that could really push the business forward? I'm just trying to understand what that big step
up in IT professionals is for?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Well, I won't recite all of the sins of IT past, but we had 23 unmirrored, not connected,
independent data centers. We're trying to get to two. We now have a data center here in Michigan that ranks in with
Google and Facebook in terms of its capability, one of the few in the industrial sector with that capability. Over the last
month, just this month, we've taken all the mainframes that were not resident in our sphere of influence and
consolidated them, without a hitch to the operations.

Having been in the high-tech environment for a good part of my career, I was very pleased with the transition to our
data centers. Along with that, we've transitioned away from some of our outsourced cost and brought it in and that's the
majority, more than 90% of our head count has been in IT this year.
So that's a positive from my perspective, because we're not paying the overhead for those people that we were once
paying to our third parties. And yes, we are a very data-driven company and you can see it just in our marketing. I don't
think it should go without passing to note that we want people to start buying cars over the Internet, as a potential half
step-away from our traditional channels. Doesn't mean we're going to trying and bypass our dealers, but why not, in
this tech-savvy culture we have, this economy we have where the millennials come in and say, I can shop and I'll just
go down and sign and go. So, we're trying to evolve not only from an internal perspective, but an external perspective
to a more 21st century information-based marketing company. So, your observations are directionally correct. We're
also trying to clean up some fundamental basics on how we run the information systems of our company.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hey. Thanks, everybody. First question is on the – in the initial reaction to the enhanced employee
discounts in the U.S., curious if you can comment on how that's gone so far early days? And perhaps to kind of
dynamic, how big were these discounts as a percentage of your total retail sales pre-crisis, because we've heard figures
as high as 30%. Now, that might have been at crazy high levels, but just want to confirm that and see how it's going so
far?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Yeah. To your latter point, Adam, 30% of our total sales were employee-based, was
that the data point?
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Yeah.
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah. That's way too high. So, to dispel some of the apparent myths around this employee
pricing, we ended up doing two things. One, simplifying the program. We had a very complicated car line-specific
EVA or rebate program that was very difficult for our employees and family members to manage. So, we went to a
simple percent of MSRP kind of discount.
Secondly, the incremental cost associated with that is relatively minor in the scheme of our overall incentive spending,
you're talking $200 to $250 a car on average. Third, that really put us in the middle of the pack as far as employee
discounts go between Ford and Chrysler, and I think you're aware, especially if you get around the Great Lakes region,
that there is a lot of interrelationships with family members, employees that have relatives that are Ford or Chrysler
employees or retirees. So, we needed to be competitive in order to make sure we were capturing our fair share of
employee and related sales. So far, it's been relatively successful. That's never going to move a market share point. It is
just, again, simplify, enhance to be competitive and make sure that we're getting our fair share of employee and related
sales.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks.
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Let me just add something to that, because I know you're trying to read tea leaves and
get some sort of perspective that gives you a better idea of what's going on. When we look at our – what I mentioned in
my remarks, incentives are down and average transaction prices are up. When we look at our competition, we're 200
basis points to 300 basis points lower than some of our competition in this area on incentives.
So, we've been very disciplined on our incentives. And as a result, our ATPs are up. That includes employees and
non-employees.

<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks for clarifying. That's very helpful. If I can just ask one follow-up. We understand that the
CFPB has sent letters to the automotive captive financing companies, curious if you can confirm whether GM
Financial's received any communication from the CFPB? And if so, perhaps share what the nature of that
communication is?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. We don't have any comment on that at this point.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Does that mean that you've not received communication or you just not commenting on that
question, Dan?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Means that I'm not commenting on the question.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thank you for clarifying.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yes. Thank you very much and good morning. Just a couple of questions on some of
the international ops. Beginning with GMIO, you did see a sequential uptick from second quarter, but I think in your
comments, you sort of – it sounded like that – you were hinting that obviously some of the core challenges there
remain. Should we interpret this as at least you've – even though you're down year-on-year and running at lower levels
than six months ago, things have at least stabilized and you're working to get them better, or is there some risk that
there is actually further downside to the profit levels you're seeing in this segment? And I would say excluding
restructuring charges, of course, which nobody can predict.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. I'd say that we're certainly not out of the woods yet, that there are ongoing challenges,
but at the same time, we're taking actions and we're taking actions quickly. You saw that we have – we made a
leadership change in the region, bringing in Stefan Jacoby to head up that part of the business for us. We should expect
to see changes through the business as we look to get the business back on track.
You need to remember that this reporting segment is really a collection of very different markets across a big span of
the globe and there are different dynamics going on in each market. We've talked about for example, in Southeast Asia,
where the yen and the competitive dynamic there has created some challenges. We've had issues in India that we've
talked about publicly in terms of some product related challenges there.
So, it is a little bit of a different story by market. We are taking very affirmative action to get the business back on to
the kind of track that it should be on, but this is something that we're going to be working through over the coming
quarters and is not fully resolved, obviously, at this point.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay, that's helpful. And just a similar question, actually, for Brazil or I should say,
South America. You had a very good quarter there relative to expectations, but you seem to caution that there's some
remaining issues there. Was there any kind of one-off that supported results, either kind of an FX issue or anything like
that that kind of reverses in the fourth quarter, or are we just talking about sort of ongoing challenges that can hopefully
sustain this level of performance?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well, there are a lot of just external challenges in the region from a operating environment
point of view. There has been, as is well known, a lot of FX volatility. I think I described in some detail how we have
worked to offset FX volatility with pricing in the various markets where we've had the biggest impacts there. At the
same time, we do operate in some volatile economies down there, including in places like Venezuela where overall
political situations remain unstable and so on. So when you're operating in some of those kinds of environments, the
business is in some ways a week-to-week activity as to exactly what the surprise of the day is going to be in terms of
the external environment that you're operating in. So we made good progress in the quarter, but we want everyone to
understand that it's a volatile environment and we'll be dealing with those fluctuations in the coming quarters.

<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: Just to add a little bit of more color. When we do our operating reviews in South
America, just to buttress what Dan said, many times, the first half-hour or 40 minutes is spent trying to understand the
politics. And it isn't just Venezuela, although Venezuela is one of them, but many of these economies have inflation,
hyperinflation. Argentina, you have a President that became ill in the middle of an election and that turn of government
could make a big impact on foreign exchange. So, it is an area that isn't a block like Europe, although you get some
volatility, but not so much economic policy variability in Europe. So, it is a more challenging political/economic area
than most areas of the world, most regions of the world and we do spend more time trying to understand that, and that's
the message we're trying to deliver.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just another one on North America margin. How
should we think about the year-over-year contribution from pricing going forward after a 3Q strong $600 million
swing? Presumably, this was still impacted by, I would guess, relatively higher incentives on older model year pickups,
which should be less of a factor going forward? And then also with the heavy duties launched in 4Q, SUVs next year, is
it possible that this year-over-year swing number could continue to get larger for another couple of quarters now?
<A - Charles Stevens>: I think that in – from a general proposition perspective, Q4 year-over-year pricing in general
will feel kind of like Q3. In other words, we should have a pretty good year-over-year impact. I would say
quarter-to-quarter, a bit different story, because the seasonality and as we move into model year 2014 as you move
through that cycle, incentives historically increase. So, summary, kind of Q4 year-over-year growth, quarter-to-quarter,
probably a bit of a headwind.
Looking into 2014, I would say there's probably going to be continued price opportunity the first half of the year as we
go through the launch of the HDs and the full size SUVs. And then I think it's going to normalize a little bit second half
of the year and going forward. So, I don't think we're going to see, in 2014, the same magnitude of year-over-year price
improvement as we saw 2013 versus 2012, but I still think there's an opportunity and probably in the first half of the
year.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Chuck. And then, just last question. Can you comment on the
9.4% net income margin that you earned on your China JVs. It was a bit lower versus year ago, but obviously still very
strong. How should we think about that trending over time? Should it naturally evolve lower as the China market
matures and we see a higher mix of more affordable cars, more Chevys and Baojuns than Buicks, or could it even go in
the other direction if you're successful with Cadillac over there? And maybe just as follow-on to that, can you sort of
remind us of your aggressive plans for the Cadillac brand in China and maybe update on how the effort is going?
Thanks.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Sure. So, overall, we've been roughly flat from a China margin point of view for the last few
quarters. And it is – it's what you described, which is the business continues to grow. We get some operating leverage.
We've had some mix, starting to see early mix favorability as a result of Cadillac introduction on a localized basis,
although it's early days for that. And all of that's offsetting competitive price pressures in the marketplace. So that's sort
of a baseline equation that we would expect to see continue generally hold going forward, assuming that the market
remains reasonably stable from a growth point of view as it has been for the last little while now. So I think that overall
trend will continue.
We have talked at length about the plans for Cadillac in China, we believe the market there is very much ready for
Cadillac in a much bigger way than it's been there on an import basis. We've started manufacturing locally. We've had a
significant expansion in the dealer network over the last 12 months or 18 months, but we're still at the early stages of
really getting the volume equation ramped up and something we'll continue to work on, not just coming quarters but

Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thanks, good morning. Just a two-part question on Europe. One Dan, you mentioned you
would start to incur restructuring charges for the Bochum closure. Do you plan on excluding those from the EBIT
adjusted or will those show up in the numbers, but called out in the appendix of the future slides? And then two, can
you remind us what the savings now going forward that are tied to Bochum are? You may have already realized some
with the write-down, maybe some labor, but what the incremental opportunity for cost savings from Bochum is going
forward?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Sure. On the restructuring, we've been very consistent that we view restructuring as part of
the cost of doing business. And so that will be in our EBIT number, and as has been our practice, we will identify it and
call it out, so people can do what they want with it. But restructuring is something that carries on in this business and in
this industry, and we've reported accordingly.
In terms of the overall savings, we haven't provided specific numbers in relation to Bochum, but we have provided our
overall cost objective for getting to the breakeven plan. We've talked about the $0.5 billion of incremental fixed cost
reduction. Obviously, capacity rationalization is a meaningful element of that, along with other SG&A savings and
things that we're working on. We've demonstrated good cost progress so far this year and we expect to continue to build
on that as we get some of these other steps behind us.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator
And our last question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One last quick one on GMNA. I
didn't hear specifically called out in the cost side anything related to the marketing for the blitz of the new launches.
Was that any bit of a headwind or a non-real issue in the quarter?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah, I would say quarter-to-quarter it was relatively immaterial, I think, sequentially looking
at Q4, there is going to be a fairly significant uptick in marketing. Part of it's seasonal, relative to Major League
Baseball World Series, NFL, and part of it supporting the ongoing K2 as well as the CTS launch.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay, great. And then I realize, just on capital allocation going back to an earlier point, realize
that these are board decisions, but can you help us think about order of operations or timing at least? Because it would
seem that there has been some technical overhangs on the stock and a dividend or a buyback may be a way to stimulate
some demand. I know you called out some of the calls on the cash next year with the Series A, et cetera, but the cash
flow is strong and obviously it looks like it's going to get stronger. So just, how do we think about timing or order of
operations? Can any of those occur before there is further balance sheet simplification?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Like I said earlier, we're obviously, I think we've made a lot of good progress on the balance
sheet. We've been reinvesting significantly in the business. So we feel like we're getting into increasingly good shape
on that with the refinancing transaction in September and so on. We are watching actions of some of these shareholders
as they work their way out and as to whether there's any developments there and we obviously remain fully aware of
the desire on the part of our investor base to see incremental returns of capital. We obviously took a big step a year ago
or a bit less than a year ago with the $5.5 billion repurchase at that time, and we'll continue to monitor our opportunities
here in the near to medium term.

<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: I sit on the board, so I'll comment on this. This board understands our shareholders are
in here to get a decent return on their money. And we have a few tactical issues over the next couple of months in terms
of preferred shareholders that are exiting the business. But I think we demonstrated our philosophy, if you will, last
December when we spent $5.5 billion to buy a block of our stock that we returned to capital of shareholders. But we
understand what we're here for and one of them is to return money to our shareholders. And that will be a continuing
theme not only this quarter, but the next year and the year after.
