Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today.
This was a busy quarter and a strong start to 2014. We continued to grow our community in size and engagement, with
nearly 1.28 billion people now using Facebook each month and almost 63% visiting daily. We also reached new
milestones as a mobile company, with more than 1 billion monthly actives on mobile and almost 55% of our daily
actives only connecting on mobile.
When you look at our business performance, we've also made some good progress. Our total revenue grew 72%
year-over-year. Our advertising grew 82%, our strongest annual growth rate in nearly three years. And mobile
accounted for 59% of our advertising revenue. These results show Facebook's business is strong and growing, and
we're in a great position to continue making progress towards our mission.
This quarter we made a number of big investments in our future. We reached agreements to acquire WhatsApp and
Oculus, and we announced our new Connectivity Lab that's focused on developing technologies to expand Internet
access around the world.
These are important efforts that we believe will help us continue making progress towards our mission over the
long-term. But as this quarter shows, we're also staying focused on execution, and carefully improving our core
products and business.
Execution gives us the strength to bet on the future, and our success over the long-term depends on us serving our
community today and delivering against our current strategy.
So, with that in mind, I'd like to run through our progress this quarter towards our three big company goals: connecting
everyone; understanding the world; and building the knowledge economy.
Connecting everyone is about making Internet services available to everyone in the world, and allowing everyone to
connect with the people and things that they care about.
Our strategy for connecting everyone is based on two approaches. The first is about giving people new apps for sharing
different kinds of content with different people. Today, our apps are at different stages of maturity. Our core Facebook
app has an audience of over 1 billion people, and has become an essential sharing infrastructure for the world. We're
currently focused on building a great business around this, and our continuing revenue growth on mobile this quarter
shows our strong momentum here.
For the next set of apps like Messenger, Instagram and hopefully soon WhatsApp, the current priority is growth.
Messenger and Instagram both reached 200 million monthly actives this quarter. We believe these apps have a lot of
room to grow and will start to be important businesses in the future, but monetization isn't our near-term priority here.
And for the new apps that we're building as part of our Creative Labs effort, we're still in the very early stages of
development. We're working hard to develop the technical foundations for these services, so that we can rapidly launch
new products and then refine them based on the initial feedback from our community.
For Creative Labs projects that demonstrate a lot of value, our next priority will be to grow them to reach 100 million
people, before we start developing them into significant businesses. Now, we're pleased by the early reaction to Paper,

our first app from Creative Labs, so we expect this to be a good test case for our strategy.
The longer term part of our strategy for connecting everyone is focused on Internet.org, our effort to make affordable
basic Internet services available to the entire world. We recently reached 100 million monthly actives in India, and
through Internet.org, we're looking to build on this kind of success. We've already started to deliver results.
By partnering with mobile operators in the Philippines and Paraguay, we've doubled the number of people using mobile
data with our partners and brought almost 3 million more people onto the Internet. Our early tests and research into
new technologies such as drones and other infrastructure to connect people are promising.
And over the long-term, we also expect WhatsApp to play an important part in connecting everyone by offering a
simple, fast and reliable messaging system that could be as ubiquitous as Facebook one day. We'll have more to share
after the deal closes.
Next, let's talk about understanding the world. Understanding the world is about using Facebook to build up long-term
knowledge about the world and helping to answer questions for people that no other service can.
Next week Facebook holds our fifth F8 Conference, the main event for our developer community. We do this because
even with all the experiences we're building, we understand that there'll always be more social experiences that we can't
build. So, we want to keep serving developers better, and to help them build, grow and monetize their apps.
We've made good progress here. On mobile, app installs has been one of our best performing ad products, driving over
350 million installs to date. Over 60% of the top grossing apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play use Mobile
App Ads, which is pretty impressive performance for a product that launched in January of last year.
On desktop, games continue to be popular on our platform and over the last 12 months desktop game developers
generated more than $3 billion in payments volume on Facebook.
It's worth noting that even though our mobile and desktop products seem completely different, they're both delivering
the same value to developers; the ability to reach a large targeted audience. That's what we provide, and regardless of
the format we will continue to improve this value. We see a big opportunity to continue improving the relevancy of the
ads people see on and off Facebook, to help mobile developers better monetize their apps, and to help provide greater
reach for marketers. I look forward to sharing more details next week at F8.
Finally, let's talk about our efforts to build the knowledge economy. Building the knowledge economy is about building
out the technology platforms the world needs for the future, so everyone can use information to do their jobs better.
Advertising and the ability to reach people more broadly is one of the most important technology platforms for
achieving this, and we're investing a lot to serve four major kinds of partners: small businesses; brands; developers; and
e-commerce partners.
After introducing News Feed ads, which increased the supply of ads in our system, our recent efforts have primarily
focused on improving the relevance and quality of these ads. To do this, we've been working to improve the tools we
provide for marketers, so they have access to better targeting capabilities, simpler ad products and more useful
measurement tools.
Our approach is less about developing new products for marketers and more about improving existing ones and helping
businesses to use them efficiently. Our goal is to make our ads as interesting and valuable as the organic content that
you find on Facebook, so that more people find ads useful and businesses can engage effectively with our community
and grow.
Our most recent data shows that this approach is working well, and we continue to be really encouraged by the
feedback we're seeing from people about our ads. There's still more work to be done here, but we've shown that we can
continue to serve our community well, while also growing a healthy business. So that's my update on how we've been
executing against our strategy over the last quarter. It's been a busy quarter and a strong one.

We're proud of our progress as a company and everything that we're accomplishing today. In large part this is due to
the incredible quality of our team, and I'm very grateful for the support of everyone here at Facebook, as well as our
stockholders and partners, as we continue working to achieve our mission.
In addition to thanking our employees, I also want to thank one person in particular: David Ebersman, who is stepping
down as CFO after almost five years. David has been a great partner in building Facebook. He set the right tone about
operating efficiently. He set us up to make the long-term investments we need. And most importantly, he's built an
incredibly strong team, including Dave Wehner, who will be our next CFO. I've learned a lot from Dave, both
personally and professionally, and I'm grateful for everything he has done to help make the world more open and
connected.
Thank you. And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Thanks, Mark and hi, everyone. Before I start, I want to join Mark in thanking David for being an extraordinary partner
and friend over these past 5 years. As Mark said, he's contributed so much to our company and I've learned so much,
personally, working with him.
Great people build great teams and that's what David has done. And so, I'm also really excited to continue working with
Dave Wehner as he steps into his new role as our CFO.
We're off to an outstanding start in 2014. Our total revenues were up 72% year-over-year and our advertising revenue
growth accelerated to 82%. That's our strongest year-over-year advertising growth rate in nearly three years.
We're really pleased with these results and the level of execution in our business. The team is staying focused on each
element of our monetization strategy: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers who
advertise with us; and investing in our ad products.
Mobile continues to be a big driver for us and a big opportunity. Mobile comprised 59% of our ad revenue in the
quarter, up 6 percentage points from Q4. We continue to believe that this is because Facebook has the best mobile ad
product in the market.
We also continued to grow the number of marketers using Facebook and saw growth from existing advertisers as well.
Our growth is very broad-based coming from all types of marketers, with particular strength with SMB and direct
response. We saw strong performance this quarter from verticals such as mobile gaming, e-commerce, and
consumer-packaged goods.
I'm especially pleased with what we're seeing and hearing from clients around the world as they shift budgets to online,
to mobile, and to Facebook. One recent powerful example is Sport Chek, Canada's largest sport retailer. They recently
decided to pull their paper circulars, which their company had relied on as its primary ad vehicle for 92 years for 2
weeks and replace them completely with digital spend, a majority of which was on Facebook.
During those two weeks, national in-store sales grew 12% year-over-year and in-store sales of the items they promoted
on Facebook grew 23%. As a result, they're going to continue with their test and their goal is to transition more than
25% of their print spend to digital and Facebook in the next year.
And last week I was in Europe meeting with clients, agencies, SMBs and developers and what I heard from them was
how Facebook was becoming increasingly important in driving their businesses.
Investing to improve and expand our ad products remains a very important priority for us. Our goal is to continue to
develop new ways to help marketers reach their customers. We've done this over the last couple of years by enhancing
our targeting capabilities, simplifying our ad products, and improving our measurement tools. I'll touch on each of
these three areas.

First, targeting. Along with Facebook's reach and scale, marketers value our proprietary targeting to help them reach
the right customers and create more personalized and, therefore, more efficient and effective ad campaigns. Ten times
more marketers are now using our Custom Audiences targeting feature compared to last year.
To share just one recent example, Ben & Jerry's wanted to drive more sales from its classic flavors. They used a wide
range of our targeting capabilities, including Custom Audiences and Partner Categories, to reach premium ice cream
buyers. Their campaign reached 14 million people, roughly 90% on mobile and drove an 8.1% sales lift from those
consumers.
As more marketers use our targeting tools, our ads become more relevant for our users and drive even better results for
marketers.
Second, we're simplifying and enhancing our ad tools for the over 1 million advertisers on Facebook. The tools that
were previously available to only the biggest and most sophisticated advertisers, like Custom Audiences and Partner
Categories are now available in our self-service ad creation process. By making these tools more accessible, we believe
we can grow the number of advertisers on our platform and improve their results.
Additionally, for direct response marketers we've added more specific calls to action in our ads, including buy now or
install now buttons that greatly improve the efficacy of these ads.
Finally, we're also really pleased with the results we're seeing from our investments in measurement tools. Our online
conversion measurement tools enable our direct response advertisers to measure the impact their Facebook ad
campaigns have on online sales. And, we recently launched new offline conversion tools to measure in-store sales,
which have yielded positive initial results.
Our ongoing focus will continue to be on improving the quality, relevance and performance of our ads and
demonstrating value to marketers. We believe we still have a lot of opportunity to generate future returns by continuing
to focus in these areas.
We also have significant opportunities to develop newer products like premium video, ads on Instagram and our
recently launched ad network test. Our initial efforts show a lot of promise and we've gotten good feedback from
marketers in all of these areas. But, it's still very early and we don't expect meaningful contributions from these projects
this year.
To summarize, our ads business is performing very well. I want to take a minute to congratulate and thank our teams all
around the world and our ads engineering, product and design teams on all the progress we have made. I also want to
thank our clients, agencies, PMDs, and other partners, who work with us every day to use our platform to build
relationships with their customers to create personalized marketing at scale.
It's an exciting time for us as more marketers around the world gain conviction in the results they can achieve on
Facebook. We have a great opportunity to build the world's first platform for personalized marketing at scale. It's early
in that journey and we're going to stay focused on making the right investments in our ad business and executing
against our plan.
Thanks, everyone. And now here's David.
David A. Ebersman
Thanks, Sheryl and good afternoon, everyone.
Before I dive into the numbers, I wanted to say a few words about my decision to step down as CFO. This was a hard
decision for me because of how much I love Facebook and all the people I work with here. In particular, I can't thank
Mark and Sheryl enough for their friendship and support and for letting me be a part of their team. I'm confident that
Facebook's best days lie ahead and I'm excited about the path Mark and Sheryl are leading the company on.

My decision's a personal one based on my desire to get back into health care where I spent my entire career before
Facebook. And, after 10 years as a CFO, half of them here, I'm ready for a different role and challenge.
Right now feels like a great time for this change. The business is doing well, the foundation is solid, and in Dave
Wehner we have a terrific successor who's up to speed and ready to go. I have complete confidence in Dave and the
rest of the Finance team. Dave will formally take over for me in June and he'll take my place on the next earnings call,
though I plan to stay with the company through September to ensure a smooth transition. I also want to thank our
shareholders for your partnership and support.
Now to the quarter. Q1 was a strong quarter for us across the business. We increased our revenue growth rate,
expanded operating margins, delivered free cash flow of over $900 million, and continued to make investments to
position the company for near-term and long-term growth.
Let's start with some people metrics. The number of people using Facebook on an average day in March grew to 802
million, up 137 million from a year ago. As Mark mentioned, this daily number represents almost 63% of the 1.28
billion people who used Facebook during the month. And overall engagement remains strong.
Additionally, these stats don't include Instagram, which now has more than 200 million monthly active users, showing
the remarkable progress by the team. Two years ago this month, when the acquisition was announced, Instagram had
fewer than 22 million monthly actives.
Turning now to the financials. Q1 total revenue was $2.50 billion, up 72% versus Q1 last year, and total ad revenue
was $2.27 billion, up 82%. Ad revenue growth was strong around the world, with each of our four geographic regions
growing by over 70%.
Mobile ad revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, compared to around $377 million in Q1 last year, and notably
mobile ad revenue was up 7% sequentially, despite the seasonal benefits in Q4. Desktop ad revenue in Q1 was up 8%
compared to Q1 last year.
In Q1, the average effective price per ad displayed increased 118% year-over-year, while total ad impressions declined
17%. The decrease in ad impressions was due to factors including the continued shift towards mobile use, where people
are shown fewer ads compared to desktop.
The increase in average price per ad was primarily driven by a mix shift with more ads being shown in News Feed.
News Feed ads have significantly higher engagement, click through rates, and price per ad compared to right hand
column ads, so a higher proportion of ads appearing in News Feed drives up the overall average price per ad. The price
volume trends were pretty consistent across our four geographic regions.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $237 million, up 11% versus Q1 last year. However, the more meaningful
comparison, that better reflects the organic growth we saw in the payments business, comes from looking at payments
volume from games specifically, which was up 1% in Q1 compared to Q1 last year, down from the 8% year-over-year
growth rate we saw in Q4.
As we've discussed before, the shift to mobile is a significant headwind since our games payments revenue comes from
desktop only, where usage is flat or declining, so growing this business going forward will be challenging.
Turning to expenses, our Q1 GAAP expenses were $1.4 billion, up 32%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $1.1
billion, up 26%. Our head count increased 39% from a year ago.
Our Q1 GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 43% operating margin, and our non-GAAP operating
income was $1.4 billion, representing a 55% margin, up from 39% last year. While the margin improvement was
helped by some non-recurring items that drove up costs in Q1 last year, we're pleased that the increase in margins came
mostly from cost of revenue and G&A.
As planned, we've created efficiencies in infrastructure and administration while continuing to aggressively grow our
investment in R&D along with marketing and sales to drive future performance.

Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 40% and 36%, respectively. GAAP net income was $642 million or $0.25
per share, and non-GAAP net income was $885 million or $0.34 per share.
In Q1, we spent $363 million on CapEx and generated $922 million in free cash flow. We ended Q1 with $12.6 billion
in cash and investments.
Now, looking forward. First, I want to note that the forward-looking comments I'll share today do not reflect any
impact from the recently announced acquisitions of WhatsApp and Oculus, neither of which has closed. After the deals
close, we'll update our guidance as appropriate.
In terms of expenses, consistent with what we've said previously, we're planning that our total 2014 GAAP expenses,
including cost of revenue and stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 35% to 40%, and that non-GAAP
expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 40% to 45%.
For taxes, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP rates for the rest of 2014 to be similar to or a bit higher than our Q1 rates,
although this could vary widely depending upon our international revenue and expense mix, and other factors including
the impact from acquisitions.
We continue to anticipate our 2014 CapEx will be approximately $2 billion to 2.5 billion. We also continue to expect
shares outstanding for calculating EPS to grow from around 2.6 billion at year-end 2013 by 2% to 2.5% in 2014,
excluding the two large deals we've announced. Those deals once closed will add another 207 million shares, as well as
additional unvested RSUs that will affect our share count over the subsequent 4 years to 5 years.
Turning last to ad revenue. As you know, our year-over-year comparables will get more challenging going forward
from here because of the timing of the ramp up of News Feed ads in 2013.
As the comps become more difficult, we continue to expect that over the rest of 2014 our year-over-year ad revenue
growth rates will decline from the Q1 rate and be meaningfully lower by the end of the year.
That being said, we believe we're still in the early stages of building our ads business and we remain as optimistic as
ever about the long-term opportunity to grow revenue impressively by improving the quality and relevance of our ads
and increasing the value we bring to marketers.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year. We're very pleased with how well our ads performed, the strong marketer
interest in our ads platform, particularly on mobile, and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder
value.
Now, let's open for questions.
Q&A
Operator
We will now open the line for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from
the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Mark or Sheryl, if you can share with
us your vision of payments for Facebook, and how the company might be able to play a role in reducing the friction
that exists today when users are trying to engage in mobile e-commerce? And then the follow-up question was just
going to be, kind of, if you could share with us what inning do you think we're in, in terms of improving the relevancy
of the ads that you're showing? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On payments, our payments business has been important in supporting some of the
developer activity on Facebook, primarily games, and we continue to be interested in that.

I think it's really important to know that our advertising business is very relevant for e-commerce and that doesn't
depend on taking payments and it doesn't depend on a payment strategy, because we provide a really great opportunity
for marketers to find customers who are then going to go ahead and buy their products, both online and offline.
In terms of relevance, I think we're in really early innings. I mean, I think people can see it from their own experience.
Most people I talk to and certainly the data we have across the base of people, who use Facebook suggest that the ads
are getting more relevant, but there's a long way to go.
Our goal is that every time you open News Feed, every time you look at Facebook, you see something, whether it's
from consumers or whether it's from marketers, that really delights you, that you are genuinely happy to see. I think we
hit that more than we used to with our ads, but I think the truth is we still have a long way to go to hit that bar and that's
the bar we're striving for.
Operator
Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, just wanted to ask you a little bit more about
margins, in particular. If we look at this quarter, it looks like the incremental margins here are 78% or so. So, I was
hoping you could drill down a little more just on the drivers within cost of revenues and how you're thinking about the
sustainability of that going forward.
And is the 40% to 45% growth that you mentioned in non-GAAP OpEx, is that taking into account the acquisitions
here at all? Just sort of thinking about how you can get to that level of spend, given where you're starting the year?
Thanks.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Doug. I think Q1 is traditionally a light spending quarter
for us, because we budget with an annual cycle and often it takes some time to sort of ramp up the new program, so I
don't think it's surprising that Q1 year-over-year increase would come in a little lighter than we expect for the full year.
Additionally, there were some one-time things that benefited the quarter that kept expenses down, particularly in cost
of revenue as we continue to exit leased data centers and sort of amend our supply chain.
I think that going forward, our expectation was and remains the 40% to 45% growth, excluding the impact from the
acquisitions. So, we will update that guidance once the integration plans are clearer and we have a better sense for what
those spend patterns will look like.
In general, in terms of margins, I mean, the comments I would make are that we don't have a quarter-to-quarter target
margin that we're managing closely to. To do so, would require varying our spend patterns as revenue changes up and
down over time. And I think that's the wrong way to focus on how you spend your money in the company. Our priority
is really to try and make investments that are high quality that drive the creation of value and make the business better.
And since many of those investments take a longer period to mature, we want to be able to think about our spend
increases over a longer term horizon.
And as you can see, looking back at the last couple of years and then our plans for this year, there's been a pretty steady
rate at which we've been growing spend, particularly in R&D and marketing and sales, where we really want to focus
on making sure we're growing smartly and thoughtfully at a rate we can manage wisely and doesn't get ahead of our
ability to manage it.
On cost of revenue and G&A, what you can see in the Q1 numbers is the fruits of a lot of labor, trying to manage those
parts of the business really efficiently and free up resources to invest elsewhere.
So, I think we've always believed that Facebook has the opportunity to be a sustainably high margin business and we
continue to believe that, noting that there were some individual items that helped us in Q1.

The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you. I think for Mark, how do you think about the evolution of browser technology,
HTML5 and development tools versus native apps? If you look 2 years to 3 years out, do you think native apps could
finally become less important for many use cases? Or in other words, maybe you guys were not wrong when you tried
HTML5, you were just too early? Thank you.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. Well, timing matters a lot. So, I do think that there's nothing wrong with the
standard of HTML5 technically. I think a lot of what we see is what the main platform providers want to push as the
standard for developing on their own platforms, and what we've seen is that both Apple and Google have really favored
and made it easier to build high quality experiences in their own proprietary formats rather than the open web format.
So, while our bias for a number of reasons would have been to have really pushed on HTML5. And I don't want to
sound like we've walked away from this, because a large number of people access Facebook from the mobile web. And
I don't know if we break that out specifically, but it's quite a large number of people. So, we're continuing to develop
that, but for the foreseeable future we see the best path to continuing to deliver great experiences be by working on the
native app experiences that we have now.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations, David, on your future endeavors as well.
So, Mark, maybe a quick question for you about the way in which you think Facebook, and the various applications
Facebook is developing also, move towards a communication ecosystem longer term. A big picture question on where
the various applications go, the ones that are in the process of being acquired and the ones you're developing
organically?
And then second question, to use the baseball analogy again, as you continue to take ad impressions out of the
Facebook platform, wonder if we should think about where you get to longer term on a level of ad impressions that you
think are the perfect mix for balancing engagement and monetization, and what inning we are in that process? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Sure. I think I can probably take both of those. So, in terms of building out a whole
communication ecosystem, the way that we think about the new apps and products that we're building is that, people
want to share all kinds of different content with all kinds of different audiences, right?
So, sometimes you want to have a one-on-one conversation or text or chat or voice call, up to having a small group
conversation, to communicating – updating all your friends on something at once and sometimes there's really good
public content, whether it's news or premium video or things like that. And at the intersection of each type of content
and each audience, we think that there's a really compelling experience to be built.
And Facebook historically has focused on friends and public content. Now, with Messenger and WhatsApp, we're
taking a couple of different approaches towards more private content as well. You're going to see us do more things in
more private content, I think. That's an ecosystem that's growing incredibly quickly. And also that speaks to why
WhatsApp and Messenger are both growing independently, quickly, is because they actually serve pretty different use
cases within private sharing and private content.
In terms of our investments, I think you want to look at it as, I kind of outlined this in my remarks, but I think it's
important enough to say again. There are different stages of maturity for the different things that we're doing. So, the
Facebook app by itself is the furthest along and more than 1 billion people use it and it's not only one of the most used
apps, probably the most used app, it's also the core of our business.

Then, the second set of apps that we have are Messenger, Instagram and soon WhatsApp. And Messenger and
Instagram are each now greater than 200 million active users. I think the WhatsApp folks independently announced, I
think, it was yesterday that they just passed 500 million actives. So, these are apps that are now at a pretty big scale and
the immediate priority is going to be getting them to 1 billion people, right? So, continuing to focus on that before
focusing on monetization in the way that we have with the core Facebook app. So, that's kind of the second stage.
The third sets are the new Facebook Creative Labs apps that we're just getting started. So, things like Paper and a
number of other things that we might announce at some point. Those are even further along than even Messenger,
Instagram and WhatsApp, where it'll probably take a few years for those to even get to the stage that Instagram,
Messenger and WhatsApp are at, which by themselves are probably a few years away from being big and important
businesses for us. So, that's kind of the pipeline of things that we see and there's kind of a full ecosystem of different
ways that people want to share with different people.
In terms of ads, going to your second question, I don't actually think we have a strategy to decrease ad impressions. I
think what you're seeing and what David mentioned is, we have News Feed ads, which are higher quality and perform
better, and then we have this legacy of right hand column ads on desktop, which generally are just shown higher
volume and they perform less well per ad unit.
So, as we shift more towards News Feed, what you're seeing is the total raw number of impressions is decreasing, but
actually the amount of value that we're delivering is increasing. So, that might continue to shift as we continue to shift
towards mobile, but I think overall what we're trying to do is make it so that the individual load on a per-person basis
isn't increasing at a dramatic rate; but instead, we're driving most of the wins in user experience, advertiser performance
and our own revenue through increasing the quality, primarily around News Feed ads. And we think that there's quite a
lot to go there, as Sheryl said. We want to get to a state where the ad content is as good as the organic content and we
see that we're getting pretty close to that in a few countries, but we want to get to that everywhere.

Your next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter C. Stabler>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about engagement.
By one measure, DAU/MAU, it's at an all-time high. But no doubt you always have a body of last users. Wondering if
you could share any color on what types of algorithm or product tweaks that you've made have yielded the most return
or the greatest return in terms of re-engaging last users?
And then, secondly, just quickly, any color you could provide on your estimate of the overlap of Instagram and
Facebook users, perhaps based on the linking of those accounts? Thank you very much.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Unfortunately, I don't think I'm going to have much color on either of those. I mean,
we're constantly doing things to make it so that people can share the content that they want, that they have the tools that
they need, and that we're showing the most relevant content to people. That is always going to be the way that people
will use the service, not through some kind of trick or something that we're using to re-engage people.
One stat that I think is pretty interesting is that you would expect naturally that as the community continues to grow,
and we're getting into later and later adopters, that the percent of people who are using Facebook, who use it every day
would decrease. And I've actually predicted for a long time that eventually that will flatten out, and I've thought it
would decrease, but actually it continues to increase, much to our surprise and joy.
And now this quarter, I think we're at almost 63% of people who use Facebook in a month, will use it in a given day.
And I think, another stat that I think is actually quite interesting is we track how many people use Facebook not just
every day, so I mean one day out of – so what percent of our monthly folks used it today, but what percent of people
used it 6 days out of 7 days of the week.

And that number, for the first time in the last quarter, passed 50%. So, that's pretty crazy, if you think about it, that you
have this really big, engaged community and not only are almost 63% of people touching it in a given day and using
the service, because it's really engaging content, but we've gone through a period where more than 50% of people have
used it 6 days out of 7 days of the week, almost every single day of a week. That just speaks to, I think, just the
underlying kind of fundamental strength in the content and the work that we're doing to serve the best content to the
best people.

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: First, David, let me add my congratulations on your success. And good luck with the future
role. Mark, beyond games, do you see other categories of apps that are ramping? And do you need to see that or can
games continue to be sort of the primary driver of app install and app engagement ads?
And then, separately, on Graph Search, do you see the potential for more partnerships for Graph Search in terms of
additional data sets and distributions partners? Or is this more go-it-along?
And then, finally, maybe for Sheryl or David, can you just give us a sense on pricing trends on app install ads? Thanks.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Yes. On app installs, I actually think we see more diversity in the customers of developers
on mobile now than we saw on desktop with Canvas. So Canvas, the business, was almost entirely games. And now,
we see that a lot of it is games, but a lot of it is other kinds of folks because everyone who's building apps on mobile
needs installs and we have the number one products out there for delivering that. So, we see that happening and we feel
pretty good about that.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On pricing, we don't break out pricing by type of ad. But overall in the ecosystem, our
prices are up. As Mark said, the effective price per ad shown is driven up by more ads in News Feed and that's because
News Feed ads have significantly higher engagement and click-through rates.

The next question comes from Evan Wilson with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
<Q - Evan S. Wilson>: Hi. Thanks for the question. Just a small item, but it looks like the Asia engagement metric, the
MAU, was down sequentially, slightly. Was there something there that impacted that in Q1 or was there something
competitive there you think might be impacting that part of the business, like the big mobile messaging services?
Thanks.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: I don't know that I would read anything into that yet. We haven't identified that as a trend
that we're focused on at this point. The numbers do bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter in various regions.

of brand versus direct response. And how has that changed this quarter versus prior quarters? And what else can be said
about that split?

some hybrid of the two?
And then I know you don't give pricing by property, but just is there a way to think about the premium or premium
multiple of price that premium video ads would go for as compared to core News Feed ads? Thanks for any color on
that.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Thanks, Anthony. I'm happy to take the first part of the question. I think in the first
quarter, we delivered strong performance across all the advertiser segments that we focused on. And so, I think they're
all growing nicely.
We don't have a perfect measure for what kind of demand is brand versus DR, per se, because someone doesn't have to
input that into the system when they come in. We have lots of things we do to try and find surrogates for that and are
happy to see that using some of that data we're seeing nice growth across the various segments.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On video ads, video represents a really big opportunity really driven by consumer
behavior. Smartphones are getting better and faster, and more people have phones that can provide a great video
experience. So, you're seeing consumers do a lot more on video. There's also a lot more video going through News
Feed that consumers are putting in and that creates an opportunity for us both on the consumer side and the ad side.
We have a current product in the market. It's a click to play video ad. It's a part of a page post. You can post a video.
Those are sold both CPM and CPC and those are going really well and I think explains some of the growth we're seeing
in our ads business.
We also have been in early conversations with some clients about what would be a CPM auto-play video ad, and in
terms of the expectations for that we really want to see auto-play video ads be something that's pretty common in the
News Feed experience based on consumer usage, before we push very hard in the ads business.
So, we remain long-term very excited. We do expect that product to demand a premium product. But as I said in my
remarks, we won't see a material contribution from it this year.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: On those auto-play videos, as an average Facebook user, I've noticed them more and more
in my News Feed, and I think they're really neat. I think all my friends love watching videos of my kids play basketball.
The question I'd have for you is what have you seen internally in terms of engagement. I assume that since I'm seeing
more, other people are too, and that users like having them in. But is there any way you could quantify or maybe talk
broadly about the impact that's having on usage? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Our goal is to make News Feed as engaging as possible, and I think if you look at the
engagement we have on mobile, we're getting 20% of mobile time on Facebook in the U.S. and growing globally as
well.
I think you'd see that, that engagement's great. I'm sure your friends love seeing your kids play basketball. I think they'd
probably like to see more of those. And when and if we deliver a really great ad experience – and ads that you loved,
something you're interested in, I think you're going to like that just as much. We look forward to the growth.

you? And then there's a lot of competitors targeting that market with new products. Maybe you could outline some of
Facebook's competitive advantages in that market?
And then, one for Dave, we'll miss you. But, maybe you could talk a little bit about maybe some things Facebook could
do to offset some of the dilution from the acquisitions, if anything? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On mobile app ads, we've seen really strong adoption and this is a very nascent, but
growing market. I think people sometimes think that a lot of our mobile ad revenue is coming from this one type of ad
and our mobile ad revenue is very broad-based. We know what you see in News Feed and what we see, are ads from
brand marketers, direct response, SMBs and developers, and so we're pretty distributed there and pretty happy about
that.
I think it's not surprising that other people are entering the space. It's obviously growing. It's one that performs well. I
think we continue to be excited by the results we're seeing for marketers and developers, the results we're seeing from
consumers. And we think the fact that we've already been investing and learning and growing puts us in a great position
to continue to have a very strong product offering, even in a more competitive space.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: So, Justin, on the acquisition, the most important thing we'll do to really I'd say, justify the
dilution will be to make those acquisition successful and over time ensure that the sort of unique assets that we're
buying contribute to Facebook's success and to our cash flows over time. The business is obviously in really healthy
shape right now, in terms of the cash it's generating. And we look forward at the moment to really continuing to
prioritize where it's appropriate, investing that in the business to drive future growth.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Thank you very much. So first, David, can you talk a little bit about the ad load during the
quarter? We saw noticeable increases here in the holidays and through Q1 versus that 5% or 6% you mentioned back
on the Q3 call. Is the new ad load we are seeing sustainable, do you think, going forward?
And, second, maybe Mark or Sheryl, can you just talk a little bit about timing for monetization of Instagram? Are there
any thresholds, either in terms of users, user engagement, whatnot, before you can ramp that advertising, or advertise
on that platform? I think, David, you were talking earlier about maybe reaching 1 billion, but I think that was a general
comment? Thanks.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Yeah, thanks, Youssef. So, as Mark sort of alluded to earlier as it relates to ad load, what
we're trying to do is optimize across multiple variables that really produce the best experience for people who used the
network and help us to grow the business. And ad load is one of the variables that we look at. Of course, we also look
at things like the size of the ads, the prominence of the ads, and of course the quality of the ads.
And what we're trying to do is to continually, really tweak all of those variables and then measure what impacts we're
having on engagement, on feedback from people, on revenue, and trying to optimize, using that data and the changes
that we've made.
And I think the story there's a really good one. Things continue to go very well. Obviously, in terms of revenue, which
you see, but also in terms of engagement and in terms of feedback we get from people when we survey them, so we
think we remain in a really very strong position in that way.
I actually would not validate the assertion that you gave, that the ad load increased dramatically in the timeframe you
described, because that's not consistent in aggregate with our data. What I can say is that every person that uses
Facebook has their own experience and the experience, including the ad experience, is personalized based on the other
content we have available, based on how much they've engaged with ads we've shown in the past, et cetera.

So ideally, we'd like to personalize not just the organic content you see, but also your ad experience in a way that's
really optimized for you and your interests.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On Instagram, Instagram's a great product. I think that's why we see so much engagement
from people who are using it and the growth passing 200 million. It's also a great advertising product and there's just
tons of demand because the pictures themselves are so visually appealing and also there's so much consumer
engagement.
We're in really early days. We've seen some great results. Just to mention one, Levi's is running an ad which is
basically pictures of people wearing denim in really beautiful outdoor spaces. They targeted people 18 to 34 in the
United States, reached over 7 million people, and importantly they drove a 24 point lift in ad recall which was three
times the control group. So, I think that shows that just as people engage with the consumer pictures on Instagram,
they're going to engage with the right pictures for marketers.
That said, we're very focused on consumer growth and we move slowly and deliberately in monetization. So, we don't
see the need or the urge to ramp this as quickly as we possibly could, but really want to grow it slowly, grow it
deliberately and continue the growth on a consumer side and the great returns for marketers.

Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thanks. Appreciate the chance to ask two questions. The first one is, I wonder if there's any
way we can generalize or correlate around the growth in mobile monetization with the shift to 4G LTE, and whether
this could be a driver, as well, of improving monetization internationally, as those higher-speed networks are deployed
in new markets?
And then, secondly, regarding Nearby Friends, just wondering how you plan to tie that feature and data set into more of
a commercialized local offering for businesses, whether that's geo targeting or other related services? Thank you.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Well, a lot of what we're trying to do with Internet.org is make it so that everyone has
the cellular networks that they need to be able to get on the Internet and access basic services, which we think are
text-based communication services, whether it's things like social networks or messaging or e-mail or search, weather,
stock prices, basic stuff like that, that people use on a day-to-day basis, but don't require a huge amount of data.
We're pretty happy with the early progress that we've made. We have a multi-year initiative to work with operators
around the world to roll out a program where folks can have free basic services.
And as I mentioned before, a lot of the initial partnerships were in the Philippines and Paraguay. And what we're really
pleased with, even just a few months of work we were able to help almost 3 million people get access to data for the
first time. So, there's no doubt that going from having no access to data to having some access is a huge jump in terms
of the activity and business that we see that's available from people.
Moving towards things like LTE later on in the funnel will be helpful as we move towards richer types of content like
higher resolution photos and videos, so that will be important, especially as the mix of content that people share moves
towards richer media, but we're really focused on both and we have a huge investment as well in the Internet.org, just
making sure that everyone in the world gets connected.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On Nearby Friends, it's a great new feature, it's an optional feature we just rolled out last
week. I don't know if people had a chance to try it yet, but, rolling out slowly but it's a great product experience, one
we're excited to be able to offer. We use information like this to enhance all the services we provide, make things more
relevant, including relevant ads.

<Q - Brian W. Wieser>: Oh, hi. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, I was wondering, with regard to the
WhatsApp acquisition, I was wondering if you could update us on the status, if the current situation with Russia poses
any issues given the development team's based there?
And then, separately, I was wondering if you could talk about Nielsen and the use of OCR with respect to advertisers'
interest in using OCR tools. Do you find that, that's making a difference at the present time in terms of brands spending
money with you in general?
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On the first, their development team is located in Mountain View, not in Russia...
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: They're doing extremely well.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Yeah. They're doing really well.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: The deal hasn't closed. So, we don't have anything to share, but I'll just point you to a
blog post that Jan wrote, I think it was yesterday, announcing that they just helped connect 0.5 billion monthly actives.
They're growing very quickly. So, I think that's up from about 460 million monthlies just a couple of months ago when
we announced the deal with them in the first place.
And I think that Jan specifically called out a few countries, including Russia and Brazil and I think India as some of the
fastest growing markets for WhatsApp. So, I'd just direct you to that statement and you should go read that for more
information on how they're doing and we'll update you more when the deal closes.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On Nielsen OCR, anything that helps advertisers measure their spend is really important.
I've talked on the call a bunch about how measuring online and in-store sales really matters. It also matters to marketers
to be able to measure their spend compared to other investments they can make.
And what OCR has done, it's given advertisers and marketers comparability between TV and digital and our spend. I
think in those comparisons, we do very well. And I think that is part of the shift that's happening. And it's part of why
we see growing interest from clients.

Facebook's on pace to represent around 20% of global display advertising or non-search advertising in 2014. Do you
view that as your addressable market? And, if so, what do you see as the potential market share you guys can capture
relative to the – I think, Sheryl, you said it's 23% mobile consumption, ex-China, globally today.
And then the second question is, there's been some press recently that Facebook is looking at building peer-to-peer
money transfer services. Is that a market that you view as an opportunity? And would that fit into Messenger or
potentially a standalone app? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: We've had a payments business for a while and we continue to have one and nothing new
to announce there.
On the first question, I think our addressable market is much bigger than digital, and you see that in the trends. The big
trend that's happening is the shift from consumer time. So, last year was the very first time those lines crossed and
consumers spent more time in digital, which is mobile and desktop than they did on TV. That continues to grow, so
where we are right now is the average U.S. consumer, as an example, spends 4.5 hours per day on TV, but 5.75 hours
on digital, and that's largely being driven by mobile.

That means that as consumer time and attention shifts, we think ad budgets shift as well, particularly, if you have good
mobile ad products and you can measure results. So, we definitely believe there will be and continues to be a shift
happening.
I talked about a print shift happening with the example of Sport Chek in Canada, but we see this across the board that
marketers are looking for the highest ROI they can find, and they should be comparing us and everyone else across and
they do that not just across digital but across print, across radio, across TV, across any other vehicle they can.
I think our investments in measurement really pay off here. We say to our clients all around the world, we want to earn
your business, because we want to be the best dollar and the best minute you spend, because both their dollars and their
time are so valuable. And we want them to compare us to the other investments they could make to see who can drive
the most value to their bottom line, and that's what we're focused on, and that goes way beyond digital.
<A - Deborah Crawford>: I think we have time for one last question.

Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thanks for the questions. Just wondered if you could discuss how Facebook's
potential mobile ad network would provide additional value to advertisers than other existing mobile ad networks?
And then just a second question for David. I don't know if you could help quantify what meaningfully lower
year-over-year ad revenue growth is, or just give us a sense of how to think about it for modeling purposes? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On the ad network, we are in very early testing for mobile ad network. We do see a big
opportunity here. We think because we are people-based, we have an opportunity both to provide greater reach for
marketers and developers who are working with Facebook across other platforms, but also improve the relevance of the
ads people see both on and off Facebook. And I think that has been our core advantage and will continue to be. That
said, it's really early days, and we're in the early testing phase.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Yeah, so John, obviously the Q1 ad revenue growth here was 82% which is fantastic and a
real tribute to the team and the platform. One of the things that contributed to that growth rate is the ramp up of News
Feed ads that in Q1 of last year we were still really early in that part of the journey and so the comparison between the
state of News Feed ads in the Q1 we're reporting now and a year ago is meaningfully different.
As you'll remember from last year, News Feed ads really ramped up in the second quarter and revenue growth ramped
up as well, so that's just going to impact the comparisons in the subsequent quarters of the year.
Having said that, there's lots of things that we're focused on that'll continue to drive our ad revenue growth, including
more users and critically more marketer demand, so bringing more marketers into the system, improving our products
and tools to increase their returns and their ability to measure those returns, and generally improving the quality and
relevance and value of the ads. So, those are the things that we'll stay focused on.
Deborah Crawford
Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again.
