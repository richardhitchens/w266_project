MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Brent, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary Shedlin; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background
noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew J. Mallow
Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock. And before Larry
and Gary make their remarks, let me point out as I do in each of these calls that during the course of this call, we may
make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may
differ from these things.
And as you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results
of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. Additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
So with those formalities out of the way, let's begin the call.
Gary S. Shedlin
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present our third quarter results. Before I turn it
over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. I'll be

referencing selected pages from our earnings supplement, which has been posted on the BlackRock Investor Relations
website, and discussing primarily as adjusted results.
BlackRock delivered third quarter EPS of $3.88, up 12% compared to 2012. Operating income was $978 million, also
12% higher. Excluding the impact of fund launch costs in the year-ago quarter, operating income was up 9% on a
year-over-year basis. Non-operating results reflected a $23 million increase in the market value of our seed and
co-investments, largely driven by private equity, real estate and distressed credit and mortgage investments. Recall that
non-operating income in the second quarter of 2013 reflected a $39 million pre-tax gain relating to PennyMac's IPO.
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was impacted by a non-cash revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities based on
various UK and domestic state tax law changes, which we exclude from as adjusted results. The third quarter as
adjusted tax rate was approximately 30%, consistent with a 31% annual run rate, which remains in appropriate
intermediate term planning assumption based on what we know today.
In the third quarter, we saw approximately $25 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic
growth rate of 3%. We, again, demonstrated the consistency of our highly diversified multi-client platform, with Retail
and iShares driving our organic growth this quarter, more than offsetting the outflows we saw in our Institutional
business.
We've raised approximately $124 billion of long-term net new business over the past 12 months, representing a 4%
organic growth rate. Because 86% of these net flows were generated by our Retail and iShares channels, our organic
revenue growth exceeded asset growth as these channels have higher effective fee rates compared to the firm's overall
fee rate, this same dynamic held true in the third quarter.
As you can see on Page 10 in the supplement, third quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, up $152 million or 7% from a
year ago. Revenues were driven by base fees, excluding securities lending, which increases a function of both organic
growth and market appreciation offset by reduced securities lending revenue, reflecting ongoing softness in the
hard-to-borrow or special collateral markets. Sequentially, total base fees, which includes securities lending, declined
by 1%, driven by mix and a seasonal decline in securities lending activity.
As a function of the market volatility we've witnessed in the latter half of the second quarter, we entered the third
quarter with lower assets [indiscernible] (04:11) average AUM for the second quarter. During the second quarter, we
were also impacted by iShares outflows and a negative beta-driven mix change in markets linked to some of our higher
fee businesses. We experienced the opposite phenomenon during the third quarter with iShares inflows and positive
beta, which will benefit our base fee run rate as we enter the final quarter of the year.
Performance fees for the quarter reflected solid results in our diversified single strategy hedge fund platform. Our
performance fee eligible products belong to a broad range of asset classes and investment strategies and are normally
not dependent on a single fund or market theme. While the fourth quarter is generally our seasonally highest quarter of
the year for performance fees, recall that last year's fourth quarter included a large one-time fee related to the wind
down of the U.S. government PPIP portfolio.
Our BlackRock Solutions franchise benefited from robust activity in the third quarter. Revenues were $156 million, up
$28 million compared to 2012. Our Aladdin business, which represented 72% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the
quarter, grew 19% year-over-year, benefiting from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation, client
seeking multi-asset risk solutions and a growing client base that is progressing through multiple phases of
implementation.
Our FMA business had a very strong quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 29%, driven by advisory fees
related to completed assignments and deliverables. While our FMA business continues to benefit from ongoing
regulatory change, especially in Europe, the revenue profile of FMA will be lumpier than the Aladdin business on a
quarter-to-quarter basis.
Revenue classified as other fell sequentially, primarily driven by our decreased ownership stake in PennyMac and
lower transition management activity in the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now hold an ownership

stake of approximately 20% in PennyMac, down from 33% prior to PennyMac's IPO and our subsequent charitable
contribution.
Turning to Page 12 of the supplement. Expenses rose $50 million year-over-year, driven primarily by increased
marketing and promotion spend and revenue-related items, including compensation and direct fund expense. As we
have previously indicated, the investment in our brand may vary quarter-to-quarter but our full year 2013 investment
will be in line with 2012. Direct fund expense is largely linked to AUM levels, primarily in our index and iShares
businesses.
Adjusting for fund launch costs in the third quarter of 2012, expenses rose 5% year-over-year compared to a 7%
increase in revenue over the same period and resulted in an operating margin of 41.2%, a 50 basis point increase versus
a year ago.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value with our first priority to invest in our
business. We completed the acquisition of the Credit Suisse's ETF business in July adding $16 billion in assets under
management, extending BlackRock's footprint in Switzerland and bringing a broader range of opportunities to Swiss
investors.
In addition, while not included in the third quarter, on October 4, we completed the previously announced acquisition
of MGPA, a private equity real estate investment advisory company. This deal doubles the size of BlackRock's real
estate advisory business, extends our reach to the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions and reinforces our commitment to
offering investors access to markets worldwide. As previously noted, both transactions will not be material to our
earnings per share.
Our capital management policy remains consistent. We repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares in the
third quarter, in line with the past two quarters. As we have previously stated, in the current environment, we would
expect to maintain this level of repurchases for the remainder of the year.
Our solid financial results once again reflect the benefits of our diverse platform and strong partnership with our
clients. We saw positive inflows across all major asset classes and regions, with Retail and iShares driving growth in
our client businesses. Similar to the second quarter, the breadth of BlackRock's platform was demonstrated by 10 funds
across Retail and iShares, each generating more than $1 billion inflows.
We spoke at our Investor Day about our excitement around the global retail growth opportunity. This quarter, we saw
long-term flows of $8.3 billion in retail, driving 7% year-to-date annualized organic growth, a significant increase
compared to the 3% organic growth we saw for the full year 2012. Results were driven by many of our key themes,
including income, alternatives and outcome-oriented solutions.
U.S. retail saw long-term net inflows of $3.4 billion, with strong flows, unconstrained fixed income and alternatives.
This represents a continuation of the momentum we've witnessed in the second quarter with both our strategic income
opportunities and Global Long/Short Credit Funds, again, delivering more than $1 billion in new flows.
In the face of sizable industry outflows this quarter, BlackRock's strong investment performance, proactive client
conversations and breadth of product offerings once again drove net inflows and fixed income. On the equity side, we
saw moderate outflows. Larry will spend some time on the positive investment performance trends of our recent hires
later in his remarks, but we are still punching below our weight in equities and we have consistently recognized it will
take time to see an inflection.
International retail saw a strong long-term net inflows of $4.9 billion, representing an 18% annualized organic growth
rate. Flows were similarly driven by our global themes, including alternatives and outcome-based solutions. We
experienced strong flows into equities led by our top-performing European equity franchise, and experienced ongoing
momentum in multi-asset as clients leveraged our solutions-oriented strategies, including global allocation, managed
volatility and dynamic asset allocation. Global iShares benefited from strong industry flows in September as risk
appetite improved and once again demonstrated its leadership position. iShares remains the vehicle of choice for
investors who want to quickly and efficiently express their views in the market.

Following the macro-driven redemptions we experienced late in the second quarter, investors once again turned to
iShares to increase risk allocations, driving significant inflows. In addition, we continue to see robust secondary market
liquidity, which adds to the depth of markets for our clients. For the quarter, iShares raised $20.2 billion of long-term
net new business. Equities led the way with approximately $21 billion of net inflows, while fixed income experienced
modest redemptions. Year-to-date, iShares has accumulated nearly $45 billion of net flows, representing a 31% share
of global industry flows for the quarter and 27% year-to-date.
Our Institutional business experienced $3.3 billion of net long-term outflows globally. However, we saw a continued
momentum in defined contribution and illiquid alternatives. We saw passive outflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter,
with equity outflows more than offsetting fixed income inflows, as market uncertainty slowed institutional fundings
and re-risking strategies, and caused some clients to tactically rebalance away from passive equity.
Active flows were roughly flat for the quarter, with strong inflows into fixed income and multi-asset, offset primarily
by equity outflows. Fixed income inflows were driven by EMEA and APAC clients, while multi-asset inflows were
paced by our LifePath target-date franchise, which experienced $3 billion of net inflows, representing a 17%
annualized organic growth rate. BlackRock now manages more than $80 billion of LifePath assets which are a key
driver for our defined contribution business.
Active equity outflows were driven by both scientific and fundamental strategies and were primarily
performance-related. Barbelling remains a prominent theme with institutional clients and we saw another strong quarter
for illiquid alternatives. Year-to-date, we have now secured nearly $5 billion of commitments which will generate
future net new business as those dollars are invested.
Overall, it was a very solid quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence D. Fink
Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Gary. And thanks for joining the call. The current market environment remains
challenging. Uncertainty is high and fundamentals are taking a back seat to policy decisions. The narrative in
Washington surrounding the debt ceiling debate is reducing the confidence in investors and business leaders, leading to
a short-term focus and risk aversion. Rather than investing in new equipment or job creation, CEOs are focused on
increasing stock buybacks and dividends which does little to drive long-term economic growth.
Even with the deal to avoid a default, the damage has been done by the fact that we have had a debate questioning
whether the U.S. will pay its bills. And the impact will be a slowdown in economic growth. In the face of this market
uncertainty, BlackRock diverse platform continues to perform. We saw a $25 billion of net inflows this quarter driven
by positive flows in all major product categories in all regions of the world. The flows we're seeing today and the
stability of our platform are the result of the investments we made in the business over the past few years.
After acquiring BGI in 2009, BlackRock went through a period of integration that led many clients and consultants to
take a wait-and-see approach. Could BlackRock marry active and passive investing to create a more holistic solution
for our clients? We address these challenges of merging two organizations, performance issues in certain products and
creating a single cultural identity. During this time, we never lost our focus of – on identifying and focusing and
attending to the needs of its clients.
We rededicated ourselves to; one, the pursuit of alpha generation, levering our risk management and analytic
capabilities to better advise clients and create solutions. Two, we built our brand. And three, strategically positioned
BlackRock to address key investment themes. The combination of strong performance and risk management focus,
continued investment in our brand, a strategic focus on strengthening of client relationships positions BlackRock well
beyond 2014.
Top quartile investment performance is critical for BlackRock to be the world's premier investment manager. Several
years ago, we went through a restructuring of our active fixed income business. What was the weakness coming out of
the financial crisis is now a strength. And we are seeing the payoffs. Our strong performance track record across our

fixed income book once again drove positive flows in a challenging market for the asset class.
We saw more than $7 billion in active fixed income inflows this quarter despite outflows in the industry. Our one, our
three, and importantly, our four and three quarter year performance is meaningful in excess of our key competitors, in
total return, unconstrained and high yield and low duration products, we are all well positioned for a continuing rotation
within fixed income. BlackRock's early investment in the unconstrained fixed income space positions us to capitalize
on what I believe will be one of the defining themes of the foreseeable future, as investors reassess risk in their fixed
income portfolios and look to limit the impact of duration in a rising rate environment.
Our unconstrained bond strategy, the strategic income opportunity to fund had a third straight quarter with more than
$1 billion in net inflows driving growth in retail. On the institutional side, we are having active conversations with our
client about the diversification benefits of an unconstrained allocation, and we expect to see more momentum coming
from institutional net front. Moving to equity performance, as we discussed in the past, one critical area for investments
for BlackRock has been our U.S. fundamental equity franchise. Much of the confidence I have been making these
changes in our equity platform stems from the success we had in the rebuilding of our fixed income side.
BlackRock did see $5 billion of outflows this quarter in active equity business, while we're not satisfied with that
outflow, we are pleased with the investment performance we're seeing in some of our managers. And as Gary
suggested, that outflow really came more from international side that was more idiosyncratic than outflows that were
stemming from portfolio manager turnover. Our basic value fund is more than 450 basis points above its benchmark
and is in the fourth percentile. Our large cap core product has risen from the 76 percentile to the 35 percentile and these
funds – since these funds came under new management.
We have seen more than $2 billion in new institutional mandates in our fundamental large cap growth portfolios
through the third quarter, and an additional $1.8 billion mandate which funded earlier this month. Our commitment to
rebuilding our active equity business is just as strong as the commitment we made to rebuild our active fixed income
business, and I expect to see the same positive results and flows over time. Just as BlackRock needed to refocus on our
investment performance, we also needed to build our brand to drive growth in our retail businesses. And the
investments we made in the BlackRock and iShares brands are now delivering those results.
As we've grown and diversified the firm over time, communicating a clear message has become a critical component of
our client interaction. Over the past year, we've been reaching out aggressively to clients to educate them on the risk of
fixed income and the need to prepare more effectively for retirement, and re-linking those messages directly to
investment strategies and individual product offerings. We're seeing the benefit of those efforts in an increased traffic
to our websites, much higher brand recognition, better client dialog, more polls from clients and improved flows in
products targeted through our marketing and communication efforts.
Retail is a key focus area for BlackRock's marketing effort. As Gary mentioned earlier, our global retail business has
grown organically at a 7% annualized rate this year, more than double our 3% growth in 2012. These results are an
outcome of our continued focus on driving investment performance across the entire platform and our investment in the
BlackRock brand.
International retail was a significant growth driver raising nearly $5 billion in new flows, the most in a quarter since
2009. The success we're seeing internationally reflects our strategic plan to diversify this platform. Our active equity
franchise drove nearly $2 billion in net flows led by European equities, as nearly $3 billion inflows we saw in active
fixed income multi-asset and alternatives demonstrated the benefits of a deeper relationships we've been building
across our global client base.
Outcome-oriented investing is another driver for retail. This is a high-growth market where BlackRock has a unique
ability to package active and passive strategies backed by BlackRock Solutions' risk management and analytical
capabilities. No other firm has that ability to put those three components together on a outcome-oriented investing
platform.
We launched our model portfolio initiative last year and now have more than 8,000 live subscriptions. We've seen
strong client appetite for our package solutions with nearly $2.7 billion in combined flows this quarter across our two

flagship strategies, our Multi-Asset Income and our Global Allocation product.
In addition to driving growth in retail, we continue to be focused on positioning for the long-term secular trends in the
ETF market. Clients use iShares as an efficient and transparent portfolio of construction tool, to move quickly in and
out of investment exposures and increasingly as buy-and-hold vehicles to build core exposures.
We see liquidity-oriented investors turn to iShares as a preferred vehicle when they want to increase market exposures
as they did in mid-September, and when they want to reduce exposures as they did at the end of the second quarter.
Given the volatility on the liquid side of the product set and the seasonal trends we've seen over time, we tend to look at
growth in iShares in a rolling 12-month basis. In the last 12 months, iShares has seen more than $80 billion of inflows
driving organic growth of 11%, consistent with our long-term expectations.
As we further penetrate the buy-and-hold segment both through the Core Series and our strategic partnership with
Fidelity, we expect more stable quarterly flow patterns. The iShares Core Series has delivered positive flows in every
quarter since its launch date, including more than $9 billion of net flows year-to-date and more than $13 billion of
flows since inception, representing organic growth of 20%.
And on the Fidelity platform, we've seen iShares growth at an annualized organic rate of 13%, also led by our Core
Series.
International expansion will also serve to increase diversification. iShares brought in more than $5 billion of flows in
Europe this quarter and we increased our presence in the market following the closure of Credit Suisse ETF platform
acquisition in July.
BlackRock continues to invest in the ETF space to drive adoption and the new usage by broadening the client base
using ETFs and launching innovative products. In the quarter, we saw our first bank client purchase of iShares bonds
and we launched [ph] NEAR (22:24), a short duration bond fund that is well positioned for the current fixed income
environment, to talk about performance, investing in our brand and how our investments and key themes position
BlackRock to deliver value.
The key to growth is translating that progress into strengthening our relationships with our clients. The depth and
richness of conversations that BlackRock is having with clients have progressed substantially in the last couple of
years. I've seen that in my own discussion with clients and I hear the same from my colleagues across the firm
worldwide.
The BlackRock Investment Institute or BII is an example of all that we are building, coming together. BII sits at the
center of our 1,600 portfolio managers, analysts and researchers worldwide. The institute was created with a single goal
in mind to harness the best insight from our global investment team and leverage that insight through a robust dialog
across the entire BlackRock platform to drive performance. And I do believe our performance results recently speak
loudly about the value of this institute.
With the creation of BII, not only our investment team is better equipped to produce alpha, but BlackRock is also
positioned to identify market themes and share our investor thoughts and ideas with our clients. As an example, we
hosted a call earlier this month on the fiscal challenges in Washington, which was led by several of our top strategists
and portfolio managers and was attended by more than 1,000 clients.
Additionally, in the last few weeks, we had strong attendance and positive reactions at client events in Asia, in Brazil
and in Washington. Our reputation for problem solving continues to build as more and more people turn to us for
insight and counsel. We appreciate the perspective at BlackRock and our platform affords of them in helping them
solve these challenging financial problems.
What BlackRock brings to the table is resonating with clients. Our products are on more retail platforms and buy lists
than ever before, and we're seeing that positioning drive growth. In bringing together our retail and iShares sales force,
we're having more holistic conversations with FAAs and RIAs, and you're seeing that manifest and flows in these
businesses.

I met with a number of institutional clients over the last few months: pension funds, consultants, central banks,
sovereign wealth funds and the reception is better than I've ever seen. The identity we're building and the clarity of
message that we're delivering is differentiating BlackRock's value proposition.
As the uncertainty in Washington impact institutional client asset allocation decision in late September, we saw passive
equity outflows for the first time since 2008, driven by profit taking in equities, rebalancing and a reduction in risk.
However, we benefited on the other side of that reallocation with nearly $7 billion of net flows into fixed income,
largely driven by international financial institutions turning to BlackRock for domestic credit exposure and more than
$4 billion in new money from official institutions across active and passive strategies.
We also saw strong BlackRock Solutions results. BRS continues to be a key differentiator for us in clients seeking risk
management solutions.
Our financial market advisory business is benefiting from the ongoing regulatory change, particularly in Europe, and
we continue to have robust dialogs regarding the benefits of our Aladdin risk management platform. We are close to
signing one of our largest ever in Aladdin assignments.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend a minute addressing the regulatory process. Last month, the Treasury's Office of
Financial Research released its study for the FSOC on asset managers. As requested, we will submit a letter to the SEC
detailing our views on the report by November 1.
We think the study reinforce some of the important fundamental points in which we wholeheartedly agree. The report
stated first, asset managers are agents, they're not principals. Asset managers act as fiduciaries on behalf of our clients.
Second, asset managers are different from banks and insurance companies. Asset managers don't make deposits. Asset
managers are not wholesale-funded, and asset managers don't benefit from any government guarantees and we aren't
levered in any material way.
The study also raises a number of potential risks related to specific investment products or investment practices. We
agree with some of those additional regulations and we agree that it is worth to look at this, as we have advocated
reforms to address many of these risks.
However, since these risks are unrelated to the size of asset managers, we believe regulation targeted at specific
products and practices will be more effective than company-level regulation or just a few firms.
Looking ahead, BlackRock will continue to see the benefits of the investments we've made; in our performance, in our
brand, in our strategy and our relationships with our clients. The positive impact that these investments have delivered
make me more confident that we're on the right path. As Gary noted, investing in our business where we see
opportunity for organic growth is a key objective and I see substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock on the
horizon.
When I talk to clients, I see them looking at BlackRock differently than they have in the past. They see us as a partner,
as a firm that can deliver solutions unlike anyone else in the industry. Our ability to combine active and passive
solutions on a single platform, backed by a risk management and analytical capabilities or BlackRock Solution business
position us to take our client dialog to a higher level. And this is a higher level both in institutional, and now in the
retail side.
We're seeing those conversations drive an acceleration in our business and I expect to see that acceleration continue.
Finally, I would like to thank all of our employees for the hard work and contribution to BlackRock. We look forward
to the continuing – to partner with our clients around the world to deliver them all that BlackRock has to offer.
With that, I'll open it up for questions.

sir.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Hey, Larry. How are you?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I'm good.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: So you mentioned model portfolios, I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper there because that's
something we've heard a lot about on our end. So can you help us size this in your mind and how important building
model portfolios with advisors are in terms of getting increased penetration for iShares in the channel?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I have Rob Kapito here. Rob, do you want to come over and answer, because Rob is
spending a great deal of time working with these channels, especially the Morgan Stanley channel related to models
and how that impacts our active and our iShares.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So clients are now looking for a more holistic solution to their clients' portfolios, and they're
looking for more asset allocation. And we are finding that clients have both active and passive in their portfolios and
what they're requiring now is for us to build model portfolios that they could use our products in them or use other
products in them. So iShares is certainly a significant part of that asset allocation. So we think by providing these
models to the advisors that that will stimulate their use of our products in their portfolios and that should help the
growth of iShares as well as our other passive and active portfolios.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Matt, one other thing that we're trying to do and we're not there yet is making sure that we –
can we use some of the Aladdin capabilities on the retail side too. So that's something we are studying, we are in dialog
with many different distribution platforms. And so the first component of really adding value to our – to the retail side
is this model portfolios which we're developing, but also can there be some analytical support in addition.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe this one's a little bit more for Gary, but you mentioned
the fee rates in some of the iShares products and how there's a little bit of a tailwind now at your back given what we've
seen in the fourth quarter. It's been a lot of focus from investors on EEM. So I'm hoping you can give us a little bit of –
maybe help us size a little bit better about the impact on fee rate and sec lending fees from the shift that you saw during
the third quarter and now into the fourth quarter, if there's anything incremental you can give us?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Well, Matt, I'd make the following observations, I mean, I think as we enter the third quarter
we saw really three different dynamics that basically created a little bit of headwinds for us as we came into the quarter.
One obviously, as I mentioned was that our spot assets under management at the end of the second quarter basically
ended up being below the average for the second quarter, and that obviously was one element.
Two, as we saw some clear outflows in iShares, particularly around EEM in the latter part of the second quarter as we
mentioned. And the third element was overall data mix, which I think is very important where we basically saw
significantly worst beta performance in markets like the emerging markets, natural resources, the world index which
obviously is relevant because we have some of our higher fee products in those markets.
As it relates to the third quarter as we basically get through the third quarter, we basically saw all of those trends
reverse. So we basically end up actually having a spot AUM at the end of the third quarter as you can see in the tables,
about 3% higher than our average for the quarter. We obviously benefited from strong inflows in iShares in September
at the latter part of the quarter, as you know some of that was driven by EEM. And then finally, we actually saw a beta
improvement in those markets that are our higher fee products, completely opposite of what we saw in the second
quarter. So that all sets us up well to basically enter the fourth quarter with a better run rate.
On the other hand, on securities lending, as you mentioned, which as you know is part of our base fee line, we did see
meaningful compression in spreads. And so while we saw our average on-loan balances go up roughly by about 7%

year-over-year, we did see significant spread compression primarily around the liability spreads where we saw those
spreads declined a little over 30%, and I would say that that's obviously created a drag.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Can I – let me just add one more thing, Gary, on that. So sec lending is a result of need for
people to borrow stock, whether it's a hedge fund or are people – and generally you see a lot of activity around mergers
and some type of corporate event. And we all know the merger market, corporate event market has been rather low
compared to other years, and hedge fund behavior has predominantly been more of a de-risking type of strategy this
year as evident of what our hedge results relative to the S&P.
And so the sec lending liability spreads have come down quite a bit. And whether this is a seasonal issue or a secular
issue, we'll find out. But unquestionably, sec lending volumes are down quite a bit in terms of the fees.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So Matt, just to finalize on that, I would just basically see that, as Larry said, that's driven
primarily by the special collateral market. And I would say that unless we see a meaningful change in the conviction of
hedge funds around their trading activity, change in leverage or a change in basically the M&A environment, I don't
think we would expect to see a major change in that in the coming quarter.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Okay, great. And then I'll just – one quick follow up for me. Just on the OFR report, Larry you
mentioned it and I know there's a lot still to be determined there. But just can you give us a sense for what your
conversations have been with the regulators kind of coming into that, going out of that. Any steps you've already taken
to satisfy any requirements from them or anything else you can give us incremental will be helpful.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, A) we had no conversation with any of the regulators prior to the publication. That
would have been considered lobbying under Dodd-Frank, and so we did not have any dialog and we read the results
simultaneous with everyone else. We are now with the publication. We are in dialog with the different regulators, the
different participants in the FSOC. And all I could say is the conversations are good, they're robust. Our letter will most
probably be public when we submit it in November 1. But it's just a process, and we are very comfortable with the
dialogs and the process that the regulators are putting forth.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Okay, thanks very much, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Ken.
<Q - Alex Kigel>: Hi. This is actually Alex Kigel in for Ken. Ken apologize as he's not able to join us today. We
basically just wanted to know about your fixed income business. Seems like June was in part an inflection point for the
fixed income investors. What are your thoughts about 3Q sales as an indication of fixed income investor behavior as we
continue to see rates potentially move higher at some point? Can we look at BlackRock's solid fixed income sales for
the third quarter as an indication of your resilience of the fixed income franchise as we see potentially rates start to
rise?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, A) I think that activity in Washington is going to probably mute the fixed income rate
rise for some time. So I'm just going to – I disagree with your proposition right off the bat. I think we're in a lower rate
environment than a lot of people suggest today. And I do believe – as I said, I do believe the behavior in Washington is
dragging our economy down. And I actually believe the Federal Reserve is probably more reserved in terms of any
movement related to tapering, and they're going to be a lot more – they're going to probably pause and waiting to see if
indeed the economy is impacted by Washington's behavior.
It is our view that we are well positioned, as I said – we are very well positioned in fixed income because of
performance. We are very well positioned because our position in unconstrained fixed income, and we are well

positioned because of our solid performance in credit and high yield.
So you put all those things together, if there is going to be flows, if there's rotation, I think we're very well positioned
for that. And as we saw in the third quarter, we did see people look to us as – in terms of adding fixed income
exposures. And I would say very clearly, the dialog we're having with clients related to fixed income are more active
than they have been in years for us. And so if the dialog we're having with clients worldwide institutionally retail, if
that's an indicator of forward growth, then I think we're going to be – we're going to have consistent growth in the
future.
<Q - Alex Kigel>: Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up, can you please update on the progress you feel you're
making in pitching fixed income ETFs to institutional investors, i.e., particularly banks and financial institutions and as
well as institutional investors and actively managed short-term fixed income products?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: We continue to have, as they said – when I'm talking about dialog in fixed income, it does
translate also to dialog in iShares bond. It's not just the active fixed income on constrained side. As I said in my
prepared remarks, iShares bonds, we have our first bank client. We have many conversations going on now and our
new ETF products, the [ph] NEAR (39:44) which is a low duration type of product, for those who are frightened of the
longer duration products. I think – as I said, we have constant dialog, whether they are in ETFs – EFT bonds and/or our
active products.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. How are you doing?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So a quick question, maybe, hoping you could give some color on how you guys have
positioned the money funds given, everything going on a potential U.S. default. And not only, maybe avoiding
technical issues that could arise but also maybe some of the knock-on effects that could come about as well?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, let me just state overall. We have dozens of teams working on contingent plans
throughout the organization. Our job is to be a fiduciary and our job is to focus on even the unanticipated risk
associated with any default. So beyond our money market plans though, I think it will be incorrect to think that that's all
we're focusing on related to default. There are many – from the municipal bond market to collateral management of
swaps to working with the custodians. You have to understand, the rating agencies, even if only one treasury bond
misses a coupon payment, definitionally, the entire sector then is considered a defaulted security.
And so we have to be prepared for all the contingencies, whether they're T-bills or any other bond, U.S. bond
instrument. And so, I think we're doing a very good job without getting in any of the details, to making sure that we're
anticipating those unanticipated problems associated with this type of event. As we all know, when you think back
about the Lehman Brothers result, everybody thought that Lehman Brothers was it. But then, when the Reserve Fund
had that Lehman Brothers exposure, that's when I believe that we really fell off a cliff five years ago.
And so our job is to having these task teams working towards all of the unanticipated possibilities that would occur in
terms of collateral management, in terms of clearing, in terms of what is considered good collateral and bad collateral.
So in addition to our money market funds, where we're obviously very focused on, we're focused across all different of
our platforms.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for that color. And then, a question on the regulation. You had mentioned that
you guys have started up a really active dialogue with the regulators here on the back of this OFR report. Just kind of
curious, there's one thing that I'm trying to struggle to get my head around is, if there is some kind of SIFI designation
for a large asset manager, what – how does that manifest itself, like what does it mean? Does it just mean enhanced
supervision? Does it mean capital? Do you – in your dialogues, do you have any sense of that or can you give us any
color around that...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: No. But let me just step back for a second. I think you're aware we have capital set aside for
operational risk. That was the condition we had with our UK and U.S. regulators. So unlike many other asset managers,
we are already in that position. We are already regulated because of PNC's 20% ownership with us by the Federal
Reserve. We are regulated by the comptroller of the currency because of our bank trust division that we bought when
we acquired – when we bought BGI.
So we have – we're a firm that is very heavily regulated across region and across all the different regulators. So your
question is a good question, but I can't answer it. But I can say we have regulatory oversight buy many of those
regulators that other firms if they were SIFI do not at this present time. And it's a good question, what does that mean
because the OFR did state we're not a bank or a fiduciary or an agent. OFR stated that these are not our assets. We're
not leveraged. So I honestly don't know what it would mean if they designated a bunch of firms as SIFIs.
That's what I – and that's why my comment was very specific-related to one of the ways that we've read into the OFR is
that maybe they're going to regulate specific products like money market funds. But they may begin some type of
supervision over let's say all types of product that have some X amount of leverage. So that would incorporate leverage
type of hedge funds and other types of products like that.
So we're not – this is too early in the dialogue, too early I believe in their regulatory reviews of what they're going to
do. But I think the OFR report was a very fair, in my mind, a very just report about what asset managers are and has
justly cited some risks associated with some of the types of businesses that asset managers are in. And so we are
working alongside with regulators and responding to their questions as best we can.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: That's helpful color. Thanks, Larry.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Hey, Larry, maybe first on flows. You gave a lot of detail and it seems
like maybe current quarter there's been some different trends than what we've seen kind of year-to-date. If I look at just
the disclosure that you guys give, I assure as retail you've been gaining some momentum. Institutional has been more
subdued and you guys have talked about that being a little bit more mature. But when I look at iShares, and I look at
say $45 billion of flows year-to-date, if you segmented that into sort of the retail population or the retail channel versus
the institutional, where is that kind of breaking up? And particularly in terms of – because if I look at your retail equity
flows they've been more subdued, but that's more on the active side. But it seems like the momentum is still there. So I
just wanted to get some color on the iShares' penetration in the two channels and how that would shift the flows in
retail versus institutional.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Let me give this to Rob because Rob is working very closely with the whole team.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yes. So basically, we have been focused on a few areas of iShares penetration. The first is
still in the education mode. So there are a lot of institutional clients that are first learning how to use iShares in their
portfolios for liquidity reasons and for access to markets before they actually find an active manager to manage those
assets. They also are looking for asset allocation from the iShares. And that's primarily on the institutional side. And we
have very good penetration there but it's a process that's really just at the early stages. So if you think that iShares has

actually grown already, we think that it's just the early stages of the growth of iShares institutionally.
On the retail side, again, it's a larger education process but a lot of the [ph] FAs (47:31) who manage these particular
portfolios are using iShares more and more in their asset allocation models that I talked about before. And we are very
focused on what we call are core series which goes directly at what we think retail clients are looking for and already
this year, we have raised $9 billion in the core series. And these are more of the buy and hold type of retail investors
which is a segment that we have begun to spend a lot of time focusing on.
The other thing is that since I mentioned to you that we believe that clients have both active and passive strategies in
their portfolios, we have combined our sales forces and we will now have the largest sales force of any asset manager
going out and educating both the institutional and the retail advisors on how to use iShares.
And then lastly, we're building up our distribution because being in the iShares business or the ETF business, it's really
capturing the flag and providing the largest funds that have the transparency and the liquidity. And of course, you
recognized some of the partnerships that we have established, one most recently being with Fidelity. And we're seeing
really good results early on from that relationship, and we have several other relationships as well.
So, we are seeing continued growth in iShares, continued ideas for the use of iShares. And specifically because we're
going into markets where a lot of liquidity concerns are emerging, certainly, iShares will help in providing liquidity in
the markets where there may not be as much liquidity as in the past.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a follow up. Gary, you gave some helpful
color just on the fee rate and how to frame the outlook. If I combine that with AUM up around 6% in the quarter, going
into the fourth quarter it seems like it's setting up for some decent operating leverage. Anything on the expense side
that's more seasonal that would offset that or it is just, seasonally, you're going to have more momentum heading into
the fourth quarter, just want to make sure there is nothing else that we should be thinking about?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Yes. I think, frankly, on – well, I mean, we've already talked a lot about compensation on the
variable side and direct fund expense, which we've talked about, I think if you look at the, obviously, performance fees
will drive relative changes in compensation levels. But beyond that, on the G&A spend, I would say that if you
compare kind of the second and the third quarter sequentially you saw a little bit of a dip in the third quarter based on
marketing spend going down, which is really all of the difference. And I think as we've been fairly consistent in our
statements, that marketing spend is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. We would naturally see probably a lift up in the
fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But beyond that, in G&A, I think with the exception of that, I think the run rate
is pretty well established.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello, Bill.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Hi, guys. Thanks for your entire comments this quarter, very much appreciated. In terms of
my questions, on the Core Series having just phenomenal success that you highlight some very good organic growth.
Just sort of curious, as that portfolio builds, would there be any natural internal pricing pressure for the remainder of the
business to maybe reset pricing lower, just given will it likely be a pickup of liquidity in the Core Series?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: I don't think so. I think this is just another leg to stand on here where there are specific clients
and we're looking at a segment that's called the buy-and-hold segment. And that typically has lower fees than those that
look for more trading. And we're seeing both, I mean, it's pretty much equally spread. So it's really different segments
of the markets and this is actually a new segment for us, so I don't really think it impacts the other fee segments in the
iShares business.

Page 13 of 15
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah. Bill, I would add one more thing to that. If you think about the manner in which
investors buy the buy-and-hold in the Core Series, these are much stickier assets, so you're going to have much greater
dollar amount and still have a much lower amount of liquidity in transactions because of the nature of the investor. So
unless we saw a mixed change of investors on the Core Series, which would then lead you to think maybe there would
be some cannibalization of the other ones, I don't – we're not seen any evidence of a migration from that. I would say
that the investors are looking for more liquidity into the Core Series.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow up. You didn't even talk about too much this quarter,
I'm sort of curious, maybe an update of demand in positioning in the scientific portfolio?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Gosh, our performance is really good and we are having more dialog, but we have not seen
any real pickup in demand in that one area. But we do have, in one of the scientific areas, is our fixed income global
opportunity fund, which we closed mid-year, and there's a possibility we will reopen it. It's been a very, very successful
fixed income hedge fund and we will probably think about opening it next year. And that had about $400 million of this
quarter in terms of growth. But it was a scientific equity where we saw that one outflow internationally. And that was
just one client looking to move out of that asset category.
So no, I'm disappointed that we're not seeing more opportunities because we really do have a great track record in that
area. And it's an asset category that is going to really just take more time to have the investors come back into the
platform. And keep in mind, I think investors are now using more and more beta products instead of scientific, and
they're using beta as alpha. And I think that's one of the outflow of interchanges in mix and the mix and style that,
maybe five, six, seven years ago, people are using quant strategies. And today, they're just – and more and more of
those investors are going to just beta strategies, but actively managing that beta strategy.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for taking both of my questions.

Your final question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Marc.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Great. Thanks. Hey, everybody. Larry, on the fixed income active inflows, can you give just a
little more color on, do you think what you saw this quarter was a function of more manager replacement and manager
sort of rotation amongst the competition? Or is this sort of more of a rethinking going on given sort of the outlook for
rates from institutional investors?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: So on the institutional side, I don't think it was – I think it was – I think some of it was just –
I don't know if it was a rotation out of all other fixed income managers. I think it was more just the clients – these
institutional clients were just generating more and more cash because of their operations. And we're winning these new
assignments as they generate more balance sheet because of our performance and our long-term relationship. Some of
these clients we won are existing clients with other products, so they did some form of RFPs. And because of our
performance and our position, we won. On the retail side, I do believe some of it is rotation into BlackRock and I
believe it's just the beginning, but it's – very strongly.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Okay, helpful. And then maybe this is a question for Rob on the alternative business. I'm
particularly interested on outside the U.S. just in terms of it looks like, this quarter, you saw an uptick in inflows and
alternatives first quarter [indiscernible] (56:20) that you've seen inflows there. Maybe you could give us an update on
sort of the retail build-out of alternatives and sort of what you expect for that business?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So we're very bullish on providing alternative investments to the retail investor. And it's all
been about providing the appropriate wrapper in order for the retail investors to get involved in that area. So we have
the alternative investments. And as you know, for a period of time, people have been separating alpha and beta and

getting their beta from passive and iShares, and their alpha from more alternative investments. And we've had those
products and have been able to do that allocation for institutional clients. And what held us up on retail is providing the
wrapper for them.
Now within the 40 Act companies in the U.S. and also in outside the U.S., we have the wrappers and have been very
successful in finding investors to go into those. [ph] And fortunately (57:25), we have track records in those products,
as well, that are long term. So it's pretty – I think it's going to be pretty exciting to watch, especially in the long/short
credit where we have significant expertise and track records. And in this particular environment, that gives people a lot
more opportunity for yield, which is what they're looking for. So this will help us provide the retail investor with the
same alpha/beta separation as we're doing the institutional, and I would look for significant increased sales in those
particular areas because it make sense for the client.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I would add one other thing, Marc, our single strategy hedge funds have done quite well in
terms of performance. And our objective, just like building our brand in retail, we are aggressively trying to build our
brand in alternative space too. And that's going to be an important component of our future growth that we identified,
not just as a passive manager in an active equity and fixed income, but we're identified as a strong solution for
alternative needs. And importantly, we have a very big forward calendar in terms of commitments in our illiquid
products. So we're seeing more and more dialog with our investors in the alternative space. Rob talked about the retail
side, but the institutional side is quite robust, too.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Yes. I was just going to ask along those lines. I know the pipeline is something you guys
don't necessarily disclose, but could you give maybe some color on sort of what the composition of the pipeline would
look like across the firm?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I just got kicked by my General Counsel. We've determined that it's just – we don't talk
about that forward – or about our forward calendar anymore or forward commitment, but we're fine. But on the – I'll
leave it at that, I'm being kicked again.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Okay, that's enough kicking. We'll leave it there. Thanks.

Laurence D. Fink
Yes, I'm going to the hospital to fix my bruised legs now. I just want to thank everybody for the commitment they have.
This is a truly differentiated quarter for us. I'm very happy with the results especially with all the debates that are going
on in Washington.
And as I said in my formal comments, I think we're very well-positioned due to the platform that is unparalleled in
terms of active/passive platforms with our overlay of risk management and that to continue to drive these unique
dialogs that we have with our clients. And I look forward to talking to everybody after the fourth quarter. And
hopefully everyone has a very good end of the year.
