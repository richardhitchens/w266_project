Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are incredibly pleased to report an
extraordinary quarter, with $54.5 billion in revenue and new records for iPhone and iPad sales. No technology
company has ever reported these kind of results.
Apple is in one of the most prolific periods of innovation and new products in its history. Just in the last few months,
we've introduced new products in every category that we make. Each one of these reflects our dedication to making the
very best products in the world. At Apple we think about the smallest details, and we're unwilling to cut corners in
delivering the best customer experience in the world. This relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the
reason our customers choose to buy our products, and this will always be the driving force behind Apple.
Apple today is over 80,000 people strong and we are one team working together to surprise and delight our customers.
Part of my job is to preserve our culture and drive it forward so we remain the world's most innovative company.
People join Apple to do the very best work of their lives, and there's no greater reward than seeing how customers love
to use our products. We continue to believe that our fundamentals, our remarkable people, our clear and focused
strategy, our new product pipeline, our booming ecosystem and more than 400 Apple retail stores will serve us well in
the coming months and years ahead.
Tomorrow marks the anniversary of a revolution. On January 24, 1984, Steve introduced the first Macintosh right here
at a shareholder meeting in Cupertino. On the evening news that night, they said it was supposed to be one of the
easiest computers to use and, thanks to the new mouse, you hardly had to touch the keyboard. We've come a long way
since 1984, but we rely on the same spirit and drive that brought the original Mac and other revolutionary products like
the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad into the world.
You're going to hear a lot of impressive numbers during this call, but they are not the only way that we measure success
at Apple. The most important thing to us is that our customers love our products, not just buy them, but love them.
Everyone here is laser focused on creating an unprecedented customer experience. We've now sold well over half a
billion iOS devices, including a staggering ten per second last quarter alone. We couldn't have achieved these
milestones without the very best products in the world and unmatched execution by our engineering, operations and
sales teams to deliver so many innovative and beautifully designed products. It's simply phenomenal.
Everyone at Apple has their eyes on the future, a future driven by the incredible hard work and dedication by the most
talented and creative team on earth who all share a common purpose of continuing to create the world's best products
and, in doing so, enrich the lives of our customers.
Today we are proud to share with you our latest results. Peter will review the highlights of our Q1 earnings and I'll be
back for the Q&A. Peter?
Peter Oppenheimer
Thanks, Tim. We're very pleased to report the results of Apple's first fiscal quarter. We established new all-time
quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales, significantly broadened our ecosystem and generated Apple's highest
quarterly revenue and net income ever. Revenue for the quarter was $54.5 billion, compared to $46.3 billion in the
year-ago quarter, an increase of $8.2 billion year-over-year.
As a reminder, our first quarter this fiscal year spanned 13 weeks, whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th
week. As such, average weekly revenue was $4.2 billion in the current year quarter, compared to $3.3 billion in the
year-ago quarter, an increase of 27%.
The strong year-over-year growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad and iTune sales. Operating margin was $17.2
billion, representing 31.6% of revenue. Net income was a record $13.1 billion, just ahead of the amount generated in
last year's 14 week quarter and translated to diluted earnings per share of $13.81.
Beginning this fiscal year, we are reorganizing the presentation of our results to provide greater transparency. First, we
have established a new operating segment of Greater China, given the very significant contribution of that region to our

overall business. We define Greater China to include Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Second, for segment reporting purposes, we are allocating certain manufacturing costs and variances, including costs
related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, to our operating segments instead of including these
expenditures in corporate expenses as we've done in the past. We've recast our operating income for each quarter in
fiscal 2011 and 2012 to reflect this change and have provided a reconciliation on Apple.com/investor. These changes
have no impact on overall reported operating income.
And third, we have realigned the presentation of product information in our summary data schedule to provide greater
visibility to revenue by product category. Under this new format, revenue from iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod sales is
presented exclusive of related service and accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand-alone Apple and
third-party software and services is presented as a single line item, and revenue from all Apple and third-party
accessory sales is presented as a single line item. We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue
sources and also provides greater transparency into our results.
As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones
compared to 37 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones. This represents a rate of almost
3.7 million iPhones per week in the current year quarter, compared to 2.6 million per week in the year-ago quarter.
That's an average increase of 39% per week, consistent with IDC's latest published forecast for the global smartphone
market in the December quarter. And on a sequential basis, iPhone sales grew 78% in the September – over the
September quarter's results. That's over 3.5 times IDC's latest published projection for sequential growth of the overall
market resulting in iPhone market share growth.
We experienced strong iPhone growth in each of our geographic segments, most notably Greater China, where iPhone
sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the U.S., Kantar Worldpanel ComTech estimates that iPhone share of
smartphone sales increased from 45% in the year-ago quarter to over 51% in the current-year quarter.
iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5, which we're extremely proud to have launched in
100 countries by the end of December, resulting in the fastest iPhone roll out ever. We ended the quarter with about
10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.5 million iPhones, and ended the quarter
within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
While other mobile devices and operating systems face increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user
experiences, iPhone and iOS continue to deliver an exceptional experience that people love. They also provide a secure
and trusted ecosystem that IT departments require.
iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government
agencies are issuing iPhones by the thousands as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Transportation
Security Administration.
We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board, from companies replacing existing
smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman
Marcus, Skanska and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give
workers access to essential corporate data.
Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter, compared to 15.4 million in the year-ago
quarter. That translates to over 1.7 million iPads per week in the current year quarter, compared to 1.1 million per week
in the year-ago quarter, an average increase of 60% per week, ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 56% growth
for the tablet market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster performance and spectacular
Retina display, and the iPad mini has been a tremendous hit, offering the full iPad experience in an incredible design
that you can hold in one hand.
In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and
government agencies, transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura

Securities and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPads to enable employees to better service customers and work securely
with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays' roll out of over 8,000 iPads has generated tremendous
employee engagement and feedback, making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclays' history.
State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, county inspectors and
law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. In state legislatures in
Virginia, Texas and West Virginia are all using iPads to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and
information.
Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of a local government workflow solution
in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch tax authority
and the Dutch court system. We began and ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That
left us below our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
Turning to Mac, we sold 4.1 million units in the quarter, compared to 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. That's an
average of about 312,000 Macs per week in the current year quarter, compared to 371,000 per week in the year-ago
quarter, a decline of 16%. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 6% during the December
quarter.
We introduced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina display as well as our stunning new iMacs in October. As we
projected a quarter ago, we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs, and were only able to ship
them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent
those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory on a
look-forward basis, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.
Moving to iPod, we sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the year-ago quarter. IPod Touch was a
popular item in the holiday season and continued to account for over half of all iPods sold during the December
quarter. iPods share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the December quarter, based on the latest data
published by NPD and iPod continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest
data published by GfK.
iTunes generated record results with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. We established new all-time quarterly
records for revenue from music, from movies and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our ecosystem
during the quarter, adding iTunes music stores in 56 countries, including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That
brings us to a total of 119 countries where customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download.
The App Store had a record-breaking December quarter, with over 2 billion downloads in the month of December
alone. The App Store now offers more than 775,000 apps to over half a billion account holders in 155 countries,
including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have now surpassed 40 billion, and we are
delighted to have paid our app developers over $7 billion for sales of their incredible work.
iCloud continues to grow at an amazing rate, now with 250 million accounts. And our customers love our iMessage
service, sending a staggering 2 billion plus iMessages per day.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was an all-time high of over $6.4 billion, with growth fueled
primarily by record iPhone and iPad sales. We opened a total of 11 new stores during the quarter, including four new
stores in Greater China. We exited the quarter with 401 stores, 150 of which are outside the United States. We also
relocated or expanded 14 stores that had outgrown their former space during the quarter.
With an average of 396 stores open, average revenue per store was $16.3 million or $1.25 million per store per week,
compared to $1.22 million per store per week in the year- ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.6 billion. We
hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 110 million in the year-ago quarter.
That translates to 23,000 visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year-over-year.
Total company gross margin was 38.6%, which was about 260 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this
difference was driven by lower products and transitory costs than we reflected in our guidance, while the remainder

resulted from a higher mix of iPhones, a weaker U.S. dollar and leverage on the higher revenue. Operating expenses
were $3.9 billion and included $460 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $462 million, and the tax
rate for the quarter was 26%.
Turning to cash, our cash plus short term and long-term marketable securities totaled $137.1 billion at the end of the
December quarter, compared to $121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential increase of almost $16
billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion in dividends paid and $2 billion in an up-front payment in
conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase program. Over $94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end
of the December quarter.
Cash flow from operations was a record $23.4 billion, growing by almost $6 billion year-over-year, a 33% increase.
Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share, payable on February 14, 2013, to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 11, 2013.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking
information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. In addition to the reporting changes that I've already
mentioned, to further increase transparency into our business, we are changing our approach to how we provide
guidance.
In recent years, our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we had reasonable
confidence in achieving. Going forward, we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what we are
likely to achieve. While we cannot forecast with complete accuracy, we believe we are likely to report within the range
of guidance we provide. Therefore, for the March quarter, we are providing revenue guidance of between $41 billion
and $43 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and
38.5%, reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be
between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion, including about $480 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect
OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.
In closing, we're thrilled to have generated over $54 billion of revenue in a 13-week period, while executing multiple
major product transitions. We sold over 75 million iOS devices during the quarter, which is a staggering number. We're
producing our best products ever, and the execution by our engineering, operations and sales teams to deliver tens of
millions of such innovative, beautifully designed products in such a short timeframe is phenomenal. We're very pleased
with our record iPhone and iPad sales, our record music, movie and app sales and the continued expansion of our
robust ecosystem. And finally, we remain very confident in our new product pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first
question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. It's clear that iPhone 5 did incredibly well in the U.S. based on the
carrier reports to date, but international sell through data points have been more mixed. How would you characterize
trends outside the U.S. for iPhone? And are you confident that you have all the right price points and screen sizes to
fully capture the non-U.S. demand for iPhone specifically?

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Katy, it's Tim. As Peter said, sequentially we increased over 70% from the September
quarter, which was 3.5 times market, and so we could not be happier with that. In terms of the geographic distribution,
we saw a – our highest growth in China and it was into the triple digits, which was higher than the market there. And so
I would characterize it as we're extremely pleased.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: And then maybe a question for Peter. With such a large cash generation again this quarter, and
confidence in the product pipeline, you made those comments and a stock price that is off its highs, why not step up
and buy back even more stock than you had originally planned at this point?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. This is something that we continuously assess the opportunities to both invest in the
business and return cash. We are pleased to have started our share repurchase program this quarter and combined with
our dividend, we returned about $4.5 billion of cash this quarter. And we started the buyback program and expect to
return about $45 billion over three years to our shareholders. We do consider increasing these programs and we'll do
what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thank you. Katy had alluded to this. Many of your smartphone competitors are now
focusing on differentiating themselves with larger screen sizes than that of the iPhone 5 and your predecessor products.
I mean, how do you think about the competitive dynamics of the market right now in that respect? Do you think that's a
valid point of differentiation? And do you think there is a long-term case for a larger screen size or at least a larger
variety of screen sizes for iPhones and for the smartphone category in general?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, it's Tim. The iPhone 5 offers, as you know, a new four-inch Retina display, which is the
most advanced display in the industry and no one comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display. It
also provides a larger screen size for iPhone customers without sacrificing the one-handed ease of use that our
customers love. So we put a lot of thinking into screen size, and believe we've picked the right one.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: I guess then shifting on to the question on iPhone demand, obviously you saw healthy growth in
the key categories this quarter. But in the context of your guidance, can you give us some color about how you're
viewing end demand trends for the iPhone coming out of the December quarter and how that compares to what you
consider to be normal seasonality at this point in the product cycle? And also, did you see any meaningful deterioration
in iPhone demand at the end of the December quarter or thus far in the March quarter that would lend credence to some
near-term conservatism?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, let me take the second of half of that and then I'll hand it back to Peter for the first half.
If you look at iPhone sales across the quarter, we were very constrained for much of the quarter on iPhone 5. As we
begin to produce more and ship more, sales went up with the production. iPhone 4 was actually in constraint for the
entire quarter, and sales remained strong. And so that's how sales progressed across the quarter. I'll let Peter talk about
the guidance.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Yeah, so, Bill, for iPhone, as we told you last year, we built about 2.6 million units of
channel inventory in the March quarter, which allowed us at that time to get into our four to six week inventory target.
So the underlying sell through is about 32.5 million, and we would expect sell through growth year-over-year as it has
for, in the quarter, as it has for many quarters in a row.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, let me make one additional point on this. I know there's been lots of rumors about order
cuts and so forth and so let me just take a moment to make a comment on this. I don't want to comment on any
particular rumor because I would spend my life doing that, but I would suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any
kind of rumor about build plans and also stress that even if a particular data point were factual, it would be impossible
to accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very
complex. And we obviously have multiple sources for things, yields might vary, supplier performance can vary, the
beginning inventory positions can vary. I mean, there's just an inordinate long list of things that would make any single
data point not a great proxy for what's going on.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Sanford Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure that I fully understand your comments about
guidance and the new guidance range that you're providing. Are you effectively saying that when you provided
guidance before, it was uniquely conservative and that level of conservatism no longer exists? We're actually getting
the real planning range for Apple and that this is fundamentally different from how you approached and provided
guidance?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Toni, it's Peter. In the past, we provided a single point estimate of guidance that was
conservative, that we had reasonable confidence in achieving. This quarter and going forward, we're going to provide a
range of guidance that we believe that we are likely to report within. No guarantees, forecasting is difficult, but we
believe that we will report within that range.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: So I'm just comparing the words. So you think you'll report in the range. Before you, I
think, on average eclipsed your guidance on EPS by 35%. Was the guidance before something that you felt reasonably
confident in achieving? Or was there an implicit buffer in there? Because I'm trying to reconcile the fact that you said
you thought it was reasonable before but your historical precedent was you eclipsed it enormously on an ongoing basis,
and this time you're saying there's a high likelihood of falling within the range, and I want to understand the distinction.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: I'll go through it again. In the past, we gave you a single point estimate of guidance that
was conservative, that we had as reasonable confidence as you can have that we would achieve. We're now providing
you a range of guidance that we expect to, as best we can, report within.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. And then if I could follow up, Tim, you started the call talking about Apple's
philosophy of really ensuring that you satisfy your customers and making great products. Against that backdrop, how
important is market share preservation? This quarter you held share, maybe increased it fractionally on a year-over-year
basis in the global smartphone market, but clearly you had an exciting new product. Is holding share in the smartphone
market in 2013 a priority for Apple, yes or no, and why? And realistically, how does Apple hold share, given that the
market segment and price point that you play in is expected to grow a lot slower and you have pretty dominant share in
that high end?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, the most important thing to Apple is to make the best products in the world that enrich
customers' lives. That's our high order bet. That means that we aren't interested in revenue for revenue's sake. We could
put the Apple brand on a lot of things and sell a lot more stuff, but that's not what we're here for. We want to make only
the best products. And so what does that mean for market share? We've been able to do that and I think we've had a
great track record here on iPod of doing different products at different price points and getting a reasonable share from
doing that. And so one doesn't – I wouldn't view the things as mutually exclusive as some might. But the high order bet
is making a great product that enriches customer's lives. And so that's what we're focused on.

<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Barclays, we'll go to Ben Reitzes.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. First question is with regard to Macs. Could you talk a little bit more
about what happened? And it would seem that the shortfall there is well over $1 billion in the quarter, maybe even as
much as $1.5 billion. And how much of that was pushed into the March quarter within that new March guidance?
Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Ben, it's Tim. Thanks for asking that question. I wanted to talk about this. If you look, I think
the best way to answer this is if you look at the previous year, our Mac sales were about 5.2 million, this year they were
4.1 million, and so the difference is 1.1 million. And so let they me try to bridge that.
iMacs were down by 700,000 units year-over-year. As you remember, we announced a new iMac late in October, and
when we announced those, we announced that they would ship the first one, the 21.5-inch, would ship in November,
and we did ship it at the end of November. We announced that the 27-inch would ship in December, and we did ship
that in mid-December. And so there were limited weeks of ramping on these products during the quarter. We left the
quarter with significant constraints on the iMac, and we believe, we know, that our sales would have been materially
higher if those constraints would not have existed. We tried to tell people this on the conference call in October. I think
I said that we would have significant constraints on iMac. And so but I recognize to some folks this may be a surprise.
Number two, if you look at last year, as Peter went through in his opening comments, we had 14 weeks in the quarter.
We had 13 weeks in the quarter this year. Last year in the average week we sold 370,000 Macs.
The third part of the bridge here would be that our channel inventory was down from the beginning of the quarter by
over 100,000 units. And that's because obviously we didn't have the iMacs in channel inventory, it was in significant
constraint. So if you just take these three factors, they bridge more than the difference of between this year's sales and
last year's sales.
Now in addition to these three points, I would point out two other things, and these are lesser things than the total of
these other three, obviously. One, the market for PCs is weak. IDC's last estimate, I believe, was around negative 6%.
Two, we sold 23 million iPads. And we obviously could have sold more than this because we could not build enough
iPad minis to come into a demand balance. And so we've always said there's some cannibalization there. I'm sure there
was some cannibalization of Macs there. But the three large factors or the aggregated total of the three large, the iMacs,
the difference in seven days of the previous year, having seven extra days, and the channel inventory I think more than
explains the difference between this year and the previous year.
As a side note, if you looked at our portables alone, they were in line with IDC's projections of the market growth.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Thanks a lot, Tim. And then just my follow up is with regard to web services,
online services; there's been a lot of publicity around maps, and can you give us an update there? And then looking
forward, how does the year look in terms of innovation in terms of iOS 7 and your online and web services? How will
that drive Apple?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Well, let me start with the second part of this. We're working on some incredible stuff, the
pipeline is chock full. I don't want to comment about a specific product but we feel great about what we've got in store.
In terms of maps, we've made a number of improvements to maps since the introduction of iOS 6 back in September,
and we'll roll out even more improvements across the rest of the year. And we're going to keep working on this, as I've
said before, until it lives up to our incredibly high standards. Users can already see many of these improvements

because they include things like improved satellite and flyover imagery, improved categorization, improved local
information for thousands of businesses and so forth. The usage in maps is significantly higher than it was prior to iOS
6.
In terms of other services, we feel fantastic about how we're doing. In Notifications Center, we've now sent over four
trillion notifications. This is mind blowing. As Peter mentioned in his opening comments, for iMessage, we've now sent
over 450 billion and are currently sending those at over 2 billion per day. With game center, we've got over 200 million
registered users. We have 800,000 apps on the App Store with over 40 billion downloads. And so I feel really, really
great about it. There's obviously more stuff we can do, and you can bet we're thinking about all of it.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
And next we'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Great. Thank you very much. Could you review your comments about gross margin in
the quarter? And also looking ahead perhaps commenting on a few areas, first of all, where are you on your product
cost curve relative to where you expected to be? And then also any comments on mix within the iPhone line in terms of
5 versus 4S, amount of storage? And then also on the iPad, last quarter you said you really didn't know what the
proportion of minis would be. Can you make any comments in terms of the demand for mini relative to what you
expected?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Steve. It's Peter. I'll start. I'll make a comment on mini, go through gross margin and
maybe Tim can pick up on some of your iPhone questions.
With the iPad mini, it's hard to know. We could not make enough in the quarter. We were constrained every week.
Customers loved the mini, and we wished that we could have made more and we ended the quarter with significant
backlog.
For the gross margin in the December quarter, we were about 260 basis points ahead of our guidance. About half this
difference was driven by lower product and transitory cost than we had reflected in our guidance and the rest came
from a higher mix of iPhones, a weaker dollar, and leverage on the higher revenue.
As we look forward, we think the gross margin will be somewhere between about 10 basis points and 110 basis points
lower sequentially. We believe that there are two primary factors that will benefit gross margins sequentially. First and
the largest of the two, our teams have made meaningful progress in reductions in product and transitory costs from the
actions that they have been working on to get down the cost curve. So we expect a benefit in the March quarter beyond
what we saw in the December quarter. And second, we expect a more typical level of deferred revenue from device
sales.
We expect these factors to be more than offset by 10 to 120-basis points by the loss of leverage coming out of the
December quarter, which is very typical for us and a different mix of our current products. And regarding mix, as an
example, as we indicated last quarter, the iPad mini gross margin is significantly below the corporate average, and we
expect to be able to meet demand for this product in the March quarter, which again we could not in the December
quarter.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And, Steve, I'll make some comments on mix. If you look – your question on iPhone mix, let
me bring up three points. One, the ASP for iPhone was essentially the same year-over-year in the quarter that we just
finished. Underneath that, if you looked at the mix of iPhone 5 to total iPhone, and then in the previous year you look at
4S to total iPhone, since it was the top iPhone, those mixes were similar. And then thirdly, I think you asked about
capacities. In Q1 we saw similar results as we saw in Q1 of the previous year. So does that answer your question on
mix?

<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Yes, it does. Thank you. And then second question would be on CapEx. You spend
almost as much as Intel does. I think you guys have said you're not going to become vertically integrated, per se, but in
a sense you are, since most of that I assume is buying equipment for your partners. Could you talk about the strategy
here? And how much of a differentiator this gives Apple in terms of your ability to ramp new products over time? And
you know, maybe a little bit more about how deep you'll go in terms of semiconductor componentry, et cetera?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. Steve, it's Peter. We expect to spend about $10 billion in CapEx this fiscal year. That
will be up a little under $2 billion year-over-year. We expect to spend a little bit under $1 billion in the retail stores.
And the other $9 billion is spent in a variety of areas. We're buying equipment that we will own that we will put in
partners' facilities. Our primary motivation there is for supply, but we get other benefits as well. We're also adding to
our data center capabilities to support all of the services that Tim spoke about in answering Ben's question and then
facilities and infrastructure. So that's where the capital is going.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?

From Cross Research Group, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a little bit about what happened last year in terms
of the refresh cycle, where you had about 80% of your revenue refreshed in the last few months? And then how you're
thinking about it this year? I know you say you ship products when they are ready, but is this a situation where you're
going to try to stagger it out a little bit this year? Or will it be sort of a similar situation to 2012?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: That's a question I won't answer, Shannon. But the 80% was an usually high percentage for
us. I don't know exactly what the historic numbers on that, but I can tell you that the number of ramps were
unprecedented and the fact that we had new products in every category is something we have not done before. We feel
great to have delivered so many products for the holiday season, though. And our customers have certainly expressed
joy over it.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then I guess could you talk a bit more about China? You provided, which is
great, you've broken out the Greater China revenue, but can you talk about what you're hearing from customers and
from some of your partners there, your thoughts on retail distribution, expansion, and just sort of overall what you're
seeing over what you saw over the holiday period and then what you sort of expect from China going forward?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, if you look at our total China, total Greater China, which would include our retail
stores that are in China, our revenues were $7.3 billion in the quarter. So this is incredibly high. It's up over 60%
year-on-year, and again, that's comparing 13 to 14 weeks. And so it's really – the underlying growth is higher than that.
We saw exceptional growth in iPhones into the triple digits. iPad, we shipped iPad very late in the quarter in December,
and despite that saw very nice growth. We are expanding in Apple retail there. In the year ago quarter, we had had six
stores. We now have 11. We obviously have many more to open there.
In our premium resellers, we went over 400, up from a little over 200 in the previous year. And we increased iPhone
point of sales from 7,000 to over 17,000 there. Now, this isn't nearly what we need, and it's not the final, by any means.
We're not even close to that. But we're making – I feel that we're making great progress. I was just over there recently
and talking to a lot of different people, I'm very happy with how things are going.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's clear that China is, it's already our second-largest region as you can see from the data that
we've given you, and it's clear there's a lot of potential there.

Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Good afternoon. Tim, you made comments in the past that the Apple TV experience is dated
and Apple wants to fix that problem. If we can take a step outside of the form factor debate, whether it's a box or a
panel, can you just talk in high level how important this market is to Apple? Number one. And number two is, can you
accomplish what you ultimately want to accomplish with the reality of where content is today and how content is
distributed?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Gene, you're asking me all questions I don't want to answer, but let me see if I can find some
comments to make that's productive.
In terms of the product that we sell today, the Apple TV, we sold more last quarter than we've ever sold before,
eclipsing 2 million during the quarter. It was up almost 60% year-on-year. And so there's actually very, very good
growth in that product. And what was a small niche at one time of people that loved it is a much larger number that
love it.
I have said in the past, this is an area of intense interest for us, and it remains that. And I tend to believe that there's a
lot we can contribute in this space. And so we continue to pull the string and see where it leads us. But I don't want to
be more specific.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Okay. And just a housekeeping for Peter. Peter, you gave gross margin guidance this quarter,
but no EPS guidance. Is there anything, any moving parts between the gross margin and the operating line that we
should be aware of that might account for that nuance in how you're giving guidance?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: No, Gene. Our prior method of providing guidance was a point estimate for each line item
of the P&L, including EPS. In our guidance for the March quarter and how we will give guidance in the future, we're
going to give a range for revenue, for gross margin and for OpEx. Therefore, there are many possibilities for EPS
within the range that we'll leave you to think through. And we'll report our actual results from March to you in April.

From Bank of Montreal, we'll go to Keith Bachman.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. The first one is, Tim, could you talk a little bit about the data, even if
anecdotal, on how iPhone sales proceeded in terms of new customers versus upgrades and how that compared to, say, if
you go to the 4S last year?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I don't have those specific numbers in front of me, but the iPhone 5, obviously, with the
numbers that we're selling, is selling to a lot of new customers.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Because we had heard feedback that it was a lot more of an upgrade cycle to existing
customers, but it sounds like that's not a statement that you would agree with.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I don't know who you were talking to. And so, again, this is one of those things I would
caution on using as a proxy for the world. There are many carriers created differently.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well, let me turn to my next question then. Peter, as we think about the March
quarter, I'm a bit confused how to think about iPads. And you mentioned that iPad mini was constrained. Any kind of
comments on what seasonality would be? And more importantly, how are you thinking about the aggregate amount of
inventory that's in the channel for iPads? Will that amount increase, decrease or stay the same as we reflect on how to
model units in the March quarter?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Keith, it's Tim. I'm going to make a couple of comments. iPad mini was very constrained.
We ended with underneath our target channel inventory range, which Peter had commented earlier. We believe that we
can achieve supply/demand balance on iPad mini later this quarter. That would likely mean that we would need more
units in the channel than we have today. I think that would be a fair conclusion to draw.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: But, Keith, I'll add to that, for total iPad sales, we don't provide a sublevel forecast, but we
would expect a large year-over-year increase in iPad sales, but a post-holiday sequential decline for iPad sales, which I
think is typical. And as Tim said, we expect to be able to meet demand for the mini.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think it's probably worth pointing out, just to be totally clear, for last quarter, we had strong
sales of iPad and iPad mini.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Keith.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks much. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go to Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Tim, can you maybe discuss the tablet market a little bit in
relation to Macs and other PCs and sort of how you're thinking about the cannibalization of that market for the iPad
relative to the PC market? And then secondly, typically each quarter you sort of talk about some of the component
constraints, and you certainly talked about iPhone 4 being constrained and the iPad mini, etc. So as you enter into the
quarter, where do you see the challenges for meeting demand for the calendar first quarter? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. I think overall our team did just a fantastic job
ramping a record number of new products during the quarter. We did have significant shortages due to robust demand
on both iPad mini and both models of the iMac that persisted the entire quarter. And we are still short of both of those
today, as a matter of fact. Additionally, supply of iPhone 5 was short, short to demand until late in the quarter, and
iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter. We believe that we can achieve a supply/demand balance on iPad mini during
this quarter and on iPhone 4 during this quarter. On iMac we are confident that we're going to significantly increase the
supply, but the demand here is very strong and we are not certain that we'll achieve a supply/demand balance during the
quarter.
In terms of cannibalization and how we think about this, I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us. One, our
base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it, and so we never fear
it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod business. It doesn't worry us that it's done that. We know that iPad
will cannibalize some Macs. That doesn't worry us.
On iPad in particular, we have the mother of all opportunities here because the Windows market is much, much larger
than the Mac market is, and I think it is clear that it's already cannibalizing some. And I think there's a tremendous

amount more opportunity there, and as you know, I've said for two or three, actually three years now, I believe, that I
believe the tablet market would be larger than the PC market at some point, and I still believe that.
And you can see by the growth in tablets and the pressure on PCs that those lines are beginning to converge. I think the
other thing for us, maybe not for others, but for us, is if somebody buys an iPad mini or an iPad and it's their first Apple
product, we have great experience through the years of knowing that when somebody buys their first Apple product
that a percentage of these people wind up buying another type of Apple product. And so if you remember what we had
termed the "halo effect" for some time with the iPod, with the Mac, we're very confident that that will happen, and
we're seeing some evidence of that on the iPad as well. And so I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Scott. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. The question, Tim, around the iPhone, Peter gave some
transparency around the qualitative, sequential and year-over-year potential increases in the iPad for the March quarter.
How should we think about the iPhone family set against that in terms of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter,
potential increases or decreases, and are there any sort of dynamics around the slower pace of LTE rollouts by the
network carriers having an impact?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The thing to consider on iPhone, Mark, is that in the year-ago quarter, we built 2.6 million
units of channel inventory because we did the – one reason was that we did the China launch in the March quarter
instead of in the previous quarter, and so the underlying sell through from the year ago quarter was 32.5 million. The
sell in was 35 million as you can probably see on a sheet in front of you.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yep.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And so in thinking through the number of iPhones to predict, we looked at the 32.5 million
number as a baseline. And we clearly believe that we're going to grow year-over-year. But I don't want to be more
specific than that because Peter is already giving you some top-level guidance and that's how we – that's – we guide in
the aggregate instead of at the product level.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. And then my follow up is just around the pace of LTE build outs across the globe,
either in Europe or parts of Asia, have those slower than expected rollouts from the network perspective, has that had
any sort of impact do you think on your iPhone sales philosophy And could that change over the next 12 months as you
see LTE capacity become more available elsewhere?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's a good question. Today we have 24 carriers around the world that provide LTE support
for iPhone 5, and those are in countries like the U.S., Korea, the U.K., Germany, Canada, Japan, Australia and a few
others. Next week, we are adding 36 more carriers for LTE support and these carriers will be in countries that were
currently not supporting LTE. So it will be LTE coverage now in – or as of next week in Italy, Denmark, Finland,
Switzerland, Philippines, also several Middle Eastern countries. And so if you look at the total of all of these and the
incremental subscribers that are in those countries, it's over 300 million. And so that's the next range of LTE rollouts
that I'm pleased to tell you about today.
Also, as you know, iPhone 5 also supports other ultra-fast networks like HSPA+ and with downloads up to 42 mps
which is three times the speed of the iPhone 4S. And so we feel very good about the situation that we're in, particularly
with these adds next week.

From Deutsche Bank, we'll go to Chris Whitmore.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks. Just to follow up on the iPhone question with respect to guidance. You know,
assuming there's some benefit from the Mac carryover effect and iPad release, et cetera and adjusting for the inventory,
it seems you're guiding to a kind of mid to high single digit year-on-year unit growth for the iPhone business from a
sell through standpoint. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about? And why the big deceleration from the
25% plus weekly sales rate you quoted in your intro comments?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Chris, it's Peter. We're not going to talk about guidance at a specific product level,
but let me give you some things we thought about in coming up with the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. That range
is a 5% to 10% year-over-year increase. And there are a few factors that are impacting the year-over-year results
making the strong performance of the business a little bit harder to see. So let me point a few of these out.
First of all, as we've talked about several times on the call, last year in the March quarter we built 2.6 million units of
iPhone channel inventory which allowed us to get into our four to six-week range. That increased the revenue in the
year ago quarter by $1.6 billion. And as Tim talked about, that was sell in, that was not sell through. We're thinking
about the business on a sell through basis. So don't lose sight of the $1.6 billion.
Second, the iPhone 5 rollout this year has been our fastest ever. We're selling in a hundred countries by the end of
December. Last year we did not achieve this country distribution until the March quarter, which included China that we
launched in January.
Third, we made a very good strategic decision to introduce the iPad mini, which customers love, and to keep the
price-reduced iPad 2 in the line. As a result of this, we saw a reduction in our iPad ASPs of about $101 year-over-year
in the December quarter. And you can see that our iPad units grew faster than our iPad revenue in the December
quarter. We would expect iPad ASPs to be down quite a bit in the March quarter on a year-over-year basis for the same
reasons.
And then finally, the PC market grew 4% last year in the March quarter, and this year IDC is projecting that to decline
by 3%.
So considering these factors, the underlying performance in the business is much stronger than the 5% to 10%
year-over-year growth implies, and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: And for my follow up I wanted to come back to something Tim said earlier about not
fearing cannibalization. I wanted to ask in context of your iPhone business, given the strength you're seeing at the low
end of your product line and the iPhone 4 being stocked out during the quarter, there seems to be a lot of demand at
lower price points for the iPhone. Why not get more aggressive at lower price bands and move down market in the
iPhone business? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I'm not going to go into our pricing strategy, but we feel great about the opportunity of
getting products to customers and a percentage of those buying other Apple products. And we've obviously seen
evidence of that through history and continue to see evidence of that today.
Nancy Paxton
