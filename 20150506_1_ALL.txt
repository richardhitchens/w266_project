MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please
go ahead.
Patrick Macellaro
Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's First Quarter 2015
Earnings Conference Call. After the prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we will have a
question-and-answer session. Yesterday we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our Form 10-Q for
the first quarter, and posted the slides we will use this morning. We also posted the document describing our 2015
countrywide, excluding Florida, reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.
Our discussion today may include forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may
differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides and our most recent news
release for information on potential risks.
Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and
in our Investor Supplement. We are recording the call and a replay will be available following its conclusion and I'll be
available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.

And I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas J. Wilson
Good morning. Thank you for investing your time with us. I'll begin with an overview of our results on slide two, then
Pat and Steve will go through the results in detail. Also here to engage with you are Matt Winter, Allstate's President,
also the leader of our Allstate-branded operations; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Kathy Mabe,
who leads Business to Business and Encompass; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our
Corporate Controller.
So, let me begin with the strength of our strategy is really evident in this quarter's results. We have a broad-based
business model that serves a wide range of customers with a broad range of products. What that does is it enables us to
generate profitable growth despite a changing economic and competitive environment. Our results reflect progress on
all five operating priorities for 2015, which are to grow while maintaining the underlying combined ratio, proactively
manage the $80 billion investment portfolio, and invest for sustainable value creation.
Our position in multiple customer segments, insurance products, geographies, and investments enables us to continue
meeting our short and long-term commitment to shareholders, our customers, our agency owners and employees as
well as local communities.
If you turn to slide three you can see the financial outcomes of our performance in the first quarter of 2015. We
continue to build growth momentum by adding 875,000 policies over last 12 months and now reaching $34.4 million.
When combined with price increases, this resulted in net written premium growth of 4.8%. The benefit of a segmented
approach to the market was evident as growth continued to accelerate in the Allstate brand which gave us room to slow
growth in the Esurance and Encompass businesses given our economic targets for those two businesses.
The recorded combined ratio was 93.7, which was better than last year. This decline reflected lower catastrophes,
which also shows the benefit of having a diversified product portfolio as an uptick in the Allstate brand auto combined
ratio to 96.8 in the first quarter was offset by an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of 78.7. Esurance and
Encompass, they are still making progress on improving value creation and the results still need to improve.
When you take out the volatility associated with catastrophes and reserve changes you can see that the underlying
combined ratio deteriorated slightly but were within the full-year range of 87 to 89. This level of profitability does
include expenses which build long-term value, such as growing Esurance and investing in long-term growth platforms,
and I'll talk about that in just a minute.
Investment results were good when adjusted for the reduction in assets due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life Company
in the second quarter of last year. Our proactive approach to investing to achieve attractive risk adjustment returns, not
just operating income, continue to benefit our overall results and we had strong results from limited partnerships which
offset the impact of reducing interest rate risk in the fixed income portfolio. We also had really good results from a
more focused but smaller Allstate Financial.
Total net income was $648 million in the quarter, $1.53 a share, as you can see in the box at the top of that slide.
Operating income was $1.46 per share which was 12.3% higher than the same quarter last year which reflected both
higher income and fewer shares outstanding.
The first quarter Property-Liability results for each customer segment are shown on slide four. I'm just going to
comment on the circled numbers in each segment starting with the Allstate brand in the lower left which serves, of
course, customers that prefer local advice in a branded offering. Policy in force growth accelerated across all products,
as Matt's team pursues a comprehensive and fully integrated growth plan. The underlying combined ratio for this
business, which represents 90% of our total premiums written, was 87.4 in the quarter.
Esurance in the lower right focuses on customers who prefer a self-serve approach but want a branded offering. Policy
growth slowed to 8.9%, the underlying combined ratio 116.5 included advertising expenses which are being made to

grow share and the cost associated with expanding the product offering and the geographic reach. As a result, we look
at the underlying loss ratio which was 78.2 in the first quarter, which still needs to be lowered.
Moving to customer segment that prefers local advice but is brand neutral, which is in the upper left. That's the segment
that we serve with our Encompass business. This business got marginally smaller in the first quarter as we seek to
improve profitability.
So as a management team, we're committed to both delivering these current results as well as investing in sustainable
value creation as shown on slide five. While these items on this page all had a negative impact on current quarterly
earnings, they are important drivers to shareholders value, so therefore, we are completely committed to them. We
made good progress on modernizing our operating model. We also continued laying the foundation to reducing low
value-added activities handled by Allstate agencies while increasing their ability to provide trusted advice to customers.
Since acquiring Esurance in 2011 we've grown market share by repositioning the brand, expanding its geographic
footprint and its product offerings, and supporting this with advertising investments that are higher than justified by
current premium levels. We continue to invest in share growth as long as lifetime returns on new customers exceed our
cost of capital.
We are also seizing the opportunity that comes with connecting customers through telephony by expanding our
telematics offering. We now have over 0.75 million customers using Drivewise and DriveSense. We are also
innovating our roadside service operating model which has over 3 million members under the Allstate brand and many
millions more under our white label offerings. So, in summary, our goal is to both deliver today and build for
tomorrow.
Now let me turn it over to Pat to go through the Property-Liability results in more detail.
Patrick Macellaro
Thanks, Tom. We begin by reviewing our Property-Liability results on slide six. Starting with the chart on the top of
this page, Property-Liability had earned premium of $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, 5.1% higher than the first
quarter of 2014. Recorded combined ratio of 93.7 was 1 point lower than the prior-year quarter driven by catastrophe
losses of $294 million which were 33.9% lower than the prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 89 was
0.6 points higher than the first quarter of 2014.
Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 14.7% from the first quarter of 2014 due primarily
to strong limited partnership returns in the quarter. As a result, Property-Liability operating income in the first quarter
was $555 million, 18.6% higher than the first quarter of 2014.
Chart on the lower left shows net written premium and policy in force growth rates for Allstate Protection. Red line
representing policy in force growth shows the continued positive policy growth trend that is being driven by the
Allstate brand. Policies in force grew by 875,000 or 2.6% from the first quarter of 2014. The Allstate brand accounted
for 86% of policy growth in the first quarter of 2015 based on the strength of auto, homeowners and other personal
lines. Total premium grew 4.8% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, reflecting the
combination of policy and average premium increases.
Exhibit to the right of this chart displays the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. You can
see the recorded first quarter combined ratio was lower than the historical first quarter average and below the first
quarter of 2014 due to lower catastrophe losses. Total underlying combined ratio of 89 was more in line with the
historical trend and was impacted by higher auto losses in the first quarter of 2015 versus the prior-year quarter.
Page seven highlights Allstate brand auto growth and margin trends. Growth trends are highlighted in the chart on the
top. Policies increased by 623,000 in the first quarter of 2015 or 3.2% higher than the first quarter of 2014, driven by a
continued broad-based increase in new business and stable retention trends. Auto items in force grew in 42 states in the
first quarter of 2015. Net written premium grew 5.7% as average premiums increased by 2.3% over the prior-year

quarter. The chart on the lower left shows the past three years quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance
for Allstate brand auto.
Recorded combined ratio was 96.8 in the first quarter of 2015, 3.4 points worse than the first quarter of 2014, and the
underlying combined ratio was 95.6 in the first quarter, 1.8 points higher than the prior-year quarter. Further details are
shown in the chart on the bottom right.
Annualized average written premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to increase over the prior year in the
first quarter. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy, shown by the red line, increased 4.1% in the first
quarter compared with the first quarter of 2014 and was impacted by three separate drivers. First, Allstate brand
prior-year auto reserve re-estimates were unfavorable; about half of the impact is due to litigation settlement accruals
on older cases while the rest is driven by variations in reserving.
Second, bodily injury frequency increased 6.8% compared with the first quarter of last year. This increase is explained
partially by comparisons to a very favorable quarter of BI frequency in the first quarter of 2014, but it also reflects
higher frequency experience across our book of business.
Third, property damage frequency increased 2.1% in the first quarter compared with the prior-year quarter. This
increase is due in part to adverse winter weather in the eastern part of the country, but again we're also seeing higher
PD frequency this year than we did for most of last year. You may recall that we did experience elevated property
damage frequency in last year's first quarter due to widespread winter weather. When we look at both coverages over a
multi-year period the trends across BI and PD are very consistent.
As you'd expect, we continue to dig into the drivers of increased frequency since the trends began to emerge in the
fourth quarter of last year, leverage our data and analytic capabilities to continuously analyze our business from the
macro level down to the micro segments that our local teams use to underwrite and price. Some examples of items
we've investigated include the impact of new to renewal loss ratio relativities, often referred to as the new business
penalty from writing higher volumes of new business, state mix and geographic mix within states, higher growth books
of business versus stable or moderately growing books, monoline versus multiline, liability only versus full coverage
and quality characteristics such as insurance score, driver age and household composition.
Based on our analysis we continue to be comfortable with the quality of both our new and renewal business. This
analysis also reinforces our conclusion that recent frequency fluctuations are due primarily to macroeconomic trends
and weather and that while we believe industry wide auto frequency will continue with a long-term downward slope
over time, there will be periods of variability within that trend that are driven by external factors.
Our regional teams have been quick to identify these developing trends on a local market basis and have taken and will
continue to take appropriate underwriting and pricing actions to achieve our targeted returns. Given current trends we
expect the level of underwriting changes and rate increases to accelerate. Proved rate increases in April of 2015 exceed
that of the entire first quarter of 2015, the result of our regional teams adjusting the timing and the amount of rates that
were already planned in the year. We do not believe these actions to maintain margins will materially impair current
policy growth trends.
Moving to page 8, let's discuss Allstate brand homeowners. We're growing homeowners in parts of the country that are
adequately priced and have acceptable exposure to catastrophes; policy growth is being driven by both increased new
business and improved retention. The chart on the bottom left shows the continued strength of homeowner profitability
and the earnings benefit we experienced in the first quarter of 2015 from having a diversified product portfolio.
Recorded combined ratio was 78.7 for the first quarter of 2015 and the underlying combined ratio of 64.5 improved by
1.3 points from the first quarter of 2014.
Moving to the lower left, annualized average premium shown in blue continued to increase at a slowing rate versus
recent history reflecting improved returns. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy were essentially flat to
the prior-year quarter. Non-catastrophe frequency in the first quarter of 2015 was 7.9 points below the prior-year
quarter and the 6.6% increase experienced in paid severity was due to claim count mix. Individual homeowner severity
perils are performing within expected ranges.

Page 9 provides an overview of growth and profit results for Esurance and Encompass. Starting on the upper left of the
slide, Esurance's rate of policy and total net written premium growth continues to slow due to ongoing pricing and
underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitable growth as well as the increasing size of the business.
Total Esurance premiums grew by 8.9% in the first quarter; policies in force grew 8.6% compared with the first quarter
of 2014.
Esurance profitability shown in the upper right chart was impacted by higher claim frequency and higher severity on
collision and property damage. Esurance's expense ratio decreased 10.7 points in the first quarter of 2015 compared
with the prior-year quarter given last year's first quarter spend to reposition the brand. Spending on expansion
initiatives contributed approximately 2.8 points to the Esurance expense ratio in the first quarter compared with 2
points in the first quarter of 2014.
Encompass policy in force growth, illustrated by the grey line in the chart on the bottom left, fell to negative two-tenths
due to lower new business and lower retention, the result of ongoing profit improvement actions. The decline in
policies also impacted net written premium which is 1.4% lower in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the first
quarter of 2014. Encompass's first quarter recorded combined ratio of 95.6 improved by 7 points primarily driven by
lower catastrophe losses.
And now, I'll turn it over to Steve to cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Pat. Slide 10 provides an overview of Allstate Financial as we've discussed previously, we strategically
repositioned Allstate Financial over the last several years to focus its business on Allstate brand customers. The most
recent action was to sell Lincoln Benefit Life and further integrate the life business into the Allstate brand value
proposition. Allstate Financial results for the first quarter are highlighted in the bottom of the slide.
Premiums and contract charges increased 2.9% when compared to first quarter 2014 results excluding LBL. Growth is
driven primarily by increased additional life insurance renewal premiums and Allstate benefit accident and health
insurance business.
Allstate benefit now has 3.2 million policies in force making it a major player in the voluntary workplace benefits
business. Operating income for the first quarter was $134 million 13.5% lower than the first quarter of 2014 after
adjusting for the disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life. This reduction in operating income was driven primarily by lower
investment income related to prepayment fees and litigation settlements and higher life mortality and expenses than the
prior-year first quarter.
Moving to investments in the chart at the top of slide 11, our portfolio total return was 1.7% for the first quarter. The
components of the total return continued to show that the income yield remains consistent while the valuation impact
varies from quarter to quarter, most recently being driven by reductions in interest rates since year-end 2014. Our
portfolio valuations have not been materially impacted by lower energy prices as the majority of our assets with
exposure to the energy sector are investment-grade corporate bonds which are currently in an unrealized gain position.
The lower half of the slide provides the investment income and yield for the Property-Liability in Allstate Financial
portfolios. The Property-Liability interest-bearing yield in the lower left graph reflects the impact of prior duration
shortening and ongoing investments in the low interest rate environment. The interest-bearing portfolios yield is close
to current market yields and is expected to respond more quickly to changes in interest rates as a result of its shorter
maturity profile.
Moving to the Allstate Financial portfolio in the lower right, the interest-bearing portfolio yield is higher and more
stable than the Property-Liability segment due to its longer duration and its cash flows being used largely to fund
annuity reductions. The drop in investment income primarily reflects the LBL disposition in the aforementioned
reduction annuities.

Total first quarter limited partnership income was 39% higher than the same period last year, up by a strong quarter for
our real estate investments. Economic conditions and high liquidity levels have contributed to favorable market
performance which is reflected in strong limited partnership results in both portfolios. As you can see from the charts,
limited partnerships and other equity investments bring a higher degree of variability to our income. While more
volatile, we expect these investments to increase returns in both portfolios over the long-term.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our strong capital position and excellent shareholder returns at the end of the first
quarter. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through a combination of common
dividends and share repurchases. We completed our 2014 $2.5 billion common share repurchase authorization in
February and initiated a new $3 billion authorization. A $500 million accelerated repurchase program was executed in
March, which will be completed by mid-June. As of March 31, we had $2.4 billion remaining on our current
repurchase authorization which is expected to be completed by July, 2016.
We provide additional information on our share repurchase activities this quarter in the chart on the right. In the table
under the chart, you can see the impact of accelerated share repurchase initiations and settlements for each of the past
nine quarters. We've also posted an explanatory document on ASRs on our investor relations website this morning.
Yesterday afternoon, we communicated details of our 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program excluding Florida. We
rolled our expiring nationwide contracts in a similar, but lower-cost agreement and added approximately $300 million
of coverage for growth in our business. As in prior years, I challenged our team to push the envelope a bit. You'll see
this year's program breaks through the historic, three-year duration of traditional reinsurance with two 7-year to limit
multi-peril reinsurance covers to provide further stability in our business for our customers. We expect to place our
Florida program in the second quarter and will communicate details at that time.
Now, let's open up the call for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your
question please.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my call. So I wanted to start off with a question
about growth. You guys have nicely increased your production coming from the core agency channel over the past few
years and there's a bunch of different things that have been going on. You talked about new, younger agents coming
into to sort freshen the footprint, also invested in developing agency management strategies and cross-selling and now
you're talking a bit about sort of evolving how you run agencies to focus more on higher value-added advisory
relationships.
And I was kind of trying to figure out map – I was trying to go through an exercise in my mind of mapping the
improving production that you're actually seeing with some of the things you've been trying to do and I was curious if
you could help us sort of walk through, is this your initiatives playing out? Or is this more a function of your
willingness now to write more homeowners and basically having gone through a period of re-underwriting and now
kind of having easy comps?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Josh. Thank you for the question. Matt will take you through some of the
specifics. It's a good question because it really gets to the substance of that which we're doing, which is our strategy is
comprehensive, but it's designed to support profitable growth in any environment and oftentimes when we get into
environment where costs are growing up and we have to raise prices, everybody thinks that it's all about price and it is
– currently price is very – obviously very important, but Matt has a much more comprehensive program on that.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Good morning, Josh, and thanks for the question. As you correctly pointed out, we have
seen some nice growth overall in the business both on the auto and the homeowners side. We've also seen growth in the

consumer household goods and we're beginning to see some growth in the life and retirement space as well. We don't
believe that it's any one particular item that's led to that. As Tom mentioned, we really – the entire team views this as
one complex system and we try to pull multiple levers on that system and have multiple influences on it that feed off of
each other as most self-generating systems do. So what we're doing now is a function of trying to improve, we use the
phrase bandwidth and efficiency. So we're trying to lay more pipe and improve the efficiency and productivity of that
pipe.
So we're adding a lot of agencies and we're adding agencies in a strategic manner. Not just allowing them to grow and
develop wherever they want, but to thoughtfully pick geographic areas that have been underpenetrated in the past and
attempt to recruit in a more targeted way. So that would include some areas that historically we've shied away from,
some of the more non-urban areas, some of the heartland, the middle of the United States, some of the rural areas and
we're approaching that in a fairly thoughtful way using a bunch of different tools including our regular agency system,
but we're also using our Allstate auto dealer program which enables us to put Allstate agencies inside of auto
dealerships. We're also using selective independent agency expansion in some of those rural areas to maximize our
points of presence around the United States.
And then we're doing a tremendous amount of work to improve the productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of those
agents once they're there. And that includes some of the trusted advisor work you refer to where we're trying to take
away some of the low value-added work that distracts them, doesn't add value to the customer and just eats up agency
time. We're trying to use data analytics, emerging technologies as well as centralized support services to pull those out
of the agencies, free them up for more value-added advice, consultation and service on coverage options, and enable
them to really do what we think that we have as our competitive advantage, which is to have a local advisor in the
community who actually knows about those customers, can counsel them appropriately and form a relationship-based
business not just a transactionally-based business.
The last thing I'd point out on our growth is, that while Tom said it correctly, it's not all about price, it is to some extent
driven by our competitiveness and the way we approach the market and that's not just agent behavior, that's not just our
points of presence, but that includes the rest of the system. That includes our marketing effectiveness, our lead
generation capabilities, our ability to offer all the products those customers need, not turning any customers away and
letting them go to other companies for one of those products.
So that's where the homeowners – opening up homeowners expanding our product portfolio and including life and
retirement comes in. It allows us to serve the customers holistically, say yes to more customers and not turn many
away. It's where our new rating plans, which provide a – through broadening the target, allow us to offer a more
competitive price to a broader group of customers coming in. So I would say that the growth that we've achieved is a
product of all of those factors not any one in particular, not any one in isolation. It's one of the reasons that we feel
confident that is sustainable growth and will continue because it's not based upon one leverage, it's based upon the
system really functioning very effectively as a system.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's great, Matt. Thank you for being so comprehensive. Maybe just a quick question then
on margin expansion in Encompass and Esurance, I'm wondering if you guys could give us a little bit more sort of the
color, the back story sort of what's creating the opportunities here. And then help us understand sort of to what
long-term sort of goals we're trying to drive these two businesses to. I mean, when you look at public comps, people
make more money in the direct business if you're larger and more mature, and people make more money in a high net
worth business than you do. And I am wondering if you could long-term drive these two franchises to have profitability
to be in line with the core Allstate channel? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me make an overview comment, then Don and Kathy can say too. I would say what
gives us the opportunity as you appropriately classified it is that it's not good enough. So we have some work to do
there. But there are different stories, right. So Esurance we would like to continue to pick up share in that segment, so
we continue doing the best ahead of where other competitors would invest in terms of advertising as a percentage of
revenues. We could obviously make that business profitable by shutting down advertising and growth and we're
choosing not to do that because we want to grow in that segment.

The Encompass segment is a different story. It's much more competitive because you're inside the agency so you have
to be more careful as to how you grow there, and so that's a different set of stories. We are not explicitly seeking to
invest in growing share, we are investing to get profitable growth. So, Don and Kathy, maybe you can give the quick
answer to those two.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, Josh, as far as Esurance goes. I think we've been very consistent since we put the companies
together that our goal is to run the business in a way that's economically attractive over the lifetime value of the
business we're writing. That then tends to take out this accounting anomaly of the advertising which, because of the
direct model gets expensed immediately in the quarter it's spent. Even though it's designed to build value over the
lifetime.
So when you look at that equation of running the business on an economic value, I think you have to break out loss
ratio and I'll say advertising expense separately. On the loss ratio, we still have room to grow. That's what I said last
quarter too. We saw similar trends to the Allstate brand in the first quarter. And so, we're also accelerating rate
increases and taking underwriting actions and there is a need to improve the loss ratio in the Esurance brand over the
course of this year.
On the advertising side, it's a little bit more complicated. As Pat pointed out in his opening comments, there tends to be
volatility from quarter to quarter. Part of it is cyclicality, but part of it is what we're trying to accomplish. So last year in
the first quarter we spent a lot of advertising dollars because we were re-positioning the brand. This year we spent less
– you see in the expense ratio going down a little over 10 points. We still ran the awareness ads in the Super Bowl. In
fact, we ran two of them, but we didn't heavy up afterwards like we did last year because of re-positioning.
So when we talk about running Esurance on an economic value basis that includes advertising. So, on a year-over-year
basis, we continue to look at what the right amount is to make sure that the business we're writing is profitable. But
you'll continue to see some variation from quarter-to-quarter.
<A - Katherine A. Mabe>: Josh, this is Kathy Mabe. Thanks for the question on Encompass. You can see from the
investor supplement that we're starting to really lean into rates. And you can see it on page 13, but keep in mind, a lot
of our rate actions will come mid-year and in fourth quarter for Encompass. Part of what you're seeing, I think the best
way to tell the story is on page 18 of the investor supplement. And you can see that we made progress on the
underlying combined ratio by about a point, but there's a lot more work to do.
From a policies in force perspective, we're about flat with where we were a year ago. And what's driving the net written
premium change is a change in mix as we really put strong action in a couple of highly unprofitable states which have
high average premiums, and redirect growth to more profitable states, which have lower average premiums. These
actions combined will allow us to position Encompass for long-term success. So we're not looking at just short-term
measures. But how do we reposition – as Matt talked about, reposition the channel for long-term profitable growth.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's great, Don and Kathy. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Your question, please.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning, Allstate. I remain pretty confident that you guys know what you're doing
on pricing and will keep the margins within your targeted level on auto. I'm less confident that you can continue to
grow PIF at the current rate. And Pat, you said, I think in your script, that you don't think the PIF growth will be
materially negatively impacted. Where are we in the environment on pricing? GEICO's commentary in Q1 I think it's
helpful, they're going to be taking rate actions. Do you feel like you're with the field at the rate actions you are taking or
maybe pushing ahead a little bit and may lose some PIF momentum?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Bob. I think in terms of your level of confidence and the level of our
confidence, the first thing you have to get through: is this our problem or is this everybody's problem? If it's our

problem then obviously the actions we take will be different and the impact on shareholder value and long-term value
creation is different than if it's everybody's problem. If it's everybody's problem, then the actions we take and the
impact on both growth, profitability, customer satisfaction, ability to expand agencies is completely different. So we
feel like this is at this point everybody's problem. Matt can help you understand why we believe that's the case.
And if you look at the relative amount of increases necessary to account for increased costs of auto insurance, and that's
all we're talking about in this particular case is auto insurance, not the broad portfolio we have. If you're just talking
about auto insurance, it's relatively small dollars when it comes to amount per customer per year.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, Bob. It's Matt. Let me expand a little bit on what Tom just said. As we talked about
last quarter actually the frequency pressure is a combination of miles driven and weather. And I believe I said last
quarter we thought that miles driven was about three times as influential as the weather. That pattern seemed to hold up
again this quarter, but we want to validate that and verify it. And as Pat referred to in his opening remarks, we did a
very intense deep dive into our business to ensure that the increases in the frequency we're seeing are proportional and
consistent across multiple segments of the business no matter how you cut it, to make sure in effect that these aren't our
problems but are in fact, external.
And so, we looked at new and renewal business. We looked at higher growth states versus lower growth states. We
looked across quality characteristics. We looked across driver age, household composition, insurance scores, full
coverage versus liability, across different rating plans to see whether or not perhaps the rating plans had influenced it.
And all of that review showed that this trend is externally driven, primarily by miles driven. And then we wanted to
validate that. And so we've looked at external data on miles driven. The miles driven February year-to-date was 3.9%
above prior year. The 12-month moving average on miles driven is 2.8% above the five-year average. So we see it from
external data. And then, we're fortunate; because we keep our Drivewise device in the car for an extended period of
time, we're able to look at that data on an ongoing basis and so we have our own specific proprietary data that shows
miles driven up a consistent amount to what we see in external data sources.
So we validated it with our internal data. We validated it with external data. And then we look at other sources to
ensure that, that in fact is true. And I switch my reading material, if you look at CollisionWeek magazine, that
periodical, it reported January production for the auto body repair industry was 6.8% higher than January of 2014.
That's a huge increase for increased activity in body shops.
So we looked at that and then we looked on the weather side. And for those of you in the Northeast, you experienced
most of this. You experienced winter storm Juno. You saw the coldest February ever recorded in Connecticut and
Upstate New York. You saw the second coldest February on record in New York. You saw 200-car pileups in
Michigan in January, one of the largest on record. And so, we saw precipitation increases and freeze increases in the
first quarter that were pretty much unprecedented. So you look at all of that and you come to the conclusion that in fact
this is an external trend. So given that it's an external trend, we believe that our competitors will react to it the same
way we will react to it. I don't think they will react to it with the level of sophistication and granularity we might or in
the exact same ways, but they will have to react to the trends.
As I mentioned in my earlier response, competitiveness is not just rate, but if you do look at rate, we saw the auto
insurance CPI up 5.9% for March. 5.9% up from February's CPI of 5.6% and the 2014 full-year auto insurance CPI of
4.2%. So the average premiums paid by customers has been steadily increasing. Then we look at [ph] payer night
(39:13) and we look at competitor rate increases and we believe we're going to be part of the pack taking rate. So as a
result, it's going to come down to execution and not just execution on how we take rate and how carefully we do it, but
how we execute on the rest of the system, all those other factors, trusted advice from agents, service, product design,
excellent claim service, effectiveness of our advertising, the productivity and efficiency and the agencies, their ability
to close the business quickly and we feel confident. I feel very confident that the team will manage through this. I like
this kind of competition. I think we're very well suited to deal with it effectively and rise to the top in it. So it does not
concern us.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey, Bob. Let me add something on top of that. First, it's not one product and it's not one
market. So, because we have a couple of competitors where you can see their results and they are one-product

companies, we end up tending to focus on just auto. We have a broad-based growth plan, as Matt talked about earlier,
and so I just want to double underline what he said earlier which is it's broad-based.
Secondly, it's not just one market. Because we report the numbers on a country-wide basis we tend to have a
conversation there, but that's not the way the business has been run. So there are many markets. So if you look at the
top 11 states, 6 of them are growing at higher than 3%, but that also means that 5 are growing at less than 3%. In fact, 4
of them are kind of hovering around 0, I think, Matt. So we don't have to react, we don't react across the country. We
react to every local market and so the results you see reflect what we've been doing for the last couple of years and they
will reflect the way we go forward in the future.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?
<Q - Kai Pan>: Good morning. Thank you. And just to follow up on Bob's question, just in terms of the action plan
you are taking on the pricing side to mitigate some of the impact of rising loss cost trends, I'm wondering how much
price increase you need to have and if that price increase – do you forecast any further rising in terms of the mileage
driven? And also, in terms of the time, how soon can you get pricing into the system than stay filing on the others? And
then I just wonder are we going to see to continued higher levels of combined ratio than your desire over the next few
quarters as you are taking these pricing actions?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Thanks, Kai for the question. It's Matt again. I think as we pointed out in the investor supp
on page 13, footnote 9, April rates actually exceeded that of the entire first quarter. So it does take us a while to begin
to implement the rate increases. It's a process. We have to recognize the trend, we have to do the filing, we have to do a
careful, thoughtful approach to it to make sure we minimize the potential impact on growth and retention and then we
institute as quickly as possible. So, this quarter showed a fairly low level of filed and approved rates. It doesn't mean it
shows a low level of activity because you can't see the activity and that's one of the reasons we point out the April rate.
I would say that we are accelerating some of the rate that had been planned for the rest of the year but overall the levels
are not something that will shock the system where rate is not our only lever on managing loss cost. We look at things
like our underwriting guidelines, we have correct class programs to make sure we're getting paid the appropriate price
for the risk that we're taking on and we have expenses and we will continue to manage all those levers to ensure our
combined ratio stays within an appropriate range so that we earn an appropriate return on the business. I can't predict
where miles driven are going to go or where weather is going to go or what the unemployment rate is going to look like
over the next several months or year. I can say that we have a very good handle on the trend. We have a system that's
designed just for this in mind because it's a decentralized rate-taking system that looks at each individual geography
and manages rate-taking by that local geography. And so we're on it and we will continue to preserve margins.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me make sure we really focus on it. There's a statement made in there which I really
want to make sure you are really focused on which is from a shareholder value standpoint, our auto business generates
really good returns both over time and even in this quarter, okay? So 96.8 was higher than we would have liked in the
quarter but if you look over the last 12 months it's 95.6. That's a recorded number. That's not underlying, that's on
anything. That is a really good return on auto insurance. And so we want to make sure that we continue to earn that
return for our customers, and give that product to our customers at the right price so we earn a good return for our
shareholders and we don't feel like we're in a position where we have to react expeditiously because there is something
that is our problem.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Great. That sounds very comprehensive. My follow up is on your reinsurance strategy. It looks like
you maintained your retention $500 million. I just wonder, like a two direction on your reinsurance, given the
reinsurance environment, but now the pricing is affordable, and you have longer-term horizon like that seven-year
contract now. So, on one hand, is that – what's your strategy to further lower your volatility basically even reducing

your current retention level? On the other direction is really what about the coastal market if you can afford to buy
long-term affordable reinsurance, will be more interested in expanding into these markets? Thanks.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So I'll address that. This is Steve. I'll address that in a couple of ways. As you noticed, we
effectively placed the same program we did last year $500 million retention, the nationwide coverage, we kind of rolled
over the expiring contracts. We brought $300 million more of coverage as our business is growing. And as you noted,
two of the contracts above the nationwide program we placed for seven years in additional reinsurance market. So that
was a major breakthrough we think in terms of our coverage. You heard me talk in the past about we need 7 to 10 year
coverage to provide stability in the business for our customers. So, that we thought was a big breakthrough this year by
our team.
In terms of buying below, making that $500 million less, we looked at that, and given our capital base, we don't think
we need to do that. We're in a business to make good returns. We're making good returns in that business now and we
don't think that economically it makes sense to really bring that down much further.
In terms of the coastal business. Matt's talked off and on about the optimization of our exposure on the coast. We
continue to work on that in terms of our agency placement. In addition to just getting reassurance, we want to have the
people in place. We want to have the spirit of risk, not only the coast, but the Central part of the country, which
provides the most optimal – both reinsurance buy and the optimal economics for the business.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Thanks. Just a follow up on the reinsurance program. As part of it goes out seven
years, does that have positive implications for capital or is that layer just too small?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: The implication. This is Steve again. The implication is we have buy at a high enough level
to appropriately meet the capital tests that the rating agencies have. The seven years is really for us because it provides
stability on a capital base and for our customers.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Alison, this will be Tom. We are way underrated anyway so.
<Q - Alison Marnie Jacobowitz>: Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question please?
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Another quick follow up for Steve, just on the reinsurance
program. Could you guys give us a dollar amount or even just directionally what you expect to save on your
reinsurance program over the next 12 months?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So if you look at what we place in the rollover of our nationwide program, it's one-third of
that program, and market pricing today is 10% or 12% better than it was a year ago. We reinvested a good part of that
in buying this other $300 million of coverage at the top, so you shouldn't see a whole lot of savings. If you remember,
most of it actually just goes through our rates, so a little bit delayed basis, but more than 80% of our reinsurance costs
are baked into the rates. So if the reinsurance costs go up, our rates go up; if they go down, as they have for the last
handful years, our rates actually go down.

<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Got it. That's helpful. And, I guess, shifting gears to Allstate brand, just a little more color on the
0.8 point of unfavorable reserve development in the auto? It sounded like about half was ascribed to litigation
settlement accruals. I know that segment – it's been redundant for a while I think because of severity-related reserve
releases. I'm just curious what drove the rest of the noise there?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So let me look at it a couple ways. First, our reserves are appropriately stated in the balance
sheet where they are subject to multiple internal and external reviews on a regular basis. I just want make sure we get
that out of the way. Second, we do stay that way because we use a variety of reserving methods and we react quickly to
the underlying changes in the data we see.
So, on the first point, to reiterate that just slightly, the reserves are established by team under Sam Pilch, our Controller,
and under myself that's separate from our business units so we have independence in terms of within the company and
they're independently valued by both our auditors and on an annual basis by our appointed actuaries. So that's the
process to ensure the integrity of the reserves.
In terms of the changes, which is the second point, we use a variety of methods to enable the accuracy of our reserves
and when changes are made in the underlying data we react quickly. So take a look at particularly this quarter. As you
noted, about half of the unfavorable prior reserve adjustments related to litigation accruals, which really were for many
years ago. Secondly, that has to do with an increase in case reserves for our major medical claims and those case
reserves were increased earlier than our past patterns because of changes we made in our claim processes to both
improve our customer experience and better manage the claims. So while we believe that acceleration of what we think
would ultimately be an upward development in the claims, we increased our reserves for both last year – so the last two
or three years we had – and also this year's severity, given the long duration of the settlement of medical claims. So,
this increase was determined using a variety of methods. We continue to look at those and as the period of time goes
along we believe that the methods will come together as we do the final payouts and the cases are settled. Is that...
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Yeah, yeah, that's helpful.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Okay.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: And, I guess, I had one more, and it sounds like you guys are of the view that some of the
frequency blip might be an industry issue in general. And I'm just trying to understand why might we have seen this
more at Allstate now and perhaps not at a lot of peers? I'm not sure if it's geographic or anything along those lines. And
also just drilling down within the customer base, where are you seeing above-average increases in miles driven versus
below average?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think as it relates to competitors, it's hard to answer that question, right? So, you saw
Geico's Q, you can look at Progressive's numbers. It's always a question, in part, of like when do you start? Like, you're
looking at percentage ups versus absolute levels. So there is obviously some state mix in there, there's weather-related
mix, there's how you grow your business. So we can't answer the question as it relates to other people. We can answer
the question, which Matt talked extensively about, which is we don't see anything in the way we have done our
business, and we have the ability to slice and dice our data as if we were our own competitor, right, so we can slice and
dice it a whole bunch of ways and we do think it's comprehensive. Matt, I don't know if you want to take the second
piece?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: The second piece was – I'm sorry, where we're seeing miles driven? Miles driven is
essentially, I think, Tom in the last call referred to it as an indicator of economic activity and I think that's really a way
to view it. And so it's been very consistent when you look at miles driven in those regions of the country that have seen
an increase in overall economic activity, lowered unemployment rate or higher investment or higher home construction.
There's a whole bunch of different ways of looking at it, but economic activity has spurred miles driven, which has
spurred frequency.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your question please?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions here. Tom, how important is channel, so if we look
at like captive versus the independent agency channel, and your ability to push for pricing to offset the impact of these
loss trends that you've seen. It seems like retentions looked pretty good in the quarter, new applications were higher. So
I'm just trying to get an idea. I mean, is it really just a timing difference in your ability to kind of right size or do you
expect to start seeing some pressure from a ceiling on pricing?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Mike, I would start with it's really about best value for the customer based on what they
want. So if you look at the Allstate agency segment, they want local advice, they want a broad set of products and
services, and they obviously want a good price as well and so it is price-sensitive. But if you sell them two cars and a
house and a boat, and all kind of stuff, raising their price by $15 or $20 a year isn't going to change that relationship or
that value equation in a substantive way. So we tend to look at it in terms of what's the customer value proposition?
How do you give them the best value, that's what the quality of the service and the product is as it meets their needs.
And then what is the cost of that.
Obviously, the channel then subjects that value proposition to different levels of competition. So when you're in the
Allstate channel you're not really subject to competition from a whole bunch of other people because you've got that
local relationship. If you're in the independent agency channel there is more competition around that value proposition.
So it tends to be a little more price-sensitive up there, and those people that are in that segment tend to value brands a
little differently. It's sort of, if I know the company, that's good enough as opposed to, I really have a longstanding
relationship and I've been part of Allstate for a long time. That second person tends to be less price-sensitive.
So there tends to be more price competition in the upper left of our core quadrant, that's the independent agency
channel. There also tends to be a little more competition on the right-hand side of the page which is the self-serve
segment because the relationship is not as strong and they are doing a lot of the work themselves so they can go out and
get it. There still is in the branded segment, where Esurance is highly focused, a fair – a focus on am I getting the right
kind of product and service and is it easy for me, so it's not just how do I go get another $5 off on this price. I would
say the lower left tends to be the least price-sensitive segment out of all of them.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it, and then, I guess, for Matt, I mean – so taking that into consideration, I mean, you've
taken clearly some rate action in 4Q that you talked about and you took more in 1Q and then you took more in April.
Where are we in the process in terms of getting us back to kind of where we were before we saw this change in trend?
And have those actions now sort of addressed the issue at this point? And you mentioned pulling rate forward, should
we expect that you will continue to balance an opportunity for rate in the captive channel to sort of get yourself back to
where you want to be? And is the environment at this point conducive to that? Thanks.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Look, we are earning good returns. We're doing a great job for our customers. Our
customer Net Promoter Score is up, we're growing the business, we're getting good returns in the auto insurance
business. So I don't want the conversation to be too – like we are reacting to what is normal in any marketplace, in any
business which is, as you have your costs go up, you work to make sure that you are maintaining the returns where you
want them to be. The first quarter was a slight blip up, but we're doing what we normally do, which is what we are
trying to explain is we look to see is it our problem or everybody's problem. If it's everybody's problem, we'll just keep
compete and compete and keep growing. So I don't think this is about getting back to someplace versus being a place
we don't want to be.
We had good profits this quarter. We made really good returns in our homeowner business, in part because of low cats
but we didn't make as much money in Auto insurance this quarter in part because of weather, in part because we have
to adjust prices reflecting economic activity that the strength of what we've got going is we have lots of levers we can
pull whether that's by product, by channel, by customer segment; the we think about it to help us achieve what we are
supposed to do for our shareholders which is get a good return. The last 12 months we had a 13% return on equity and
we just gave back $1 billion in cash, so we think that's a pretty good offer.

<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: And then, just lastly, I guess just to follow-up. I mean, is there a tailwind from more
economic activity for your business? [ph] We've (59:22) sort of focused on the frequency impact but is there an
offsetting tailwind to premium or policies that we should think about as well?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, sure. There's a couple of tailwinds. As the country continues to grow, and given where
we are, we will continue to grow with it. The other part of that is in the investment portfolio, we are basically long U.S.
growth the way we positioned our portfolio that being shifting into more performance-based investments and keeping
our duration short in the investment portfolio. So, as growth goes up then you would expect to be able to earn higher
returns in our fixed income portfolio at some point in time and that would be a huge tailwind for us.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We'll take one more question and then we'll finish up.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question please?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thanks. I was trying to get your perspective on the underlying combined ratio? The guidance for
this year was 87% to 89%; the first quarter was 89%. I'm just trying to gauge your level of comfort to stay within the
outlook for the full-year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Jay, if we wanted to change it, we would have said we want to change it. I would point out
it's a full-year number. We are committed to that full year number. We see no reason to change that number at this
point. Obviously, you would prefer to start a year at the low end of your range rather than outside your range, which we
did not. Being at the high end of the range just means we have to continue to work to get our commitment done. I
would also point out that 90% of our business had an underlying combined ratio of 87.4 – that's the Allstate brand
piece, so we feel like we're in good shape. We're running the business we want to do.
Thomas J. Wilson
Let me close off, because I know you all have other things and we're appreciative of the time you give us. We had good
results this quarter, good balanced results. You can see the strength of the broad base of our business model, which is
not just one product, not just one customer segment, not just one investment offering and investment strategy. We have
a lot of levers we can continue to pull to earn good returns for our shareholders. We continue to generate not only good
returns on equity but also good cash returns for our shareholders and we expect to continue to do that as we move
forward. Thanks very much. Have a great quarter.
