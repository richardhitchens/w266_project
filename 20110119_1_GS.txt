Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?
David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our fourth quarter and full year
results and then take your questions.
My remarks today will be focused on our new segment disclosure that was discussed in our Business Standards
Committee report. The Business Standards Committee evaluated the firm's public financial disclosures with the
objective of improving our standards of transparency and disclosure by more clearly explaining our business activities
and performance and how they relate to serving our clients.
The committee recommended changing the firm's three previous business segments into the following four business
segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing and Lending and Investment Management. The
composition of the new four segments is described in greater detail in our 8-K dated January 11, 2011.
Full-year net revenues for 2010 were $39.2 billion. Net earnings were $8.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were
$13.18. These results generated an adjusted return of common equity of 13.1%, which is our reported return on
common equity excluding the U.K. bank payroll tax, the SEC settlements and the impairment of our New York Stock
Exchange Designated Market Maker rights. If these items are included, our return on common equity for 2010 was
11.5%. Over the past year, book value per share was up 10% to $128.72.
Fourth quarter net revenues were $8.6 billion. Net earnings were $2.4 billion and earning per diluted share were $3.79.
During 2010, market participants were faced with a series of broad macroeconomic concerns. European sovereign risk
came under heightened scrutiny periodically during the year. Investors have also been intensely focused on the U.S.
mortgage market regarding procedural concerns associated with home foreclosures and the potential for mortgage
put-back risk.
Throughout the year, global financial regulation continued to be a concern, specifically the implications of the
Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III.
Finally, the trajectory of the global economy was heavily debated and there were growing fears about the potential for
inflation in growth markets. The ultimate consequence of these concerns led to greater risk aversion and deterioration
in conviction among institutional investors, and thus a steady decline in client activity. This reduction of client activity
occurred across a broad set of businesses within Investment Banking and FICC and Equities client executions.
Despite the difficult economic backdrop and lower levels of client business, the firm produced a solid 13% adjusted
return on common equity, which is a testament to the strength and breadth of our client franchise and the commitment
of our people.
I'll now review each of our businesses.
Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 30% from the third quarter due to
significant increases in financial advisory and equity underwriting revenues. For the full year, Investment Banking net
revenues were $4.8 billion, down 3% from 2009, with a 9% improvement in financial advisory partially mitigating an
11% decline in underwriting.
Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter advisory revenues were $628 million, up 26% from the third quarter.
Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A globally for calendar 2010. We advised on a
number of important transactions that closed in the fourth quarter, including for Brookfield Asset Management, which
led to $24 billion restructuring of General Growth Properties; E.ON's $7.6 billion sale to PPL Corporation and United
Airlines' $6.5 billion merger with Continental Airlines.
We're also advisor on a number of significant announced transactions, including NSTAR's $17.5 billion merger of
equals with Northeast Utilities, Earl-Cali's $9.6 billion acquisition of Silvanee and Toronto-Dominion Bank's $6.3

billion acquisition of Chrysler Financial.
Fourth quarter underwriting net revenues were $879 million, up 33% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of
$555 million were up 79% from the third quarter, reflecting a significant increase in IPO activity. Debt underwriting
decreased 7% to $324 million, reflecting lower activity in investment grade markets.
During the fourth quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including AIA Group's $20.5
billion IPO, Renault's $4.2 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in Volvo and Hutchison Whampoa's $2 billion
investment grade issuance. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased compared with the end of the third quarter.
Let me now turn to institutional client services, which is comprised of FICC and Equities client execution,
commissions and fees, and security services. Net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Net revenue
generation within FICC and Equities client execution declined significantly as client activity leading into and through
the holiday season was low and exacerbated by several macro concerns.
Full year net revenues of $21.8 billion for institutional client services were down 33% relative to 2009 on lower levels
of client activity and tighter bid offer spreads. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the fourth
quarter, down 39% sequentially as client activity slowed meaningfully in the quarter.
Credit and rates net revenues, our most significant FICC client execution businesses, were down as macro uncertainties
led to lower customer activity levels and weaker revenues. Currencies and mortgages net revenues were also lower
sequentially. Commodity net revenues were up amid more favorable market conditions.
For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues of $13.7 billion were down 37% from 2009, as macro uncertainty
throughout the year drove lower client activity and led to tighter bid offer spreads.
Turning to Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues
for the fourth quarter were $2 billion, up 1% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues were down 10% to $772
million, reflecting lower net revenues within our derivatives business. A slight improvement in market volumes and
higher market values drove an 11% increase in commissions and fees. Securities services net revenues also increased
sequentially by 7% to $368 million, reflecting higher average customer balances.
For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $8.1 billion, down 25% from 2009 on lower market volumes in the
U.S. and client activity levels across the franchise.
Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the fourth quarter was $120 million, roughly flat with the third quarter.
Let me now review Investing and Lending, which produced net revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter. The firm's
Investing and Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity
securities, including private equity and real estate, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct
investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities.
Our investment in ICBC produced a $55 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of
$1.1 billion across both public and private equity investments and benefited from the significant increase in the equity
markets.
Net revenues from our debt investing and lending businesses were 537 million from interest income and tightening
credit spreads throughout the quarter. Other revenues of $330 million were primarily produced by the firm's investment
in consolidated investment entities.
For the full year, Investing and Lending generated net revenues of $7.5 billion driven by 747 million in gains from our
ICBC investment, $2.7 billion in gains from our other equity investments, $2.6 billion in revenue from our debt
investing and lending businesses and $1.5 billion from other investments. Significant increase in global equity markets
and tighter credit spreads provided a favorable backdrop for our Investing and Lending businesses in 2010.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 18% from the third quarter due
to higher assets under management and $310 million in incentive fees generated across the firm's alternative asset

products. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5 billion, up 9% from 2009 due to a favorable
change in the composition of assets managed and a significant increase in incentive fees.
During the fourth quarter, assets under management grew $17 billion to $840 billion. The increase was driven by $5
billion of net inflows reflecting money market inflows as well as $12 billion in market appreciation. On a full-year
basis, assets under management declined by 4% mainly reflecting industry-wide outflows in money market assets.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity reward and other items such as benefits, was down 5% to $15.4 billion. This translated into a
compensation to net revenue ratio of 39.3%, which is in excess of 600 basis points lower than our average
compensation ratio between 2000 and 2009. When adjusted for the increase in head count, compensation and benefits
declined in line with the firm's overall revenue decline.
Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were up 35% sequentially, largely in depreciation, amortization and other
expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased significantly to 725 million as the firm wrote down the value of our
New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker rights by $305 million in the quarter. The increase in other
expenses is primarily related to a $320 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund.
Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution.
As we discussed last year, GS Gives provides senior employees with a firm-sponsored mechanism for recommending
charitable contributions. This effort will continue to be focused on those areas that have been proven to be fundamental
to creating jobs and economic growth, building and stabilizing communities, honoring service and veterans and
increasing educational opportunities.
For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 14%. In 2010, non-compensation expenses included the $550
million SEC settlement and the $305 million impairment of our New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker
rights. Total staff at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 35,700, up 1% from the third quarter and up 10%
versus year-end 2009.
Our effective tax rate was 35.2% for the full year resulting in $4.5 billion in tax expense.
As you know, economic growth remains the key driver of our operating performance. As we've said in the past, a
strong and growing global economic environment usually translates into greater activity among our client base and
ultimately drives our business. The operating environment in 2010 was dominated by heightened uncertainty
surrounding the global economic outlook which contributed to a steady decline in activity levels over the course of the
year. While economic activities improved in recent weeks the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter combined with the
continued uncertainty surrounding the outlook makes future activity levels difficult to predict.
Longer term, we remain optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for the firm. Our optimism is rooted in our
belief that the firm will continue to expand with the growth of the global economy and the further development of
capital markets. In addition, clients' demand for our advice and execution capabilities remains unchanged. As always,
our global client franchise is central to our success. We believe our fundamental re-commitment to our clients and the
primacy of their interest coming out of the Business Standards Committee report will further strengthen our existing
client relationships and serve as the foundation to build new ones. We also remain committed to expanding our global
franchise and footprint.
Even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, we've continued investing in our client franchise and in new market
expansion. This commitment will enable the firm to continue its legacy of providing best-in-class service to our clients,
best-in-class returns for our shareholders and attracting and retaining the best talent in a competitive global
marketplace.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening day. I'm now happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, David.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. So, I hear your thoughts on the Financial Crisis Commission. I still – look, you
reset your disclosure to center around how activity is done for better clarity and I think we appreciate that. But without
the rules being set, is there a chance that as the rules are written, some things that are in Investing and Lending are no
longer permitted? Like, how do you think about how that business gets reshaped as the rules get set?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the way you asked the
question, Glenn, is there a chance that some things in Investing and Lending aren't permitted, the answer is yes. There's
a chance that some things in Investing and Lending aren't permitted. We don't know what the rules are going to be yet.
The report came out last night. We're still just going through it. So it's hard for me to give you a more definitive answer
on the question.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: There's a lot of things in that
segment that are basic lending to our clients. Some of our funds do nothing other than lend to our clients. Some of it is
investing alongside and in our clients. Which of those things are not going to be permitted? We're just not sure.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: So I'm assuming that in the Basel III changes, this is the segment that gets impacted the most by
both rule changes and cap to risk weightings. Are we going to I guess on the 10-K, are we going to get equity and
assets and P&L by the new business segments? Is that wishful thinking?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You're certainly going to get assets
by the new business segments and you're going to get P&L by the new business segments.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Well, that's a start. And any chance we get a preview on the Investing and Lending side? I
know that answer.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: If we had it for sure. If we had it in a
form that I was sure it wouldn't change, I'd give it to you. But we're not there yet.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We'll try and get there in the future,
but we're not there yet.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, maybe one more. Just the gross leverage is low. You're below 12-times, you're below
13-times if you just look at common. Curious on your thoughts on being able to move that a little bit higher? And I ask
because in a so-so world this year, you produced almost 100 basis point ROA, so a little bit more leverage and you
actually have a decent return.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's really, honestly, it's a question of
opportunities. If we – we're not artificially holding that down. We just have not seen the opportunities to do things that
would increase the leverage. If we see them, given the amount of capital we have, given the amount of liquidity we
have, we would take advantage of them.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: And just so I'm clear. You can do it if you want to. Meaning there's this couple of terms of
leverage are within your operating ability?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think we're – yes. Absolutely.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: On FICC during the quarter, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how skewed
the results were by month? And to what extent were either customer activity levels or just inventory valuation impacted
by what happened in the Muni market and in the interest rates market?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Let me do this in reverse order. The
Muni market, it's just not that big a part of our business. So it wasn't a positive for us, but it was a very immaterial
negative to the firm. Look, it was really customer activity levels more than anything else. And while you know I don't
like to talk about one month or another month, clearly in the month of December, things were just dead. There was just
very little activity.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And turning back to the, some of the more principal activities in the Investing and Lending
segment, you had debt securities and lending revenue of about $500 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion in the year. I
was hoping maybe you could better characterize that for us. Maybe a little bit to Glenn's point about things that might
or might not persist. I think investors really want to understand what types of revenue really are so lending driven that
we could really anticipate that they would not necessarily be affected by Dodd-Frank by Volcker rules?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, there's two things in there.
We're going to have to get back to you with the exact breakdown. One, you know we mark everything to market. We
mark our loans to market. So if we lend to someone and their spreads widen, we mark them down. If their spreads
narrow, we mark them up. Because we mark everything we have to market, loans, loan commitments, everything is
mark-to-market at Goldman Sachs. So that mark-to-market is in there. And interest income is in there as well. So we
lend to people, they pay us interest and that revenue is in there as well. So those two things are both in there in the debt
securities side.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yes. I understand. Again, there's just some aspects of some of that are more likely to persist,
we can assume, than others, but obviously there's a lot of rule writing in front of us.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: On the equity securities side within that Investing and Lending segment, can you – I mean,
we know that private equity and real estate as you said are in there. Where would we find things that we thought of
more as prop equity such as GSPS and statistical arbitrage?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Anything that you would consider
prop trading would be in the Other line in Investing and Lending, and most of that line is our consolidated investment
entities, which really are revenues which we have to take because of the accounting and they're largely offset by
expenses. So anything that you would consider as prop trading would be within the Other, and it would not be the bulk
of Other.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And, again, you say that the revenue that we see there is a revenue that's net of the
direct expense load?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, it's not net. That's the gross
number, the expenses within expenses.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. And in terms of the equity revenues that we saw for the year and the quarter,
the equity security, excluding ICBC, can you give a sense at the end of the quarter in particular for how much of that
was realized gains versus marks and a sense for the concentration within particular positions?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it's not heavily concentrated.
It's quite broad. I would tell you it was roughly equal between public securities and private securities. And I'm going to
have to get back to you on the private securities which how much was realized and how much wasn't. That I don't have
offhand.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Thanks. And then just one more question in comp, was there any significant change in
the cash/equity mix for the year?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Not really significant.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And was there a significant increase in the stock amortization component for the year
relative to what there was last year?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't think – I don't think it was
that meaningfully different.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hi, good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: On FICC you noted the lower client activity and the macro concerns a few times but I was
just hoping that you could touch on the competitive landscape and how you think the firm's market share has
potentially evolved over recent quarters.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Look, across the full year, I would
say the competitive landscape got much tougher. This was not a surprise. We've talked about it in the past. Certainly in
the early part of 2009 our competitors were hurt probably more than we were financially, were much less willing to
commit risk capital on behalf of clients than we were. I think we picked up quite a lot of market share. I think we told
you through last year we did not expect that market share would stay. I think we've kept a small amount of it, but our
competitors are stronger financially.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks, David. And then switching gears, as we're in the middle of the rule-making process
specifically for derivatives reform, I was just hoping you could provide some initial thoughts on the recent proposals
we've seen such as those for swap execution facilities, etcetera.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think it's just too early for me to
give you much. A whole big report came out last night, yesterday afternoon. We're still reading through it and as we get
more – as we understand it better, we'll get back to you on it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, great. And then the firm purchased some stock again this quarter to offset the share
issuance. How should we be thinking about potentially upsizing that to potentially just doing more than just offsetting
share issuance? Clearly you gave us a lot of detail on Basel III and the pro forma ratios last quarter and it looks like, as
all the other banks have kind of taken your lead that you're going to sit at the high end of capital for the group.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think we are – we're going to see
how the world unfolds. We're going to get – see how the rules are ultimately written, and then we'll see how that all

plays out with our capital ratios. If we remain this elevated hopefully we'll find – our number one choice will be to find
opportunities to use the capital profitably, and if not we would probably give some more back.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, thanks. And just final quick numbers question for me, just any impact of DVA this
quarter, David?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it was pretty small. There was
about $120 million loss and about I think three quarters of that was in FICC.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Yeah. Looking at that Investing and Lending line, the activities that would conceivably be
disallowed going forward, I guess my question is to what extent can you do all that in fund vehicles? And is it the same
from a client perspective and internal process perspective? In the past you used to be able to write a check from your
own balance sheet. Now you're going have to do it through a fund vehicle, where you presumably you'll have fiduciary
duties to the investors and all that. Does it change your relationship with the corporate clients to morph your business
model in the way that these regs are going to force you to?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would actually say it a little
differently. Most of the investing we have done over time has been through funds. There's been some on our balance
sheet, but most of it has been through funds. I think what the one thing we know the rules do, it limits the percentage
we can have in the funds to 3%. We have traditionally had more than that in the funds. We're going to have to have
smaller percentages than we've had in the past.
We'll still have some money so our clients will know that we're there, but I think the most important thing for our
clients is that we are still going use our franchise to find opportunities, which is what we've done in the past with the
funds. So I think the biggest difference is going be we know we have to have a smaller percentage of our own capital in
those funds going forward. Other than that, we expect we'll operate similarly, using the franchise to help source
opportunities for our clients, with some small amount of co-investment by the firm in the funds.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. And now another bank that reported earlier today kind of referenced that they were
hoping for a 25 or 30% payout of their earnings. I mean, whatever it is, whatever the regulators give the banks, fine. If
taking capital out of this Investing and Lending line frees up additional capital above and beyond, is it your
understanding that you're able to use that to retire stock? Or does it all get driven by this percentage of earnings ratio
that the Fed is talking about of 30%?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think over time, as long as we have
sufficient capital ratios and a sufficiently robust capital plan going forward, we should be able to manage our capital
prudently.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. And in terms of buy-back versus dividends, you're clearly tilted more towards
buy-backs rather than dividends, right?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We have generally been tilted more
towards buy-backs than dividends. Not one at the exclusion of the other, but more tilted towards buy-backs.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. Then finally, was there an impact or can you gauge what is the impact of the sheer rise
in U.S. bond rates in the course of the fourth quarter? It was a pretty violent decline in Treasury bond prices during the
period. To what extent was that a factor in the weak FICC trading results?

<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think it was a factor in that the
extent, you said the violence of the move especially moving when it did as we're getting towards the end of the year,
caused even more uncertainty, and caused more clients to sit on the side and say, let's wait until the year ends, let's see
how things unfold, and call me in January.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: But not necessarily positioning losses in the course of market making activity?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, nothing material. It was much
more client activity driven.

Next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Hey, good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Just on the topic of sort of reduced client activity I'm wondering how much do you think that
your businesses are impacted by externalities? For example, concern around OTC regulation? Otherwise it seems like
we're in a fairly robust GDP environment, a fairly normalized capital markets environment, certainly investment
banking, a lot of trading plus or minus certain segments. I'm just wondering if you think that we're in an unusually slow
period here that may be driven by customers shifting to maybe more listed liquid products, or cash instruments that are
less profitable?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I didn't say we were in an unusually
slow period. I said we had an unusually slow period in the quarter, because they're different. And I think that – I think
external events actually affect client philosophy a lot and client psychology and therefore their willingness to take risks
and their willingness to do that. I think some of the things that we saw over the course of the year when you had, as you
said, some concerns about regulation but also about Europe, about inflation, about many other things caused people to
be very unsure, even though we basically had a year where, for the most part, asset prices kept going up. It was not a
year where anyone felt confident asset prices were going to keep going up. And so I think that caused a lot of people to
sit on the sideline.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: But do you think like, for example, in the commodities business like energy and CDS, are
those businesses do you think being impacted by clients not wanting to trade OTC products given the pending
regulatory reform? Because it seems like that we've heard that. I'm curious your view?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think that there is more focus on
cash products than derivative products right now partially because of the concern and uncertainty around regulation.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Okay. And then as you think about your sort of the longer term, you touched on this a little bit
with some of the prior questions but sort of longer-term return expectations, say over the next three years, right? ROE
expansion. If you were to rank growing top line, reducing comp expense structurally further, or reducing the equity
investment of the business, how would you rank how those are going to contribute to rising ROE? It was particularly
relative to your 20% cross-cycle target?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I always think the most important
thing for growing ROE is growing top line. That's what's going to drive the business over time. We're not going to cut
expenses to being a successful firm over time. You might do it in a year where we don't perform as well, we'll cut our
comp. We've told you that. But over time what is going to drive the business of Goldman Sachs, what is going to drive

the returns to our shareholders is growing our top line revenue.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: So what do you think's really missing right now? I mean obviously derivatives is a slow part.
But the rest – what do you think's holding back that greater revenue producing capability?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think what we need really is
conviction on the part of our customers and clients.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Got it.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Some more level of conviction and
therefore wanting to really be active in the markets.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Okay. And just last question. Your liquidity position is still pretty high. I think we talked last
quarter, a lot of that is – or a decent amount of that is sitting in Treasuries. How should we think about that given that
Treasuries could be a negative-returning asset class?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's a drag on our return.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: There is no question having all of
that liquidity is a drag on our return. As you've heard me say, we think about everything in terms of risks and rewards.
And we think right now the risk of having too much cash and having somewhat lower returns versus not having enough
is very skewed towards having too much.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Does that show up in FICC or is it across the P&L?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's really across our inventory but
more of our inventory would be in FICC so more of that would be affected.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Right. Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: You mentioned Investment Banking – well, the Investment Banking pipeline being down. It
seems like there's still a lot of kind of client conversations going on out there. Can you give us a little color as to what
you're seeing as far as client conversations going? I'd be kind of interested in regionally; is Asia still where a lot of the
equity is coming from? And then even kind of within equity, are we continuing to move away from kind of bank recaps
into non-financial demand for equity?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Here's what I'd say. One, you always
have to be careful when we talk about the backlog. We tell you what it is, the backlog is probability-weighted revenues
that we're going to get. But things like the backlog is probably a reasonably good indicator when you're talking about
merger deals because they take a long time to go through backlog. It's not necessarily a good indicator on equity and
fixed income because many of those come up quickly, get executed quickly. Many of those come up and get executed
within the quarter.

So it's not necessarily that good an indicator. But I think in a way you answered much of your own question. There's
still a lot of dialogue.
I think in keeping with the answer I just gave, if there was more conviction, I think you'd see even more activity. So
there's a lot of dialogue, some of which turns into deals, some of which doesn't. And I think the equity markets continue
to be pretty good and pretty receptive and the debt market as well. So I think you'll see more issue activity. I think
you're going to see a lot of it coming out of Asia, as you've seen in the past.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: What do you think it takes to move the conviction toward more deals getting done?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think you need some final certainty
around regulatory reform, some people feeling a little bit better about how things are going to unfold in peripheral
Europe, and I think a little more confidence around inflation in the markets. I think you're seeing really – certainly in
the U.S., pretty positive economic data. So I think that – if that continues, I think that will help as well.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: And I guess finally, in the investment banking side, thinking about kind of debt underwriting. I
mean we've come from some very strong activity levels, a lot of pre funding. How do you think about the kind of
macro demand for where the supply side for debt underwriting is, given how strong the last couple of years have been?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think there's still plenty of demand.
If economic activity picks up, there will be plenty of demand for underwriting.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And then, quickly, you mentioned, when talking about client risk appetites, "Call me in
January." how are you seeing risk appetites pick up year-to-date? And it's anybody's guess, I guess, but how are you
looking forward in 2011 as well?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Again, you answered it well. It's
anybody's guess. You know I don't like to look forward. And two and a half weeks don't tell you a whole lot. And I
wouldn't say it's the best period we've ever seen, but it's sure a lot more active than December.

going forward. How should we think about that for 2011? And in what regions or businesses would you expect staffing
levels to increase?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's a very good question. I would
expect, subject to the economic environment not changing very dramatically, I would expect we will continue to grow
our staff. And it will be more focused on the growth markets than anywhere else, with some growth in other places as
well.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And in terms of business segments, is there any focus as well, specific focus?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would say there's probably more
focus on the investment management division than other places. But again, we would expect all the businesses to grow
somewhat.

<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And should we think about the staff increases in line with what we saw in 2010 relative to
'09?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would say somewhere in the mid to
high single-digits is what I would expect. But, you know, I'm almost certainly going to be wrong, either high or low, by
the time we get to the end of the year. But as we sit here today, that's what I would tell you.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And if I look at the FSOC [Financial Stability Oversight Council] study that came out last
night, it seems to me they do give some exact details of metrics that one should look at in order to determine prop
trading. And I was wondering how you think about these, because some of them to me seem to be realistic, some of
them questionable. Is there really any impact or really realistic to assess risk?

to really go through it in enough detail for me to respond.

breakdown between Basel 2.5 and how much it would be for Basil 3 now that we have the final rules?

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: What would FICC have been under your old reporting?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Because we're not doing our old
reporting, I don't have that, but we can calculate it and get back to you.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Right.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm going to guess, Mike, it would
have been in the range of $2.5 billion. But I can get – we'll get you the exact number.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And you've kind of alluded to it being a little bit worse than I think what you might have
expected. You said December was dead and the rise in the U.S. bond rates. How much of the lower than typical level
was due to structural changes or regulatory changes?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's impossible for me to answer that
question. I don't know why people were really sitting on the sideline. There was a lot of uncertainty. I don't think most
of it was due to structural changes. I think people are – you've heard me say this before. I think when we're through
with all the regulatory changes, people are still going to need the same things they needed before. So I don't think much
of it was because of that. But it's hard for me to answer your question.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And the cyclical part of the decline, the rise in the U.S. bond rates, you said things have picked up
here so far in January. Is that because rates are stabilized? What are some of the factors behind that?

<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think that there was so much
uncertainty – traditionally, things get slower at the end of the year. There was so much uncertainty in the macro
environment that it got even slower than usual. I think as we get to the New Year, people are coming back and are
wanting to be more active.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Shifting gears, the percentage of revenues outside the U.S. versus in the U.S. and linked-quarter
changes?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We've been running pretty much in
the mid-50s in the U.S and mid-40s outside the U.S.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And how are the growth rates for the recent quarter, U.S. versus non-U.S.?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It was right around there. Mid –
right around there. It's right around there pretty much for the whole year. I said mid to high 50s in the U.S., mid to
low-40s outside the U.S. Probably that being in the range of 60/40 Europe/Asia, outside the U.S. And those changed by
a few percent quarter-over-quarter, but it's not all that meaningful, when I give you a couple of percent change, because
you have a U.S. client doing an Asian acquisition, or an Asian client doing a U.S. equity offering, or a global book in
foreign exchange that moves around the world. So those are the rough numbers. They haven't changed very much.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: As it relates to activity levels, are you seeing any incremental pickup or decline in say Asia versus
Europe versus the U.S.?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No.

<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay. Okay. And then just thinking about China, we've seen a number of competitors start or
move from one form of business opportunity there into another. Do you think – is there an increase in competition from
non-Chinese competitors in that business? And does that imply that there could be some margin reduction in that
business over time?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No doubt there's an increase in
competition, and there's going to continue to be an increase in competition. I actually generally assume there will be an
increase in competition in all of our businesses everywhere in the world, all the time.
We had a multi-year start on our presence in China, along with one other firm. We knew other firms were going to get
there, and I think they're getting there now. I think that will lead to more competition and likely over time, although it
will take a while, that will lead to lower margins.
I think generally what happens is, as that happens, though, it is offset by a dramatic increase in volume as their markets
continue to grow. I think their capital markets will continue to grow. The growth rate in China is expected to be pretty
high. So I think the volume of activity will pick up many more times than the decrease in margins.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: Okay. And then a final question, just switching gears. In terms of S&P's recent commentary
on U.S. bank ratings, including some commentary about their view of investment banks being a bit riskier than a
traditional commercial bank, have you updated your thinking about how you're intending on maintaining your current
ratings?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would tell you, we do not share
their view.
<Q - Matthew Burnell>: And is that largely due to your capital position and liquidity?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll just leave it at we don't share
their view. And you know, as you saw, they kept our rating stable. Their most recent report on us talked about our risk
management, our capital and all those other things. And our expectation is that our ratings will reflect our performance
going forward.

<Q - Richard Bove>: You've broken principal transactions into market making, which is presumably your services to
third parties and other principal transactions.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Oh, the other principal transactions
line. That is primarily Investing and Lending.
<Q - Richard Bove>: Okay. The larger question is – I think what everybody's trying to get at is has there been a lack
of customer conviction in the last six months in the marketplace, or has there been a structural change in the
marketplace, which has got nothing to do with investor conviction?
I would point to the commercial paper market for asset-backed securities, which at the peak was 1.2 trillion in size, and
now is one-third that in size and is unlikely to get back to 1.2 trillion, because there isn't any major housing market out
there, there isn't any major ferment in CDOs squared or CDOs cubed, et cetera.
So what – where in the structure of the financial sector, as we see it, are there product lines that could in fact come back
to replace what I would consider to be a structural decline in a market like that? And I'm applying that to all financial
markets?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Your question is a very, very good
question, and clearly there have been some structural changes in certain parts of the markets. The real question is, are
they permanent? Are they temporary? I don't happen to believe most things are permanent. When you look over time at
financial markets, things get created. Sometimes they stay. Sometimes they get out of fashion and other things get
created to replace them.
There's going to be a housing market in the United States. In order for there to be a housing market in the United States
you need mortgages and you need financing for those mortgages. That's not going to go away. Is it going to be the
same type of securitizations that we saw in 2006 and 2007? Probably not for some period of time. I wouldn't say not
forever, but certainly not for some period of time, but is there going to be something to replace them to allow that
market to go on? Yes, there's going to be something. I don't know what it's going to be yet.
So it's a really tough question to answer. Some products that were in favor are now out of favor and are likely to stay
out of favor for at least some period of time. But other products will be developed to replace them.

up here so far, do you think it's just the seasonal factor? Or do you think there's really a, how robust do you think the
client conviction recovery could be here in the first quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't want to overstate it. We've
only, we're two weeks into the quarter. So anything can happen. All I can tell you is there has been a pick up from the
fourth quarter to the first quarter so far. It could change.

<Q - David Trone>: How about in the European credit markets?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think there's just been a pick-up of
activity everywhere. But again, it's just two weeks. I don't want to overstate that.
<Q - David Trone>: Right. Do you think that area has the biggest potential? Was that, that was particularly weak I
suppose, right?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think there are still a lot of
concerns about how, what the ultimate resolution is going to be in Europe. I think that's one of the things that's
weighing on people's conviction. I think it's one of the things that weighed on activity throughout the entire 2010.
<Q - David Trone>: Okay and then switching gears. The adjusted comp ratio, again you're below 40% for the year.
And I assume given the increase in deferred comp over the last few years you have some, a wave of tranche vesting
coming which will impact the comp expense. How do you think about that going forward?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The two things I would say, we don't
target a ratio, you've heard me say this before, we pay our people fairly based on their performance, based on the firm's
performance, the individual performance. And again I'm going to say something you've heard me say before we look at
compensation based on our performance, the competitive environment, the external environment, we take all those
things into consideration. And we paid what we paid this year. I can't tell you what it's going to be next year.
<Q - David Trone>: Okay. Is it reasonable to assume that all else being equal, the vesting, the increase in deferred
comp as it vests would be an upward pressure?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm not sure there's going to be that
much of an increase going forward versus where we've been. We've always used a lot of equity. It's always been pretty
high.
<Q - David Trone>: Okay. I think that's it. Thank you very much.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JP Morgan.
<Q - Steven Wharton>: Hi, David.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steven Wharton>: So I just want to follow up, it goes back to this question everybody's wondering about, how
much of this is just a temporary lull in activity due to client uncertainty and how much could be more structural? I
guess my question is when you gave your head count outlook, I think you indicated you'd be up this year. I assume you
budgeted for that, yet historically when you've gone into these periods of weak activity, you've seen the brokers cut
back sometimes in head count. So does this reflect your confidence I guess that this is temporary in nature? And at
what point do you kind of think about, well, because of whether all these regulatory changes or other factors, we need
to kind of re-evaluate the amount of heads that we have?
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Two things I'd say to you. First of
all, I talked about the fact that a reasonable amount of that is expected to be in the growth market. That's investment for
the long term. We think it's important for the long-term success of the firm. It might not result in revenues very quickly,
but we think over time it will be the best thing for us and our returns and our shareholders.
The second thing I would say is, if activity levels stayed where they were in the fourth quarter for a protracted period of
time, we wouldn't be growing our head count. We don't think that's going to happen. We think it was largely a seasonal

fourth quarter event. I can't tell you for sure. I don't like to make predictions. So we have to see. And remember, I said
that – I prefaced my comment on saying that I thought it would be mid to high single digits with assuming there was no
dramatic change in the economic environment. If there is, then I think that number will change.
<Q - Steven Wharton>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David A. Viniar, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You're welcome.
