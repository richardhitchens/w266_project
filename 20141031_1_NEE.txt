Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had a very good quarter with strong performance at
both FPL and Energy Resources. At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased approximately 6% over the
prior-year comparable quarter, driven roughly equally by our continued commitment of new capital to the business and
by growth in wholesale power sales.
Operationally, our performance was strong despite a challenging period of summer weather as our investments in our
transmission and distribution network are helping us deliver improvements in our system reliability. We continue to
make good progress on the third of three generation modernization projects at Port Everglades, which remains on track
to achieve commercial operation in mid-2016.
Our gas reserves petition advanced through the regulatory process and we expect the Public Service Commission to
consider the matter in early December, which we except will permit a decision either late this year or early next year.
Also, during the quarter, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Commission's decision to approve our
2012 rate case settlement. The court's order comprehensively rejected all the arguments raised by the Office of Public
Counsel and made it very clear that as long as the PSC follows appropriate procedures as it did in 2012, it has wide
latitude to determine whether a settlement agreement is in the public interest, taking account of all the prevailing facts
and circumstances.
We believe this is a very positive development that will encourage and support our efforts to negotiate future settlement
agreements that, like the 2012 agreement, had new and innovative elements in them.
Energy Resources had an outstanding quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased roughly 16% over the prior year
comparable quarter, primarily as a result of additional investments in our contracted renewables business. And the
business enjoyed great success in terms of new renewables origination activity, signing contracts for a total of
approximately 445 megawatts of new wind and solar projects. Beyond this, we see strong prospects assigning another
600 megawatts to 800 megawatts by the end of the year. It was an excellent quarter for new origination activity with
very strong near-term prospects.
At NextEra Energy Partners, operational performance during the quarter was solid and cash available for distribution
was in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NEP board declared an initial quarterly distribution of $0.1875 per
common unit or $0.75 per common unit on an annualized basis.
And just as important, we have made excellent progress around key decisions that will affect the future growth
prospects for NEP. The Conflicts Committee of the NEP board, composed of independent directors, reached an
agreement with the sponsor to acquire two additional assets from the Energy Resources portfolio. And more generally,
we completed the first phase of our ongoing analysis of future growth and concluded that it's in the interest of both the
shareholders of NEE and the LP unitholders of NEP to undertake a short-term acceleration of the NEP growth profile,
while still preserving the expectation of continued long-term growth in the 12% to 15% per year range for many years
to come. I will provide more details on each of these later in the call.
Overall, we are very pleased with our progress this quarter.
Now, let's look at the results for FPL. For the third quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $462 million or $1.05
per share, up $0.06 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business and an expansion of wholesale
operations were the two principal drivers of growth. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $670 million, and
we expect our full-year capital investments to be roughly $3.1 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 5.2% over the
same quarter last year.
Our principal current generation initiative is the Port Everglades Energy Center, which will deliver fuel efficiency
savings and emissions reductions to our customers when it enters service into 2016. This approximately $1 billion
project remains on schedule and on budget. We are also focused on investing in our transmission and distribution

network to improve its resilience during severe weather such as hurricanes, as well as to provide increased reliability to
our customers on a daily basis.
As I mentioned earlier, this year presented one of the more challenging periods of summer weather and what we are
seeing in terms of our ability to improve our already outstanding reliability is encouraging. Comparing against years
that have had similarly challenging weather, we estimate that the reliability of our network, measured in terms of
system unavailability, has improved by 10% to 15%. This means fewer minutes of interruption for our customers and
lower outage repair costs for the company.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended September 2014 will be approximately 11.4%. As
you may recall, for prior quarters, this includes the impact to transition costs associated with our enterprise-wide
productivity initiative, Project Momentum incurred late last year.
The impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory ROE as we move through the year, since
the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12-month trailing basis. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been
11.5% and this remains our target for the full-year 2014.
As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined
regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period, in this case, the 11.5% that I previously mentioned, excluding
special charges such as the Project Momentum transition cost.
During the third quarter, we reversed all $131 million of reserve amortization that we had taken this year through June.
The need for reserve amortization is generally the lowest in the third quarter, since the third quarter is typically our
strongest in terms of revenue. And our non-fuel O&M expenses in the third quarter of this year were actually lower
than in the third quarter of 2013, reflecting the excellent results of our productivity improvement initiative, Project
Momentum.
Relative to our expectations at the time we first discussed Project Momentum in the spring of 2013, we are seeing
earlier delivery of results and likely greater overall savings. Incidentally, our ability to shift focus to a comprehensive,
multi-year effort like this is just one example of the benefits that will flow to customers over time for the settlement
agreement like our 2012 rate agreement.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to further reduce the amount of reserve amortization by reversing some of the
amortization that was taken in 2013 in the first year of the settlement agreement. As a reminder, we utilized $155
million of reserve amortization during 2013. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to be able
to reverse a third to a half of that amount in the fourth quarter.
The economic recovery in Florida remains solid. A focused effort of the state's leadership on economic development,
along with a consistent improvement in the business climate, has helped to drive growth in employment. The number of
jobs in Florida as of September was up 206,000 compared to a year earlier, an increase of 2.7%. Nearly 700,000 jobs
have now been added since the bottom of the downturn in 2009. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in
September was 6.1%, down 0.8 percentage points from a year ago.
As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels, albeit lower than our recent peak.
The Case-Shiller Index of South Florida shows home prices up 10% from the prior year and mortgage delinquency
rates continue to decline.
Turning now to our customer and usage metrics. FPL's average number of customers in the third quarter increased by
82,000 or 1.8%, with an estimated impact on sales of 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, the estimated impact on sales is
slightly lower than the customer count growth because the remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our
smart meter program continues to account for a portion of that customer growth, as these new customers are
disproportionately low usage and residential.
We began deploying the remote connect and disconnect switches in the third quarter of 2013 and were fully deployed
by the end of the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect the growth in customer count year-over-year to revert in
coming quarters to an underlying rate of about 1.3% to 1.5% or 60,000 to 70,000 customer additions annually.

Overall usage per customer grew by 1.9%, of which weather accounted for roughly 0.8%. Weather-normalized, usage
per customer increased 1.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This was a very strong rebound from the
year-over-year decline in the second quarter. But as we have often said, this measure can be volatile on a quarterly
basis. Through the period of the rate agreement, our expectations of underlying usage growth are unchanged at
approximately 0.5% per year.
The average number of inactive accounts in September declined 20.8% from the prior year and the percent of inactive
accounts is now at a level well below the 20-year average. As of September, the 12-month average of low usage
customers fell to 8.0%, down from 8.3% in September of 2013.
Before leaving FPL, let me update you on the two capital initiatives that we discussed in the spring of last year that
have been pushed back a bit. First, we are continuing to monitor the actual emissions profile of our peaking units in
Broward County. Based on the results of this testing, we will determine what the most cost-effective upgrade path will
be for our customers. We continue to expect to need to modernize and upgrade these assets, but the exact size and
scope of the project remains uncertain. Construction is not likely to start before 2016.
Second, since completing our first 110 megawatts of solar in Florida, we've been working hard to identify ways in
which we can cost-effectively introduce more solar capacity into our system. Distributed solar, especially residential,
remains extremely high cost relative to our efficient generation fleet and will only serve to drive up customer rates if
pursued in any quantity.
Even utility-scale solar, which is by far the most cost-efficient way of adding renewable energy in our service territory,
is not yet at a stage to be generally cost-effective across our entire service territory. However, we've continued to work
to identify specific opportunities and now believe we can bring forward three roughly 75-megawatt solar PV projects
that can take advantage of the 2016 ITC window, leverage available land, transmission capacity, as well as prior
permitting and development work, and that will prove cost-effective for our customers.
We expect to bring these projects into service in 2016. Moreover, we continue to believe that with reasonably
foreseeable continued improvements in solar economics, there could be greater potential for utility scale solar by the
end of the decade.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $204 million or $0.46 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $231 million or $0.52 per share. Before reviewing the details, let me
provide a reminder about the interrelationship between Energy Resources and NEP. As you know, the launch of NEP
closed on July 1. Energy Resources will continue to consolidate NEP for accounting purposes. But beginning with this
quarter, you will see a deduction for income representing NEP LP unitholders' interest in NEP's results.
Energy Resources' adjusted EPS increased by $0.07 per share year-over-year. The contribution from new wind and
solar additions placed into service during or after the third quarter of 2013 was $0.09 per share, and this continued
growth in our contracted renewables business was the primary driver of Energy Resources' growth.
Our customer supply and trading business had a modest positive increase in contribution of $0.03 per share, driven
mostly by favorable summer results in retail and wholesale full requirements. A mild summer is typically favorable for
these parts of the portfolio.
Wind resource came in at roughly 95% of the long-term average, which was roughly comparable to last year and the
existing asset portfolio added $0.01 per share overall. Offsetting these gains was a $0.03 per share decline in
contribution from our gas infrastructure business due to increased depreciation expense, primarily related to higher
depletion rates. All other factors reduced results by $0.03 per share.
For the full year, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View Solar Project
and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to
roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects.

As I mentioned earlier, the team has driven significant growth in our portfolio of contracted renewables opportunities.
Let me spend a bit of time now on where each program stands. Our total 2013 to 2016 U.S. solar program is now
roughly 1,400 megawatts. This includes roughly 304 megawatts newly added to the backlog since the last call and is
approximately 300 megawatts better than the high end of our expectations at the time of the March 2013 investor
conference. All of these new projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016. There are also a number of
other projects that we continue to pursue and we now believe that our total 2013 to 2016 U.S. solar program could be
1,600 to 1,800 megawatts.
Turning to our wind programs, our U.S. development program for 2013 to 2015 is now nearly 1,900 megawatts. This
includes 91 megawatts newly added to the backlog since the last call. Based on everything we see at the moment, we
now believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could exceed our previously stated range of up to 2,500
megawatts. In Canada, we added a new approximately 50-megawatt project to the backlog, which we'd expect will
enter operations in 2016.
Since the last call, we've brought into service roughly 75 megawatts of solar, 199 megawatts of U.S. wind and 133
megawatts of Canadian wind, a total of over 400 megawatts. Not only are these very attractive assets in their own right,
but we also believe that we have unlocked the potential to better highlight their value by isolating a portion of the
portfolio and making the cash flows visible to investors through the creation of NEP.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. During the third quarter, NEP's initial portfolio delivered cash available for
distribution or CAFD of $27 million, which was is in line with our expectations. Full financial results will be available
when we file the 10-Q. The assets operated well and wind and solar resource remain normal. Overall, there's nothing at
this time that causes us to change the expectations that we have previously shared for these assets for the 12-month
period ending June 30, 2015.
As I mentioned earlier, NEP has entered into agreements to expand its portfolio through two project acquisitions from
NextEra Energy. The first of these is Palo Duro, an approximately 250-megawatt wind project in Texas that will sell
100% of its output under a 20-year PPA. It is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2014. Palo Duro is not
part of the ROFO portfolio. We expect to earn PTCs on the project and to enter into a differential partnership or tax
equity structure that we expect will make the project very attractive to NEP investors. In essence, we expect our tax
equity partner to make a portion of their contributions to the project through ongoing payments in exchange for
receiving PTCs. We expect this to result in an overall project cash flow profile that fits the NEP model.
The second acquisition is Shafter, a 20-megawatt solar project in California that will sell 100% of its output under a
20-year PPA. It's expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2015 and is a part of the ROFO portfolio. NEP
expects to acquire both projects in the first quarter of 2015 for total consideration of approximately $291 million, plus
the assumption of approximately $250 million in tax equity financing, which is expected to close in December for Palo
Duro and subject to working capital adjustments.
The $150 million of primary proceeds retained from the IPO will support a portion of the acquisition. The remaining
consideration of roughly $141 million will be financed in the short term through the utilization of NEP's revolving
credit facility in addition to cash on hand at the time of the transactions. Since the revolver is not expected to be utilized
for longer-term capital requirements, we expect to replace this interim financing with equity and, potentially,
incremental project debt at some point in 2015.
NEP expects the impact of these acquisitions to increase 2015 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD by roughly $50 million to
$70 million and $15 million to $25 million, respectively and to increase the annual run rate of adjusted EBITDA and
CAFD by roughly $65 million to $75 million and $20 million to $30 million, respectively. We expect additional
acquisition opportunities to become available as well and I will talk more in a moment about our current thoughts on
overall expected growth.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2014, GAAP net income
attributable to NextEra Energy was $660 million or $1.50 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 third quarter adjusted
earnings and adjusted EPS was $688 million and $1.55 respectively.

Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of
2013. The development of both Sabal Trail Transmission pipeline and Florida Southeast Connection pipeline continue
to progress well through their respective processes. Florida Southeast Connection filed its FERC certificate application
in September 2014 and Sabal Trail continues to refine the route with the expectation to file its FERC certificate
application in November 2014. Both projects expect FERC authorization by year-end 2015 to support commercial
operation by mid-2017.
During the quarter, we completed the formation of our Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture with EQT Corporation.
In addition, the joint venture completed a binding open season for the roughly 300-mile natural gas pipeline designed to
connect the Marcellus and Utica shales with markets in the Southeast region of the U.S., in order to support growing
demand and improvements in reliability.
After concluding the open season, the project has secured approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity
commitments. Based on our expected ownership share, the expected size of our capital opportunity is approximately
1.0 billion to 1.4 billion. Both companies have received board approval to move ahead with the project.
Looking ahead, at NextEra Energy, we continue to expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 and this
range includes the negative impact of about $0.15 associated with the launch of NEP that we discussed in the second
quarter earnings release. Having completed a closer review of the 2015 outlook, we now see a range of $5.40 to $5.70
as being reasonable.
We expect to see a few cents of drag associated with the combination of the accelerated transfer of assets to NEP,
which I will discuss further in a moment, as well as higher capital spending associated with a more rapid evolution of
the Energy Resources backlog. The accelerated transfers would give us more equity than we need to maintain our target
credit metrics, other things being equal. And we can utilize this extra equity to support the additional CapEx without
recourse to the equity market. These effects are reflected in the $5.40 to $5.70 range.
In the slides accompanying today's presentation, we have also provided new disclosure for our expectations for the
Energy Resources portfolio, focusing on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash flow for 2015. Please note
that this view of 2015 does not yet reflect the impact of the anticipated accelerated growth at NEP.
For 2016, we are maintaining our current expectations of $5.50 to $6.00 for the moment, and we expect to be able to
provide an update with the fourth quarter earnings release in January. As always, our expectations are subject to the
usual caveats including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions.
Starting in 2016, we expect to see, reflected in GAAP income, the effects of asset transfers to NEP. Because of the
subordination provisions governing NEE's LP units, gains on these transfers are currently deferred until one year after
NEP pays distributions at a level of $1.13, corresponding to the high splits in the IDR structure. At that point, we
expect to start amortizing any gains from sales of assets to NEP over the life of the assets.
Looking beyond 2016, while we are not yet in a position to provide a specific numerical range for earnings, it is clear
from the development of our capital deployment initiatives that we are well positioned to sustain our strong growth
profile. We expect to be able to sustain the 5% to 7% per year growth in EPS off a 2014 base at least through 2018,
assuming all our capital initiatives continue along their current path. In addition, everything we see suggests that our
operating cash flow will continue to grow more rapidly than EPS during this period, and we expect the average growth
of operating cash flow in the 8% to 10% per year range through 2018.
With the proposed acceleration in the growth of NEP, which I will detail in a moment, we should also see the IDR cash
flow stream at NEE grow rapidly so that by 2018, this could amount to somewhere between $75 million and $100
million per year. This is included in our overall expectations of cash flow growth.
Turning now to NEP, we expect the initial portfolio to deliver roughly $270 million to $280 million of adjusted
EBITDA in the first 12 months, yielding cash flow – cash available for distribution or CAFD of nearly $85 million to
$95 million. For the full-year 2015, taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating, we expect
the NEP portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120

million.
This would support a distribution level at an annualized rate of 1.125%, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR
splits by the end of 2015 or possibly slightly earlier. Again, the disclosure in the appendix does not yet reflect the
impact to this acceleration of growth at NEP since we have not yet determined the specific projects that will be made
available to NEP. We expect to update our disclosure when a more specific plan is in place. After 2015, we currently
see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations for at least the next
five years.
Let me now spend a moment explaining our logic for accelerating the short-term growth of NEP and why we think it
will be good both for NEP LP unitholders and for NextEra shareholders. We have spent the last few weeks examining
in more detail different scenarios for NEP acquisitions of Energy Resources projects. We've also spent considerable
time asking questions of our investors and considering their input. While we retain accountability for our decisions, we
recognize that many investors have been thinking about the same issues, and we value the input we had received.
We recognize that other things equal, if there is value to be created by transferring an asset to NEP, in general, it would
be better to do so earlier rather than later subject to the project being sufficiently far along in development and
construction to fit the NEP competitive model. At the same time, NEP's competitive positioning is strongly supported
by the long runway of growth that it can reasonably expect to offer investors, given the large portfolio of Energy
Resources projects that it can hope to acquire.
As we have studied the portfolio more closely and considered how it may evolve, we have come to the conclusion that
we can support a short-term acceleration of growth, while still preserving reasonable expectations of growth in the 12%
to 15% per year range for several years thereafter. We think this profile is more attractive to NEP investors than simply
continuing the 12% to 15% growth rate and maintaining more assets in the Energy Resources portfolio for a longer
period of time.
Two factors in particular have changed since we launched NEP. First, as we've discussed, we've been working on a tax
equity structure that we now think will enable us to make some projects available to NEP earlier than we had
previously expected, and of course the Palo Duro project discussed earlier is an example of this.
Second, again, as discussed earlier, the development pipeline and backlog at Energy Resources have continued to
evolve in a very positive fashion over the last few months, and nothing has changed our view that the longer-term
prospects for renewables development in the U.S., particularly with the prospect of EPA regulation of carbon dioxide
emissions are very favorable.
These factors, in our judgment, support an acceleration of NEP growth. From an NEP LP unitholders perspective, there
are two other secondary factors that also support this proposed shift. First, investors have noted that NEP currently
offers limited liquidity simple because of its size, and accelerating the growth in the short term should improve
liquidity.
And second, although the initial portfolio is broad and diverse, accelerating the growth will enable the portfolio to
become broader and more diversified, which again, should be a positive for NEP investors. Finally, from a NextEra
Energy shareholder perspective, accelerating the growth of NEP will also mean that the upper tier of the IDR splits will
be reached more rapidly than we had originally thought.
While this doesn't change the fundamental value proposition, we think it will serve to highlight a portion of the NEE
value proposition, which perhaps today is not widely recognized among NEE investors. We estimate that the IDR cash
flow stream could be worth $5 to $10 per share later in the decade.
For all these reasons, we have concluded that accelerating the growth of NEP over the next 12 months or so, while still
retaining reasonable expectations of sustained growth in the 12% to 15% per year range for several years thereafter,
makes sense for both sets of investors. At this point, we are not prepared to discuss the specific assets that NEP expects
to acquire, as we are still working through the details. However, this accelerated growth profile is still likely to be
dominated by the same kinds of high-quality, long-term contracted renewables projects that characterized the initial

portfolio. Longer term, it may well make sense to broaden the NEP portfolio into new asset classes, but for the short
term, we believe continuing to focus primarily on renewables projects makes sense.
To sum up, both NEE and NEP had excellent quarters. Current performance is strong. The outlook at least through
2016 is highly visible and we continue to believe that we have some of the best long-term growth prospects in our
industry. All this is supported by a very strong financial position, which we expect to maintain. Our fundamentals are
excellent and our growth initiatives continue to evolve in a very positive fashion.
With that, we will now open the line for questions. Since this is a combined conference call for NextEra Energy and
NextEra Energy Partners, it will be helpful if you can be clear which entity you're referring to in your questions. Thank
you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Moray, I wanted to explore the PTC structure that you outlined that could permit perhaps
more assets to be dropped down to NEP earlier than we had expected. Can you generally speak to the – you mentioned
some of the assets could be eligible. Is this something we should be thinking of as fairly broadly eligible for your assets
with PTCs or is it a more limited field of assets? Just trying to sort of generally get a feel for how significant this
structure is.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. I guess the first point to be made is it applies to new projects going forward. So
anything that's already in the portfolio either has a structure against it or probably is fairly far along in its 10-year
window of eligibility and it wouldn't make sense for us to go back to some of those. But potentially for all PTC projects
going forward, subject to available market capacity, this could be applicable.
Now, when I say available market capacity, the tax equity market is a relatively specialized part of the overall capital
access possibilities that we have available to us. And the capacity of that can vary from year to year. So depending
upon just how much capacity there is would determine really how much we can do in any particular year. But I think it
could be quite broadly applicable going forward.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's helpful. And then just looking at the wind business, obviously you've had some great
progress in terms of additional contracts, and it looks like the outlook is positive for additional contracts. Could you
speak broadly to which parts – within the U.S., which parts of the U.S., which regions look most attractive in terms of
growth? Is it more the Upper Midwest, more Texas or – which parts of the country are you and your colleagues seeing
the most opportunities in?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. I'm going to ask Armando to offer a few more, a little more color. But broadly
speaking, our development efforts have been and will continue to be concentrated on the best wind resource areas
because that drives the best economics. And that tends to be all up and down the middle part of the country, but
Armando can speak more specifically to some of the areas we're focused on.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Sure. I think it's – number one, it's the middle part of the country. I call it the Midwest, but
I'm not a geography teacher. When I talk about the Midwest, it's a very broad section, starting up in the Dakotas going
all the way down to the Texas region, including a little bit of Colorado. But I wouldn't include the Northeast in that. So
it's a wide area. We've developed very well in that area in the past and we continue to do well. I think what you'll see as
some of the newer projects come forward that we do have now some projects actually out in California, some wind
projects that are starting to make sense. And we continue to look at the Canadian development for new projects and just

this past quarter, were able to sign another 50-megawatt PPA.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. Stephen, just to add on, we have traditionally not focused a great deal of effort on
the Northeast, in the East Coast, and that continues to be the case. The development challenges are greater, projects
tend to be smaller and the wind resource tends to be weaker. So the overall economics get much more challenging. So
we tend to go where the economics are most favorable.

Operator
And we'll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: It was a very good job with the pipeline additions on the renewable side at NEER. Can you
maybe talk a little bit more, A, on the wind side, if you're going to qualify for the PTCs or if you need an extension on
PTCs to hit the upper end of the new guidance range? And then on the solar additions, kind of what markets you're
seeing better opportunity or you've been able to add more significant backlog?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. Again, I'll ask Armando to comment.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: All right. Good morning, Dan. Everything that we announced today on the wind side,
including the potential to go over the high end of the range is – would be built in 2015, and we feel – or by the end of
2015, and we feel very comfortable that they would all qualify for the production tax credit.
Interestingly enough, I'd say over the last two to three months, we've started to get into discussions with some
customers that are looking for 2016 wind. Now, obviously, those contracts, if we sign them with those customers,
would be PTC-contingent. But everything that we talked about today would be built by the end of 2015 and would
qualify for the PTC.
In terms of solar, I'd say it's just about everywhere. We're seeing good activity all the way from the South, and from the
South, I would mean anywhere from Texas, all the way really to the Southeast, Southeast United States. But we're also
seeing interest really because of the improvement in economics, the reduction in the panel prices, the reduction in the
balance of plant, we're seeing interest all the way up to the Canadian border, which is a positive.
The contracts that we announced today, we announced I think roughly 304 megawatts of new projects, those projects
span from California all the way to the Southeast United States.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Very good. And then, Moray, on the 375-megawatt projects at the utility, can you remind
us how those will go into rates or how you guys will get recovery on those in the midst of the four-year deal you have
in place?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: We would not be looking for any adjustment to the rate agreement, so we will live with
the base rates that we have in place.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.

Next, we'll take our question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi, Moray. How are you?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Just first question, and I'm not sure if you can answer this now, but you mentioned the 5%
to 7% long-term earnings growth, about 8% to 10% long-term cash flow growth. Could you maybe give us some sense,
or if Jim's there, when you were thinking about dividend policy, are you going to focus more on earnings growth or
cash flow growth?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: If you recall how we got to – the logic that got us to the current target, 55% payout ratio, it
was fundamentally based on a shifting portfolio mix. So with the portfolio shifting to a higher concentration of
regulated and long-term contracted assets, we felt that that supported and justified a slightly higher payout ratio than we
had had in the past. If you carry that logic forward while the same trend continues from 2014 on, it's at really at a
slower pace.
So, at this point, I don't see a particular logic for recommending a change in that payout ratio with one possible
exception, which I'll come back to in a minute. But assuming that we go on that obviously means dividend growth
roughly in line with EPS growth.
The exception that I have noted on a couple of occasions is should we, at some point in the future, get to a position
where capital deployment opportunity sets starts to slow down, then the rapid growth in the cash flows would quickly
move us into a free cash flow positive position. And if we saw that being a sustained phenomenon for multiple years,
then in that circumstance, I think we would be inclined to recommend an increase in the payout ratio.
So I think those are kind of the two broad policy things to keep in mind. Obviously, we are always sensitive to the
overall dividend position and how it compares with other companies that we're competing for capital against. So we'll
always be taking that into account. But from a policy perspective, those are the two points I would make.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then I guess a question, maybe this is for Jim. Just historically, well you talked
about the 5% to 7% growth and Jim said several times he'd be disappointed if you didn't hit the upper end of that, is that
still the view and just with all these kind of different moving parts, seems like you're executing really well on the
growth investment. Is that going to show up into kind of what you've said on getting to the higher end?
<A - James L. Robo>: Yeah. Steve, I will continue to say that I'll be disappointed if we don't in 2016 earn at the top
end of the range at $6. And we'll be giving an update on that 2016 guidance in January, as Moray said earlier on the
call.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. One last quick thing. On the Florida solar and you might have answered this, but
how would those projects work? Would you just do them and sell the utility under just the current rates, or would you
look for like a solar clause or something of that sort?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, no. They would be recovered within the current base rates. Obviously, we got to make
sure that they are the most cost effective solution for our customers. We're pretty close on that. We think that we can
demonstrate that's the case and these are kind of specific projects where we've already done a lot of work and they
happen to be in particular locations work from a transmission perspective. So if we can do that, we would expect to go
ahead and construct them and demonstrate that net-net they're a good deal for customers from a total bill perspective, in
which case they should roll into base rates going forward.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, just following up on the latest NEP GP guidance, the $200 million that was
depicted for the end of the decade, is that consistent with the 12% to 15% and to the extent which it is, can you give us
a sense for drop-down assumptions, et cetera that that will be baked in?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Julien, I'm not quite sure I follow the question. Today, we talked about $75 million to
$100 million around the 2018 time. If you carry the growth forward a couple more years, then I think you can
reasonably see it getting to the $200 million a year level. I believe that was the number that I mentioned in the speech I
gave at Platts the other day. So it's really just an extension of the growth profile.
As I said in the prepared remarks, we are right now really working through what are the specific assets that it makes
most sense to make available to NEP for the short-term acceleration. But the longer-term growth profile and
expectations continue to be supported by all the projects in the Energy Resources portfolio that we talked about in the
past, including potentially contracted fossil assets and including potentially pipeline projects.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Or to be more specific, what about the drop-down multiples that you're thinking about
broadly, is it still kind of in that 9% to 11% range?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: As a broad generalization, yes, although one of the things that I've observed is we've gone
through these first transactions is that EBITDA multiple are not necessarily a very good metric for thinking about
drop-down valuation because the profile of projects can be quite different, and it depends if you have a project where
you have CITC, for example, whether it's pre or post the tax effect, so. But we haven't really changed our view of the
long-term valuation, which as I said on several occasions is going to depend upon the individual project first and
foremost.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got you. And then secondly, you've talked about disproportionate cash flow growth.
Obviously, some discussions of late around a large utility acquisition. What are you thinking about use of cash flow
structurally? Is the business orienting towards more resources like businesses or are we talking about more utility
growth in the future be it outside of FPL or within it, et cetera?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, as is actually implicit in part of my answer to Steve's question earlier, both sides of
the house continue to have very strong growth prospects. And so, as we go forward, the balance is remaining roughly
equal. We still continue to become a little bit more regulated and long-term contracted, but not greatly so over the next
few years. So, we will continue to pursue the opportunities that we see in the existing portfolio as much as we can.
In terms of third-party acquisitions or corporate large deal acquisitions, as we've said before, we are, in principle, open
to the possibility. We don't need to do a big deal to continue to be very successful. We're going to be very disciplined if
we do look at anything, but it's not fundamental to our strategy.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got you. And just a quick clarification of Dan's last question, the solar PV site. While
you may not be filing for it in the immediate sense, once you're through the current stay out, those would indeed roll
into base rate?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure, assuming that they indeed act to reduce total customer bills over the long term, then
they would roll into rate base and they'd be reflected in our filings in 2016 assuming we file as we expect to in 2016,
and for whatever new rates would go into effect in 2017.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Excellent. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Just on the solar in Florida. When you mentioned it's the most cost effective solution for the
ratepayers, are you referring to the projects being at retail rate parity, or are we talking more an LCOE reaching like a
natural gas high heat rate peaking asset? So can you just maybe comment on what you mean by cost effective?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. The way to think about cost effectiveness for these projects is to think of them in the
context of a constantly evolving integrated resource plan. So solar in Florida obviously has energy value. It also has
capacity value based on its coincidence or degree of coincidence with the load curve. So essentially, what we do is in
the IRP, we plug-in different combinations of potential future generation and figure out on a present value basis which
of those are cheaper for our customers.
And so if we can get to the stage where as we think we now can with these three specific projects, we can introduce
them into the mix and have the overall present value as seen through the customer's eyes, lower, that's a good thing for
our customers and something that we want to go ahead with.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Got you. And then with the latest solar projects you've added to your pipeline and then maybe
comments that solar can become very economical at the end of the decade. Can you just maybe talk about the current
LCOE trend versus a higher heat rate peaking asset? Are you with and without the investment tax credit?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I can try, but it's very hard to think about LCOE because you really need to think, as I just
described for the FPL situation, in how these assets work into an integrated system. So, you're really not or you
shouldn't compare assets side by side. That would maybe be appropriate if you were thinking about building a new
system from scratch. But in all cases, we're talking about introducing new capacity into an existing system.
With that as a caveat, however, I would say that we are getting to the stage where potentially by the end of the decade,
assuming that we revert to the 10% ITC that's embedded part of the tax code, that in many regions of the southern part
of the country, we could see something that is competitive on an energy basis with a combined cycle unit. Whether or
not that makes it fully competitive on an integrated basis, then depends upon capacity value and shape of the load
curve, a whole variety of other things in the region that we're talking about.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Got you. That's very helpful, actually. And then just lastly on the rate basing of the E&P
reserves, is there any potential how large this could be relative to what FPL's gas needs are?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I think for the next few years, we're going to be limited more by sort of the pragmatic
factors than theoretical long-term potential. So in theory, if we could get to 30%, 40%, 50% of the gas burn, I think that
would be a very attractive proposition from a customer perspective, but I think it's going to take us time to get there.
First of all, we've got to get the initial deal approved and up and running and show that that works as we anticipate it
will. And then I think we're going to build on that at a moderate pace and demonstrate that the overall strategy is
effective. I think the other factor that could be limiting here is simply the available opportunity set. FPL is looking for
something a little bit different in gas reserves than where the general market is. By that I mean, FPL is really obviously
focused on dry gas, and a lot of the plays that are being pursued out there tend towards the wetter or oilier spectrum.
So there may be some limitations just driven by the availability [ph] of sets (51:09). So, all of that in my mind says that
I think we have realistic odds of scaling the thing up to the point where within the next few years, we can commit
several hundred million dollars in capital each year to it. Beyond that, it's too far for us to look right now.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So, sorry to beat a dead horse on the regulated utility side, but just following up on the solar
question. Presumably, you're making headroom in – under current base rates through the continued improvement in
costs under Project Momentum, such that you would still expect to be able to earn inside the ROE range until you roll
these at the base rates?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yes. That's generally true, not just of these assets but more generally, infrastructure CapEx
that needs to be recovered under the current – in terms of the current base rate agreement, our ability to invest for
example in our reliability initiatives is conditional upon our ability to manage the O&M effectively. So, the fact that
we've been very effective there, and as I said in the prepared remarks ahead of where we expected to be, in a sense
creates more headroom to allow us to deploy capital.
Now, that capital still needs to be productive from a customer's viewpoint, either improving reliability or as we just
discussed with respect to the solar units, improving the long-term cost effectiveness of the system. But assuming it is,
then from an investor perspective, we can sort of afford to accommodate it within the terms of the current settlement
agreement.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Two more questions. One on accounting. You mentioned that the accounting treatment for
drop-downs would be to amortize those gains starting 12 months after the initial drop and over the life of the – over
what time again? I'm sorry. I don't recall that piece.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, let me just repeat that. In the structuring of NEP, because of the presence of IDRs,
we have subordinated our LP interest. Those subordination provisions go away one year after we have sustained the LP
distribution corresponding to the high level of the splits. Until that time, from an accounting perspective, we defer all
the accounting gains that are recorded on the transfer of assets from Energy Resources to NEP. So, once we clear that
one year period, then we can start amortizing those gains.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And those gains would be amortized over what period?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Over the life of the assets.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And we would expect those to run through NextEra Energy Resources' ongoing earnings?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. And so you get the cash in and the year you do the drop, you amortize the gain over –
starting a year out over the life of the asset?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yes, subject to the more technical description that I gave, going forward it would then be
the case but that's subsequent projects you would be getting the cash and starting to realize the gain simultaneously.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you. Great. One final question for Armando. We talked a bit last time we saw you about the
opportunity for storage as a growth investment at NEER. California has this RFP going on. Can you talk about whether
or not storage is in fact a piece of the growth opportunity at NEER? And if so, what's the magnitude and when might
we start seeing those investments?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: I think it is. I think I've been pretty consistent in saying that at least my expectation's for
storage investments to become a significant part of our CapEx spending at NEER, is really towards the later part of the
decade. I mean, as you mentioned, there are opportunities in California, opportunities in Hawaii, opportunities in New
York. And actually, there are some smaller opportunities in PJM.
We are looking at and playing in all of those markets. But I would not expect in the near term through 2016 even if
we're significantly successful for the CapEx to be very meaningful in terms of what it adds to earnings. Having said

We'll take our question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just to recap a little bit here on the NEP accelerated growth, and maintaining the long-term
growth outlook as well, is that basically being driven by just a more robust outlook in terms of the opportunities for
renewable development? Or – I just wanted to clarify as to what – just make sure that I understand exactly how you're
able to accelerate the growth in the near term and maintain long-term growth. Is that what's driving it?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. I mean the underpinnings of it obviously are our long-term expectations for the
evolution of the Energy Resources portfolio because that's the principal source of the project that create the opportunity
set for NextEra Energy Partners. So we're feeling very good about that. We've had great success this quarter in the
relatively short term, all the long-term fundamentals appear to us to be very encouraging. So that's kind of a
fundamental driver.
Then, assuming that you can get comfortable with the long-term growth expectation for the opportunity set, then the
next question is, what's the right sort of shape to the growth profile? And, clearly, we recognize that other things equal,
meaning as long as you can sustain a long period of good growth, and by good I mean 12% to 15%, then it's better to
have more earlier rather than later.
And then, if you couple that with the recognition that with this tax equity structure, we may add some assets that
previously we would've thought about as not being available for 10 years, now being eligible earlier, it makes sense to
get those transferred when we can, so there's more opportunity, particularly in the short term, and hence acceleration in
the short term appears to us to make a lot of sense.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I just want to make sure I understood that. Then, with respect to slide 20 and the new
investment, now I realize things have changed. You guys have changed things a little bit here, provide a lot more
information. But it does look like the new investment line has dropped a bit. Obviously, we have NEP on the top part
there. Is there anything that's – I mean, could you elaborate a little bit more about what's changed in new investments
other than the allocation to NEP in that slide?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's going to be difficult for me to do that on the fly.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: ...on the call. Let me just – a couple of caveats that slide 20 does have some differences
from the part what I call gross margin hedged charts. So it's very difficult to compare those directly.
Among other things we have in the new disclosure, we have allocated into the adjusted EBITDA across the various
lines, the base G&A that we have supporting the respective elements of the business that we didn't have before. So all
those will tend to be a little bit lower.
One of the things that is on our list to do is now to go back and compare these pieces and understand precisely why
some of the line items might look a little bit different. I would say there's no major change to the 2015 numbers. Most
of the developments that we've seen in the last quarter will tend to affect 2016 and 2017 much more.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then just finally weather versus normal. I'm sorry, if I missed this, what has it
been year-to-date the impact of weather versus normal?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Energy Resources year-to-date on the wind side is a little above average. The quarter was
a little bit below average. Solar has been about on.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And the utility? Has it been big at all?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, it's been an average year overall. The challenges that we've had here in Florida have
been associated much more with heavy rainfall and thunderstorms and lightning. But in terms of average cooling
degree days, it's not been greatly different. Now, we recognize of course that all of that gets absorbed by pluses or
minuses in simplest depreciation and amortization at FPL. So it doesn't have a direct immediate ROE impact.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. Thank you very much.
