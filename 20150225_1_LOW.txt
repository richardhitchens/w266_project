Robert A. Niblock
Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we delivered another strong quarter with
comparable sales growth of 7.3%. Comp growth was driven by a 4.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.3%
increase in comp transactions. The mix of comp ticket and comp transactions was consistent with our expectations.

Comparable sales growth for our U.S. business was 7.4% for the quarter. We saw balanced performance across the
country again this quarter with all three divisions the North, South and West generating comps within a tight range. In
fact, all 14 regions had comps greater than 5%. Likewise, we reported positive comps in all 12 product categories and
our Pro Services business continued its strong performance with comp sales in line with the company average during
the quarter.
I'm also pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double-digit comps in local currency for the seventh
consecutive quarter. We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive
sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 115 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.46,
a 59% increase over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.3% and earnings
per share of $2.71, a 27% increase over fiscal 2013.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased $1 billion of stock
under our share repurchase program and paid $225 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.9 billion of
stock and paid $822 million in dividends.
As we head into fiscal 2015, macroeconomic fundamentals are aligned for modestly stronger home improvement
industry growth. Jobs, incomes, household financial conditions are expected to continue strengthening in 2015,
building on the momentum gained in 2014. Coupled with an increase in revolving credit usage, these trends set the
stage for higher discretionary consumer spending and the sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers to
pump less money into their tanks and more into home improvement and other forms of discretionary spending.
Improvements in housing should persist in 2015 as well. Strong income gains, mortgage rates that remain historically
low, and moderating home price growth should keep home affordability at elevated levels and provide more support to
home buying in 2015. Expected growth in the home improvement market is further supported by recent consumer
confidence ratings and the results of our fourth quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey, which revealed that homeowners'
views around personal finances and home values continue to improve. In fact, approximately one half of homeowners
now believe that the value of their homes is increasing. Along with the positive progression in sentiment, this quarter
even more homeowners indicated their home improvement spending was increasing. And while most of the home
improvement projects they have planned are still small ticket, the survey indicated a boost in plans for big ticket
projects versus this time last year.
In 2015, we will continue to focus on a few key priorities to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy.
We'll further pursue top line growth by differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences and improving
our product and service offering for the Pro customer. In addition, we'll continue developing omnichannel capabilities
as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage
with us. We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in a few specific
areas including store payroll, marketing, and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. These efforts
give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Bob will share these details in a few minutes.
But first, I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. Their steadfast
commitment to serving customers is critical to our success and an important driver of this quarter's strong results.
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Ricky D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert stated we delivered strong performance in the quarter and I'm
pleased to share that our store employees earned a record payout from our sales and service employee incentive
program. This program rewards store employees for achieving their sales and profitability targets and for delivering
outstanding customer service. We continue to capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through our enhanced sales
and operations planning process, improving relevance with the Pro, and expanding customer experience design
capabilities.

In the fourth quarter, we used our enhanced sales and operations planning process to coordinate inventory flows,
advertising, and training around our Celebrate the Season winter campaign. With this campaign, we targeted four
important shopping occasions: interior refresh, holiday decorating, gifting, and getting organized. For each occasion,
our store logistics, merchandising and marketing teams collaborated to ensure that we had relevant products available
to customers at the right time, that they were effectively advertised and strategically promoted to drive traffic, and
across merchandise to build the basket. As a result, we drove both online and in-store transactions and ticket growth,
and we fulfilled orders in the most convenient manner for customers.
Our ability to sell products from a store, online, in home, or through our contact centers is a distinct competitive
advantage that allows us to engage customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose. We know that for
many projects more than half customers research online before making an in-store purchase, and for purchases made on
Lowes.com approximately 60% are picked up in store, 10% are delivered from the store, and the remaining 30% are
parcel shipped. This speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we
are introducing.
From a category standpoint, we drove above company average comps in flooring, kitchens, appliances, lumber,
building materials, millwork, and outdoor power equipment. We drove company average comps in fashion fixtures,
tools and hardware. Customers are increasingly interested in refreshing the interior and exterior of their homes, so we
used targeted promotions coupled with our investment in Project Specialists to drive performance in fashion fixtures,
flooring, kitchens, appliances, and millwork. We are pleased with the Project Specialist programs. Currently we have
Project Specialist who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores. Our Interior Project Specialist
program has an average ticket above $10,000 and customer satisfaction scores over 15 points higher than the industry
standard. So, we're expanding it to another 470 stores in 2015, reaching over three-fourths of our stores by year-end.
With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise, and find the right contractor to do the job, we are rapidly
becoming the project authority in home improvement. Within lumber and building materials, we met strong unit
demand for dimensional and treated lumber with robust inventory depth. We also leveraged our store's canopy
program, in which each market reflects the most relevant lumber and building materials to be stacked just outside the
Pro entrance under the canopy. This program helps Pros quickly find items like lumber, plywood and wallboard,
quickly check out, receive loading assistance, and get back on the job.
With outdoor power equipment, we met strong Midwest and Northeast demand for snow throwers. In tools and
hardware, we saw particular strength in power and pneumatic tools, we have a compelling assortment of national tool
brands and we've expanded our relationship with Hitachi to include pneumatic tools. Combined with Bostitch, Lowe's
now has the number one and number two brands, making us the destination for pneumatic tools, particularly for the
Pro.
Kichler, the innovative leader in decorative lighting, is another important brand for Pro customers, and I'm pleased to
announce that we just recently added this leading brand to our lighting assortment. Expanded relationships with brands
like Hitachi and the additions of brands like Kichler build on a solid foundation to serve the Pro. In fact, 14 consecutive
quarters of Pro comps at or above the company average are a testament to this foundation, which includes dedicated
service in our stores, inventory depth, and our 5 Ways to Save value proposition. Additionally, field-based Pro account
executives and our national accounts team make it easy for medium to large sized companies and government entities
to do business with us.
We are also completing our beta test of lowesforpros.com, which has been well received by our pilot customers. This
dedicated platform is fully transactional and will provide Pros useful functionality such as the ability to develop
requisition lists and view their purchase history, as well as customize product catalogs. This site can also be integrated
with purchasing systems Pros use to manage their business, further streamlining their day-to-day operations and
helping them work more effectively. We have received positive feedback on the site's flexibility and ease of use, and
expect to make it available to all Pros this spring.
Last quarter, Mike told you about the holiday décor experience we implemented in all of our stores using the stage
created for our outdoor living experience. This stage leverages our larger store format. Developed through

collaboration between our merchants, stores and customer experience design team, the holiday décor experience
inspired customers to decorate, raise their awareness of the breadth of our holiday décor and gift offerings, and
provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro season. The customer response was very positive and we
improved sales, inventory sell-through, and gross margin for the products included in this set. We are now transitioning
this space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we are focused on driving productivity and profitability. During the
quarter, our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours as comp sales accelerated, increasing sales by hour by
approximately 5% and driving 28 basis points of payroll expense leverage. They drove this leverage while maintaining
great customer satisfaction scores and best-in-class inventory shrink performance. We are pleased with the progress this
year on sales growth, productivity, and operating profitability, and we are committed to further improvement in 2015.
In 2015, we expect to drive sales growth as we further capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through increased
relevance with the Pro, improved customer experiences and the continued development of omnichannel capabilities.
We will increase gross margin by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and lower first costs by
leveraging our supply chain fixed costs. We will continue to leverage payroll as we further align payroll hours to
customer traffic and more efficiently complete non-customer facing tasks.
We will also drive expense productivity as we increase sales while reducing fixed expenses. For example, we will
reduce our total marketing spend, even while increasing our presence in targeted digital media, and we will obtain
further expense efficiency by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate
and store functions. Likewise, we will increase inventory turns approximately 15 basis points as we continue to hold
inventory per store flat while increasing comp sales. With solid depth of high velocity items and job locked quantities
in place we will obtain additional inventory productivity as we continue to thoughtfully conduct our line review
process. We are excited about the further improvements we will make to our business in 2015, and look forward to
sharing our progress as the year unfolds.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $12.5 billion, which represented a 7.6%
increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total average ticket increased by 4.9% to $66.17 and total transactions
increased 2.5%. Comp sales were 7.3% for the quarter. As you heard from Rick, further momentum from our initiatives
and improving execution drove balanced performance in the quarter.
Comp average ticket increased 4.9% and comp transactions increased 2.3%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were
6.7% in November, 7.2% in December, and 8.2% in January. For the year, total sales were $56.2 billion, an increase of
5.3% driven by a comp sales increase of 4.3%, on full year of Orchard sales compared with a partial year following the
August 2013 acquisition, and new stores. For 2014, comp average ticket increased 2.4% and comp transactions
increased 1.8%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.6% of sales, which is roughly flat to last year. In the quarter, the mix of
products sold negatively impacted gross margin by 25 basis points. Also price actions drove gross margins by
approximately 10 basis points. These items were essentially offset by value improvement and better seasonal
sell-through, which helped by 15 basis points and 10 basis points respectively.
For the year, gross margin of 34.79% represented an increase of 20 basis points over 2013. SG&A for Q4 was 25.24%
of sales, which leveraged 88 basis points. The SG&A leverage was driven by a variety of factors. In the quarter, store
payroll leveraged 28 basis points due to better alignment of hours to customer traffic and strong comp sales. Property
tax expense leveraged 21 basis points due to favorability in property valuations recognized this year.
At our Analyst Conference in December, we noted that expense productivity would come from utilizing our scale to
reduce the spend on indirect goods and services. In the quarter, these efforts allowed us to leverage telecommunications

and the armored car expenses. Also, given the sales growth we were able to leverage fixed costs.
Lastly, we had approximately 30 basis points of expense leverage associated with last year's asset impairments. These
items were offset somewhat by employee interest deleverage of 30 basis points. The higher expenses were driven by
both higher enrollment, as well as cost inflation.
For the year, SG&A was 23.62% of sales and leveraged 46 basis points versus 2013. Depreciation expense was $362
million for the quarter, which was 2.89% of sales and leveraged 28 basis points. The leverage was driven by higher
sales as well as assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 6.53% of
sales, which represented a 115 basis points increase. For the year, EBIT of 8.53% represented an increase of 76 basis
points over 2013. Interest expense at $132 million for the quarter leveraged five basis points as a percentage of sales.
Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 5.48% of sales. The effective tax rate for Q4 was 34.5%. The lower rate this
quarter relative to the 38.7% last year was driven by tax provisions that had expired but were retroactively extended by
Congress for calendar 2014 in the fourth quarter. The tax rate for the quarter was also lower than our expected 36%,
resulting in an EPS benefit of $0.01 per share. For the year, the effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 37.8% for
2013. The lower tax rate for the year was the result of the settlement of prior-year tax matters.
Q4 net earnings of $450 million increased 47% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.46 for the quarter were up
59% from last year. For 2014, earnings per share of $2.71 were up 27% versus 2013. The earnings per share
performance for both the fourth quarter and the year represent record highs for the company.
Transitioning to the balance sheet; cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $466 million. Inventory of
$8.9 billion was down $216 million or 2.4% from last year. The decrease was a result of better inventory management
and improved sell-through of seasonal goods. Inventory turnover was 3.85, an increase of 11 basis points over last year.
Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.69.
Moving on to liabilities, accounts payable at $5.1 billion was up $116 million or 2.3% to last year. The increase relates
to an almost two-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease-adjusted debt to
EBITDAR was 2.15. Return on invested capital increased 243 basis points to 13.9%.
Now looking at statement cash flows; cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion, an increase of 20% over last year due
to net earnings growth and working capital. Capital expenditures were $880 million, down 6% from last year. Free cash
flow of $4 billion represented a 28% increase over 2013.
During the quarter we repurchased 14.9 million shares for $1 billion through the open market. For the year we
repurchased almost 74 million shares for a total of $3.9 billion. Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items
detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecast suggest modestly stronger growth in the home
improvement industry in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecast and our improving execution
we've taken a prudent approach to our 2015 outlook.
For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4% to
4.5% and the opening of 15 stores to 20 stores, which includes six Orchard and two city center locations. We expect to
report our highest comp in Q1. This is an important quarter for home improvement and the easiest compared to last
year. While we expect the first half comp to be higher than the second half, we do expect that the two-year comps will
improve sequentially through the year.
We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 basis points to 100 basis points. As I noted during our Analyst Investor
Conference in December we're now targeting 25 basis points to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion reporting comp
above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year there will be some choppiness quarter to quarter. For example, let
me offer two items that will put pressure on the flow-through for the first quarter.
In Q1 last year, we had 70 basis points of gross margin expansion, our strongest quarter of the year. This year we
expect gross margin to be flattish in Q1, while improving roughly 20 basis points for the year. Also in Q1 last year we
had our lowest comp and therefore reduced bonus accruals. This year we plan to accrue to target levels resulting in
deleverage of 25 basis points in Q1 while leveraging roughly 10 basis points for the year.

We expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll,
marketing, bonus, and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect to have
fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%; the higher tax rate
relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior-year tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate
impacts earnings by roughly $0.06 per share.
For the year we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents a 22.5% increase over 2014. We
are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital plan for 2015 is approximately
$1.2 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.8 billion for 2015. We expect to issue incremental debt
during the year as we manage to the 2.25 times lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR target. We had approximately $2.4
billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year. Our guidance assumes
approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. All future share repurchase authorizations are subject to
board approval.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Thank you very much, and congratulations, guys, on a nice quarter and year. Robert, maybe
looking at the industry and your performance kind of from 30,000 feet, it certainly seems like the macro environment is
improving even if housing is okay, but not great. As you look at your business, do you think there's less cyclicality, and
is it less tied to housing today than it has been in years past?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, Al, I think, we've talked about that some in the past and how really when you're
looking through all the prior cycles when housing was – turnover was going up and down, homes continued to maintain
their value, and actually continued to increase during a lot of those cycles. But we saw that kind of disconnect in this
most recent downturn when home prices dropped dramatically. So we're kind of going through the cycle, we're getting
home prices starting to come back up, that's driving confidence among homeowners that they can reinvest in their home
again.
Certainly there's been a lot of deferred investment to the kind of the wish list, the to-do list on the refrigerator, so
people are re-engaging in that, and that's what we saw in our survey, where we're starting to see a slight increase in
those that are not only taking the discretionary projects on, but also starting to move into larger projects, because
they're getting confidence in the macro environment, confidence in the value of their home, but at the end of the day,
income and housing are continuing to be the things that drive our business. So, there was a little bit of a disconnect in
the downturn, but we are seeing consumers re-engage and we feel good about that, and that's really what's built into our
guidance for 2015.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you. And one follow-up, if I may. With respect to foreign currency effects, what
were the effects on your 2014 numbers in aggregate, and what impact do you have built in, in your 2015 guidance as a
result of the strengthening dollar?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Alan, the impact was essentially nominal to us. Our international business, Canada, Mexico,
are relatively small pieces of our portfolio of businesses, so it did have a modest drag on comps, 10 or so basis points
for the quarter, and about the same for the year. As we think about FX going into 2015, at this point we've modeled
roughly the same levels as where we are today.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much.

Next question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. Just a minor point, but just to clarify, in Investor Day I think you
mentioned margins of at least 9.5% in 2015. I think the guidance range for 2015 now, if our math is right on GAAP
EBIT, is around 9.3% to 9.5%. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, is the range – I guess the wider range, is that
just conservatism or has something changed in how you're looking at next year?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So what I would say is that when we put our outlook for the year, this is something that we
expect to achieve and hopefully beat. So if you think about our EBIT guidance for 2014, we started the year at 65 basis
points and delivered 76 basis points. So I would suggest that it's some level of conservatism. As I mentioned in my
comments, we took a prudent outlook, prudent approach to our outlook for 2015 and the 80 basis points to 100 basis
points range is consistent with that.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then the follow-up is I think you mentioned the Pro grew in line with the
house, and I think the past few quarters it was a little stronger. So is that just a fourth quarter thing? Did you do just so
well around Black Friday with consumers that that's – that kept the consumer rate a little bit higher, or was there
something that changed on that side?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah. This is Robert. You hit the nail on the head. Actually we've had for a number of
quarters the Pro exceeding our overall business, but we had really good strong performance, which led to the strong
comp that we delivered in the fourth quarter with great response from our retail consumer. I'll let Rick jump in and talk
a little bit more detail about what we're seeing from the Pro.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah, Simeon. It was really the result of the holiday in the retail consumer. When you look
at the Pro in general, we still saw strong demand across all regions with the Pro. As a matter of fact, when you look at
account growth, which is the measure that I look at to determine health of the Pro instead of viability of our processes
and programs, our Pro accounts grew 24% during the quarter, so still a huge take rate from Pros as they look to
leverage our benefits of our value proposition as well as we continue to meet their needs. We did see positive comps
across all ticket sizes and ticket ranges for the quarter as well. We showed strength that we did not lose anything
relative to any type of transaction size that we monitor or watch during that timeframe as well.
So we feel good with the Pro. We still feel good with the strength of the Pro and their response to our process and
programs. And moving into 2015, we still think that we have room to continue that growth with the brands that we're
launching in 2015, a lot of what we talked about during the AIC with GAF Roofing, Owens Corning, Lennox,
[indiscernible] (32:01) other brands that we're bringing back into the portfolio, as well as those brands we launched
during Q4. So we feel really good from where we are today and looking into 2015 with relevance for the Pro.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks. Nice results.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you. Appreciate it.

<Q - Michael Baker>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Two questions. One just on the margin efficiency point. So 25 basis points to
30 basis points rule of thumb for 2015, which is higher than you've targeted in the past, but in the fourth quarter it was
only 18 basis points. Is it really just that insurance issue? Was that the only factor that led you to come in below that
rule of thumb? Or are there other things on the margins in particular to call out?

<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Mike, a bit of it was the impact of insurance. Some of it was the bonus payout that Rick
mentioned going into the quarter. We expected a little bit more leverage in Q4 on the bonus line than we experienced,
but we're happy to pay the associates. They delivered strong results for the quarter and they deserve it. The other piece I
would mention, Mike, is the mix – the 25 basis point mix impact hurt the flow-through as well.
<Q - Michael Baker>: And actually, so if I could follow-up on that 2.1 within the gross margin you talked about price
action. Can you give us more details there? And secondly, when you say less leverage on the bonus, I'm sure it's not
that you expected a better comp, it's just that the payout was evidently higher. Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So two things. The payout is based on our plan performance, so as we – our outlook for Q4
wasn't a 7.3% comp, so we out delivered our expectations by a greater degree going into Q4 which led to the increased
bonus payout. As it relates to your first question on price actions. Really, Mike, that ties back to Rick's comment on
targeted promotions.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. Thanks. Makes sense.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS Investment Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I was hoping to get a little bit more
perspective on how you think your share is trending within the different bucket of tickets. So we saw really good
performance for your big ticket bucket and slower performance from your smaller ticket stuff. Does that – is there any
suggestion that as the consumer is reengaging with some of the bigger spend projects that the store location matters a
little bit less, that you're picking up more of your fair share in that spending arena? And then conversely, is that
potentially coming at the expense of some of the smaller ticket stuff?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Michael, I'll start, and get Mike Jones to jump in a little bit. I think, firstly, it's a lot of the
things we've been working on when we talk about the omnichannel, differentiating own experiences. We've talked
about the project nature of the business and the way we're focused on how the project nature of the business – that's
why we saw strong performance in areas that we outlined for you, like kitchen and appliances, flooring, those types of
things. And I think a lot of that is dovetailing with my comments earlier about the consumer getting reengaged in some
of those projects that for lack of a better term has been deferred in the middle of the downturn. As they're now getting
more comfortable with the macro environment, getting more comfortable with an income job outlook, and more
comfortable quite frankly that the value of their home is going to continue to move in the right direction. So a lot of
what the team has been working on over the past few years was setting ourselves up to take advantage of the macro
environment that we find ourselves moving into now which I think played itself out in the fourth quarter and I think
that is what's built into our guidance for 2015. So, Mike, if you want to dovetail on top of that?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Absolutely. Thank you, Robert. I'd add to it that along with really doing well on large ticket
and gaining share. What Rick talked about with respect to Pro, ensuring that we continue to build out our portfolio of
brands, have the right inventories, have the right breadth of assortment, we think that's also going to help us over the
long-term, continue to build better traffic. So, while we think our financial levels are apt for both, we think that, that
we're seeing our – some of our project execution, relative to the industry base customers start to pay off early.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: That's very helpful commentary. My follow-up question is when you look at your
different categories can you give us some sense of where – the categories relative to peak that are still furthest off of
from a sales perspective and where you think you can – still have opportunity to regain those sales?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Michael, that's – that would be all the big ticket discretionary categories. As Robert
commented, the consumer is feeling better about the situation, feeling better about re-engaging in big-ticket categories,

but it hasn't necessarily started in earnest, so if you think about kitchens, flooring, millwork, all three of those
categories are the furthest away from where they were back in the peak.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Can you give us some – can you quantify in some way?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: What I said earlier is at the peak those items were – those three categories were close to 19%,
20% of our sales, today they're 16% to 17%. So, while all those have been rising they're still lagging as a percent of the
mix.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: That's very helpful. Thank you so much.

Next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys. So it seems to me like you guys have been a lot more aggressive with
adding new brands the last couple quarters from Sherwin-Williams to some of the new products and brands mentioned
during the call. Now are these still all part of the value improvement efforts or is this a specific focus to expand your
Pro business which is a clear initiative or is this just kind of a more overall aggressive stance on the merchandising
front?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Scot, I'll start and then have Mike jump in. Certainly as we talk about at AIC, we have a
strong focus on the Pro customer and we know that to continue to – we've had great performance at the break line for
you, but to continue to drive that relevance with the Pro it's everything we're doing from the quality of the people to the
account executives, the service in our stores, the depth of inventory and also the key brands that they rely on. So that's
been a dedicated focus for Mike and his team to make sure as we talk to Pro customers we have the dedicated brands
that they want. So Mike, if you want to?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Sure. Absolutely. I'd say, the customers of Pro tools value tool that we use to go after better
serving this customer, and certainly brands that enable us to serve these customers as well. And so to Rick's point
earlier, if you think about what we've added [indiscernible] (39:22) wiring devices, GRK Fasteners, Lennox HVAC,
Owens Corning insulation, just really, really great job by merchants partnering with our team and store operations to go
drive the brands, that's not just in Pro. If you think what we've done in the DIY space, HGTV by Sherwin-Williams, the
granddad, that the quality of Sherwin-Williams and their core expertise of HGTV, we're really, really excited about
that, and look at Grills as an example, another one that we don't talk a lot about, but we have both Weber and
Char-Broil, the number one and number two brand in grilling. So excited, and so there's a ton of work in tools very
specifically as well.
Owens, Lennox we talked about, both the Owens brand and Lennox brand, we've made reference of Hitachi pneumatic,
you couple that with our exclusive Bostitch makes us the destination for pneumatics. Rick spoke about adding back
Kobalt hand tools and that's added to our current portfolio of brands, which includes Bosch, Dewalt, Kobalt, and Porter
Cable to name a few. So the merchants have done a phenomenal job at really going out into the supply base, working
with our vendor partners to bring back the right brands that both the Pros want as well as showing a growth for DIY
and the – and our customers still looking for strong tool performance. So we're excited about what's going on, and to
your point; great, great work.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.

<Q - Jessica Mace>: Hi. Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you, Jessica.
<Q - Jessica Mace>: My question is about the online business. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more
color on the performance and maybe talk about with such a large portion of sales from that business picked up in store,
are there any particular categories you see really driving overall sales.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah. Jessica, this is Rick. I'll start and then I'll let Mike jump in as well. We continue to be
pleased with our performance at lowes.com. It was up 25% for the quarter, 2.5% over total sales for the year. When you
look at dotcom, the thing that we're really working on is, as you said, we've been doing online pickup in store for over a
decade. So it's something that we're really continuing to focus on. Dennis Knowles and the team have done a
phenomenal job on store operations and improving the experience on the front end to make it easier for the customers
to transact and get their products in and out of store quickly. And it continues to focus on our ability to drive our
omnichannel aspects of what we're trying to accomplish and do as a organization and create that visibility across stores,
dotcom, contact centers, and [ph] own siter (42:18) in the home. So it's a component of what we're really doing from an
overall strategic standpoint.
What we've been focused on over the last couple quarters and in 2014 is really enhancing the experience that the
customers have when they jump on our site, so we've been working on delivery scheduling. You've seen us work on
improving our search capabilities and adding several thousand additional search terms to avoid getting back no search
results. We've improved our filtering of products and we're also working on improving our content, and have improved
content for 17,000 highly visible items on the site. So we're really looking holistically at the site to make sure that we
continue to drive what we are working on. The thing that we're still extremely pleased with is that the store remains
very relevant with the customer, in fact almost 97%, 98% of all transactions still go through our stores. That's
evidenced by the fact that we talk about the 60% pick up, the other 10% delivered, and then a large portion of our
parcel orders are actually shipped from our stores. So they continue to play a critical role as we leverage that asset and
continue to move forward in the future. Mike, I don't know if there's anything that you want to add?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: I'd just add that anything can be purchased online, so the consumer often starts online for
inspiration, getting a better sense of how they want to pull their project together, and they like to couple that with an
in-store experience so that they can work related to project. But appliances, fashion fixture, outdoor power and tools are
certainly mainstays for online. And we take an approach that for the consumer, they want us to be relevant whenever
and wherever they want to interact with us. And so we recognize that often they start online and [ph] then move to an
(44:08) in-store discussion.
We're also very careful to make sure that as we tie back our merchandising approaches that we're leaning into both
what's important from a process perspective as well as what's important from an online perspective. And to Rick's point
earlier, a couple brands that have been added, Progress Lighting and Kichler Lighting will be featured online, and then
our online tools will help them both make selections and ship to the home or make selections and come into our stores
and see that product and make their selection. So for us it's about the cohesive experience of which online is certainly a
key piece of it.
<Q - Jessica Mace>: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first question relates to the mix issues that you discussed
impacting gross margin in the fourth quarter, if you could just give us a bit of color as to what categories drove that and
how you would expect that dynamic to play out as we start the new year.

<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Matt, as you might expect, the biggest driver for that was appliance, strong growth of
appliances in the quarter, double digit growth in appliances. Also some strength in lumber and building materials, a
lower-margin category. Those are the two main drivers of the – I guess third, outdoor power equipment, so elevated
generator sales in the quarter based on weather. As we look at 2015, we are modeling a modest mix bag going into
2015, but that's embedded in the roughly 20 basis point improvement that I mentioned.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Great. And then my second question, your inventory was actually down outright
year-on-year, which is a very strong performance, you know perhaps even more than you're guiding for going forward.
So is that a function of the strong Q4? Is the port a part of it or is this just you're outperforming your goals with no
constraint at the sales as a result?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I'll take part of it, and let Rick talk about the port. As we mentioned, we're trying to grow
comps at a mid-single-digit keeping inventory first quarter flat, so a lot of effort and energy around improving the
productivity of inventories. And that's sure to be in Q4. The second is improved seasonal sell-through. So you think
about some of these seasonal goods are good quality products that we'll choose to carryover throughout the course of
the year. We in fact did that in Q4 2013 based on the strength of the seasonal set the customer experience design work.
We had far better seasonal sell through Q4 2014 than we did 2013. Therefore, we didn't have any carryover inventory.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah. And Matt, I'd just add that we also count in-transit inventory in our numbers, so
whether it's sitting at port or in our DCs, it's still in our total inventory numbers. As it relates to our port to the port
issues, I'm extremely pleased with the efforts of our supply chain in getting our products moved through the port during
this slowdown. As a matter of fact, we feel fairly good and confident about our inventory position heading into spring.
Currently we have over three months of forecasted sales of seasonal products already in our distribution centers and in
our stores. So we feel good from that perspective.
We continue to monitor the process in general at the ports, and we continue to take steps to minimize any further
impact such as moving products and cargo through other ports, re-routing the product so we can get it to our stores the
most quickly and time effective means possible. But the teams have done a great job in flowing our product off the
port, getting the containers moved through and really proud of what they were able to accomplish. So we feel good
going into the spring with our current inventory levels and particularly against our forecasted expectations for the first
three months.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks so much for that.

Next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So I think, there's a great debate out there on how
much of the gas price declines will flow to the consumer, what categories are going to benefit and when. From where
you sit, whether the consumer research or what you're seeing, is there a way to attribute any of the 4Q comp to – and
the industry growth really broadly to lower gas prices? And do you think that the lift is accelerating and still on the
come? Or how would you frame that out?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Chris, as we think about drivers of our business. There's really three: household, net worth,
employment and housing. So certainly, less dollars going towards fuel is going to be more discretionary dollars for the
consumer to spend. So that's a fact. What we don't know is exactly how much of that's going to savings, how much of
that's going to restaurants, vacations, et cetera. How much is going towards home-improvement. So we know the
customers got a little bit more walking around money. To your specific question, Chris, I can't determine, or we can't
determine the specific impact to our comp in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Is there anything to say that – I guess especially because you sell a lot of
big-ticket durables. Is there anything to say that the benefit should actually accelerate? I mean I think it's sort of general
anesthesia, it helps all categories. But is there anything that you're seeing or could say that perhaps that once it's

believed to be sustainable by the consumer, that the home improvement category would see a greater lift in the future?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Chris, this is Robert. Certainly I think as you listen to economists speak out there, they
would say that the longer that it were to go on, yeah, the more that it becomes part of your discretionary income versus
kind of a one-time impact. And so, yes, I think it's reasonable to assume the longer it goes on the more likely
consumers will spend a portion of that and more likely part of it winds up in our channels. So that's positive. We view
that as a potential positive as we think about our outlook for 2015. On the other hand, depending on how long it takes
place, the impact it has on a slowing global economy, the U.S. exports, multi-nationals, and the impact that could have
on overall jobs and those type of things, don't lose sight of that, it's not just a one way street. There can be other impacts
as well that we need to take into consideration.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: And you're not seeing anything in the oil patch now that's a concern to you,
stores that are exposed there?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: As I said in my comments, we saw [ph] broad type (51:17) performance across all of our
divisions and all of our regions in the company.

Your next question will come from line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, guys. A couple questions. First, on the Pro account growth, up 24% in the fourth quarter,
can you give us maybe some perspective around that? Give us a sense of how fast that had been growing, how fast it
grew for the year? Just trying to understand – put that into context?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Sure, Peter. When you look at this, and like I said, we've been investing to grow our Pro
business over the last couple years. We talked about the organizational designs that we've made, the inventory
investments that we've made and the value propositions. As we go through – and then the addition of the programs
continue to resonate very well with the Pros. So when you look at account growth for the year in context, accounts
grew at 16% for the year.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Good. Thanks for that, Rick. And then I guess on some of the categories, you talked
about the OP strength, snow throwers, maybe generators, anything on the early spring side though, maybe out West as
you see kind of temperatures warming out there, kind of the view towards the OP category this spring?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: The only thing I would say, Peter, is that like I said, we're early into the process. If you
recall, last year we talked on the call extensively about the outdoor living experience and how we'd set that and the
great response that we saw from customers from an outdoor living. By the time we were setting over the majority of
our stores, the deep South we were already into spring, and so therefore we didn't want to disrupt the spring selling
season in the deep South. We came back in the fall of the year, reset all of those, and so that's the earliest indication we
would have would be from the deep South, and what we're seeing, the receptivity from those consumers after what
we've done with the outdoor living experience has been very strong. So we're pleased with the early indications and just
waiting for spring to get here for the rest of the country.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. And just lastly, just on the Flooring business, looks like above average here in the
fourth quarter. It had been running kind of I guess – I think in line, so what drove that change? Was there – it was
something that you guys think you did or was it just kind of a broader pickup in that category?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: We did do a tile reset late last year, but we're seeing pretty good strength beyond when we
did the reset, so I think, I suggest that the category itself, the industry has done better.

Our final question will come from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Thank you. [ph] Yes, (54:07) batting clean-up. Good quarter. Had a couple of questions on
the costs. Wondering if you can delineate – you rattled off a few costs that you look like you're digging into in a pretty
minute way, which is intriguing to me. So I'm wondering if you can kind of just highlight some of the costs again
you're looking to kind of trim back on? You mentioned advertising, I think, and a few other things. And then I know in
the past when I've asked you, you've mentioned that the profit margin gap between you and your nearest competitor
you think is almost entirely due to volume. I'm wondering though as you drill in a little deeper if you think you might
be finding some kind of SG&A opportunities that might be – as the opportunities irrespective of volume?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Aram, when I take a look at relative profitability, when your gross margins are set the same,
there's only one place to look is operating expenses. As we think about operating expense opportunities, we do think
there's a number of areas we talked about, so certainly we had some elevated bonus in 2014. We'll plan for target levels
in 2015, increased leverage in store payroll, some advertising leverage, those are the big buckets. And the depreciation
dollars actually fall in 2015 so we get some healthy leverage there.
Beyond that, the whole indirect spend category we talked about it at the analyst conference in December. I talked about
some discrete items in Q4, not because they were large drivers, and I mentioned telecom and armored car specifically
just to give you a sense that it's real and it's working, and we've got a number of categories in 2015 that we're looking at
things from store fixtures and displays, supplies, the entire category of various services, so there's a variety of activity
around that where we think we can become much more efficient going forward that will help improve the flow-through
that we talked about, the 25 basis points to 30 basis points.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: That sounds like a great area of focus. Thanks and good luck.
Robert A. Niblock
Thanks. Appreciate it, Aram. And as always, thanks for your continued interest in Lowe's. We look forward to
speaking with you again when we report our first quarter 2015 results on Wednesday, May 20. Thanks, and have a
great day.
