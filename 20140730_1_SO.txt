At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Well, good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As you know, 2013 was one of our busiest ever from a regulatory
standpoint. The constructive results our traditional operating company has achieved has our company well-positioned
to execute out plan to continue delivering on our core commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable, and affordable
energy to customers and the communities that we are privileged to serve.
Our second quarter results were consistent with expectations. Weather was normal for the first time in the past few
quarters and the regional economy is gaining strength as anticipated. We achieved major milestones in our two major
construction projects and continued to extend our track record of solid operational performance.
In a few minutes, Art will provide an update on our financial results as well as our sales and economic outlook, but first
I'd like to begin with an update on construction activities at Plant Vogtle and Kemper County.
We continue to make impressive progress at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and Units 4, as you can see from the recent aerial
photo we've included in our slide deck. Our next major milestone will be completion of the CAO5 module for Unit 3,
which will comprise one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. That module is now outside of the
module assembly building and is projected to be installed in September.
The next key elements for Unit 3 will be CA01, a large containment vessel module that will house the unit's steam
generators and a series of concrete pour that will raise the structural concrete currently surrounding the containment
vessel bottom head and bring it to ground level, typically referred to as Elevation 100. This concrete will ultimately
serve as the foundation for the Unit 3 shield building. We currently have 36 sub-modules of the 47 sub-modules for
CA01 on-site and expect to install the completed module in late fourth quarter this year or first quarter next year. The
concrete pours to Elevation 100 should be finished near year-end 2014.
Meanwhile, the latest Vogtle Construction Monitoring, or VCM, hearings are complete with a vote scheduled for
August 19. During the hearings, the Commission's independent construction monitor concur that project risks are
consistent with those contemplated when the project was approved and that they are being managed well by Georgia
Power. The construction monitor also concur that sufficient oversight is being provided to contractors and global
supply chain vendors. It was further noted that Georgia Power has been successful in meeting requirements to secure
the benefits of the DOE loans, production tax credits, and other options to help mitigate risks for customers.
We anticipate the filing of VCM 11 at the end of August. I'm also happy to report that Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper
County had a good quarter in which Mississippi Power achieved significant construction milestones. Pressure testing is
complete on both gasifier trains, a significant step towards the heat-up of the first gasifier, which is targeted for late
third quarter or early fourth quarter 2014.
We also have achieved pipe-tight status, meaning that all piping, more than 900,000 linear feet is installed, sealed and
ready for testing. Successful combined cycle testing is winding down as Mississippi Power prepares to place this
portion of the plant in service.
On the regulatory front, Mississippi continues to engage constructively with the Mississippi Public Utilities
Commission staff. There are a number of issues involved that we are working hard to resolve. In the meantime, we
remain optimistic about the outcome of these discussions.
Elsewhere, I'm pleased to report that the acquisition of the Macho Springs Solar Facility by Southern Power and Turner
Renewable Energy closed during the second quarter. This 50-megawatt facility, the largest solar project in New
Mexico, is now in commercial operation and can generate enough electricity to power more than 18,000 homes.
Southern Power is continuing to seek new solar and natural gas projects with long-term contracts and creditworthy
counterparties.

I'll now turn over the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. For the second quarter of 2014, we earned $0.68 per share, compared to $0.34 per share in the second
quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.34 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, we earned $1.08 per share
compared to $0.43 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.65 per share. Earnings for the six months
ended June 30, 2014 included an after-tax charge of $235 million or $0.26 per share related to increased cost estimates
for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project recorded in the first quarter of 2014.
Earnings for the three and six months ended June 2013 included after-tax charges of $278 million or $0.32 per share
and $611 million, or $0.70 per share, respectively, related to the Kemper County project. Earnings for the six months of
2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million, or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease
investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding these items, earnings for the second quarter of 2014 were
$0.68 per share compared with $0.66 per share for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.02 per share. Earnings
for the six months ended June 30, 2014, excluding these items, were $1.34 per share, compared with $1.15 per share for
the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.19 per share.
A primary driver for our 2014 second quarter results was more normal weather compared to the same period in 2013,
resulting in an increase of $0.03 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Second quarter 2014 earnings also benefited
from increased industrial sales and retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies. Earnings were offset
somewhat by increases in non-fuel O&M expenses. A more detailed summary of quarter-over-quarter drivers is
included in the slide deck.
Economic activity in our region continues to be led by the industrial sector, as evidenced by our 13 consecutive months
of year-over-year industrial sales growth. This growth is consistent with national trends such as the ISM Manufacturing
Index, which has remained above 50, signaling expansion for the past 13 months. In our region, we continue to see
exports play a big role. In the second quarter of 2014, exports from Alabama and Georgia grew at 4.1%, almost twice
the rate of the U.S. as a whole. Container exports from the Port of Savannah grew 6.3% in the second quarter of 2014
compared to 2.5% for all of 2013. This growth has been broad-based across all of our traditional operating companies
and across all of our top 10 industrial segments.
As an additional point of interest, 90% of our major customers say that they expect their sales for the second half of
2014 to be either the same or better than the first half of 2014. In the housing market, we continue to see signs of a slow
recovery. The most recent Atlanta Federal Reserve survey of brokers and builders indicates that home sales are up from
last year. Inventory levels continue to fall and prices continue to increase, albeit modestly. Overall, builders and
brokers expect activity in the Southeast to continue to increase. These trends are consistent with our internal measure of
new housing activity, new connects, which were up 17% in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period
last year, with positive growth across all of our traditional operating companies.
These findings, which are consistent with our expectations for the period, were underscored at the most recent meeting
of our Economic Roundtable earlier this month. As a reminder, this is a group of regional economists and executives
from a handful of our largest customers. Overall, the Economic Roundtable affirmed our view that of the continuing
momentum behind the industrial sector and the continued recovery of the residential sector. The group's consensus is
that GDP during the first quarter of 2014 was not consistent with employment or industrial production trends and that
quarter-over-quarter GDP growth of 3% can be expected for the remainder of this year.
Several of the economists on the roundtable noted that income growth continues to be weak and will likely remain so
until under-employed workers are absorbed. This weakness in income growth is reflected in Southern Company's
continued weakness in use-per-customer growth as well as in signs of continued discipline on consumer spending
patterns. All of this data is reflected in Southern Company's sales results. Industrial sales were up 3% in the second
quarter of 2014, compared with the second quarter of 2013, with all 10 of our top sectors demonstrating growth.

For example, chemicals were up 5%, paper was up 6%, and transportation was up 7%. As a group, the housing related
segments of textiles, stone, clay and glass and lumber were all up 3%. Meanwhile, weather-normal residential sales
were down 0.6%, and weather-normal commercial sales were flat in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second
quarter of 2013.
Looking forward, we continue to see this ongoing recovery reflected in strong economic development activity. One
example of this is the Elba Island LNG terminal, where a joint partnership of Shell Oil and Southern LNG, a Kinder
Morgan company, is adding natural gas export capability at its existing facility in Savannah. Once fully operational, the
associated electric load increase will be 180 megawatts, making it one of the largest customers in our service territory.
Meanwhile, in Alabama, we continue to see growth among Tier 1 and Tier 2 auto suppliers for assembly plants we
serve, as well as inquiries for suppliers that will serve the future Airbus assembling facility.
Our economic development pipeline remains robust. We are currently tracking some 330 prospective projects,
representing 37,000 new jobs and $14 billion in capital expenditures. From this pipeline, more than 8,000 jobs were
announced during the second quarter of 2014, a 23% increase over the same period in 2013, with a potential for $1.3
billion in capital expenditures.
Now, I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2014, which will be $1.06 per share.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. As I've said many times before, Southern Company values the opportunity to engage constructively at all
levels of government for the benefit of the customers we serve. This week, we've had another such opportunity in the
form of public hearings on the EPA's proposed rules for greenhouse gas emissions at existing power plants. Several of
our company's senior officers participated in the hearings yesterday and today, both in the nation's capital and here in
Atlanta.
We continue to have concerns about the impact of this proposal, particularly with regard to the reliability and
affordability of our nation's energy supply. We are currently reviewing the proposed rules and will submit our formal
comments to the EPA, in keeping with the established timeline. Our initial review, however, has revealed three primary
reasons why we believe the current proposed rule should be amended.
First, the proposed rule significantly overreaches the EPA's authority by attempting to regulate activities that are clearly
beyond the scope of the Clean Air Act and other existing legislation, and that have historically been under the purview
of the states. Second, the details of the proposed standards do not appear to be workable, relying upon unrealistic
standards of performance and violating long-standing regulatory constructs. And third, and perhaps most importantly,
the proposal is not in the best interest of electric consumers due to its potential negative impacts on retail prices and
system reliability. As we have in the past, we will continue to engage constructively on all fronts in this important
policy debate.
We are now ready to take your questions. So, operator, we will now take the first question.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Good afternoon, guys. I apologize if you answered any of these at the beginning because I was
little bit late. I saw that things were looking up at Kemper this quarter; you didn't have any further cost escalation
beyond your current budget. As we get into the list of activities on the bottom right of page six, at what point over the
course of the year should, if you're going to have further slippage, should we be focused – well, what are the key things
we should be focused on, and when will they be incurring?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, yeah, we actually talked about this slide, getting ready for the call. You are around,
Art, 95% of the way through construction. There will be tails of construction – when we say construction is complete,
there will be tails of construction that go right into just about in-service. So saying it's complete is kind of a term of Art.
But we're very close to kind of being there in a substantive way. The real risks, I think, going forward relate to the
startup. And, of course, there are the normal issues related to startup. But the one thing we always say to ourselves is
the unknown unknowns. And that is there could be, as we go through the startup process, potential equipment failures
that we don't contemplate or have quick inventory or quick turnaround solutions for that could impact schedule. But
with respect to the risks associated with construction, those are winding down pretty quickly. The risks that largely
remain in front of us are the risks that relate to startup.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. So second question, which is more of a tactical or short term question, just because we've
had such a huge build in gas production, natural gas production, and we've had a decline in the amount of gas being
burned for power-gen nationwide. And so natural gas prices – partly because of weather obviously, natural gas prices
have fallen a lot. As you look at the rest of the summer, how do see your gas burn relative to what you burned last year.
Because if I look at the very short-term data, I noticed that it's gotten cooler down there over the last few days, but
you're still burning an awful lot of gas relative to where you would burning it where the weather was, let's say, a month
ago or two months ago. Is there something going on where we should expect a higher gas burn for the balance of the
summer or should we assume that if the weather continues to be cool that you'll back down on the gas...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, so, Greg, I think you're all over the question, right? We do steadfast economic
dispatch. So whatever's the cheapest energy is what we'll provide. And whatever energy resource provides the cheapest
energy is what we'll use. Look, a year ago when gas prices were moderately higher and you had coal prices moderately
cheaper – I'm sorry, just the opposite, gas prices were cheaper, we burned a lot more natural gas than we did coal. What
we're seeing this year is similar to what we projected, and that is kind of in the 40% range for both coal and gas from an
energy standpoint. We're slightly ahead so far in 2014 on coal relative to gas, but I would argue with gas dropping
down here recently right in the $4 range that gas will pick up a little bit. So my sense is, kind of going forward is kind
of where we thought we would be, in the general range of 40%/40% for both coal and gas. I could give you specific
numbers, but I'm not sure the differences are meaningful.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll get to our next question. It's from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Go right ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Tom, can you just give a little clarification? I know the headlines hit on kind of the
discovery process of new nuclear. Can you just maybe explain more broadly how you're thinking about that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. Yeah, sure, absolutely. It was funny how that got reported. It's actually on the
YouTube website. I gave a speech, I think I was keynoting at the Bipartisan Policy Center along with Energy Secretary,
Ernie Moniz. And it was all about energy innovation. And after the talk was given, I had a few questions and answers.
And I think this was the first question, and it really went to why isn't anybody else building nuclear? And I went on to

describe kind of what kind of companies could build new nuclear and what kind of had to be in place. And I referred to
the different energy markets in the United States.
And at the very end of the comments, I said something like, and you know what, I would love to be in a position by the
end of the year to announce that we're building – that we're starting even more nuclear. In doing that, everybody should
know that the way you start the process is the way we started the process at Vogtle 3 and 4, and that is that you would
begin a permitting process. Remember, too, that from kind of beginning to end in 10 years or so. So we're really talking
about nuclear generation that could be in service in the middle of the next decade. And the first process that you start is
a permitting process. But we would only do that as we did with Vogtle 3 and 4 with the concurrence of our state
regulatory jurisdiction whichever one was relevant at that time. So that's all I was talking to. And what that does is
preserves the option to build new nuclear if, in fact, that looks like it's desirable from a customer standpoint in the
future.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Tom, with the carbon rule kind of sitting out there, or with a review going on. What do you
think is going to be the legal course as you guys look at the rule if it stays roughly as written in the final decision? And
do you guys think there's a potential for a stay or is that too big of an ask?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's a fascinating question, Dan. The overreach here to me is so clear, and it's interesting
where EPA says we're giving everybody flexibility. They can't give you what is not theirs to give. The inference must
be that somehow Congress via the Clean Air Act gave the EPA more power over the electric utility industry, and new
power over relatively what had been the purview of the states, than even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In other words, somehow, EPA is taking the authority to require in some respects Renewable Portfolio Standards, State
Energy Efficiency Standards. They are taking the power to obviate what has been the long-standing practice of
economic dispatch and incorporate a concept of environmental dispatch. And in the course raise prices significantly
and perhaps reduce reliability. My sense is this overreach is so great, I think there is, number one, a significant
opportunity to amend the rule before it becomes final, and number two, to work in whatever jurisdiction is sensible to
achieve a better structure or better timeframe in which to evaluate it.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Will determination on the final rule have bearing on the potential construction of additional
nuclear, so...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: ...would starting this process now facilitate more?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. In other words – but there is also some unintended consequences. The nuclear rule as
written really doesn't – it actually helps to penalize people that have taken early action. Since 2005, Southern Company
has reduced our carbon emissions 26%. We've led the United States in the renaissance of new nuclear and essentially
we don't get on to getting credit for those actions. And even in the plans – even if you haven't started, if you've
contemplated plans, they would include those in the calculations and you don't get credit for that. Now having said all
that, any passage of further regulation around greenhouse gases does incent new nuclear, that is clear. And in fact,
building new nuclear is in our view has been a hedge against future carbon regulations.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good. How are you doing?
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: I'm doing great. So first, I guess, just to clarify the clarification of the new nuclear – the
new new nuclear, excuse me. So, is this, are you at a point when you're doing kind of your RFP process or other stuff
where you need to be making decisions on the next round of base-load and thus looking at permeating nuclear or
something else over the next 12 months or 24 months or no?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: There's nothing new in the statement that we haven't said numerous times already. We
believe nuclear is a dominant solution in the portfolio of Southern Company's generation going forward. When – all
things considered, we need base-load, right? You need base-load intermediate and peaking. We know that coal is kind
of moving away from favor in America. So to the extent you're going to do coal, it looks like a Kemper plant. If you are
not going to do coal, it's nuclear. And so, if you're going to preserve nuclear as an option to add as a base-load resource
in the middle of the next decade, you need to start thinking about the steps necessary to preserve that option. That's all I
was referring to.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then switching gears, I think Georgia was going to do a pretty large solar RFP.
Is there any update on that process?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Steve, they have that process ongoing, there were bids that were made, I think it was
late April. There'll be a shortlist notification sometime the middle of August and then a final – the final selection I
guess will be mid-October of this year. And we'll know by then, I guess, whether Southern Power or Georgia Power
will be either in the shortlist or the final list by the October call.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay, great. And then I guess one last question, I guess, for Tom. Just we started seeing
some more utility M&A activity recently in the sector. Could you maybe just give us an update in your thinking on
consolidation in the sector? And how Southern might or might not participate in that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Here, again, this is going to be a standard answer, Steve. We're not going to comment on
any specific transaction, of course. And, of course, it is standard for management to exercise its fiduciary responsibility
to evaluate option enhancing – I mean, value enhancing strategies for its shareholders. To the extent any of those
opportunities come to fore, of course we'll pursue it; and if successful, announce it.
But it's something we do all the time. We look all the time. And you know our position is we're reasonably conservative
from a financial standpoint. We believe in maintaining the highest level of financial integrity. I know one of the
in-vogue ideas these days is to use cash. I think the underlying presumption there is to use debt at least as a bridge
underlying the cash. But I really don't have anything new to add that I haven't said before. We'll look at it all the time.
Extraordinarily hard to complete successfully that really do accrete to shareholder value, but that doesn't mean we
won't be trying.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay, great. Thank you.

right ahead.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey. How are you?
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Not bad. Just hopefully a quick question on the Southern Power project. Just wanted to
know, like, what type of returns are you seeing on solar now? When I think with the advent of yieldcos and all these
other type entities, has there been like a downward pressure on the returns you're getting from renewables?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we continue to look at that, Anthony. We've got a process whereby we evaluate every
deal on its own. There's not a one-size-fits-all approach here. We'll look at the terms and conditions around the,
whatever they may be, the off-taker, where the project is located, whether there's any other legal risks associated with
the contracts within the states that we're looking at. And we'll adjust our hurdle rates based on those. But I'm not going
to comment on any kind of return number that we look at because it varies honestly with every project we do.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But it's reasonably consistent, I think. We haven't changed our hurdle rates with respect to
kind of what the market is showing us. I haven't seen a dramatic change in what yieldcos are offering in the market.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll get to our next question. It's from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Go right ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. How are you doing?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Good.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: This is going to be a tough question, but I know you can't really comment on the details, but I
guess maybe the larger items that we should really be focused on when we see the outcome of the Mississippi prudency
process there. And can you maybe walk us through how that's going to – how it will be announced and what to look
for?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, we alluded to it in the opening comments and it really kind of goes to the idea of this
global settlement and there's a whole host of issues that could be taken into account in what we describe as our ongoing
constructive dialogue with the staff. We've thought a lot about how to respond to the natural question that I know you
all will say about where are you in that, and I think the best thing for us to say right now is to let the people do their
work and when we have something to announce, we'll announce it. To not say too much at this point. We remain
optimistic about a result.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay, okay. But I guess the most likely outcome like you mentioned is maybe more of a
settlement between the parties involved?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. We had been working on the so-called global settlement that takes into account a
number of issues and we think we're having constructive dialogue about that issue.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay, thanks. I know that's pretty hard to talk about at this point. Just a quick question on
operations, it's a smaller item but kind of an ongoing trend from the last quarter, you have a pretty major shift in your
non-Powder River burn away from Powder River Basin. Is that just a function of where your contracts and pricing are
at? Or is there something else moving that needle?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I think that's a function of outages. We had some of our Powder River units on outage
in both first and second quarter this year. So that's why you're seeing those numbers down a bit.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. So it was mostly driven by that, then. All right, thanks a lot. I appreciate it, guys.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question. It's from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Go right ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good afternoon. Any updates on the Vogtle dispute?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. We have all engaged in conversations. There's kind of two ways to think about that
and I would direct you to go to their earnings calls as well. But there is the nature of the conversation between Georgia
Power and the consortium. Recall, the consortium is Toshiba, Westinghouse, and Chicago Bridge & Iron. And then
there is the conversation within the consortium among and between Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron, and
Toshiba. In effect, what I'm saying is both of those have to be resolved in order for us to reach a settlement.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Any – venture a guess as to the timeline until a settlement?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. I've said this before and I don't mean to sound glib, but it's something that can happen
quickly or it's something that could take a long time including going to litigation. Recall, venue is Augusta, Georgia.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then just back to the new, new nuclear, can anyone who is expecting an announcement out
of Southern by year-end took your comments out of context?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, sure. Yeah, look, that's something we've said consistently. I was kind of surprised at
the amount of press it got. But love to be in a position by the end of the year to announce and what you do when you
start that process is you undertake essentially a permitting process and we would only do that with the approval of the
relevant jurisdiction in order to recover those costs. Recall also that's not a commitment to build, that's a commitment to
gain the option to build. So this is something that will – these are the first steps you take in order to achieve new
generation by the middle of the next decade, for heaven's sakes, something like that.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay, thanks again.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll get to our next question. It's from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Go right ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, how are you?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, Tom or Art, can you remind us in your 2014
numbers, what weather-normalized electric sales have you assumed for the year and how are you looking at them on a
longer-term basis? Can you just remind us of those numbers?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, on the – if you look at 2014 total retail sales, we expected to be up 0.7% over 2013
levels. And then beyond that, it really is around 1% to maybe a little stronger than that, but that's a function of how fast
the economy grows in the 2015, 2016 timeframe.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And year-to-date.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Year-to-date, we are standing at 1.1%.
<Q - Ali Agha>: All right. And I know third quarter obviously is the biggest, but given the trends you're seeing would
that cause you to change your full-year outlook at this point?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No. You know we don't comment on that until the third quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and just to remind everybody, we only talk about guidance twice in the year, once
when we give it and once when we kind of update it in October.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Separately, Art, I know last time I think it was in the last earnings call you had mentioned with
regards to equity – needs for equity, that you were pretty much close to your limit in staying out of the equity issuance
side. Are we still there, or can you just give us an update on your latest thoughts regarding equity needs perhaps in the
future?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Ali, what we've talked about is issuing about $600 million of new equity this year, and
through June we've issued $331 million, so we're well on track to hit our target, and our target hasn't changed.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question, Tom, for you. Again, you all had given us an update longer-term talking
about your earnings trajectory, slight slowdown next couple of years, and then a pickup again down the road. Are you
seeing opportunities that could change that trajectory and cause the near-term growth to go up as well, or is that still the
profile we should be looking at for the next five years or so?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So that's still the profile. You know that we're a conservative company, and so we wanted
to give you kind of a – we've never really gone out that far talking about what our earnings trajectory might be. And the
reason we did that was because we felt it had a shape. And so, we wanted to describe the shape to you all. We continue
to work hard on ways to improve that shape. We have several things that we're kicking around internally here;
opportunities with Southern Power, opportunities around the traditional business. But nothing that we want to give the
weight that would be derived from conversation in this forum. Still kicking around a lot of stuff.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question. It is from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Go right ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul. Paul?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi. How you doing? Sorry about that.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: A lot of my questions have been answered. But just to fall back on Kemper. If I understood
your comments earlier, it sounds like you guys pretty much feel that the boundaries are sort of laid out in such a way
that there's probably isn't going to be much more of a cost increase potential there. Is that – am I understanding that
correctly?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So I'm looking at all those risks. If I were to focus more on startup risks, what would the
risks be? And I used a funny phrase, unknown unknowns, right? So let's say as we go through startup, some piece of
equipment failed that we didn't anticipate. We've tried to mitigate or at least be proactive in mitigating the startup risks
by providing, I think, extra amount of inventory of what we think are critical parts of the plan. But in startup, if
something does not perform well, or needs to be re-designed, or whatever, that could add more months to the schedule
for example. And that would require increased costs. Right now we have reserves through, I guess, the very end of
May. June 1, whatever you want to call it.
So we've maintained that estimate. Obviously, if we didn't have common sense, we would have changed it. We had a
good quarter in construction, and I think being pipe-tight. So that means essentially all the pipe is erected, now we still
need to test it and other things. We just had a good quarter and I want to make sure that the folks on the site there that

are just working like crazy understand that we appreciate their effectiveness this quarter. The challenge now,
transitions, I think largely from a construction project to a startup project. That will have its own set of issues, we'll see.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I did notice that the first fire of gasifier A's schedules have been pushed out. Would that
be a key thing to look for in September, October, as being one of the key tests?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right, Paul. I mean to the extent you can't meet that kind of schedule, that puts
pressure on the backend. We move the schedule in concert with the new estimated – you remember when we came up
with the May schedule, that's when we changed a lot of the major components along that way. So that schedule is
consistent with a completion date at the end of May.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then I think Steve was asking you about M&A.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And I remember previously that you guys had a preference for the super-Southeast. And I was
sort of wondering, just geographically, does that – I'm not sure exactly what that means. Does that include Texas, or is
that still something that you guys have, a preference for the Southeast versus other areas?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Let me speak very broadly about that. The preference in something like the
super-Southeast would be where you could gain natural synergies. That's what that comment alludes to, okay? So – and
let me just pick stuff out of the air. We would have more synergies operationally in a company that was inside our
footprint or adjacent to it or whatever, than we would for a company in Canada. That's really the concept you're after
there. So in preferring the super-Southeast, it is the idea that you can more readily gain operational synergies. And let
me also distinguish between asset M&A where you don't really require synergies so much, that's like building a solar
plant in New Mexico, relative to corporate M&A, which is I think what you're referring to.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I got the picture. Thanks so much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thanks, bud.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll get to our next question. It's from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go right
ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael. How're you, bud?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: I'm all right, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. Really a near-term one, and this may
be more of an Art one, third quarter guidance, if I back out all of the one-time items from third quarter of last year, is
flat to actually down a little bit. How should we think about the puts and takes, not really just for third quarter but also
for fourth quarter, meaning kind of the – what's weighing on third quarter? Why isn't there a little growth
year-over-year third quarter 2013 to third quarter 2014? And what does that mean or imply for fourth quarter? Is it an
O&M timing issue? Is it a view on kind of the summer? Just trying to ask some of the near-term puts and takes.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, O&M is certainly an aspect of that. If you look at our history, we're a second half
spending company and depending on actually how the third quarter goes, because the third quarter represents fully 45%
of our annual earnings. It's a big player, and that points directly at fourth quarter earnings. Over the last five years,
we've earned anywhere from $0.18 in 2010 to $0.48 last year. And that's a reflection of where we end up through the
third quarter. We also have weather impacts as well, as you know, and we're assuming normal weather throughout the
remainder of the year, but that's certainly something we have to play into account for.

The other aspect is the share count, and share counts are up. We've talked about issuing new shares this year, so you've
got to weigh that in too. And once you factor all that in, that – these are all the things that are, as you say, puts and
takes on where the number will end up.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And when we think about just the next year or year and a half, maybe year or so,
what's next on the horizon going across the Southern system in terms of just thinking about rate filings, rate actions,
that could involve, kind of, not just pretty small numbers, but where there is stuff on the horizon that folks should pay a
lot of attention to?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Michael, this is Art. Georgia completed their rate case last year, right?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So they're good through 2016 from a new rate filing perspective. And when you look at Gulf,
Gulf Power missed a – well, they filed a rate case last year that was settled. They're good through 2016 as well.
Alabama, as you know, has filings every year, and they'll file that sometime in the fall, so you would need to look at
there as to what that particular filing would have. There are also clauses at some of our operating companies that could
operate as well, Alabama being one of those.
You also have fuel issues at each of our operating companies. Right now, system-wide, we're about $283 million
under-recovered on fuel, and some of our companies have had to file with their regulatory bodies just as information,
not necessarily for a change in rate, but some of them may be dealt with, some of them may be pushed off. And then
Mississippi, I believe, is good through 2015, 2016 as well, from their PEP filings. So it varies, but I think to a large
degree, all of those are pretty well settled, Alabama being the annual filing that you would have to watch each year.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And in Alabama, you would attempt to recover the deferral that you made in the prior RSE
process?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's always...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, oh, the O&M deferral? Is that what you're referring to?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yes, yes.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct. And that's over another period of time, I think over three years.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. Any of that is always part of the calculus.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah, got it. And then last item. Just thoughts on bonus depreciation, it's kind of been
bantered around back and forth a little bit in D.C. Just curious in terms of, A, what the impact would be on cash, I don't
know needs and uses for next year a little bit if it gets extended. And, B, just the general, from a policy and from an
impact on Southern's spending level kind of how you think about it in kind of the broader energy policy framework?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, Michael, this is Art again. In 2014, we were looking at anywhere $200 million to $225
million but when you look at 2015, it would certainly impact some of our assets and it will impact some of our MATS
compliance so I don't have a number to share with you, but it could dramatically impact the financing that we do from a
cash flow perspective. The other side of that sword is the fact that it reduces rate base growth, so there's good and bad
associated with bonus depreciation.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Vedula.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Good afternoon. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: I've got two questions. The first one is much more of an industry type of thing versus you guys
specifically. There's been a lot of press recently about a couple of years ago there was a huge solar flare that came
awfully close to threatening our entire grid and everything like that and there was supposedly a historical event back in
1859 that knocked out all the telegraphs and things of that nature. Some I'm just kind of wondering, one, kind of what
yourselves and the industry are doing to possibly prepare for that type of event that's just like kind of tail-end kind of
thing? And it also ties into the cyber issue as well so if you could just kind of talk a little bit about obviously given your
position in the industry, I'm sure you guys are extremely involved in all this so I'd just like to get a sense of that. And
then I've got a separate secondary question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, so we are involved. I chair for the industry and that's not just IOUs, that also
includes co-ops and municipal utilities. It's called the ESCC, the Electricity Sector Coordinating Council. You may
know that under the Department of Homeland Security they've cut commerce in the United States; they've segmented it
into 16 different pieces if you well, and so our sector is one of the 16. So I chair the Electricity Sector Coordinating
Council and we are responsible, essentially, for proactive planning and adaptive responses to all things cyber, physical
terrorism, and natural disasters.
And some of the things you suggest are absolutely part of our purview, and there's quite a bit of activity going on. And
in fact, the government – I think can look this up, the government has held the electricity sector up as the, I think, the
best sector in terms of preparedness and response to different threats. Lots of different things we could go into here.
You know that we have been involved in the response to the kind of request for additional physical security updates, so
this kind of interrogatories back and forth between NERC, the cyber issue you may know, that we have adopted a
single kind of cyber threat regime, a set of software that kind of, under the auspices of the government, which will be
able to detect anomalies within electronic commerce, servers, other things, assess those anomalies and then be able to
piece together information around the potential for threats and the best way to either protect or respond to a current
threat.
All of that is going on right now, and I would say on the third sector this response to natural disasters, Nick Akins,
CEO of AEP, a great friend of mine, a great guy, has been leading an effort in the industry to knit together a more
effective response from what they call the RMAGs, the Regional Mutual Assistance Groups. We actually I think
performed well with Hurricane Sandy but I think even now we will perform better, and I think we're much better suited
from a comprehensive storm to be able to respond great.
So I would be glad to fill you up with a lot more details but that's the quick fly-by. The ESCC governs cyber terrorism,
physical terrorism, natural disasters. We work hand-in-glove with the Department of Homeland Security through the
Department of Energy. We have, I think, unique among all the other industries, a deep CEO participation. This is
nothing that's delegated down. And I think we've already demonstrated, I think, really good plans and responses to
threats.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: How much is this costing a year, or accumulatively over a period of time in order to address all
of these possibilities?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Vedula, that change is based on each company. Each company is going to have a different
kind of response to that question. So if you have somebody in mind, it's much better for you to ask them than me.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: [indiscernible] (55:27).
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But I would say this – let me just give you the aggregate answer.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The amount of money that we're talking about pale in comparison to the benefits. As an
industry, we have always been committed to providing the best reliability and we understand that the United States is in
a new era. And we all understand that not only responding to but being proactive to defend ourselves against these
threats is job one for us. So yeah, it's going to require some more money, but I think the cost pales in comparison to the
benefit.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Okay. And I guess one last thing is going back to the old M&A question that's come up a couple
of times. I mean, in my career, the last time you guys ever did a corporate-on-corporate was when I first showed up in
1987, when you guys bought Savannah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: And I'm just wondering given the state of the industry, I mean, other than finding something
discrete, is there anything that is within what's going on in the industry that makes your attention or interest in M&A
any higher than what it's ever been in the past?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's a very interesting question. My quick answer is probably not. Not really. I think we
are where we have been. We've always been very consistent in our love of the integrated regulated utility model. We
always think that we generate the best long-term value for shareholders by providing the best risk-adjusted returns
around. We think that our jurisdictions have demonstrated that we can deliver attractive returns with low risk profiles
and therefore, from an EVA sense, deliver I think a terrific value proposition.
For us to undertake M&A activity, we have to be convinced in the long run that we can preserve that kind of
performance. That's just a big challenge. When you look around, we use the expression also, don't chase fads. A lot of
companies will pursue things in the short run. We really are focused on the long run. So we don't get kind of dazzled by
short-term trends, we try to keep our eye on the right long star here.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Appreciate it. Thank you, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.

Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question. It's from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Go right
ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Andy.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. Hope you're good.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Yeah, I'm good. Thank you. And I thought that was a very good question by Vedula, that last
one. Well asked. And I apologize ahead of time for asking this question but I feel it's a question that needs to be asked
just because I just kind of noticed it's coming up in one of the companies that you're doing business with. So if you look
at kind of CBI, and its stock price, it's dropped from $85 to $60, and I am by no means an accounting expert or an
expert at CBI, but obviously there's been some financial issues that were brought up whether they are true or not. But I
just want to know how kind of that affects your thinking in whether it's affected any of the construction? Or are there
any concerns that Southern has relative to CBI?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and, Andy, thank you for the question. You all know this, we're completely
transparent. We love questions. Anything you want to ask is fully fair game so never apologize. The second thing is we
think CBI is a great partner in this project. We think the performance, frankly, of the project, the challenges have been
reduced since they've come in. And I meet periodically with Philip Asherman, their CEO. In fact, Buzz Miller and I
flew to Houston two weeks ago to meet with him just to go eye to eye on certain issues. We do that all the time and,

frankly, I think this week we're meeting with Westinghouse and Toshiba personnel in D.C. So this is something that we
do as an ongoing matter. This is not constructing Plant Vogtle 3 and 4, in many respects is not a delegated activity, but
Buzz Miller certainly does a great job. But we're all involved.
With respect of any challenges that CBI has had recently that have been in the press, look, the right people to ask about
that is CBI, we can't speak for them at all. And we do look at their earnings calls and at least from our position, in terms
of the interrelationship we have on Plant Vogtle 3 and 4, we think they've fully explained that to the investment
community and we are very satisfied with their relationship in the consortium and their relationship to us.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Great. Thank you very much for answering that.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you.

And we'll get to our next question from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Go right
ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Dan.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Hi. Good afternoon. I have a couple questions on your slides on Vogtle, Kemper and then
some on related to your sales. And excuse me if these are repeats, but I kind of missed the beginning. I had some issues
with calling in. But I just wanted to try to get a sense on slide four, one, how we should think about the timing, the
things you have listed as near-term and on-the-horizon, are those things that will occur in the third quarter, or how
should we think about the timing of those items that you have classified there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, this is Art. CA05, I think we dressed in the script that we talked about this
morning and we're looking at, I think it was September before CA05, that – what we did comment there was it's out of
the module assembly building but it is awaiting, it's going under further modifications, but it will be lifted sometime
within the next month or two into the nuclear island. But setting the containment vessel lower ring, those are already
complete and ready to go. They're going to probably do that after they insert CA05. So again, from a timing
perspective, it's sometime probably September. And then the cooling tower vertical construction I guess on Unit 3, I'm
guessing, Dan, it's sometime in the next four months. But then that really is not what we would call critical path.
Critical path is all in the nuclear island.
In terms of Unit 4, module fabrication has just begun on their major modules. The nuclear wall installation will
continue. And by the way we're making great progress on Unit 4. If you compare activities, we're learning a lot of
lessons from our construction in Unit 3 and applying them in Unit 4. And then the turbine building vertical construction
is certainly not critical path either in Unit 4 but it is going very well and you'll see steel come up out of the ground
probably sometime late this year.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, if I just did that real quick, I would say and this just goes back, Dan, to maybe you
missed the reading of the script, CA05 September, CA01 late fourth quarter or early first quarter next year, Elevation
100 concrete pour near year-end.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then on Kemper, I was wondering, just – I was looking prior to the call at your
presentation I think you did back in June, and I just want to make sure I understand the terminology. You've mentioned,
first gasifier fire expected late third quarter, early fourth, where earlier it's said first gasifier heat-up targeted for mid- to
late-summer. So is heat-up and fire different or are they the same, or how should I think about that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, those are the same. And it's moved out a bit. Again, it's getting ready, doing a lot
of the milestones ahead of that like airflow testing, and making sure the lignite dryers work like they are designed to
do. So there are tests all along the way with equipment that Tom described earlier in the call, but these are all elements
of the startup process.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we're kind of gratified with where we've gone so far. The pressurizing – the pressure
test on Train A took a couple or three weeks or whatever. The pressure on Train B went very quickly. So we're very
gratified with our progress so far.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: I know last quarter, I think you talked a little bit about how the timing of these in-service
dates on Kemper have some implications for the tax credits and so forth, or the tax – the investment tax credits. And
you have here first syngas production expected late this year. Would that be enough to qualify that for those credits this
year or not, if you were able to achieve that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, what we will get credit for on a – from a tax perspective, from a bonus
depreciation perspective, will be the combined cycle by putting it in-service this year, along with other elements of the
plan. But be mindful that there could be an extender bill that pushes bonus depreciation into 2015 as well, so we'll just
have to wait. That probably wouldn't happen until later this year.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: But we really don't want to get into all the details of that, because we don't want to front-run
the regulatory discussions going on in Mississippi.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then I – just the last question I had is kind of related to your industrial sales
year-to-date have been up almost 3%, which is quite a bit stronger than I think your forecast. I wonder if you could give
us a little more color just on terms of, like, geographically, where that's coming from, and if you expect that to continue
in the second half?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we commented that on the script as well, Dan, but I'll catch you up. Yeah, it was
broad-based. If you look at our top 10 industrial segments, all of them showed growth both for the quarter and the
year-to-date period. That's – chemicals, our largest segment, was up 5.4% for the quarter; primary metals, our second
largest, was up 3.5%. So it's been very broad-based, and you think geographically it was across our entire footprint. All
of the operating companies participated in the growth, the expansion on the industrial side.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And roundtable – Economic Roundtable seems to suggest that people were bullish about
prospects going forward.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we expect this to continue.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, one other element that you may have missed, Dan, was that we also survey our top
customers about what their sales are going to be over the next six months, and 90% of the respondents to that survey
indicated that they expected their sales to remain equal to or greater than their sales year-to-date through 2014. So that's
a very bullish indicator to me that they're expecting similar sales in – of their products into the market.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then the last thing, just on the residential side in terms of customer growth, is the
customer growth in line with what you expected, or how's that tracking?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, it's going directly in line with what we expected. We've added 13,300 customers,
residential customers, since the end of last year. If you look at it year-over-year, it's right at 25,000 customers. So it is
going directly in line with our expectations for the year.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you very much. And at this time, there no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?
