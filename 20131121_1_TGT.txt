MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, November 21,
2013.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Gregg W. Steinhafel
Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our 2013 third quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today
are Kathee Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.
This morning, I'll provide a high level summary of our third quarter results and strategic priorities for the remainder of
the year. Then, Kathee will discuss category results, guest insights and plans for the holiday season. And finally, John
will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and the
year. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for the question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via
webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to
answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties,
the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A
reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.

Target's third quarter financial results reflect continued strong operating performance in the U.S., despite an
environment in which traffic and sales remain challenging. Comparable sales increased 0.9% in the quarter, near the
low end of our guidance, and our U.S. operations generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, near the mid-point of
our expected range.
We continue to manage our business thoughtfully, investing to maintain our relevance over the long-term, while we
focus on disciplined execution to drive current performance. We continually work to anticipate and respond to the
ever-changing needs of our guests, as we monitor the economy and the competitive landscape.
GDP continues to grow at a painfully slow pace, while household income and consumer spending remain constrained.
In particular, lower and middle income households are shopping cautiously, as they work to stay within tight, very
tight, household budgets, which have seen additional pressure from this year's payroll tax increase. And consumer
confidence, which has been generally recovering since the recession, took a dramatic step backward in October during
the government shutdown. This decline was particularly evident in lower and middle income households and we saw
lower than expected sell-throughs on Halloween merchandise. Not surprisingly in this environment, our competitors
have become increasingly focused on promotions, both to gain the attention of value conscientious consumers and to
clear heavy inventories of discretionary categories.
Our results show that guests continue to consolidate trips, as evidenced by a slight decline in our third quarter
transactions, which was offset by an increase in average ticket. Given their focus on value, guests continue to respond
to initiatives that connect them with Target and allow them to save even more off our already low prices.
We're very pleased with the rapid growth of 5% REDcard Rewards, as penetration grew beyond 20% in October and
averaged just below 20% for the full quarter. And the response to Cartwheel, our digital coupon portable, has been
remarkable. Cartwheel now has nearly 3 million users, most of whom access it exclusively on their mobile device.
Even though we launched Cartwheel only six months ago, guests have already saved more than $14 million.
We continue to generate strong operating margins in our U.S. segment, which is especially notable in an environment
where sales growth is slow and consumers and competitors are focused on promotions and value. Inventory and
in-stock levels in the U.S. remain healthy and expenses remained very well controlled. Teams throughout the
organization are contributing to our expense optimization efforts, finding innovative ways to reduce expenses, which
we can reinvest to drive future growth. In addition, our stores' teams have done an excellent job increasing productivity,
while delivering a great guest experience.
In the third quarter, we opened our eighth CityTarget and we continue to be pleased with the results from this new
format. We opened our first CityTarget stores more than a year ago and we're seeing very strong comparable sales
growth in these locations, as we raise awareness of our frequency categories and communicate the breadth of our
assortment and the great values we deliver across the store.
In Canada, we're nearing the end of this year's unprecedented market launch. Earlier this month, we opened an
additional 31 stores, our largest cycle so far. And with two remaining stores opening tomorrow, we will reach our goal
to open 124 Canadian Target stores in 2013. The Target Canada team has shown remarkable energy and perseverance,
allowing us to open a record number of new Target store across Canada less than three years from the announcement of
our agreement to purchase leasehold interests from Zellers.
With this final cycle of openings behind us, the team is completely focused on improving operations in run state,
enhancing systems and processes to better deliver the full Target experience to our new Canadian guests. The Target
Canada team is energized and prepared for the holiday season and preparing to enter 2014 with improved in-stocks and
a much better inventory position.
We continue to see a very strong mix of our higher margin home and apparel categories in Canada; however, third
quarter gross margin rate in Canada was unusually low, as the team worked diligently to eliminate excess inventory and
enhance flow throughout the supply chain. This activity led to heavier third quarter markdowns and higher than
expected dilution of $0.29 in our Canadian segment. Process improvement efforts and inventory clean-up will continue

in the fourth quarter, as well.
As we gain experience in operating Canadian stores and accumulate sales histories, by item, by location, inventory flow
and allocation will become much more reliable and accurate, setting the stage for improved sales and operating
efficiency in 2014. Given that this is our first holiday season in Canada, we will focus on delivering everything that's
special about the season, while continuing to emphasize that our prices in Canada are unbeatable. Over time, we are
confident that the Canadian consumers will recognize that Target's combination of low everyday prices, compelling
discounts in the flier, price matching policies, and 5% REDcard Reward savings offer an unbeatable value in the
marketplace.
While our initial sales and profits in Canada have not met our expectations, we remain enthusiastic about the Canadian
market and confident in the long-term success of these stores. They are located in densely populated, vibrant trade areas
and based on 50 years of experience building stores and entering markets in the U.S., we continue to believe that our
Canadian segment will contribute meaningfully to Target's sales and profits over time. We also believe the sales
shortfalls and earnings dilution from excess inventory and start-up costs will moderate next year, leading to significant
improvement in the Canadian segment profitability in 2014.
In the U.S., it's clear that the holiday season will be highly promotional and that consumers will be laser-focused on
value. In past holiday seasons, we have consistently offered compelling value, investing billions of dollars in low
prices, yet we believe we have an opportunity to communicate this focus on value more clearly to the marketplace. As a
result, this holiday season, we will be much more overt in our price messaging across our marketing vehicles, stressing
our unbeatable combination of everyday low prices, deep discounts on promotions, our price match policies and our
5% REDcard Rewards program. And while we're entering the season with guarded expectations for sales, we feel very
good about our inventory levels, merchandising and marketing plans, and we expect to deliver profitable fourth quarter
sales, while offering unbeatable value for our guests.
While we all know about the loss of six shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, at Target, we're
entering the holiday season with cautious optimism, as we annualize over last year's election and consumer uncertainty
surrounding the fiscal cliff. Based on our results a year ago, we're investing our merchandising and marketing resources
with a stronger focus on key holiday categories, like toys and electronics. In particular, given our market share in video
game hardware and software, we expect to benefit this holiday season from the most meaningful platform launches in
more than seven years.
In addition to fourth quarter merchandising and marketing plans, teams across the company have been preparing for the
full chain roll-out of in store pick up, the first of multiple efforts to deliver flexible fulfillment for our guests. The team
has moved quickly to roll out this capability, growing from a limited second quarter test with Minneapolis team
members to all of our stores earlier this month. The initial response from our guests have been encouraging and we're
looking forward to measuring their response throughout the holiday season, providing valuable insight as we prepare to
roll out additional capabilities in 2014.
We entered 2013 with an ambitious agenda, as we committed capital and expense to transform the company and create
value over time. Throughout this year of transition, both in the U.S. and Canada, our team has been remarkably
resilient, energetically embracing every challenge as they work to position Target for long-term success. Our entire
team is focused on developing Target's multi-channel capabilities, while offering merchandise and experiences to
create loyalty and position Target to deliver strong performance in any environment.
Now, Kathee will provide more detail on our third quarter results and outline initiatives for the fourth quarter and
beyond. Kathee?

Thanks, Gregg. We're pleased with the ability of our team to manage the business in the third quarter, maintaining
profitability in a soft sales environment, while we continue to develop digital capabilities that allow us to connect with

our guests in new ways. Across our merchandising categories, we saw a relatively balanced mix of third quarter sales
between lower margin and higher margin categories. Among the lower margin categories, need-based areas, like food
and healthcare, continue to outpace our overall comp. And electronics had a great quarter, driven by sales in mobile
devices and video games. Our discretionary higher margin apparel and home categories both saw small declines in
comparable sales. In apparel, third quarter trends were strongest in jewelry, accessories and newborn/infant/toddler. In
home, sales trends were strongest in domestics. In our digital channels, we saw very strong growth in apparel, hardlines
and beauty.
Early in the quarter, we were pleased with the comparable sales results in our back-to-school categories, which
outpaced both the industry and our overall results. Results were particularly strong in supplies, which saw a big
increase in penetration of our up & up brand. Performance in back-to-college was also stronger than average, both
in-store and online.
In September, our collaboration with Phillip Lim was one of our most successful to-date. Sell-through levels were very
strong overall and particularly high in our digital channels. The most popular items in the collaboration included
handbags, men's shoes and women's dresses.
In October, this year's calendar shift benefited comparable sales, as a portion of Halloween-related sales moved into the
month from November last year. However, as Gregg mentioned, in conjunction with the government shutdown and
pullback in consumer confidence, we saw a slowdown in our sales trends, leading to the lower than expected
sell-throughs on Halloween merchandise at the end of the quarter.
We continue to see remarkable guest engagement with Cartwheel. In response to guest feedback, we moved quickly to
integrate Cartwheel into the Target app for both Android and iOS in time for the holiday season. Now, guests can find
Cartwheel deals in four places: On their shopping list; on the product listing page; on the product detail page; and the
What's in Store content section.
Beyond Cartwheel, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in our digital channels. We continue to see
double digit growth in overall digital traffic and triple digit growth in mobile. This is notable, because mobile is a much
higher percentage of our digital traffic compared with some of our closest competitors. We're also seeing improved
conversion on both the traditional site and on mobile, as we continue to benefit from investments to improve search and
navigation.
As we survey our guests and monitor the overall consumer environment, we continue to see anxiety regarding the
economy and the ability to stay within household budgets, particularly among lower and middle income consumers. In
October, a very high percentage of our guests were aware of the government shutdown and concerned it would hurt the
economy. In addition, a meaningful portion indicated they were changing their shopping behavior, in light of their
current financial situation. This was evident in our guest metrics. In the third quarter, we were pleased to measure a
year-over-year increase in the number of guests shopping with us, but this increase was offset by a decrease in their
average shopping frequency. We even heard from some guests that they were cutting trips for fear they would be
tempted to spend too much, a behavior we first observed in the recession.
In light of this environment, we're entering the holiday season with a cautious outlook for sales and a very liquid
inventory position. Specifically, at the end of the third quarter, our average inventory per U.S. store was up only 1%.
We believe this position is appropriate, as it protects against the downside in a tough environment, knowing that our
base inventory is large enough to enable sales well beyond our fourth quarter plan if the season turns out to be
unexpectedly strong.
As we look ahead to the rest of the holiday shopping season, we're excited about our plans to deliver on both sides of
our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, beginning with our plans for next week. On Thanksgiving, we're excited to
open at 8 p.m., based on the response to our Thursday opening last year and the higher number of families who shop
together, making Target part of their family tradition. This year, we've pushed opening time up by one hour, to help
accommodate our guests and remain competitive in the marketplace.

Of course, on Black Friday, we'll offer hundreds of doorbuster deals, including some of Target's lowest prices ever on
electronics, toys, home decor, fashion and more. These deals will be available while supplies last in store and at
target.com, from Thanksgiving Day through Saturday. We've also integrated Cartwheel into our plans. When guests
redeem any Cartwheel offer this Sunday through Wednesday, they'll unlock one additional offer card to select the
Cartwheel deal of their choice.
Also next Wednesday, Cartwheel will feature Black Friday-like deals on about 30 items, including some of the season's
hottest toys and electronics. And no matter how, where or when they want to shop, guests will find Black Friday deals
in stores and at target.com, with even more deals available throughout Cyber Week. Target.com will feature 15
online-only daily deals for two straight weeks beginning Sunday, November 24. The only exception will be
Thanksgiving Day, when hundreds of Black Friday deals, including almost all of the in-store deals, will be available
starting in the early morning hours.
Also, on the two days before Thanksgiving, target.com will be running a special REDcard preview sale, with 25
exclusive offers for REDcard guests in items ranging from electronics and entertainment to toys and housewares.
Guests can also use Target's mobile app throughout the holidays to review the weekly ad, make shopping lists, check
item availability at nearby Target stores, find store maps and more. To raise awareness of our outstanding offers, we're
increasing media weight over last year and concentrating efforts during the entire week of Black Friday, with TV,
digital, cinema and radio support.
This will be the most digitally-enabled holiday campaign in our history, with an enhanced presence in the channels
where we know our guests are most engaged. And finally, next week, we will be testing a special offer in Northern
California stores, where all apparel and accessory items will be 40% off from the time we open on Thanksgiving
through close of business on Saturday. This offer will be available in 89 stores and will include women's, men's, kids',
baby apparel, along with jewelry, accessories and shoes. The only exclusion is clearance items. We'll monitor results
from the test to determine whether to extend a similar offer in other markets in future years.
In electronics this season, we're very excited about the highly anticipated platform launches from Sony PlayStation and
Xbox, bringing newness to a category which hasn't seen meaningful change in many years. We're also featuring the
hottest new headphones from Beats by Dr. Dre and wireless speaker systems from SONOS.
For this year's toy catalog, we'll feature more than 500 items. We're offering more than $100 of coupon savings. In
addition, we're offering free shipping on every item in the catalog until November 27. These savings are on top of the
5% guests receive when they use their REDcard.
In beauty, we recently launched a complete line of bath and body products from our longtime beauty partner Sonia
Kashuk, including four beautiful scents created by Sonia in collaboration with French perfume house Robertet. The line
is available in stores and online and will include gift sets for the holiday season.
In home, guests continue to respond to the unique affordable designs from Nate Berkus. New for the season, we've
rolled out exclusive Nate Berkus holiday collection in bedding, gifts and decor, available in stores and target.com. Also
new in home this season, we're excited to feature high-end kitchen items from Vitamix and Nespresso.
In entertainment, we continue to offer our guests exclusive content from a wide spectrum of artists and genres. In
October, we launched exclusive albums from artists, including Mary J. Blige, The Head and the Heart, Paul
McCartney, The Abbott Brothers and Kelly Clarkson. In November, we added exclusives from Celine Dion, Avril
Lavigne and James Blunt. And on December 3, we'll release the Target exclusive version of country star Jake Owen's
new album Days of Gold, which includes four bonus tracks.
And in grocery, we're following up on the recent success of Target exclusive Pumpkin M&Ms, with a wide variety of
big brand holiday treats, including exclusive items from M&Ms, Oreo and Hershey.
Beyond the fourth quarter and the holiday season, our team continues to develop services and multi-channel
capabilities to delight our guests and keep Target relevant over time. We are pleased with the initial response to our
store pick up program, which became available in all U.S. stores on November 1. Early results indicate that guests are

using this service to reserve high ticket items, such as iPads and weekly ad items, to ensure they get the item before it
sells out. Top categories for in store pick up include baby, furniture and electronics, and our strongest markets have
been New York, Chicago and Seattle.
Following the strong guest response to our Chicago test of our Baby 360 layout, which features added service and an
enhanced presentation, last month, we extended the test to an additional 20 stores across the country. We'll continue to
monitor sales and registry trends in these stores to determine future roll-out plans.
We're also excited about results from our Beauty Concierge program, which we extended this month to another 95
stores in new markets across the country, including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco and Dallas/Fort Worth. This
program is exceeding its sales goals and we're seeing particular strength in core categories, like cosmetics, skin care
and hair care.
While Target Ticket is still new, since its launch a little over a month ago, we've driven millions of page views to the
site. Visits consist of a blend of new and existing users, who come back to review new movies and TV shows that are
continuously added. The number of Target Ticket accounts has exceeded our expectations to-date and we're excited to
continue introducing this service to new guests, as it expands and evolves in 2014.
In late September, following a three month team member pilot, we rolled out a Subscriptions service, that allows guests
to order baby diapers, training pants, wipes and formula to their doorsteps on a recurring schedule. Target Subscriptions
service has unique advantages, including free shipping and easy in-store or online returns, 5% off Subscriptions
purchases when using a Target credit or debit card and a compelling assortment that includes national brands and
popular owned brand products like up & up diapers. Based on the initial guest response, we plan to expand our
Subscriptions service to more categories by the end of the year, to learn more about guest interest in this type of
service. For example, we'll be adding a limited assortment from categories like coffee, personal care, paper towels and
toilet paper.
And finally, last week, Pinterest added tools, which allow us to highlight the most pinned items. We'll be integrating
top pins on target.com in two ways. We'll feature top-pinned items on key category pages and if guests click on a link
to a product that is no longer available, they will see top-pinned product alternatives in the same category. And in our
stores, we'll use signing to highlight top-pinned items throughout our assortments.
While we are cautious about the near-term sales outlook, we are confident in our fourth quarter plans and believe we're
taking the right steps to position our business for long-term success. Our guests rely on Target to help them save money
and stay within their budgets, but they also expect us to surprise and inspire them in new ways. That is the essence of
our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, which guides our efforts every day.
Now, John will share his insights on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter.
John?
John J. Mulligan
Thanks, Kathee. Our third quarter financial performance reflected continued strong execution in our U.S. segment and
higher than expected dilution in our Canadian segment, as we continue to refine operations and clear excess inventory.
This morning, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.84, near the mid-point of our guidance, despite comparable sales near
the low end of our planned range. Our GAAP EPS of $0.54 was below expectations, reflecting $0.29 of dilution from
our Canadian segment.
In the U.S., comparable sales trends were fairly consistent throughout the quarter. As Kathee mentioned, trends were
softer than expected in October, as consumers witnessed the dysfunction in Washington. However, on a reported basis,
this weakness was offset by the calendar shift, which moved a meaningful amount of Halloween sales into the third
quarter.

Page 7 of 15
Our sales continue to be driven by a small decline in transactions, which is being more than offset by an increase in
average transaction size. In the third quarter, this increase in basket was entirely driven by an increase in average retail
per item, driven largely by electronics, which, as Kathee mentioned, saw a much stronger comp in the third quarter than
we saw earlier in the year.
Sales penetrations on our REDcards continue to grow, as more and more guests understand the compelling value of our
5% Rewards program and decide to deepen their relationship with Target. We continue to see a consistent response to
households who apply for and activate a new REDcard, increasing their spending at Target by about 50%, on average,
as they respond to the ability to save with REDcard Rewards.
Third quarter U.S. segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were consistent with the guidance provided at the
beginning of the quarter. Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we saw a moderate decline in gross margin rate,
reflecting the rate impact of 5% Rewards and a small mix impact from our remodel program, combined with
underlying rate pressure, driven largely by seasonal markdowns. A portion of these markdowns were driven by the
calendar shift, which moved Halloween clearance sales into the quarter, with the remainder driven by lower than
expected sell-throughs on Halloween merchandise.
Third quarter U.S. segment SG&A rate was somewhat better than expected, at about 70 basis points higher than last
year's revised U.S. segment rate. Among the drivers of this increase, the credit card portfolio drove about 60 basis
points of pressure, consistent with results in the first two quarters of the year, reflecting a smaller portfolio, last year's
reserve release and this year's profit sharing arrangement with TD Bank. And, consistent with our prior quarters, we
experienced about 20 basis points of pressure related to this year's change in vendor agreements.
This means that outside these two factors, the underlying U.S. retail business generated a small amount of SG&A
expense leverage on a 0.9% comparable sales increase, overcoming ongoing pressure from investments in technology
and supply chain to support our multi-channel efforts. This is outstanding performance, better than we'd expect over
time and reflective of the company-wide expense optimization efforts, which we've been discussing with you
throughout the year.
In our Canadian segment, we opened another 23 stores in the third quarter, even as we continue to work to refine
operations and improve performance. In the quarter, the team made a lot of progress in their efforts to begin to
rationalize our inventory position, update item counts in stores and distribution centers and improve network flow. As a
result of these efforts and recognition of incremental inventory reserves at the end of the quarter, we saw a much lower
than expected gross margin rate in the Canadian segment of about 15%.
Clearly, this is not the rate we expect over the long-term, particularly as we continue to see a much richer mix of sales
in our higher margin home and apparel categories in Canada; however, we do expect pressure on Canadian segment
gross margin to persist in the fourth quarter, as we continue to do whatever it takes to enter 2014 with improved
operations and a notably better inventory position.
Obviously, expense rates in Canada are unusually high, due to start-up costs, incremental activity to clear inventory and
lower than expected initial sales. While expense rates are expected to improve over the next several years, we expect
meaningful improvement in 2014, as we move past first year start-up costs, we gain efficiencies through systems and
process improvements, and we drive sales increases through our efforts to drive shopping frequency.
Turning to consolidated metrics, third quarter interest expense declined $27 million, or 14% from last year, as we
continue to benefit from the debt retirement following the receivables sale. We returned $271 million to shareholders
through dividends in the third quarter, marking our 184th consecutive quarterly dividend since we became a public
company in 1967.
You've likely noted that we did not repurchase any of our shares in the third quarter. While we remain committed to
share repurchase over time, we have consistently maintained that we will govern the pace of repurchases with a goal of
maintaining our strong A credit rating. As a result, in the third quarter, we took a pause in our share repurchase activity,
in light of the incremental dilution we're currently experiencing in the Canadian segment.

Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor our results, while maintaining a dialogue with the debt rating agencies, and
we will resume the program when conditions are appropriate. I should emphasize that, given the compelling increase in
free cash flow we expect next year, we believe we'll have the capacity within our rating objectives to return up to $4
billion through share repurchase in 2014.
Now, let's turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter and resulting metrics for the full year. In the U.S., we're
planning for approximately flat comparable sales, given there are six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and
Christmas, the current state of the consumer, and the expectation for a very promotional and competitive environment.
As Kathee mentioned, we have ample base inventory to generate much stronger sales than planned if consumer demand
turns out to be stronger than expected. And while most of the season is still ahead of us, I can tell you that, so far in
November, sales have been right on our forecasts, supporting our expectations for the quarter. Notably, the pace of our
digital sales growth, so far this month, has been on plan and much stronger than we've seen so far this year.
Fourth quarter U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate is expected to be down slightly from last year. On the gross margin
[ph] line (30:46), we expect to see year-over-year improvements, reflective of the comparison against last year's
unusually high seasonal markdowns, this year's change in vendor payments, and the comparison to last year's 53rd
week, which added a relatively low gross margin week to the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter U.S. segment
SG&A expense rate to be a full percentage point above last year's revised rate of 17.3%. About half of this increase, or
$110 million, is related to the credit card portfolio, driven by its smaller size comparing against the small reserve
release last year, and this year's profit sharing arrangement with TD. The remaining expense pressure in the U.S.
segment reflects the change in vendor payments, investments in technology and supply chain, and a lack of leverage on
flattish comparable sales growth.
In the Canadian segment, we expect another meaningful acceleration in sales dollars, reflective of the stores we opened
in the third quarter, additional openings this quarter, and the surge from holiday-related sales. We expect gross margin
expense rate pressures to continue, as we move beyond a record year of store openings to refining operations and
clearing inventory in preparation for 2014. Our forecast is for the Canadian segment dilution in the range of $0.22 to
$0.32 in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. As you'll recall, last year's 53rd week
added $0.05 to $0.10 to adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and full year. Adjusting for this benefit, this year's
expectation would keep us flat to down slightly from last year's performance on an apples-to-apples basis, despite an
expected $110 million headwind from the credit card portfolio.
Combining our expectations for adjusted EPS, Canadian segment dilution, and the $0.02 impact from the reduction in
the beneficial interest asset, we expect fourth quarter GAAP EPS in a range centered around $1.26. For the full year,
our expectations are for adjusted EPS in the $4.59 to $4.69 range, down slightly from last year's performance of $4.76,
reflecting outstanding operational discipline, when you consider that it reflects more than $400 million in lower
expected earnings from the credit card portfolio, driven by a smaller asset base, annualizing last year's reserve
reductions, and the profit sharing arrangement with TD. It reflects more than $200 million of expense pressure from
incremental investments in technology and supply chain to support our multi-channel efforts. It's comparing against last
year's 53rd week, which added $50 million to $100 million to last year's pre-tax earnings.
Combining these factors, we faced a headwind in the neighborhood of $700 million this year, of which we've offset a
meaningful portion in a tough environment, with expected comparable sales of less than 1% for the year. As a result,
we are very pleased with the operating discipline reflected in our expected 2013 results for the U.S. segment.
In Canada, we have accomplished a great deal and remain confident in the long-run potential for these stores. In the
near-term, however, dilution has been higher than expected, as the team worked diligently to refine operations, enhance
inventory flow and position the segment for meaningful improvement in profitability throughout 2014. For the year,
our expectations are for Canadian dilution in the range of $0.95 to $1.05. Combined with the net accounting impacts
from debt retirement, the credit card sale and nonrecurring tax benefits, our outlook in the U.S. and Canada leads to an
expectation for full-year GAAP EPS in a range centered around $3.52.

While the economic environment for the next year remains quite uncertain and beyond our control, we feel good about
our plans for 2014 for a number of reasons that are within our control. In Canada, we'll move past start-up expenses
from this year's market launch and we're confident in our plans to rationalize inventory, drive sales and improve
operations. In the U.S., we've demonstrated our ability to continue to manage the business with discipline, regardless of
the economic environment, including our continued focus on expense optimization.
And we feel very good about our plans regarding capital deployment, as we expect to have a dramatic increase in share
repurchase capacity, driven by a reduction of Canadian CapEx of more than $1 billion, meaningful improvement in
Canadian segment EBITDA and continued strong cash flow generation by our U.S. business, with U.S. CapEx
essentially flat to 2013. As of today, we expect the combination of factors will allow us to repurchase up to $4 billion
of our shares in 2014, while continuing to grow the dividend and maintain our A credit ratings.
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Gregg, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your
questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: I wanted to start right with REDcard and traffic. That's a trend this year that's sort of gotten
locked in at this down 1% to 1.5%, and you just gave some goals a few weeks ago where comps would be 2% or better
over the next few years. How do you get to the 2% over time, if traffic's still down 1% to 1.5% or what initiatives with
REDcard or anything else that you have to really get that traffic stabilized?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: So I'll start, Greg. I think a couple things. One, I think, first of all, the stress on low
income consumers is certainly playing a role. We've seen that all year long. The payroll tax increase has been a portion
of that, for sure. I think we get to cycle past that in January and we'll get better information about what that looks like
going forward. But beyond that, and the things that we actually control, as you said, we continue to see meaningful
growth in REDcard. That continues to drive 50% lifts in sales, all of that driven by traffic. Kansas City is above 25%
penetration now, so it continues to grow hundreds of basis points a year.
And then beyond that, I think it's all about our multi-channel initiatives and everything we're doing there. And, as I
said, we're starting to see strong digital sales growth. That, combined with the flex fulfillment activities that we're
implementing now, piloting a little bit later this year and we'll begin to roll out next year, we think all of that put
together will continue to drive meaningful traffic increases.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: And the other thing I would add, Greg, this is Kathee, is just that as guests are consolidating
their trips and they're coming less frequently, it's really important for us to get them to shop around the store and to buy
more. And you do see in our basket, that we've been able to accomplish that for the past several quarters, as well, so we
will stay focused on how do we ensure that we get more of their wallet when they do come.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And maybe a direct follow-up to that, I know that with all the multi-channel initiatives and you
outlined them all on the call, how have you changed how store managers and associates are incentivized, so that they
give the sort of level of service to the online guest that's coming in to pick up in store? Do they get credit for that or
how should we look for that to be changing going forward?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yes, they do. They get total credit for anything that is bought online, picked up in store or
things that are in store where there's an extended aisle sale and it's – so we're incenting this – actually, we have a
parallel environment, where both teams, both our .com team and our store teams get credit for growing the business in
a collaborative way.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Does that...

<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: So there's no penalties or there's no internal conflict at all, as it relates to who's going get
that credit for the sale. So we're double crediting everybody from an internal standpoint and then we take it out at the
enterprise level to make sure that it all washes through on a consolidated basis.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Is that true if I have it shipped to my home?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: If it's shipped to your home from the store, yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: Kathee, just on the average ticket side – Greg was talking about transactions, but just get to the
ticket, I mean there's sequentially been a pretty nice acceleration in AUR throughout the year and you talked a little bit
in the third quarter electronics impacting that with the UPT being down. As you plan the business into the fourth
quarter, would you still expect your AUR to be up kind of 3% and UPT to be down? Or how should we think about the
dynamics that's driving average ticket? And also, that points to – if AUR is up, which points people are maybe buying
up, you're moving them up, how do you square that with a consumer that's constrained?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Most of what's driving it up for the fourth quarter will be those hot categories, like
electronics, that are most popular in the holiday season. And there's a lot of newness there that drive up the average
selling price. So think of iPads, think of all the new video game consoles and games, which Target does very well with
and we are really excited about that business for the holiday season. So I would anticipate it will continue into the
fourth quarter.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah. So think of it more as a change in the mix of what we're selling at this time of year
versus trading up within category.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: Got it. And then my kind of question related to this, Kathee, and it gets back to the trip issue;
with what you've seen with Cartwheel, what trips is that group – you're seeing an extra trip and how do you really jump
on that at a faster rate to drive trips the way you did with REDcard?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah, first I would tell you it's pretty early. I think we've got about six months in with
Cartwheel, but, as we mentioned, very excited. We've got over 3 million users right now that are very engaged. I think
it's helping trips. I also think it's really helping basket, because they're using Cartwheel in the store on their mobile
device, looking for deals on things that they want to buy and they're adding more to their basket. So still really early to
see trends, but we are very excited about it and are talking about it more and more. We're going be using Cartwheel as
one of our vehicles to help drive value this holiday season and, hopefully, more and more people will hear about it and
sign up for it, but we think this is a big success story for us that we can continue to grow.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Great, thanks. I have a couple-part question here on Canada, and I think most of them are
related. John, I think you talked about the gross margin being impacted by some inventory issues in Canada late in the
quarter. Can you just give us a little bit more color there on what happened there and then, maybe also outline where
are some of the pockets of excess inventory that you're looking to move through? And then, just secondly, are there any
signs of hope in the business, or glimmers of hope that you can kind of point to, whether it's by region or category, that
are kind of going better than expected at this point in that market?

Page 11 of 15
<A - John J. Mulligan>: There's always hope, Sean. We're highly confident that we're going be successful. To your
inventory question, we talked a lot last time about, given the sales shortfall and the fact that we planned inventories to
protect on the upside, given all the excitement, there was a pretty large inventory overhang. And as the teams have
worked hard over the past 90 days assessing the best way to handle that, and it depends on the various categories about
the best way to handle that, we've clearly seen some markdowns come through. We're taking advantage of that actually
to drive value messaging in Canada and get across how sharp our prices are.
And then we're also assessing what of the inventory do we think we're going to sell ultimately below cost or end up
salvaging, because there's just flat out too much of it. And that's the inventory reserves that we assess at the end of the
third quarter. We do that every quarter anyways as a matter of course and we'll do that again at the end of the fourth
quarter. But that was a large piece of what happened at the end of the third quarter.
I think as far as lumpiness of inventories, as you'd expect, it's the long lead categories where we tend to be lumpy. The
stuff that turns quicker or that is domestically sourced, we can obviously shut down receipts much, much quicker. But
stuff that is long lead and we'll see this continue actually a little bit into spring and here think about categories, like
bikes, where those are a long lead item. And it just, we can't get out of the receipts once we've made commitments. So
those are the type items that'll take us a little bit longer to clear through.
I think on signs of hope, we wouldn't call it hope, but on signs of our execution starting to improve, we are seeing, and
I think this is consistent with what Gregg said, as we start to get sales histories, we can start to replenish stores more
accurately, balance our inventories and meet guests need when they need that.
And we're starting to see success there. As we look at our current results, we're pretty much hitting our current forecast,
but we're seeing much stronger results in the cycles that have been open longer. Cycle one, cycle two, cycle three have
actually begun to exceed our expectations a bit. So we're a little bit hopeful. We're not hopeful, we're optimistic that
we're seeing the right trend with those cycles improving. And we believe we'll continue to see that as we get more age
behind the cycle four and cycle five stores.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just secondly, on the – in terms of expense
optimization in the U.S. business, looks like you guys did a great job of controlling that there in Q3, maybe even below
what you would expect moving forward. Do you feel like you're in the right position now there? And what type of
comp do you feel like you need right now to leverage that SG&A moving forward maybe in Q4 and then the first half
of 2014? Thank you.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah. I think our efforts on expense optimization continue to be very successful. The teams
are very engaged across the company and continuing to look for new ideas of ways that we can reduce expense. And I
think part of this is about lowering our center of gravity that you're referring to. But a big part of it, too, is reinvesting
that in other parts of the business. And you've really seen that this year. We had significant incremental investments in
technology, supply chain. That will happen again next year, particularly around technology and flexible fulfillment.
We'll make SG&A investments and expense optimization really allows us to offset that. So I think leverage probably
hasn't changed a whole lot somewhere between that 1% and 2% range, but it gives us a lot of capacity to invest in the
business as we continue to grow our multi-channel capabilities.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Good morning. My first question relates to Canada. What kind of insight can you give us into
the average number of stores opened over the course of the quarter, in terms of as it relates to timing of openings, just
to give us the ability to measure an accurate sales productivity number? We obviously try to get sales per store and
sales per foot. But the growth is moving so quickly on such a small base that it's very easy for those numbers to get

distorted.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: We agree with the last part of that comment. And we've continued to say it's very early here
and we're going to see it move around again in the fourth quarter, given we see the surge in holiday sales. I don't have
the exact weighted average on the store timing, Matt, but John Hulbert will get that to you. We can get that to you
today.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: That'd be very, very helpful. Second question I would ask relates to the electronics business.
Clearly, the video cycle is here and is very prominent. And I know that mobile is still a relatively new business for you.
If you look at the legacy consumer electronics businesses and you mentioned tablets, where I know you had a fairly
high profile promotion recently and TV and other businesses that have less kind of industry-wide going on
year-on-year. What's your experience been in those categories? What was it in the third quarter and what's your sense
of the promotional environment here in Q4?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Well, Matt, I'd say it's strong overall. Certainly that varies by category, but there are a lot of
great trends in our business in electronics. I mentioned a couple that we're excited about for Black Friday next and
going into Cyber Monday and the rest of the holiday season, things like Beats by Dr. Dre. The whole headphone
category has been fantastic and that's a lead item. Speaker systems, like SONOS, have been fantastic. So there are
many different categories that are performing well. Some are a little bit softer, like cameras, but, in total, a really strong
business in electronics right now.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the Canadian and gross margin and just
your thoughts about how that proceeds going forward, I think originally you had talked about the Canadian gross
margin being above the U.S. I was interpreting that as maybe a couple hundred basis points above the U.S. rate. But
you have these competing factors right now, where the markdown pressure is a negative, but the mix factor is a
positive. So as you look into the crystal ball, how do you think – how might your – are your gross margin expectations
shifting based on those two competing factors over what the long-term opportunity could be relative to your original
expectations?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah. Hi, Chris. This is Gregg. Over the long-term, our expectations haven't changed at
all. What we're experiencing now and, as John talked about it, it's those long lead time businesses that are
markdown-sensitive, particularly home and apparel, that we have to exit and it's costly to do so. Remember the first
cycle of stores didn't open until April, and the second cycle followed shortly after that and that was only a handful
number of stores. By the time we really got a good, clear indication, in terms of where the sales were going to level out
for this year, in our long cycle businesses and think six, seven, eight months, these receipts were already planned and in
production and on the way. So it's really the lump of inventory that we've got to work through. And once we do that,
we're very confident that we're going be back in the mid-30s, like we talked about in terms of the overall gross margin
because the mix continues to be strong. And we're very pleased with that and we don't see any signs of that abating.
Now, it might come down a little bit as we get more aggressive in terms of building that trip frequency. And we'll start
those efforts in earnest when we turn the corner in 2014. But on an absolute basis, we're really pleased with where we
are in home and apparel. And we've got to get through this next quarter and the early part of the beginnings of 2014
until we really get that sales history developed, by item, by store, and eliminate some of the huge variability that we
have in the supply chain, so that we can get a more even balance between receipt flow and what we're selling. And, at
that point in time, we fully believe that we're going be back to where our initial expectations were from a gross margin
standpoint.

<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And then, you mentioned that some of the early cycle stores were starting to, I guess,
exceed your expectations a bit. I had a really interesting chart at the Analyst Day that talked about where the expected
ramp in the stores initially versus where it's sitting now. Could you just reference for us what you mean by exceeding
your expectations a bit? Is that versus, I guess, your original expectation on first year sales or versus what you
re-thought?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: No. These are against the new most recent level-setting expectations that we shared at the
Analyst Day that said that they're not where they were when we originally planned the business. But now that we've
had enough experience, we see where they were and we established, and rebooted essentially, our expectations for
Canada. So against that new most current forecast, what we're seeing is encouraging signs out of those earlier cycle
stores. They are exceeding these newer revised forecasts more than the later cycle stores, because they've had a chance
to operate on their own. They're six months into it now. The inventories are flowing better. In-stock levels have
improved. The guest is getting used to our stores. They're converting from more of a browser to a shopper. And so it's
still very, very early, but we like what we see in some of those early cycle stores. And so, at this stage, we're just
encouraged by the fact that they're performing better against most revised, revised forecast.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And then, one just quick last one, can you just share with us what your share in the
gaming category is in the U.S.?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: I don't know that number off the top of my head. It is definitely higher than our typical
market share, but we can get back to you with that number.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah. It's much higher than our aggregate store or electronics market shares.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Okay, appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah. We'll get pack to you on that one.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Hi. Yep. It's Jason DeRise here at UBS. Can I ask, I guess, about the comps? I just want to get
your thoughts on a few of these items if you would maybe quantify them. So one is the, how much of the shift from the
timing of the calendar between Q3 and Q4 in your reporting benefited the current quarter that was reported and pulled
forward from Q4? And then get your thoughts about if you think there's any impact on your comps from SNAP,
whether that's directly in your food sales or your general merchandise sales, if you'd quantify what kind of uplift you
expect from video games. And also, one thing that didn't come up yet, but lower fuel prices, how you're thinking about
that?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Well that's a lot of questions. On the third quarter, I think, clearly, Halloween moving into
the quarter benefited it. I would remind you that we also said at the end of last quarter, a back-to-school week moved
out of the quarter into second quarter. That benefited second quarter, net-net, probably a wash, maybe 10, plus, minus,
10, 20 basis points. I don't really know, but net-net, a wash. Let's see, on...
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: WIC.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: WIC, any time there's a decrease like that, there's an impact. But for us, grocery, food is
about 20% of our business roughly. And it's a very different kind of trip for us than most grocers. So certainly there's an
impact, but, for us, meaningfully, that's just not – again, this is a small impact relative to what we might see at other
retailers who sell significantly more food as a percentage of their business than we do.
And then electronics, what was the question on electronics? I'm sorry.

<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: I guess the video game cycle itself, what kind of comp uplift you would expect just from that.
And the last part of that was about fuel prices coming down, if you see that as a benefit for yourselves or not.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Well we don't necessarily talk about categories and how big they are, but with two new
console releases and all the games that will go with them, as you know, it's been a declining category for several years,
given the maturity. It's been over seven years since we had a new console. So having two in the same year is very
meaningful for the category. It's also very meaningful for electronics in the store. So we think it's going be one of the
biggest gifting categories of the year and we will certainly benefit from that.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: And then on fuel, there's no question that in a time when, particularly lower income
consumers have very constrained budgets, having less – having to spend less on fuel, it helps in some way. For us, I'll
tell you, through time, we have looked at this many, many ways and it's really hard to quantify fuel price moves in our
sales. There's times when fuel prices are going up in a good economy and that's good for everybody, which is different
than today. So it's hard to quantify. But overall, lower fuel prices is definitely good for consumers. It just puts more
money in their pocket.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: And if I can ask one more about comp trends, the apparel part of the business, I mean, it
sounds like the branded stuff is going well for you. Can you talk about your private label trends in apparel? Is that
maybe where some of the weakness is and what you're doing to try to turn that around?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Apparel, I think, was – most of what we have is owned brand product and exclusive
designer partnerships that we do, so that is the bulk of our business. Certainly, we do a lot of basics with branded
manufacturers, Hanes, for example, but our comp in apparel was down slightly. It was much stronger online. So we're
seeing some shifting happening there. We are pleased with the new releases that we've had. Phillip Lim was probably
our best designer launch ever, very clean sell-throughs, both in stores and online. Our launch of our holiday product is
off to a good start, while it's still early. So we're feeling pretty good about apparel overall. I would say that the softest
part of apparel has been in kids', and we are working on ways to make sure that we can drive that business and have the
right price-value relationship for our guests to help drive better market share gains. But the rest I feel pretty confident
in.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: You're welcome. We have time for one more question.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Good morning. Just looking at the U.S. business from a gross margin standpoint, if we
exclude the vendor agreements' accounting shift, I think gross margins would have been down about 50 basis points
year-over-year. Can you just kind of prioritize or rank for us the impact from markdowns versus category rate pressures
and other factors and just how we should think about that going into the fourth quarter, given the promotional intensity?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: The 50 basis points is about right and I would say about half of that was due to the ongoing
pressure we've seen for several years now related to REDcard and the store remodel program. The other half, like we
talked a little bit about, was really related to markdowns we took, given the Halloween sell-through that we saw. And
we saw sales soften up, like we said, in the middle of the quarter, given everything that was going on with consumer
confidence and in Washington. We saw sales soften up a bit and really just some promotional markdowns to sell
through our Halloween inventory. I think as we think about fourth quarter, as we talked about, it's going to be very
promotional. There's no doubt about that, but the primary driver of our performance versus last year is last year, we
took significant clearance markdowns [ph] last year. (58:49) That's what you'll see be the primary variance
year-over-year in our gross margin rate.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Okay, so improved performance on gross margin in 4Q versus 3Q experience?

<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Absolutely.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Got it, got it. And then, just lastly on Canada, you mentioned that there was a lot of
investment – or a lot of markdowns in inventory. Is some of the gross margin hit also related to price investments being
made in certain categories? If you can just give us an update on that, along with a reminder, John, on what the drag was
from start-up expenses in Canada this year.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah. We haven't disclosed the drag from start-up expenses all year long, so we haven't
really talked about that a whole lot. As it relates to price investments and markdowns, I think it's all – we view that as
all one big bucket really, and it's really the total value message we're able to give to the guests in Canada right now.
And, as I said, we have a little bit of excess inventory. We'll take advantage of that, to be sure we're giving a great
value message. But beyond that, as we look at our pricing in Canada on like items, we are right on where we want to
be. We are locally competitive and right on the price leaders in Canada, so we feel really good about our pricing in
Canada on like-for-like items.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Thank you.
