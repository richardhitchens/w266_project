Turning to our business segments; my comments reviewing the third quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the second
quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 3 and 4. Timberlands contributed $80 million to pre-tax earnings,
$3 million more than in Q2. Revenues from Timberlands exchanges were $24 million in the quarter, an increase of $17
million. In the West, log prices declined approximately $5 per cubic meter. Domestic log prices decreased due to an
abundant supply of farmer wood. Export log prices were off slightly due to mix.
Dry conditions and fire danger in the West resulted in a 3% reduction in Fee Harvest volumes. Row crops in the West
were seasonally higher. In the South log prices increased 2%. Third-party log volumes rose 6% and the Fee Harvest
was slightly higher. Silviculture costs in the South were slightly lower as planting was deferred due to dry weather
conditions.
Wood Products, charts 5 and 6. Wood Product contributed $59 million to pre-tax earnings in Q3, $29 million more than
in Q2. Price realizations increased across nearly all product lines as product supply channels remained lean. OSB prices
increased $54 per thousand square feet, or 25%, and lumber prices rose $9 per thousand board feet, or 3%. The sales
volumes for Engineered Wood products increased 8%. Sales volumes for lumber declined slightly as Southern lumber
mills took downtime in response to slightly weaker market conditions around the 4th of July holiday. Lumber mills
operated at over an 80% rate in the quarter. OSB mills took downtime for scheduled maintenance resulting in lower
sales volumes. The operating rate for OSBs was 85%.
Cellulose Fibers, charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $78 million to pre-tax earnings, $42 million more than in
Q2. During the third quarter, this segment had a strong performance, pulp production increased 9% and maintenance
costs were lower. In Q3, there was only one scheduled maintenance outage of 13 days. In Q2, there were two annual
maintenance outages resulting in 27 days of mill downtime. Pulp sales volume increased 2%. Pulp price realizations
were flat.
Real Estate, charts 9 and 10. Real Estate contributed $17 million to pre-tax earnings and had no significant income
from land and lot sales. Second quarter pre-tax earnings of $15 million included $12 million of land and lot sales.
In Q3, single-family home closings increased 21% to 615 homes from 508 homes in Q2. Home closings were up 21%
over the same quarter last year. Although the average home closing price was $372,000, this was nearly flat with
second quarter. Margins went up in most geographies with the largest increase in San Diego. Gross margins in Q3 were
24.3%, up from 19.5% in the previous quarter. The backlog at the end of the quarter was 1,055 homes.
Real Estate controls approximately 27,000 lots in our primary markets. In addition, we control 67,000 lots, mostly
under option, and a lager master plan community in Nevada, where development and construction is on hold pending
improvement in the local market.
Unallocated items, Chart 11. The foreign exchange gain of $11 million in Q3 was due to the strengthening of the
Canadian dollar. The swing from Q2 was $19 million. Offsetting this was a charge of $10 million for the elimination of
intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. As we discussed last quarter, this item was formerly reported at the segment
level and it's now recorded in unallocated items. The charge for share-based compensation increased in Q3 as the price
of Weyerhaeuser stock appreciated. The increase in share-based compensation largely accounts for the increase in
SG&A.
Now, I will turn the call over to Dan Fulton.
Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
I'll start by saying that I am pleased with our strong quarterly performance. As Kathy noted we earned $117 million
during the quarter. Comparing this quarter's earnings with our second quarter earnings before special items, we had a
quarter-over-quarter increase of $70 million, with each of our core business segments showing gains. The rise in our

earnings was the result of ongoing business improvement initiatives, coupled with increasing strength of U.S. housing,
which allowed us to capitalize on the full value of the company.
Before I offer some brief comments on the performance of each of our business segments I'll provide a macroeconomic
context for our quarter.
First, the housing market. On last quarter's call I noted that the long awaited housing recovery looks and feels real.
After another solid quarter, all indicators point to continued steady improvement. Recent September housing starts data
shows a seasonally adjusted level of 745,000 for the year, confirming what we're seeing on the ground in the
marketplace.
In addition to increased construction activity, we now have the latest release of the widely reported Case-Shiller
numbers, which are a bit of a lagging indicator. These numbers show broad modest increases in pricing across most
major markets. Price increases help build consumer confidence which then begins to move more potential homebuyers
off the sidelines. While today's construction levels are still low by historic standards, all forecasts point to continued
recovery in 2013, as we begin to return to long-term trend levels that are needed to house a growing number of U.S.
households.
Since World War II, housing has normally led the way out of our cyclical recessions, but as economists Rogoff and
Reinhart suggests, this time is different. In this recovery, the broader economy began to improve earlier in the cycle and
we enjoyed the benefit of improving global markets over the past couple of years in our cellulose fibers business. This
time however, it's housing that has been lagging. Ironically it now seems that the broader economy has hit a soft patch,
perhaps in response to trouble in Europe and slower growth in China. Housing is at last beginning to play its historic
role in putting people back to work.
There are plenty of reasons to feel cautious about the pace of the housing recovery, including election-year uncertainty
and the year-end fiscal cliff. Additionally, high oil prices affect our costs directly in the form of diesel fuel, resins and
glues, and freight costs. And high gas prices affect consumers, especially homebuyers in California. Nevertheless, our
quarterly results show that we're improving our performance in this uncertain environment.
With respect to global economic conditions, over one third of our revenues come from exports of products from our
Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. Slower growth in the Eurozone and China affects demand
for our products in these markets. Demand is also affected by supply from global competitors adjusting to changing
levels of regional demand. I'll discuss specific factors as I review results for our business segments.
Now, I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Timberlands, we had a solid
quarter with earnings increasing slightly as a result of increased profits from dispositions. Export sales of logs from our
strategically located Western lands are a competitive strength of Weyerhaeuser, and they're an important component of
our earnings. During the past quarter, demand from Japan, which is our largest export market, remained stable.
Quarterly volume was down slightly due to the timing of ship departures. These shipments will be included in fourth
quarter results.
Over the past few quarters, we've commented on the slowdown of log exports to China, but noted that we expected
some pickup in Chinese demand towards the end of the year. Our effectiveness in building longer term reliable
relationships with direct customers, together with some correction of temporary oversupply, resulted in a 9% increase
in our shipments to China during the quarter. This increase helped to offset the slight decline in volume to Japan, which
will be reversed in the fourth quarter.
In Wood Products, we again delivered strong year-over-year results and quarter-over-quarter results. Sales realizations
increased for most products as a result of improved commodity prices, as well as a higher value product mix. The
segment also benefited from the effective execution of performance improvement initiatives. The result, earnings
nearly doubled compared with the second quarter despite slightly lower volumes for lumber and OSB.
Excluding special items, our $92 million in EBITDA for the quarter was up $102 million from the third quarter of
2011, and year-to-date, we're up $195 million, demonstrating the operating leverage that we have with our large scale

in all product lines, especially lumber and OSB.
Improvement year-to-date is the result of better market conditions, but also from deliberate, across the board initiatives
that we've undertaken to improve our performance. In total, these initiatives have contributed to more than half of our
year-over-year bottom line gain.
Examples of these broad improvement initiatives include: revenue gains from targeted price increases for both
commodity as well as value added products; volume growth from an expanded presence in the repair and remodel
market; reduced manufacturing costs from higher operating rates and greater manufacturing reliability; and lower raw
materials costs due to improved log recovery, reduced purchase of outside veneer, and reduced use and cost of wax and
resin additives. We still have further opportunity to improve our performance, but we're pleased with our progress.
Moving to RECO, as Kathy noted, earnings increased slightly from the second quarter results, as home closings rose
21% due to steady market improvement as well as seasonal activity. This quarter, we had no significant land sales
compared to the second quarter when we sold our Cross Creek Ranch master-planned community in Houston.
Sales continue to show the strength of the housing recovery, as quarterly sales increased 45% compared with last year.
Year-to-date, total sales were 40% greater than last year, and they're up in every one of our markets. This sales activity
led to a 74% increase in our backlog compared with last year. The national housing market continues to improve at a
measured pace, tracking job growth and a steady decline in both new and resale home inventory.
Real Estate is still local, however, and the pace of recovery differs among our regional markets. In the quarter, our most
improved market was the Inland Empire of California, where sales doubled from the second quarter, and tripled from
one year ago, as we tapped a market opportunity with attractive newly designed homes for more price sensitive buyers.
Sales in the Washington DC market, which typically are slow in the summer months, showed surprising strength
compared with last year. This improvement included sales of affordable homes, which are required as part of our
development entitlements in this region.
Year-to-date, our most improved markets are Arizona, Las Vegas and California's Inland Empire, followed by solid
gains in the Puget Sound region, Washington DC and San Diego. The LA-Ventura market is beginning to show signs
of slow recovery, and Houston, which has been a solid market during the downturn, has maintained steady volume this
year.
My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fiber segment. Our Cellulose Fiber segment earnings increased
significantly as a result of less planned maintenance downtime and higher productivity. This improvement came despite
challenging global market conditions. Price realizations were approximately flat, holding better than commodity grade
index prices, which declined during the quarter.
With approximately two-thirds of our Cellulose Fiber sales coming from exports, foreign exchange rates can affect our
results. During the quarter, the Canadian dollar rose slightly, while the euro strengthened late in the quarter in response
to new Eurozone policy measures. Both changes should help the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fiber
segment.
We continue our dual focus on – of continuous improvement in our manufacturing and marketing while also
developing innovative new products. Innovation over time will provide margin uplift and allow us to continue to grow
with global customers.
Construction is nearing completion at our new modified fiber manufacturing plant in Gdansk, Poland. Product
qualification is set to begin by year-end, and we should begin to deliver product by mid-year 2013.
Our newest announced product is THRIVE, a proprietary form of thermoplastic composite using a sustainably sourced
cellulose fiber from our pulp mills as a reinforcement additive. The product will initially be used in automotive parts
and household goods. This green polymer product will help manufacturers of auto parts improve performance
characteristics and costs compared to their existing petroleum based parts. Thought this will not have a significant near
term financial effect for us, it's an example of our success in developing innovative new products from cellulose. In this

case for new customers, starting with Ford today with global potential in the future.
Before turning to Patty for comments about our fourth quarter outlook as well as financial highlights, I will talk about
our recent decision to increase our dividend by 13% from $0.15 per quarter to $0.17.
When we converted to a REIT in 2010, we stated that our objective was to set an attractive dividend that would be both
sustainable and could grow over time. In setting our initial post conversion dividend level, we wanted to strike the right
balance considering our overall economic outlook, our outlook for near-term company performance, our targeted
capital structure, and the affordability of our targeted dividend.
On last quarter's call in response to a question, I said that we would set our dividend not looking back, but looking
forward considering our future earnings potential as well as our view of market conditions. Although we remain
cautious about the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global economies, our board was pleased to take action at this time
to increase our dividend. This decision was based upon the clear results of operational improvements to enhance
performance within each of our businesses, that are evidenced in our report this morning, and our confidence that
housing fundamentals are improving.
And now I'll turn the call over to Patty, to discuss our fourth quarter outlook as well as provide financial highlights.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning everybody.
Notwithstanding the uncertainty in the overall economy, we are pleased that nearly one month into the fourth quarter
we continue to see the sustained signs of an improving housing market.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is summarized on chart 12, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the
West, domestic log prices are anticipated to be slightly higher on volumes comparable to Q3. Export volumes to Japan,
our highest margin logs, remained strong and are expected to increase in the fourth quarter. Housing markets in Japan
have been stronger this year driven by a combination of historically low mortgage rates, planned increases in
consumption taxes in later years, and some rebuilding and repair activities from last year's tsunami. The weak euro
continues to create heavy price competition from European laminated lumber. Demand and prices for our logs to China
are expected to increase moderately with improvement in both residential and commercial construction activity.
In the South, realizations for logs are expected to be slightly lower due to a smaller piece size with a heavier mix to
chips and fiber. Fee volume is likely to be slightly higher seasonally. We will see significantly increased costs, mainly
due to the timing of silviculture treatment. Nonstrategic land sales are expected to be flat to Q3. Overall, we expect
earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter.
In Wood Products, the fourth quarter is traditionally one of the weakest earnings quarter of the year due to seasonality.
While we do not – while we do expect to see some softening as we progress through the quarter, to-date prices and
volumes have been unusually strong for this time of year across most product lines. We will likely have reduced
volumes later in the quarter, and we will continue to match supply with demand. We continue to focus on driving
operational improvements across the system and we will take the opportunity with the slower holiday season to
complete some minor maintenance and capital projects. We expect to be solidly profitable in the fourth quarter, but
well below third quarter level.
Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales realizations for pulp to decline primarily due to
softening in the fluff market, which lagged the decline in [ph] NBFK (20:48). Global softwood inventories are in the
normal range, but uncertainty in the global economy still exists. Sales volumes are expected to increase somewhat
compared to the third quarter.
Our final planned outage for the year was completed earlier this month with downtime of about six days, compared
with maintenance downtime in the third quarter of 13 days. As a result of fewer maintenance days, maintenance
expense will be lower. Energy costs will likely be somewhat higher as a result of lower electricity sales and somewhat

seasonally higher natural gas usage. We expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment for the fourth quarter will
be comparable to the third quarter.
In our Real Estate segment, we anticipate home closings to increase to just over 800 compared to 615 closings in Q3.
The mix of closings in the fourth quarter will include fewer closings from certain high margin communities in San
Diego, and increased volume of affordable homes with low margins due to regulated sales prices. As a result, although
our home building activity continues to be strong, we will likely see margins drop to below 20% in the fourth quarter.
The increased closing volume will also result in higher selling-related expenses. We expect that earnings from our
single-family home building activity will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And it is
possible that the fourth quarter could have some land sales, although the amount and the timing is difficult to predict.
There was no significant land sale activity in Q3.
Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Through the third quarter, capital spending for Weyerhaeuser
Company totaled approximately $219 million. We still expect total spending for the year, which includes reforestation,
to be around $290 million. We ended the quarter with cash of $608 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter
included debt maturities of approximately $181 million, and a $97 million payment on a note related to a timber
monetization for timber that was sold in 2002. During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive about $110 million when
the related financial investment matures.
Cash received for stock option exercises during the quarter was approximately $66 million, driven by the higher stock
price. Our dividend payout in the fourth quarter will increase to approximately $92 million, reflecting the increase in
the quarterly per share dividend to $0.17, as Dan has already discussed. We have no further debt maturities this year,
and we expect working capital balances to decline seasonally by year-end, however, not to the levels of last year-end
given our stronger Wood Products markets.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks Patty. Quarterly results from all of our business segments demonstrate the operating leverage that we have to a
recovering housing sector, as well as operational improvements in each of our businesses that are increasing our
competitiveness.
We will continue to focus on what we can control; improving our operating performance and our relative
competiveness; being prepared to take full advantage of the quality of our assets, the strong relationships with our
customers and suppliers, and the commitment of our dedicated employees.
And now, we welcome your questions and comments.
Q&A
Operator
At this time, I would like to welcome everyone. [Operator Instructions]
And your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Hi Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: I had a question on costs. You've done a good job of containing SG&A over the past year.
But as we look forward to 2013, there is a possibility you could be growing revenue maybe in the double digits; you
should be seeing volume recovery in most of your businesses. Can you talk about how you think about SG&A targets
in that environment?

And then in terms of working capital requirements as you ramp up volumes, what are the working capital needs, and
maybe the incremental capital spending that's going to be tied up as we move closer to 1 million starts next year, or the
following year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning Anthony. Let me first talk about – address your question on SG&A. We've
made a tremendous amount of progress on bringing down our overhead expenses over the last three to four year period.
And our journey is not done. We continue to look for opportunities to continue to ratchet down our G&A. However, we
are now shifting to a period where we expect to be growing because of the pickup in housing and the need to be
re-staffing in certain locations. A lot of the re-staffing is not reflected in G&A, it's costs of sales head count. So we
continue to be focused on managing our G&A and keeping the gains that we've made during this downturn. We would
expect selling costs to be increasing, coincident with the pickup in sales because fundamentally most of our selling
costs are tied to revenues, and we would expect selling related expenses to be increasing as we begin to recover.
As we think about working capital, Patty commented that we shouldn't expect the same level of working capital at the
end of this year in our Wood Products businesses as we had last year, because we are selling more material and we are
manufacturing product, not just to maintain our current level of business, but as I mentioned in my remarks, we are
increasing sales in certain channels. And so there will be some additional working capital related to increased sales
activities as go into 2013 and as we continue to expect housing starts to recover. We would expect the same thing to be
showing up in our retail business throughout 2013 because we expect our volume to be increasing coincident with the
pickup in housing.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Maybe the one thing that I would add, and you saw that in this quarter, as Kathy
commented, where G&A will go up to the extent that the stock price impacts the variable compensation in terms of
marking our share price to market. So I look forward to that part of the G&A going up. But as Dan said, we'll continue
to stay very focused on holding on to the G&A gains, and really increasing that through productivity and some of the
activities that we have underway.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question, please.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just shifting gears to Chinese log demand. You
referenced expectations for improved log prices on Chinese homebuilding activity. I'm just wondering can you tell us
what you're seeing in October, and is that something that you're really seeing now, or is there sort of an expectation for
an improvement towards the year-end, or can you just give us any kind of color on what you're seeing now?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, we saw some pickup in our export activity in the third quarter, probably a little bit better
than what we might have imagined. We had been anticipating some market recovery towards the end of the year. We
were able to capitalize on better conditions in the third quarter, and we would expect that to continue through the fourth
quarter and in to next year.
Some of that, as I said, is related to working down inventory generally in China, but also us continuing to capitalize on
the relationships that we have developed with our Chinese customers. There was a slowdown in construction in China
that now seems to be reversing itself a bit. Remember that we're not selling structural grade material into China for
wood framed housing. You know the wood that's going to China is used in construction for primarily forms as well as
other industrial uses. But I think we're seeing the benefits of the predictability of our logistics, the quality of our logs,
and so we expect that we continue to take advantage of the opportunity in China, recognizing once again that our
largest market is Japan for our export volume for logs.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: But Anthony to your question what we're seeing for China now. We are having – and they
are moderate increases, small, but we are seeing the pricing picking up on our China. And as Dan talked about we
really go through very established customer relationship. So it may be a little different than what you are seeing in the
broader industry.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thank you, Anthony. Next question?

Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning Mark.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Mark?
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: I am sorry. Can you hear me better?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes that's better, thanks Mark.
<A>: [indiscernible] (30:54).
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay, sorry. Okay. So two things, I mean everything you've said about housing is right and
bullish, and I think we all feel pretty good about it. Was the increase in the cancellation rate anything special, or is there
something we should be watching for there?
And then a second question, which I know I have sort of asked this question before. As I talk to Southern landowners
they tell me that rotations are changing dramatically just by default. Is your system not seeing that just because it's so
big?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: With respect to cancellation rates, I think they've been extraordinarily low for the last several
quarters, and I think, Mark, what we're seeing is a return to perhaps a little bit more normal situation.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The primary reason today for cancellations is the challenge in mortgage qualification, which
is still difficult process for most homebuyers, and so there is some level of discouragement that leads some to drop out.
But I don't view the uptick in cancellation rate to be troubling. In fact there is a very low level of finished inventory in
the market for new homes, and the inventory levels of used sales have come down pretty dramatically. So there is a
shortage of product out there, and that causes me to feel relatively comfortable.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. That's really helpful.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Mark, this is Patty. Actually, it's not just one. There is a number of ones that we have;
they're small in size. Most of the activity that took place this quarter, I believe was primarily in the South.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. And do you have an expectation Patty for what we will see over the next 12 months to
24 months in terms of aggregate level of non-strategic sales?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Boy Mark, it's difficult to know. As you know, those sales are lumpy. I wouldn't see a
significant pickup in the amount of acreage that we would bring to market from a sale perspective, only because we've
really optimized the portfolio. So, in terms of additional non-strategic assets, as you know, we sold a fair amount over
the past.
In terms of things that might come on the market, I think we are seeing some pickup from the industry broadly, but
difficult to know exactly what'll happen over the next 12 months to 15 months.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. And could you talk on at RECO, what you're doing vis-à-vis lots and lot options at this
point.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes. I mean, we always approached the RECO markets differentially Mark. As we've
explained in the past it's really a function of what the entitlement risks are in each market. We are always active in the
market. We have a strong pipeline of lots at various stages. And, so we're confident that we've got lot availability that
we can see for an increase in activity in 2013.
As we look out towards 2014, our plans are in place to be sure that we've got the improvements going in, so that we'll
have finished lots for those time frames. We also have lots, I think as we've discussed before, where we have the ability
to sell to other builders at the right time in the right place, and we've got the optionality in our portfolio to either build
homes on those lots or to sell them to others, if that happens to be an advantageous strategy.
The lot market is tightening up in most major metro areas, especially finished lots. So the industry is working through a
lot of the lots that had been developed prior to the turndown in the cycle. Now we're back into a mode of having to put
in infrastructure improvements to complete new lots, and so that is causing some escalation in prices in most markets.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thank you, Mark. Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: One thing that stood out, and I know we're not back to normal times, and who knows what
normal will be. But when you go back in the past, it seemed like you all had usually a rush of closings in the fourth
quarter in Real Estate that really took the number up a lot. And again, knowing we're just on the turn I can see why it
might be premature. But is there anything else going on that might make the pattern seasonally be different as we go
through the next few years as housing – assuming it continues to recover, if that happens? Or will we at some point – or
this just an usual year that the fourth quarter is not really moving up a lot?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, our fourth quarter closing estimate is increasing. And that is typical with the seasonality
that you observed in the past. I think that's typical not just for us, but for other builders. And so we have actually a
fairly significant increase in closings that are projected.
As Patty pointed out, the margins will not be as great as what they were in the third quarter. And so that's a
quarter-over-quarter comparison that's important to recognize. Q3 margins were higher than normal because of a mix
that was heavier to San Diego, especially some projects in San Diego where we were closing out sub-divisions and had
very high margins. As we move to the fourth quarter, the shift of mix moves away from San Diego to more affordable
markets where margins are lower, and is further affected by the fact that we have a significant number of closings that
we're projecting out of our Winchester operation in the Washington DC Metro area where they will be delivering some
affordable homes that are required as part of the entitlement process in Maryland and Virginia.

Page 10 of 16
And – and so those are very low margin homes that are part of an overall subdivision development. Those affordability
requirements are imposed on developers in projects that are roughly 50 lots or more. And so what you're seeing really
is as a quarter-over-quarter comparison that is a mix shift, and it accentuates those differences. But we still expect an
increase in activity in the fourth quarter for closings.
What is noteworthy this quarter, as we look at the fourth quarter, I think as Patty noted, normally we'd have more
slowdown in the Wood Products business. And what we're seeing is pricing hanging in there a little bit longer then
what might be normal. And I think that's related to construction activity, not for homes that will delivered this fourth
quarter, but early next year.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Chip just to give you some numbers on the closings. If you went back last year in the
third quarter, we were at 508 closings and we went to 582 closings in the fourth quarter. This quarter, the third quarter,
we were at 615 closings and will be over 800 closings in the fourth quarter for this particular quarter.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. And – and that's very helpful with the mix, it sounds like it's unusual. And just one
quick follow-up. I'm looking at your guidance for Wood Products and we always – as we all know have to take it with
a grain of salt given the volatility. Although there are lags, it just seems to me that you are taking quite cautious view,
especially given that in the last week or two we've seen a rise in the price of Buff Lumber and OSB, at least in the trade
press. And now we've got this hurricane, which of course you guys don't have to worry about out there, that is about to
visit us here on the East Coast. And so I mean are you taking a large dose of the normal seasonality and putting that
into your guidance, or do you actually think this is a – in other words, are you being conservative?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I think it's a fair statement, Chip, that our overall guidance is conservative. As you
appropriately pointed out, volatility for pricing in both of those commodities has been a pleasant surprise, both in the
third quarter, and as I said in my opening comments, to-date in the month of October, we've been pleasantly surprised
with the strength of pricing.
Just to give you maybe some way to gauge that a little bit, in lumber, every $10 of movement in price for us in this
quarter will be about $3 million per month, given the volumes that we're projecting for the fourth quarter. And in OSB,
every $10 is $2 million a month.
So those earnings move pretty dramatically with price increases. So if these price increases hold, we will be above the
guidance that we gave you for the fourth quarter. And I think the nice thing about Wood Products is you do get some
visibility as we go through the quarter in terms of what's happening out in the market given the printed publications that
come out.
But we're pulling for higher pricing in both of those. And I would be very pleased later in the quarter to be reporting
that our guidance for the fourth quarter was higher than what we're talking about today.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Two final comments on that question, Chip. When the new housing start numbers were
announced last week, that did cause some increase in activity among our customers, because our customers are running
with very thin supply – inventory levels. And they would normally be managing inventory levels down at year-end.
And so, good news with starts causes the channel to react relatively quickly, especially with limited amount of product
in the channel.
And then finally, we do care about the hurricane. That will potentially affect our manufacturing business and our woods
on the East Coast and as well as overall market conditions for our customers. And so we're concerned about that just as
much as you are.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thank you, Chip. Next question?

Page 11 of 16
<Q - George L. Staphos>: I have two questions. One on RECO, to beat that perhaps into the ground, then one on
Cellulose Fibers.
The closings that you're projecting for fourth quarter are actually pretty normal relative to your backlog, if you look
over history, and certainly you've talked about mix, and the fact you have more affordable housing being produced this
– or closed this quarter. Yet traditionally, Dan, the fourth quarter from an EBITDA dollar standpoint, an operating
profit dollar standpoint, has been in fact larger than the prior quarters. Should we now assume that this change in mix is
something that we should expect for future periods? Are there any implications from this, or is this really just a one-off
factor? And when you're talking about mix, could you relate at all what the selling price changes were on what closed
this quarter within your regions?
On Cellulose Fibers, my question is, have there been any positive or negative implications thus far in terms of your
demand from some of the outages that we've heard about on super absorbents relative to that Japanese factory
explosion? Thank you.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So, George, I'll answer them in the order that you asked them.
With respect to the fourth quarter, it is a mix issue, especially relative to Q3, and it includes these affordable units. And
the issue on the affordable units is that it – there's a different rhythm to them. So in our Winchester operation, which is
where these sales are coming from, they are normally a pre-seller of homes. And so they take an order and then they
build the house and deliver it. With these affordable units, they are attached, they're part of a larger project. We build
them and then when they are close to completion, we turn really the sales process over to the community entity that
handles these affordable units. And so it's a – it's a larger number of deliveries all at one time. And so when you have
low margins in a large group of homes, it will tend to drag down the overall mix. That's not something that I would
expect over time, but there is some lumpiness to the way those affordable units are delivered.
We are also seeing an increase in closings that tracks the sales that we've had earlier in the year in some of our lower
priced markets. And so that is also affecting margin. As we look at cash flow, the increased activity in closings will
generate more cash flow even if margins are down a bit, because fundamentally we're recovering all of our costs
including the land cost that's invested in those lots.
With respect to the question on the SAP...
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Maybe before you go there, Dan, in terms of the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter, fourth
quarter last year to this year, the other thing that impacts that, George, and I think you referenced that, it's just the
average closing pricing itself. And you can see that delineated somewhat on chart 10 that's in the packet.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Right.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: You can see that the average closing price at the end of last year's fourth quarter was
almost $400,000; this year it's $372,000. And right below that graph you can see the average sale price, which came
down through the end of last year and the beginning of this year, but now is trending back up again. So it's a
combination of those two.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Patty, that's mix. So I mean would you say that all your markets have seen increases in
selling prices even if the mix itself has changed the average price that you're reporting?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We are seeing some. It's not a huge significant amount. We certainly would look forward
to seeing more as housing recovers greater, but...
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Understood.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We did see a pickup in the quarter in September. So if we look at our – the September
numbers are different than the quarterly numbers, but the September numbers prices are up, I think, in every single one
of our markets.

Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Alex?
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: With the – yes, can you hear me?
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Yes.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Excellent. With the housing momentum gaining the – with the housing momentum improving,
especially with the housing starts number that we saw a couple of weeks ago, which I think was a lot better than
people's expectations. As you look at your Wood Products manufacturing footprint, is there any capacity that right now
isn't running, that you think you will be bringing back in 2013?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are operating all of our lumber manufacturing facilities today. We're operating all of our
OSB facilities. They have – they are not running 100%. So they have some capacity potential. In our Engineered Wood
products facility, we still have some mothballed facilities. The operating rate in our engineered manufacturing
operations is lower than it is with OSB and lumber. And so we have the ability to ramp-up production in order to meet
demand in the near-term. And we have no announcements at this point, nor we have made any decisions about when to
bring back shuttered capacity.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. Understand that. And then, as you're going to go through your budgeting process for next
year, would you be able to share what housing starts number, or a relevant range for housing starts number, that you'd
you would expect to use as you think about budgeting within the Wood Products business next year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We will share that on our next call at the beginning of the year. So we're tracking a number of
outside forecasts. The ranges today for 2013 from third party forecasters that we track, range from about 900,000
housing starts up to as high as 1.2 million housing starts. We'll have a better handle on that at year-end and then we will
share with you what we are using for planning purposes, and that would help you calibrate perhaps what we're
expecting to be delivering in our Wood Products business, our timber business and homebuilding.

<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Southern saw log markets? So we've seen
a reasonable pick up in housing activity, Wood Products prices are up, but it doesn't seem like there is much traction in
terms of log prices. And I'm just wondering what you think is holding that back, and what it will take to start to see a
pick up and turn there?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I think it will be consistent, steady demand, and we would expect some pick up in response to
increased activity. It continues to be a regional market, Gail, as you know. And so as starts pick up generally, there's
opportunities in the marketplace to manufacture more in, certainly, our wood products facilities, as well as third parties.
And I just think it's going to be continued uptick in demand that will tension the market and then you should start to see
some movement.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And in terms of homebuilding activity, when you look at kind of the sales activity
that you're seeing, is the mix of business what you would expect to be normal, aside from the affordable housing issues
that you're having in the fourth quarter? But I mean, are you seeing kind of the new home buyers versus – the mix
you'd expect of new home buyers versus step – move-up buyers, et cetera, that you would expect in kind of a more
normal housing market?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are. I mean, we sell to a broad range of customers. The activity that I talked about this
morning in the Inland Empire has been reassuring for us, because that market has been very slow, and so we've seen a
steady increase in activity. And I think we found a sweet spot in terms of price and product for that market. So that's a
first time buyer product.
In some of our other markets, we've seen move up activity being stronger. Las Vegas is a market where we've had some
real success in move up housing. So I would say it varies by market. We're not seeing any noticeable long-term shifts in
demand in terms of the kinds of homes and the kinds of features. We're all focused on affordability, and we're focused
on getting homebuyers confident again to go back into the marketplace. And so we're starting to see that activity, and
each of our local markets are responding with new product that meets the needs of today's buyer. But not seeing any
significant long-term shifts at this point.

Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Hi, Mark.

looking, if discount rates stay roughly where they are for next year versus this year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Mark, we'll be going through those calculations here shortly. We really haven't finished
that workup yet. So I really don't have anything to share at this point, but we will be going through that on our fourth
quarter call.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. If I could, though, one more. I know last year you had a pretty big increase in the
amortization of actuarial loss that went up by, I think, about $70 million. Does that stabilize this year or does that also
go up again this year?

<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: And then real quick, so lumber panels, you mentioned you're operating kind of 80%,
85%, if I caught you right?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. The types of housing start increases, particularly the upper end that some of the
forecasters are talking about, would potentially imply that quite frankly you would struggle to meet all the demand and
maintain market share. Am I missing something there? And/or – and what can you do? Is there flex in your system now
where you can meet that higher demand if need be fairly quickly?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have flex in our lumber business because we have the ability to add hours, and ultimately,
if the demand is sustained, to add some shifts. And then there is – we have continued to make improvements in the
productivity and the throughput in the mills that we do have. Our OSB mills have some flex capacity as we ramp up.
And what we'll do is focus on serving the markets where we optimize our margin with longer-term relationships, and
we optimize our strategic advantages. So I would say we're looking forward to the opportunity to challenge ourselves,
Mark, with that increased activity.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Understood. Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: The other thing is especially as we look at our lumber system, Mark, we do have the
ability to do some debottlenecking across the system as the demand picks up. So we're looking at the ability do that,
first with non-capital solutions, and then obviously to the extent that there are other capital things that would give us
some additional capacity that we have in front of us, we'll be looking at doing that as well.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering, I actually missed your discussion of how may lots
you had. I think you said 27,000 within RECO and then you had a big position in Nevada, which I missed.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes. So what we said was that we have – control about 27,000 lots in our primary markets.
Those are lots that are intended for our own home building operations as well as for sale to other builders. Of those lots,
roughly 80% are owned and 13% are optioned.
And then additionally we control about 67,000 lots in large master plan in Nevada, and that is a project that where
we've put the development and construction on hold, pending improvement in local market conditions. The majority of
those lots are held under a long-term option, and the value of that particular property is based upon its development
rights, and in particular its water rights. When we look at our lot position, we have always sold some portion to
third-party builders, and what that gives us is tremendous amount of optionality because we can choose to shift the mix
between what we build and what we sell. So in general about 25% of the lots that we control have been targeted for sale
to third parties, but we do have the ability to shift that mix depending upon opportunities in the marketplace.
The length of our lot pipeline varies by market based up on local entitlement conditions. So we have a much longer
position in a place like California where entitlements are very difficult, and a short position in a market like Houston,
which has no zoning, and one can go through the process relatively quickly.
And in some markets we are developing a majority of our own lots and others we continue to purchase lots from
third-party land developers.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: So the 27,000 lots, are those basically shovel-ready? And how would that compare to your
target inventory in a normal housing environment?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: They are not all shovel-ready. But they are – we control them and we have some level of
entitlements, and what we do is we manage the development of these properties so that we're not investing in a lot
infrastructure earlier than we need to. So we're comfortable with the position that we've got. As the market picks up we
will continue to perhaps move the locations of those lots around, and the investment in lots, but that's an ongoing
process based upon local demand and local opportunities.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thank you.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Could you just – sorry, Kathy, remind me the time lag between when a home is sold and
closed?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, that varies. So in some cases we have finished homes. Houston is a market, for example,
where we historically have built homes on a speculative basis because there is a large group of buyers in Houston that
are relocating there, primarily in the energy business, and when they come to town they need to buy a house. And so
that house needs to be ready to move in, in probably a couple of months.
If it's a completed home and if we sign a contract in today's market it's likely 60 days to go through that processing for
a mortgage. And then the other extreme would be a pre-sale, which we do in most of our markets where we have a
model complex, a buyer comes in, they sign a contact, and then we build the house, and the construction timeframe can
run from say 90 days to six months, depending upon the complexity of the house, and the finish and the ultimate price
range; and then you'd add the closing timeframe to that. So if it's a pre-sale the homebuyer is going through mortgage
qualification process while the home is being built.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Again sorry to beat the home building issue to death, but just one quick question there. Can
you tell us what your community count is on the RECO side, and how that's changed over this year? And also on that
where you envision that going, I guess in 2013?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The community count for RECO is down just a bit this year. And so what is happening in the
homebuilding business at all times is you're continuing to open new communities, you're closing out new communities.
Total community count today for us is 66, and we would expect that to be increasing next year.
One of the things that we have focused on, especially over the last two to three year period, is the sales per community.
So we have focused on increasing the effectiveness and the productivity of every one of our communities to the point
that today, I think based upon our data, we've got the highest number of closings per community of any public builder.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: And are you seeing any credit trends among new home buyers today, or existing home
buyers, are you seeing that going down the credit curve, so to speak, or is it still mostly in people with very high FICO
scores, people that could get mortgages much easier, or are you starting to see some falling of credit?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Still very high FICO scores. Mortgage qualification process is challenging. We're still waiting
for a definition of Qualified Residential Mortgage through the Consumer Product Protection Bureau, and also coming
out of Dodd-Frank. That's an issue that needs to be addressed in the industry. Right now, the initial proposals continue
to be for a 20% down payment. I think that's too difficult, and there needs to be some moderation, and the pendulum
swung very far to tightening credit and I think that longer term we need to see some moderation in that process.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thank you, Josh. We have time for one more question.

Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Thanks very much for taking the question. I had just two questions on Wood Products. We
obviously saw OSB prices jump in 2012 here, and they seem to remain high. How do you see about the – what do you
think about the sustainability of that market?
And then also on lumber, although it's come up, we're still below long-term averages. Just your future sort of view on
that pricing dynamic as well.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I'll take lumber first Paul. We take the long view on lumber and look at total projected North
American starts, both U.S. and Canada. And then we look at the relationship that we have with lumber that has
historically come from Canada. We would expect demand to be increasing as the market recovers, and we would
expect a healthy environment for lumber. I can't project future prices.
With respect to OSB, the market has been tight. Most operators are producing at relatively high levels. As I mentioned
earlier, when the new starts number came out last week it was evident that the supply channel was pretty thin. And so I
think that's what's been helping OSB prices. And we would expect that – we've got a long way to go on this recovery.
As I mentioned, today's levels are still very, very, low compared to historic starts numbers and long-term trend
numbers, and so we're bullish on the long-term.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Great. Thanks very much.
