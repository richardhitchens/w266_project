MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All
participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This
call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the
question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by
Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Brian B. Yoor
Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide
opening remarks, and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom,
and I will take your questions.
Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from
those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities
and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except
as required by law.
Also, you'll see in our earnings news release this morning that financial results from the developed markets branded
generics pharmaceuticals business have been presented as discontinued operations this quarter due to the pending sale
to Mylan. As a result, the line items of our Consolidated Statement of Earnings are now reported on the basis of
continuing operations. We also provide in the release a reconciliation between continuing and discontinued operations

for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 and 2014. For the remainder of 2014, our earnings per share
guidance will include results from both continuing operations as well as discontinued operations associated with the
developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business being sold to Mylan. Our commentary and guidance for
sales and other P&L line items will be for continuing ops only.
In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on
our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the
impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share above expectations and
another quarter of sequential improvement in total company sales growth. We're also raising the midpoint of our
full-year adjusted EPS guidance range, which is now $2.25 to $2.27, representing double-digit growth. Third quarter
adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 increased approximately 13% including discontinued operations, which is above
our previous guidance range.
Today, I'll focus my comments on results from Abbott's continuing operations where sales increased 6.7%
operationally. Emerging market sales will now represent nearly 50% of Abbott's total sales, and increased 15% in the
quarter with double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition, and Diagnostics. In the quarter, we also
advanced a number of transactions in our branded generics business to accelerate our ability to drive balanced and
sustainable growth in emerging geographies. We remain on track to divest our developed markets business to Mylan in
the first quarter of next year. Mylan is well-positioned with its global scale and capabilities to do well with this
business over the long term.
We completed our acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals at the end of September, which establishes Abbott as a top 10
pharmaceutical company in Latin America. CFR provides scale and a product portfolio that strongly complements
Abbott's presence in Latin America, and more than doubles our branded generics sales in the region. CFR also brings a
network of manufacturing plants and R&D facilities in Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, which further diversifies
our cost base in emerging markets. And, most importantly, CFR adds top talent with strong local market knowledge
and a proven ability to quickly develop, manufacture, and bring new products to market.
We expect our announced acquisition of Veropharm to close by the end of the year. Veropharm positions Abbott to
become a top five branded generics company in Russia, providing us with in-country manufacturing and a broad
portfolio well aligned to our therapeutic areas of focus. Following the close of these transactions, our Established
Pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics is driven
by favorable demographics, including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out-of-pocket
for high-quality trusted brands. Moving forward, we would expect this business to generate sales growth in the
upper-single to double-digits.
We're also executing on our organic growth opportunities, including the launch of a number of new products and
innovations across our businesses. I'll briefly review our third quarter results. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales
increased double-digits this quarter. We've largely recovered from the sales disruption in our International business. At
the same time, we're executing on multiple new product launches across key geographies. We continue to invest in our
global infrastructure to support the strong global demand for adult and pediatric nutrition. As we discussed last quarter,
we reinforced our footprint in China through the opening of our new manufacturing plant in Jiaxing and our strategic
alliance with Fonterra to invest locally in China's milk supply. And last week in India, we announced the opening of
our third new manufacturing facility this year in Nutrition. A stronger footprint in our key geographies will allow us to
be closer to our customers and work faster to create and customize new products for their needs.

In Diagnostics, we delivered 6% operational growth in the third quarter, a sequential improvement from the second
quarter driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
We're funding investments in growth in advanced multiple new system platforms across all three of our Diagnostics
businesses. In Medical Devices, our Vascular business is performing below our expectations, primarily related to sales
of our drug-eluting portfolio.
We remain focused on improved execution and increasing the penetration of Absorb in Europe and several key
emerging geographies. MitraClip, our structural heart technology, delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter,
and we expect continued adoption in the U.S. following improved reimbursement and National Medicare coverage. Our
peripheral stent, Supera, also contributed to growth of our Endovascular business in the quarter.
In Diabetes Care, we launched our next-generation Flash Glucose Monitor, FreeStyle Libre, into the nearly $4 billion
blood glucose monitoring market in Europe. Libre is a revolutionary new glucose sensing technology that's generated
very positive feedback early in its launch. It eliminates the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a
simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.
And in Vision Care, 70% of our sales are generated by our cataract products, which increased double-digits again this
quarter. Our new cataract lenses and the uptake of our Catalys laser cataract system are driving above-market growth.
To support the growing global demand for our cataract lenses, we recently broke ground on a new manufacturing
facility in Malaysia.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, as we expected, sales improve sequentially again this quarter. The emerging market
branded generics business increased double-digits as a result of improved commercial execution, and continued
expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus. We expect continued momentum in EPD as
we exit the year, including CFR, where sales have been growing consistently at a double-digit pace.
So in summary, we're right on track with our expectations that we communicated at the beginning of this year.
Operational sales growth has improved sequentially each quarter. We're particularly pleased to see that type of
improvement in our branded generics business and Nutrition as well as steady durable performance in Diagnostics and
Vision Care.
We, again, exceeded adjusted earnings per share expectations for the quarter and increased the midpoint of our EPS
guidance range, which results in another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we're continuing to build
Abbott for durable growth over the long-term, completing the CFR acquisition in the third quarter and working toward
a first quarter 2015 close of the sale of our developed markets branded generics business to Mylan.
I'll now turn the call over the Tom.
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. As Brian mentioned upfront, because guidance previously provided for the third quarter and the
full-year 2014 included the developed markets branded generics business being sold to Mylan, we will continue to
include the contributions from this business in our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2014. However, our commentary
and guidance for sales and other P&L line items this quarter and for the fourth quarter forecast will be for continuing
operations only; that is excluding the business being sold to Mylan.
Today, we reported third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding specified items, of $0.62, above our previous
guidance range. Sales from continuing operations, that is, excluding the developed markets branded generics business,
increased 6.7% on an operational basis, and 5.8% on a reported basis in the quarter. Including the contribution from
discontinued operations, sales would have increased 5.6% on an operational basis in line with previous guidance.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in several businesses, including double-digit growth in
Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition, and steady growth in Diagnostics and Vision Care. Total company sales in
emerging markets increased 15% on an operational basis in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of

sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.4% of sales from continuing
operations.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014. Today, we're raising the midpoint and narrowing our EPS guidance
range, excluding specified items, to $2.25 to $2.27, which includes the results from our developed markets branded
generics business now presented as discontinued operations and reflects double-digit growth over 2013. We forecast
operational sales growth from continuing operations in the mid-single-digits for the full year 2014. Based on current
exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full-year reported sales,
which is somewhat more negative than previous expectations, driven by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digits for the full year 2014. Brian will review the
growth outlooks by business in a few minutes. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% of
sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat more than 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of
sales from continuing operations for the full year 2014.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014. We forecast double-digit operational sales growth from
continuing operations. As Miles mentioned earlier, we recently completed the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals and
expect this business to contribute approximately $200 million to sales in the fourth quarter. Based on current exchange
rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 2.5% on sales in the quarter. This would
result in reported sales growth in the high-single-digits for the fourth quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin
ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investments of approximately 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A
expense of around 28% of sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, our sales and earnings progression for the year is playing out as we forecasted back in January as we
continue to forecast another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Brian B. Yoor
Thanks, Tom. This morning, I'll review our third quarter 2014 performance and fourth quarter sales outlook by
business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with our Nutrition
business, where global sales increased 10% in the third quarter. In our International Pediatric Nutrition business, sales
increased 14%. We have recaptured our share in China and Vietnam, following the previously-reported 2013 sales
disruptions, and continue to drive uptake of new products. This includes new infant formula products, Similac QINTI
and Eleva, that we recently launched into the premium segment of the Chinese market to further enhance our
competitive position. International Adult Nutrition sales increased strong double-digits in the quarter, representing the
fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business. Sales growth was led by continued strong
performance of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in emerging markets.
Last week, Abbott announced the opening of our new nutrition manufacturing plant in India, the third plant we open
this year to meet increasing demand for our nutrition products. This new manufacturing plant is one of Abbott's most
technologically-advanced nutrition plants in the world and will source up to 80% of its ingredients locally in India. We
will work together with Abbott's nutrition R&D center in India to deliver innovations to address unmet health needs in
pediatric and adult nutrition, while also meeting specific local tastes and preferences. In the U.S., Nutrition sales
increased low-single-digits in the quarter in line with expectations. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect
global nutrition to deliver double-digit sales growth on an operational basis.
In our Diagnostics business, sales increased 6% in the third quarter, representing sequential improvement from the
second quarter with sales in emerging markets growing double-digits. Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased
nearly 7% as we continue to outperform the market. In the U.S., sales growth was impacted by comparison to the third
quarter of 2013 when sales were higher due to the timing of equipment sales. Year-to-date growth of 7.5% better
reflects the underlying performance of the U.S. business where we continue to build momentum with our enterprise
account promotional model.

International sales in the third quarter increased 8%, driven by continued strong growth in emerging markets. In
Molecular Diagnostics, our core focus in largest business is infectious disease testing, where year-to-date sales
increased mid-single-digits. In the quarter, growth in our infectious disease business was offset by a decline in some of
our smaller businesses as well as the timing of tenders in several emerging markets. In Point of Care Diagnostics,
worldwide sales increased 6.7%, representing a sequential improvement from the first two quarters of the year.
International sales increased 17% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and
emerging markets.
For the fourth quarter, in global Diagnostics, we're forecasting mid- to high-single-digit operational sales growth. In
Medical Devices, Vascular sales decreased low-single-digits in the quarter. Sales growth was relatively flat excluding
the impact of the third quarter 2013 sales true-up related to a third-party agreement. We continue to see strong market
adoption of MitraClip, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation and growth from Supera,
our peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA. As Miles mentioned during the third quarter, MitraClip
received National Medicare coverage and improved payment rate for the procedure, which will help drive adoption of
MitraClip in the U.S. Both structural heart and endovascular products grew double-digits in the third quarter globally.
In our drug-eluting portfolio, in September, we presented the first randomized clinical trial results for Absorb, our
bioresorbable vascular scaffold. One-year results from the ABSORB II study demonstrated that Absorb provides
comparable results to XIENCE and lower rates of angina or chest pain. Also in the quarter, we launched additional
Absorb sizes, further expanding the potential for Absorb's use in more coronary procedures.
As we look ahead, we expect to see improvement in Vascular sales growth driven by commercial execution and
contribution from new products, as well as further Absorb penetration as we exit the year. So for the fourth quarter, we
expect to see a sequential improvement in growth in the third quarter with relatively flat year-over-year sales on an
operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, global sales in the third quarter were somewhat ahead of our expectations as the rate of decline in the
U.S. is moderating. Outside of the U.S., we are focused on driving growth in both emerging and developed markets in
our Diabetes Care business and recently announced European launch of our revolutionary new glucose sensing
technology called FreeStyle Libre. It eliminates routine finger pricks and finger-prick calibration and reads glucose
levels discretely through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm.
In the near-term, we're working to obtain reimbursement for Libre in Europe as well as bring it to market in a number
of additional countries next year. For the fourth quarter, in our global diabetes business, we expect a mid-single-digit
decline on an operational basis with international growth offset by the later stages of the market transition in the U.S. in
line with our forecast earlier this year.
In Vision Care, sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Sales of our cataract products, which represent approximately
70% of our Vision Care business, increased double-digits, outpacing the growth of the global cataract market. We
continued to capture market share with our recently launched premium intraocular lenses including our TECNIS
OptiBlue line of lenses in Japan and our TECNIS Toric lenses in the U.S. and Japan. In addition, we continue to see
strong adoption of our new Catalys laser cataract system.
We're also receiving strong feedback from early adopters of our new TECNIS Symfony Extended Range of Vision
intraocular lens that we launched in Europe in the second quarter. TECNIS Symfony provides patients with a
continuous range of vision including far, intermediate, and near distances, but with reduced incidence of halo and glare.
And last week, we announced the distribution agreement in the U.S. with Carl Zeiss Meditec, a leading ophthalmic
diagnostics company. The Zeiss product line of diagnostics and visualization systems combined with Abbott's
intraocular lenses, lens removal systems, and laser cataract systems, provides surgeons in comprehensive portfolio of
cataract products to maximize the visual outcome and streamline patient flow. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect
our global Vision Care business to grow double-digits on an operational basis.
And lastly, our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, where sales from continuing operations, that is,
excluding the developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business, increased nearly 13% in the quarter. This

strong performance was driven by double-digit sales growth across several emerging markets, including India, Russia,
Mexico, and Vietnam. This business continues to make meaningful progress in becoming a more consumer-oriented
organization that is focused on expanding product portfolios in key therapeutic areas, implementing new branding
initiatives across the portfolio and increasing its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channel.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, we forecast double-digit sales growth on an operational basis from continuing
operations in our emerging markets branded generics business; this includes CFR Pharmaceuticals, which is expected
to contribute sales of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, sales growth improved sequentially this quarter, as we expected, and we exceeded earnings per share
expectations, raising the midpoint of our full year guidance range. We are on track for another year of double-digit
adjusted earnings per share growth in 2014.
We will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on a nice quarter. Miles, I wanted
to really start with the EPD business and, first, the updated agreement today with Mylan. Could you just spend a minute
on that [indiscernible] line (22:52) because obviously, there was some question about whether that transaction as it was
initially constructed [ph] could be approved (22:58)? So, A, can you comment on that, and then, B, the EPD
performance from continuing ops this quarter, the up 12.9%. Can you just talk about the sustainability of that
performance? That seems like a very high number. So could you just talk about how we should think about that
business going forward? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, well, I assume that one of the questions this morning was some clarity on whether or not
the transaction with Mylan's going forward. I think that's clear; we've reported discontinued operations, carved out the
financials, et cetera, and as we very clearly said in the earnings release, yes, we're tracking forward, no change. I don't
think there's much more to comment other than that, so that should take away some, I suppose, speculation on
uncertainty there. And that's all tracking according to schedule. The performance of the remainder of EPD – actually I'd
say both halves, I mean we've actually seen improvement in the developed markets part of the business, which is a
good thing. That's the part that we're divesting to Mylan. And in the – and we've seen improvement in the emerging
market piece.
And some – I'd say some improvement in market and economy in a few of these markets, like India, but overall, I'd say
an improvement in the overall performance of the business, which we've been expecting and waiting for, and that was
kind of what we intended, kind of what we planned, and we're seeing it. So I can say that's gratifying. Now I think
everybody around the world, every company I've seen reported, expressing caution around economies everywhere, and
currencies everywhere and so forth. And I think the one issue that I continue to track closely, which we have obviously
less control of than the operating performance of these businesses is just the overall currency volatility around the
world and that of course affects this business because it's purely an ex-U.S. business.
But other than that, I think what we're seeing here in gradual improvements and our performance in the business is
good, that's good. I'm feeling pretty good about that, because, as you know, and earlier in the year, we were projecting
sequential improvements in this business as the year went on, and you guys rightly asked about it every quarter, and
we're seeing that – your greatest fear is that you don't see that. So we're pleased with that. Now in addition, we add
CFR to that, CFR's performance in Latin America has been consistent double-digit growth, and that's also a plus going
forward. So I think if you look at the underlying performance of the business, we exceeded double-digit growth, and
there's very little CFR in here, so because of the timing of close. There's not a lot of CFR in the numbers, and even

without it, the business is growing double-digits. So I'm pleased with what I see in the emerging markets.
When we're done with the Mylan transaction, with the developed market business, this business will be purely an
emerging market business, which has been our strategic intent to focus on, because we see the conditions in those
markets in the developing economies quite favorable to the business over time. So that remains an important strategic
focus for us, and I think the investors now will have a much clearer visibility and transparency to the opportunity in
those markets. One of the great things about emerging markets is the growth potential there of these economies and
these healthcare systems, and that's why we're focused on that.
That's a very important source of growth. It comes with volatility, which means you've got to be diverse, you've got to
be diverse in the geographies you're in. Fortunately, we are; we're well spread out. I think CFR helped us even further
with that. So I like the prospects for the business and I'm glad we're seeing the fundamentals improve.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: So, Miles, just two quick follow ups, if I can. So one obviously, one, you're confident that
the transaction is going to go through. Two, the piece that we've talked about that you didn't really address at all in your
opening comment in this call was the Vascular business, which obviously had a difficult quarter. So can you just talk a
little bit about how you're thinking about that business strategically and how you turn that business around given your
success now in turning around EPD? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes. Well, first of all, back to your original question about confidence. We're right on track
with our transaction with Mylan. And I'm superstitious enough not to want to speculate or hypothesize or whatever. I
would say we're on track with what we said, what we expected, and everything we're doing is pointed at a conclusion
on time, on schedule as described. And I don't know what else to say about it than that. I don't really want to get into a
lot of speculation about other stuff, but – and I think it's as I said tracking exactly where we want it to be. So that's
about as much as I can say, and – or I think I should say.
The Vascular business is a disappointment. There's just no question about that. And this is our performance. To a
degree, I think all of us competing in this business can look at a slower market, but this isn't about slower market, this
is about us. The part of this business where I'm most disappointed is the U.S. in us and our performance there. There's a
lot of price competition, but when there's price competition, that price affects everybody. So the whole market is
experiencing price competition. I think that there is a fair amount of commoditization that's happening here as
customers are turning more and more towards value and less and less toward differentiation of performance of
products. And I think when that happens, your competitors begin to sell on price and other factors. I think this market
has definitely changed.
The dynamics, the competitive dynamics have changed, and our approach to it needs to change as well. And that's just
a fact. For us, if you look at the performance, it's primarily the stent business, and it's primarily the U.S. Now is there a
residual effect in Europe? There is. Is there a residual effect in Japan? There is. I'd say in both countries – both
geographies, that is, Japan and Europe, it's price. But in addition, I think that there is definitely a share war going on.
We're the leaders in the category and, as such, we – a lot of – we're targeted by everybody else, and we don't seem to be
dealing with that as well as we should and I think that's pretty clear. So, at this point, I don't have any projections to
make to you other than it's got our full attention.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I want to, sort of, follow along the train of thought on
the Vascular business. And, Miles, when we make the comparison to the turnaround you've been able to execute on
EPD, it seems like it's not completely analogous. And the reason I say that is EPD you operated in fairly attractive end
markets, largely in the emerging markets, whereas in Vascular the vast majority of the business is in stents, which I
think would be hard to call an attractive market. So as you think about this business strategically, do you need to
rethink the business mix, or the potential to engage in more aggressive portfolio modification to really change the

growth portfolio of that vascular franchise?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, first of all, let me tell you, I don't see an analogy between this and EPD other than there's
been a time when both have performed below our expectations and we frankly wished them to perform at or above our
expectations. So, there's the comparability. Other than that, you're right, they're different. The answers to the device
business or the stent business are clearly different. The dynamics of the market are different, and so on. In our case, I
think there's two things. One is, we clearly have to deal with our competitiveness in the stent category and in particular
in the U.S. We simply have to figure out here how to be a lot more competitive than we apparently have been. So that's
point number one.
Point number two beyond that, I think for this business to be a contributor to growth, it's got to be broader, we've got to
broaden our footprint here. We've got to broaden into new areas, new innovations. Now in our case, MitraClip, the
peripheral, the longer-term prospects for Absorb, and frankly any other expansion beyond that, they are all
considerations here. We can't just sit here and be a drug-eluting stent company and rely on that, so it's clearly our intent
to broaden the business and grow other dimensions of it in the device area, but you have to do that on strong a
foundation, so we've got to fix the competitiveness of the underlying business first. And we're clearly looking at how
we expand and shape this business going forward. I have no intention of being out of the business. I have no intention
of shrinking. I have no intention of any other changes other than full steam ahead. But, I'd say, the underlying
competitiveness and then expansion from there is what's on the table.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's helpful perspective. And then maybe just on the underlying business, maybe
could talk a little bit more about Adult Nutritionals that that is a franchise that looks to be doing reasonably well, and
there obviously looks to be a pretty big opportunity in China on a go forward basis. Can you maybe just help us
understand the adult opportunity that exists in front of you? And then how we should think about the impact that has to
the global growth of that Nutrition business on a go forward basis?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, I'll tell you, I think this is a great business, and again, I always think we can do better at
it. In this case, it's a very different dynamic. We are the Adult Nutrition business worldwide. And it's one where – it's
not about riding growth or competing with particular competitors, because we're quite large, I guess, I would say in the
area. So we have to drive the growth and create the demand as well. And the single biggest uncreated opportunity thus
far is China, and we're recently launching into that the arena with powder-based products and so forth. We'll learn our
way in here. We think we understand the dynamics of the market, but you always think you understand the dynamics of
the market, and then the market teaches you more.
In this case, we're launched; I think there's a big opportunity there, I think there's a future opportunity beyond that –
beyond the powder-based business in liquids, and we're prepared for that as well. But I think we'll go at this, I don't
want to say cautiously because that's not the right term, but thoughtfully, progressively, we'll establish our distribution,
establish our brand, establish our product, establish us in the category. The dynamics in China are different than the
dynamics in the U.S. or other countries of the world. Their own behaviors and practices as consumers are different.
And so it's not like you can just take a U.S. or European or Latin American model and apply it to China, you can't. But
I think there's a big opportunity there. And I think there's opportunity in the rest of the world to continue to grow the
business.
In this case, we don't measure our success so much on shares – we do in so many other categories – we measure our
success on real growth, because our share is high. And I think that when you're a very high share in a given segment,
you can often be too comfortable and not drive the opportunity or the market growth. I don't think our people are
comfortable. I think they all understand there's a much bigger opportunity there to drive growth in this business. We
certainly do think that. And so, for me, that's a real upside for us that's on our radar screen for a lot of investment
attention. And as you know, we've recently invested in additional plant capacity, not only in China and India, but also
here in the U.S., in Ohio, where we built a brand new liquid plant that is specifically dedicated to this business, and
we're already in the Phase II expansion there. So we've got great expectations of the ability of this business to drive
growth in the future, both here and in the areas overseas.

<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. And maybe lastly for you or Tom, even if you don't monetize the Mylan shares that
you'll receive, you'll still be sitting on a pretty big chunk of cash, fairly under-lever interest rates still low but
potentially rising. Any updates on how we should think about use of capital going into next year and how you might
look to offset the Mylan dilution, and any headwinds that might materialize from foreign exchange in 2015?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, you've got two different questions there. One is sort of capital allocation and the Mylan
shares, and then currency. So let me just deal with the capital allocation, first. I'd say, I'm probably not going to tell you
right now what our intentions would be or what we'll do. I'd say your best proxy for that is just simply to look at have
we been good stewards and capital allocators in the past. We always pay a healthy dividend. We always try to balance
share repurchase. But at the end of the day, we also have been investors in strategic growth opportunities and so forth.
And I think the best expectation is a mix of the above. We're not going to run to one side of the ship and tip; we're
going to keep things relatively balanced. I think we'll be opportunistic about our Mylan holding. Obviously, we don't
want to do anything to destabilize that holding or either company. And we think that's a pretty strong and valuable
investment for us.
So we can afford to be, I'd say, thoughtful about the disposition of those shares over time, although it's not our intent to
be long-term shareholders of Mylan, and I think that's been pretty clear. And I'm glad to have the capital and the
challenge of how to best allocate it for our investors. But I think if you look at our track record, historically, we've been
pretty good at balancing that for the range of investors we have, those that rely on income, those that rely on a cash
return, those that rely on good strategic investment and so forth. So without betraying any future direction here, and
certainly time and opportunity can change here, I'd say you can expect more of the same from us and not something
dramatically different than what you've come to expect.
With regard to currency, I know that a lot of the companies that have reported in the last couple of weeks have flagged
caution around currency around the world and rightly so. As you know, our business is 70% international, and the
continuing operations now will be about 50% emerging markets. And some of those currencies have been
disappointing or volatile if you're an American company and competing in dollars, and it remains a challenge for us.
So over the past few years, we, like other companies, have taken quite a dent from currency. And I would point out that
over that time, as you know, the company has made tremendous strides in improving margins, improving gross margins
and distribution margins. And unfortunately – well, fortunately and unfortunately – fortunately we've done that,
because it's been able to absorb a lot of the currency hit and/or pricing pressure that we've experienced around the
world over the last couple of years. And we've still managed to improve margins, but – or it would be eroding the
bottom line that we're experiencing. So going forward, I don't think any American company likes to have to keep
dealing with that, but, for a period of time, it appears to me we're going to be under some exchange pressure as
companies around the world – and it depends on the market basket mix.
Over the long-term, our best hedge against currency fluctuations is to have our cost basis in the markets where we
serve. And what I mean by that is, our production, our plants, our products, you've got to matchup some of our
production in proportion with the profitability of markets. In fact, that means producing in-market for the market. And
a lot of these large emerging markets and even the smaller ones that want foreign investments or want American brands
or American companies, or frankly European companies, they also want you to invest there, to build plants and employ
people, et cetera, in their markets.
And over the long haul, the best hedge against currency is to have your costs where your profits are, and we happen to
have profits in a lot of countries of the world, and so we've got to ensure that we've also thought through how to put
some of our production capacity, R&D capacity, and so forth there. We can't solely be exporters from the United States
or concentrated places. You can't put all your costs in India and export to the rest of the world, you've actually got to
match it up where your profits are, invest in those countries and mitigate exchange.
So I think over the next few years, that's something that's going to get a lot of focus from us and other multi-nationals
that are 40%, 50%, 60% international companies and businesses, and you're going to see many of us working to
balance that over time, because to the extent that the kind of currency we've experienced continues and we expect it to
continue into 2015, I'd tell you right now, I'd be – I'm not ready to even start hinting about 2015, we always start the

year targeting double-digits, and we always do target double-digits. We always set a high bar from ourselves even in
slow economies. But the hardest part of predicting this is the currencies, and then we still deliver on top of that. So I
think, over time, the only real way to mitigate currency is to do as I just described. You can hedge short-term, but that
is short term, and for the long-term, we've got to deal with that. Because I think if we want the growth and the
participation in these markets then we've also got to shape our business to deal with the fluctuations in currencies,
because, as you know, our investors require us to get it right every quarter to the penny.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Understood. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Miles, I just want to come back to the strategic question here. With Nutrition
back on track and the [ph] reshaping (41:50) in EPD you have two legs of the stool growing now in excess of the target
rate you laid out for Abbott at the spin, Devices is the obvious departure, which is more Vascular and Diabetes, but one
of your larger diversified peers is actually getting smaller in devices. And I guess our question is even though
everyone's discussing large device consolidation, in light of the strength you have in the other two legs and arguably
better secular fundamentals in those businesses, why even bother getting much bigger in Devices versus doing tuck-in
technologies or focusing on better execution...?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'd say, two things. First of all, I'd correct you a little bit, and say we've got three major
businesses that are doing really well. I think Diagnostics is doing well too. I think relative to the kind of opportunities
Diagnostics has and how it's been performing, it's been a really solid performer over the last few years and has a hell of
a bank of systems and new products coming. So I think your analysis, and I'd say, look – and by the way, I haven't told
Nutrition they're back on track yet, you just did, but I'd keep the fire to our feet here on this performance. But okay,
let's take your description and say the Established Pharmaceutical business and Nutrition are trending in the right
direction in terms of growth, expansion, and so forth; I take that. I think Diagnostics has been a very solid performer.
That leaves Devices, and I would take that in three pieces and say, the Diabetes Care business actually, I think, is doing
very well. I think they've stabilized the underlying business relative to the competitive bidding dynamics in the U.S.
Every major competitor took their hit there. We just launched a unique and, I'd say, spectacular product that – in
Europe, at this point, that I think is going to drive a whole new generation of performance there that we're excited
about. So I think in terms of the things we would do for our Diabetics Care business, we're pretty happy with how that's
progressing at this point.
And our Medical Optics business is the best-performing division in the company right now, which is ironic, because as
you know, for a couple of years after we acquired it, we kept reporting disappointing performance to you and, of
course, you all rightly challenged us on that. But that business is performing well, taking share in its business. It's had a
great run here of new product delivery and continues to. So I like what I see in Medical Devices out of those two
businesses at this point, good innovation, good R&D productivity, good commercial execution, good expansion, good
platform, I just can't say enough good about it.
That leaves Vascular, and Vascular has got its challenges, which I already talked about. So you'd say, well – I mean,
that's the one part of our release where you'd say I'm disappointed in the trajectory, I'm disappointed in what I see in
terms of performance, and we know that. I mean, nobody is going to be surprised to hear me say that over the phone.
So you can look at it any number of ways. You can say well that's not very good anymore, let's just do something with
that or shrink or get rid of it or whatever. And I don't really think that's necessary. I think, right now, our issue isn't –
you can say the market is slower. All markets are slower. All markets are slower, there's no question about that.
The first issue here is our performance, our strategy, our execution, how we're doing our business in these markets and
relative to our competitors. I don't think you abandon commitment to an investment in a business because of your own
execution, I think you go fix your execution. And, in our case, that's what I'm going to focus on. Do I think there's still
a lot of opportunity in Medical Devices? I do. I think there is opportunity. There are some segments of Medical Devices

that are attractive to us and some that are not.
There's some that we would not choose to be in and haven't chosen to be in, and there are some that we would choose
to be in, and I'd say that ebbs and flows. It's not clear at given points in time what's going to evolve, what's going to
develop. I'd say, we all know that the easy part of it with a big tailwind of innovation funded by government
reimbursements and so forth, that's not as easy anymore. Now you've really got to compete, and you've really got a be
innovative, and you've really got to be better at it than your competition and you've got to put a value proposition on the
table with a product somebody wants and is willing to pay for.
So I think right now my focus on the Device business is both fixing the base of that particular business, as I described,
and looking at where we would selectively choose to invest or expand. I think one of the benefits of being large and
diverse as we are is that we can afford to absorb occasional poor performance or economic downturn or whatever the
case may be and fix a business or improve its performance, but we can afford to be patient about what new
opportunities may come along and where we want to invest. There've been a number of transactions that we've done
over time to build the company that have been, from a timing standpoint, opportunistic. We've tracked those businesses
or those segments for a long period of time, and when an opportunity presented itself that fit and was economically
good for us and our investors, then we pounced on it.
And I think, in this case, some dimensions of the future of the device business requires some patience here because the
markets, as you know, aren't as favorable as they could be, and it's not clear when that will change, and it's not clear
where the new opportunities in some of the areas of devices will be attractive. But I think for the long term and
especially in some – out of the U.S. geographies and so forth, there's still a lot of opportunity here. So I'm not ready to
throw in the towel on this at all.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: And, Miles, just to follow up on something you mentioned on Nutrition, OUS Adult, very,
very strong; Pediatric, maybe a little less so. Is Pediatric the business that you'd like to see greater improvement, and
what steps need to be taken to do that?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm not sure I understood the question there.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Just in terms of Nutrition, we had OUS Adult very strong and then Pediatric maybe not as
strong as we expected, and given your comments on Nutrition back on track but not quite where you wanted, I wonder
is the area of improvement is that more in Pediatric than it is in Adult? And what specifically has to happen in Pediatric
Nutrition to improve that performance?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, okay. As you know, over the last – oh gosh – three or four years, there has been some
large event that impacted the Pediatric Nutrition business, usually in China. And the recall that we had over a year ago
clearly impacted the business in China and several other countries. And when that happens to the Pediatric business, it
typically takes a year or more to recover. And you might note that one of our competitors was impacted more than we
were by that particular recall has not recovered, and we have.
So I think first thing I'd say is our team in China and Saudi Arabia, other places, Vietnam, they've done a wonderful job
recovering not only share they had in the market, but performance trajectory, brand confidence with the consumer, et
cetera, and we're seeing that now. Are we completely there? We're close, we're close. But that cost a year's worth of
growth in base and so forth for those countries. We're in a good trajectory in China. There are a lot of new product
launches going on right now that are driving us, I think, very nicely. I'm not sure we're going to be satisfied or let
ourselves be satisfied in the Pediatric business in China until we've taken incremental share over and above where we
were when the recall happened.
But we're on a good trajectory there and I think the team's doing well at that. We've launched a lot of new products
around the world country-by-country over the last three years, our R&D productivity in the Nutrition business has been
exceptional, tops in the company. And they've put a lot of new products into the marketplace, and it's our own
commercial execution that needs to make those products successful in those markets. So, I'd say, we're in so many
countries that the opportunity from a pediatric standpoint is really strong, really good, and driven by good demographic
circumstances in those countries and economic development circumstances. So I'm pleased with all of that.

As I turn to the U.S., the U.S. has always been about competition. There's not – there's no tailwind of growth for the
Pediatric business in the United States, this is hand-to-hand combat. And that's primarily Mead Johnson, and they're a
to-be-respected formidable competitor, and they make us better. Hopefully, we make them better. I think they're a very
strong competitor. We're both relatively equivalent share in the United States and we just slug it out every day, and I
think that puts a lot of pressure on both companies to be innovative to perform well, to always be looking at new ways
to reach the consumer and the medical community.
And in our case, I think we've done really well. I think that our share growth, our share gains in various segments of the
business, has been excellent. And if you ask me if I'm satisfied, I'm never satisfied. I always want us to do better than
we've done, and I think the attention that we give that business is warranted. I mean we've got a lot of attention on that
business because I think it can do even better than it has. I think we've got really good management team there. And I
think the opportunity and the upside for us is good. It's not a market-driven growth, it's competition-driven growth; we
have to compete.
And I'd tell the people in the company that if you really want to see head-to-head competition and understand what
competition looks like in a business, look at the Pediatric Nutrition business, because in every country of the world, it is
head-to-head with our competitors. And I think we've done really well there from a share standpoint, the growth
standpoint to access that market. So that gets a lot of attention and focus for us. It's a profitable business. It generates
strong cash flow. I like everything about it.

Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just one multi-part question for me.
Just starting with the Mylan deal; I think when you announced the deal, you said it would be $0.22 dilutive. Any update
from the new terms? And how should we think about EPS growth off of the 2014 base with the Mylan dilution and the
CFR accretion? And just lastly on the same theme, I think, Miles, in the past you said that you tried to make up any
dilution from M&A. Is that still the case following the Mylan deal? Thank you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: So going down the list, no change at all in our...
<A - Miles D. White>: Just to be clear, that's Tom speaking.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. No change at all on our forecast of 2015 impact of the divestiture of the developed
markets business for EPD to Mylan. That stays at the $0.22 we estimated back in July. CFR, the way to think about that
is we indicated that would add $0.07 to any baseline you would develop in 2015. And the third question was what,
Larry?
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: I mean, I think in the past, you and Miles, I think it's Miles, I think I've heard say that
he would try to make up any dilution from M&A. Is that still the case here?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I mean, I don't know if that's quite the right way to phrase it. I mean, we – we're very
sensitive to dilution, and I think if you go back in the many deals we've done in the last several years, investors have
not been impacted by dilution on any deal, and so our efforts have always been that if there is some modest impact of
the business that we find a way to manage through that without impacting investors, and I think that's the way to
approach it. And that definitely has been our history, and that continues to be a way we think about deals going
forward.
<A - Miles D. White>: Larry, I would just add to it, there is $0.22 on this divestiture of this business, and that's a
chunk to make up. Now obviously our EPS is a lot bigger than that, but it's still a chunk to make up. CFR will offset a
fair amount of that. And then I would only point out that, to the question earlier, we aren't constrained with capital in
terms of opportunities, but we want to be opportunistic in terms of any opportunities that we add to the company. So I
don't want to just rush out, and you're not suggesting this, I understand – but thoughtlessly deploy capital to simply

replace EPS. Long-term, I'm always looking to build EPS and grow the company. So we clearly with – not only the
continuing cash we earn and accumulate, but the Mylan proceeds and so forth have tremendous flexibility for M&A,
and kind of without constraint.
The only thing that constrains us is opportunities, and the fit of those opportunities, and so on. So I think, to the degree,
that there are investors who look at the net, let's call it, dilution from the sale of the Established Products business in the
developed markets to Mylan, I'd say be patient. You can't offset that or fix that in a few weeks. But longer-term,
obviously, our motive is to grow and improve the company, and I just can't predict the timing of that, but I can certainly
tell you I've got all the flexibility in the world to deal with it.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Hey, Larry, I just add one more thing to what Miles said, and the way I answered the
question, obviously to Miles's point, in the near-term, we will have – we won't have the earnings of that particular
business, but as we talked about back in July, and as you saw in this quarter, in this first quarter where we reported
continuing operations, we saw significantly enhanced top line growth rate, a better bottom line growth rate, and that
obviously investors like that message when we delivered in July, and that's one we shouldn't lose as we move into
2015.

<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Okay. We've got time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Rick Wise from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks. Good morning, Miles. Hi, Tom. Miles, you've approached this in multiple ways, but I'd
sort of like to ask it more directly. When I think about the last year or so, you've done an amazing amount of
operational and portfolio reshaping, I mean, clearly it seems like Vascular is something that you're going to be paying
more attention to. But just if you could list the top three priorities for your attention here, where are you focused
operationally in, from a portfolio perspective, now that you've addressed so many of the major challenges?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm focused on Vascular, and I'm focused on Devices. I think – you think about where you
spend your time, it's not like you run to one thing, and only spend your time here, Diagnostics – they all get a lot of
time and attention from all of us. But we know very clearly where we're headed, what we want to execute, what we
have to do in almost every business here. Where we don't seem to be executing or defining that future as well is clearly
in the Vascular business. I think It's not even Devices, it's the Vascular business. And we can think of the Vascular
business as Vascular, or we can think of it more broadly as Medical Devices exclusive of Optics and Diabetes Care, et
cetera, for a minute, and I'd say that particular leg has both a fix-it dimension to it, and an expansion future strategy
dimension to it, and it's got both.
So that's something that's going to get a lot of attention from all of us and more so; I mean, I would say, we believe we
have been paying sufficient attention to all of the things necessary in that business, but clearly, it shows in the
performance right now that that's not sufficient and we've got to think through this a lot more thoroughly. And I think
through from a standpoint of being more successful. We just got to be a lot more successful here, not only in the current
business, but in the future. So, I guess, if you said, where's the majority of my worry time spent or my focus time or
strategy time or whatever, it's with my folks in the Vascular business now.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Got you. And just two last operational questions. If you could talk a little bit more about China,
are you back to normal in China? And do you think the new plant distribution, Fonterra, the new products, how do we
think about growth and share there over the next year or two? It seems like it could be quite extraordinary. And just
last, just briefly – more briefly, remind us on the Flash FreeStyle, how big the opportunity is – I know the market is
huge, how big an opportunity – how big a product could this be, and remind us about the U.S. approval and launch
times? Thanks so much.

<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. With regard to China, yeah, I think we're back to where we were. Are we ahead of where
we were, have we made-up for a lost year? No, but we're back to where we were, in my view. And with regard to
prospects in China going forward, I'd say they're sort of near-term and long-term. The near-term is often a bumpy ride
in China, and that can be because of local conditions, it can be economy, it can be the government, it can be the
unexpected recall, it can be anything. China is a bumpy ride. And yet, it's a very attractive long-term market, so we've
made long-term commitments and investments and have a long-term strategy there, including the ownership and
development of our own dairies and our own milk supply inside the country.
And I think that that is unique among multi-nationals at this point. We've ensured our own supply and our own access
to ingredients at a very high-quality level, et cetera, and I think for the long term, that makes a big difference. We're
very, very well-positioned. So I think the prospects in China are very good for the long-term in spite of the fact that it's
an occasionally bumpy ride. Okay? And I think the underlying potential dynamics are all very strong and very good.
It's a very competitive place, it's a different place to do business, but I can say that about any market around the world.
And people say, well, they tend to lump emerging markets together like they're all the same. They're not the same.
There are no two the same, and yet they represent tremendous growth, and I think China does in particular.
Now, in our case, I'd say we're pretty spread across a lot of foreign markets and emerging markets around the world,
because we don't want to be over-dependent on just China, just India, just Russia, just Brazil, et cetera. So, as you
know, with our CFR transaction, CFR doesn't happen to be substantial in Brazil or Mexico or very large markets, it's in
a lot of next level markets, medium-size, et cetera, where there's tremendous opportunity. So, in our case, we don't wish
to over-index necessarily just in China or India. Now when we're in a market, we want to be very successful in it, so
we're the largest healthcare company, the largest pharmaceutical company in India and I like that position, but at the
same time, our share is at a point where there's still tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us. We just don't want to
be over-dependent on any one market. And while China is a tremendous growth opportunity, so is the rest of the world.
With regard to Libre, which is the Flash Glucose product, you just referenced, I don't know that I can tell you what the
potential is to be honest. I think we're going at it at the beginning here with, I'd say, modest financial expectations but
aggressive marketing intent. We're going at this a different way. I don't want to be overly-reliant on reimbursement
because I think this product has tremendous consumer or user appeal for the insulin-dependent diabetic. And I think the
experience for that particular patient or user is so superior to what's available today or what they can do today that, I
think, our challenge is to establish the value proposition and the product and its benefits and its use and its experience
to that patient group. And if we do that well, then it won't be as dependent on the gate-keeping or hurdles of
government reimbursement, et cetera, although it may be well enhanced by that at some point.
But we're trying to go about it more from a consumer approach perspective and go direct to the patient with this and to
the extent that all regulatory circumstances allow. So I think it's got great potential opportunity. I don't know how to put
a dollar value on that yet so I'm reluctant to kind of forecast one. But our team in Diabetes Care knows that almost any
number they give me won't meet my expectations, and I think that's kind of how we leave it internally right now. It's
not clear that we can completely project what the uptake will be or how fast, but we're very pleased by initial reactions
of consumers and professionals and physicians and so forth. And I think after we've had some months of experience,
we'll be better able to put some numbers around what we expect here in terms of continuing trajectories, expansion,
share gain, et cetera, in the biggest user group there is, which is the insulin-dependent diabetic and the frequent tester.
So I think that's the best I can tell you about it at this point. Right now, we've got an awful lot of expectation and hope
and we're not overly-focused on meeting particular numbers, because right now, the numbers are small, of course,
because it's the initial launch phase, but it's launched in 70 new countries, and that's going to be a pretty good test for
us.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks again.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah.
