Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.
The first quarter played out much as we expected with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the
enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC
countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year – of last year. In addition, we see
continued momentum in IP data center solutions from servers to networking to storage across both mature and
emerging markets. Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of
major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like
to highlight a few examples.
We are ramping our 22-nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our
third-generation high-k metal gate and the industry's first 3-D tri-gate transistors. The move to tri-gate transistors
delivers roughly twice the improvement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to
low-power applications like smartphones and ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and
design, to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model
allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014.
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior
generation 32-nanometer process. Our research on 3-D transistors began over ten years ago and advancements like this
don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry
continues to grow, giving us product advantages in power, performance and cost.
Ultrabooks are re-inventing computing with new form factors, high performance, better battery life, advanced security
and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline
for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress and yet this is just the beginning.
Earlier this month we launched our largest advertising campaign in a decade, and over the next few months we expect
ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect the touch interfaces and innovative new
hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly
no compromise devices and experiences.
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple, and data
storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown
at eight times the worldwide average over the last five years, making it the second largest server market in the world.
The Xeon E5 processor code named Romley was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance
up to 80%, and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has
shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week we also provided details about our upcoming Atom-based micro server system on chip, code
named Centerton. Centerton will launch in the second half of the year with two cores, 64-bit capability, ECC and
virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope, delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency
with unmatched software compatibility.

This quarter we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and
Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, as
well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender security
product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day zero CRIDEX worm
attack missed by many other anti-virus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software security
strategy.
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've
already begun high volume shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will
be our fastest ramping product ever comprising nearly a quarter of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing
over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business
later this week: the launch of the world's first Intel architecture based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up – setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation
of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel
architecture.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. The first quarter results came in slightly better than our expectations. From a revenue standpoint, the first
quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively
impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain.
Despite this continued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of
personal computers in the first quarter with demand trends playing out as expected.
Our expectation of high single digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged. For the second quarter of 2012, we are
forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter, and a return to year-on-year
growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1% as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC
supply chain as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin, first quarter gross margin of 64%, was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance, and
down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year and our
gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our
Ivy Bridge production in three new 22-nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs. As we progress
through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second half gross margins
improving from the first half.
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast
for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to
spending, when compared to the first quarter primarily driven by the start of our ultrabook marketing campaign. We
expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the
fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in
dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases. Inventory grew by
approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge.
On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter results and our
forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year, and reinforce our
expectations for 2012. Against a backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic

weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong.
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments of our business. Both Romley and
Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend
with three new 22-nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half.
Additionally we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the
long-term. We are making investments in our business which brings us competitive advantage and we are using the
cash flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next
month's investor meeting.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right. Thank you, Paul and Stacy. We'll now move to Q&A. As is our normal practice, we'll ask each participant to
ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Misty, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. Stacy, just a follow on to the gross margin in Q2,
it sounds like the entire hit is just the ramp of Ivy Bridge. I just want to get a little bit of understanding. Was this an
expected unit cost uptick or is there something different going on with the yield curve with Ivy Bridge at 22 than you
had anticipated
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No, it's absolutely consistent with my expectations when I started the year. Maybe it's
worthwhile. It's been two years since we've gone through a process transition. That was the 32-nanometer transition, so
let me just take a second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these.
We have three new 22-nanometer factories and at the beginning of that ramp, the first units to go through those
factories, in essence, absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is by far the most expensive part of the ramp.
Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory and as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that
we sell through and so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is, we'll have a peak in unit costs in the
second quarter and then we come down nicely in Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp.
As I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year and it's consistent with what we saw with
32-nanometer if you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit costs. The difference there
was it was two factories and today it's three factories because of the speed at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: And then, guys, as my follow up, Paul, just recognizing that sometimes things don't happen
nicely within a four-quarter period, you guys have talked about DCG about – that DCG would be about a 15%
long-term growth CAGR on top line. To achieve that this year, given the March quarter run rate, it kind of implies a
pretty healthy ramp to about $3 billion a quarter for the next three quarters. Is that kind of how we should expect the
Romley ramp to play out? Or if you can give us some guidance around that, that would be helpful.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I'll give you a little color on it and I'll let Stacy handle the CAGRs and the dollars per quarter.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the
EP version, in March, and that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In anticipation of

that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers, as they knew this
transition was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter and in particular, if you look year-over-year,
remember, last year, we had some large deliveries of products to some internet data center customers that I think Stacy
described as being very lumpy in terms of their demand, and that skewed Q1 of last year as well as the 14th week. So
when you adjust for those factors, I really don't see anything on our data center business that puts us off track from the
numbers that we committed to in terms of the 15% CAGR. And yeah, we do expect double-digit growth in the second
half of the year for this product line.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, actually, I'd just add to that, we – I would expect the Data Center Group – I think Paul did
a really nice job of describing the Q1 compare. As I think about Q2, we would expect the Data Center Group to get
back to double-digit growth and then as we move into the back half of this year, it's growth rates that are at or above the
historical average. So it's expected to grow and we're still committed to the goals that we talked about last May of
doubling the business over the next five years and the trends that are driving it are still intact.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on the impact of hard drives
and seasonality. So you obviously got hit by it in Q1. You're seeing a bit of a snap-back in Q2. You said you're not – in
your CFO commentary, you said you weren't forecasting any more negative impact. But is it possible – is a positive
impact possible? Have we seen all the snap-back you think that we're going to see from the hard drives coming back?
Or is there potential for further above seasonal growth coming in the back half? How should we think about overall
seasonality in the wake of the hard drive situation for the rest of the year.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, great question. Thanks. This is Stacy. And actually, I'd characterize Q2 as being our
forecast was pretty consistent with underlying demand and then I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as
we get into Q3. So let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was
obviously impacted significantly, as the impact of the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there
and as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with a hard disk
drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually
continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain.
What you see in Q2, I believe is pretty indicative of end demand, just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed
because of that contraction in the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is, that's when you're going to
really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs. And it's a combination of, they're going to
replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older generation technology, and its anticipation
of a good Q4 where you have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of
excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. That's helpful. And for my follow up, another question I guess on gross margins.
So this quarter gross margins came in a little bit better than expected, and it looked like it was because your platform
unit costs were better than expected. Next quarter, on – at least versus where the Street was, it looks like gross margins
come in a little worse, and it looks like it's probably because of higher than expected gross margins or higher than
expected platform unit costs. I know there had been some fluff floating around of push outs on Ivy Bridge. Is this –
should we take this as I guess some sort of evidence that the initial ramp of Ivy Bridge actually did see a bit of a push
out from Q1 to Q2? I mean, how did that ramp versus where it's going now compare with your original expectations
back in January when you gave the big gross margin guidance for the quarter?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, if you remember during the quarter, we were pretty public that we shifted the ramp of Ivy
Bridge out three weeks. That was to make sure that there was enough inventory in the pipeline.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Shifted the launch out.

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I'm sorry. We shifted the launch of Ivy Bridge out three weeks, yes. And so what that means is
we sold through a little less Ivy Bridge in Q1. Those products were in inventory. Then that's the Q2 impact that I talked
to on cost. So Ivy Bridge really explains the little bit of good news in Q1 and then that Q2 gross margin forecast and
again, that Q2 margin forecast is consistent with what I thought when I started the year, it's just Q1 was a little better.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
<Q - Shawn R. Webster>: Great. Yeah, thank you. I was wondering if you could help us understand some of the
moving parts within desktop and notebook for the quarter and what your expectations are going into Q2.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, we don't forecast at that level of granularity, but what we're seeing and remember, we're
comparing to a 14-week quarter back in Q1 of 2011. But in general, when you step back and look at what's happening
in the different businesses, what we see is that the notebook segment of the market continues to grow nicely on a unit
basis, emerging markets continues to grow. And that tends be a bit more desktop centric. Enterprise was relatively
strong and then we saw some weakness in mature market consumer. Those kind of played through the different
segments, but if your question is are we continuing to see notebook market growth, we did in Q1 when you look at the
actual demand for computers relative to where we were a year ago and relative to what you'd expect seasonally.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I would add on top of that, the first versions of Ivy Bridge that we're shipping are quad-cores,
and the bulk of those are going into desktops. And there's a lot of interest in these new generation all in one desktops, if
you haven't seen them, they're pretty attractive machines. And then the second launch of the products is in the
dual-core, which is the mainstream notebooks, so I think that helps put a profile over the course of the quarter as well.
<Q - Shawn R. Webster>: And then I guess as a segue from the mix perspective into pricing, pricing was roughly flat
for you guys in Q1. Do you expect it to remain kind of flattish over the course of the year? Or are there some things
happening in terms of your ramps that you're expecting where pricing could actually maybe increase over the next
quarter or two?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I characterize the pricing environment in January as I think the words I used were, relatively
benign, based on the process technology leadership we have and the strength of our products relative to competition. I
haven't seen anything that would cause me to change my view. I think 2012 will be a relatively benign pricing
environment for us.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.
<Q - Uche Orji>: Sure. Thank you very much. Paul, can I just ask you a two-part question on the ultrabooks. You
talked about being able to achieve mainstream pricing in a few months. Can you just talk about where you were able to
make changes, help your customers make changes in the bill of material? I know you set up a $300 million fund to help
achieve some of those improvements. Given the way the ultrabooks look compared to regular PCs, I just kind of want
to know how much were you able to achieve improvements to achieve those mainstream pricing and how much of
those improvements are proprietary to Intel given your investments in taking costs down?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: The ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in to where it's yielding near term bill of materials
reductions, Uche. We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online
for second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens to be able to make sure that those come down
in price. The biggest changes are quite frankly, just competition.
When you – I talked about 21 designs shipping now, another over 100 more coming for the second half of this year.
That is – that's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of

technologies. I'll give you one example. Asus is now shipping a very low profile 500-gig hard drive into an ultrabook.
Something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found the technology to do this and that helps give them an
advantage. I think you'll see other customers do that.
The biggest change and the one that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8
launch with sufficient quantities of ultrabooks that have touch enabled. Up until now touch has been a fairly, almost
$100 adder to costs, to bill of materials cost. We've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60 to 90 days
as we've worked it and as more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the
combination of all of these things of the OEMs and Taiwan, Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities is really what's
driving prices and costs down.
<Q - Uche Orji>: That's great. Do you still think you'll be able to achieve 40% of consumer notebooks and ultrabooks
exiting 2012? And any update as to enterprise adoption of ultrabooks? I know it's probably early days to say but any
sense as to what you can give us will be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: On the 40% yes. I'm still very confident we can do that. All the signs are tracking there. I mean
everything we've looked at since we first gave that number set has gotten more positive. More designs, better price
points etcetera, etcetera, lower costs. All the first derivative indicators are very positive around that.
In terms of enterprise adoption, enterprise seems to be a little bit slower. A lot of enterprises like our vPro technology.
The vPro based SKUs for ultrabooks, I think come out this summer, first ones and then start ramping over the course of
the year. I will say that hasn't stopped the people in this room from having ultrabooks. As I look around the table. Most
of them are ultrabooks. So this enterprise, for one, is adopting them.

Your next question...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Over the objections of our CIO.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thank you very much. Could you tell us when we might expect the Romley equivalent for a
multiprocessor or a four way service?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I'm not sure what we've said publicly on that. It's not far off David, but I don't want to
preannounce the MP version of Romley. There's more Romley versions to come; as you said, the MP version and then
the low-end version of Romley. And I'm not sure how precise we've been in terms of the launch date. Mark's telling me
we haven't said. So let's just say it's in the not too distant future.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay. I think you have said though, that the die size on Ivy Bridge is about – for a quad-core
is about 160 square millimeters, quite a bit less than the quad-core die size of Sandy Bridge. So does that mean that the
Ivy Bridge platform costs, when you've got your costs normalized will actually be quite a bit less than Sandy Bridge
too?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I'll talk more about long-term trends in May in the investor meeting but I will say that
even – I kind of talked about the cost accounting of these new factories coming on in Ivy Bridge. I'll end 2012 with a
lower platform cost than I had at the end of 2011 even with these new factories. So I think that gives you a sense of
both the ramp rate and the cost curves.

Your next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
<Q - JoAnne Feeney>: Hi. Thanks, guys. I was hoping you could perhaps give us some insight into the mix you
anticipate for the corporate versus consumer this year. What kind of demand you're seeing out of the emerging markets
and what kind of anything out of the more industrialized markets right now?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: We don't get into that level of detail on a forecast basis. I'll say for Q1, JoAnne, our mix was
quite healthy. We didn't see any significant shift in mix. Generally I think as we progress through the year, what we're
going to see is, relative strength based on the strength of the Ivy Bridge product line and the Romley product line and
their respective segments. Then we're likely to see some price competition at the low-end of the market. That all kind
of plays into my benign pricing environment that I expect for the year. But we don't get into that level of detail
typically on a forecast.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I'd add, though, JoAnne, that typically the enterprise SKUs, particularly in notebooks, tend to
be about a third of the business. And that's been true sort of year in and year out for a long time. The trend that is
underlying that, though, is that more and more businesses are allowing their employees to bring any kind of computer
they want into the office. And so you're seeing a bit less rigidity around that number than we've seen in the past and it
tends to get a little bit more mixed. We think that we've got some ideas on how to improve those – the security and
manageability of those machines over time while still giving the employees the choice of what they want to bring in.
<Q - JoAnne Feeney>: Great. And that's a nice segue into the follow up. On the margin front, how do you see the PC
CPU margins? I know you said overall pricing is expected to be benign; I'm thinking more about mix here. How do you
see those margins differing between say, your standard notebook and your ultrabook and your tablet? Do you see mix
as a threat to overall margins or as perhaps a helping factor?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, I think our mix has been very strong, and I'll talk more about the segments of the
business in May. But between ultrabooks and the rest of the client business, we've got a great cost structure and a rich
mix. And I think you can kind of see it in the overall results. If you just do the gross margin math for the company,
between our Q1 actual, our Q2 forecast, the kind of average 63% for the first half. To get to a 64% gross margin for the
year, it says we have to be up around 65% in the back half and that's – as we're ramping Ivy Bridge, it's as we're seeing
ultrabook volumes really ramp up.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. Paul, I have longer-term question. It's clear the emerging markets
have been driving a lot of PC growth. I'm curious, longer term do you think these emerging markets go more towards
ultrabooks or towards tablets? And what implications will that have on Intel's pricing?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I don't think anyone in the world knows the answer to that question, Vivek. I think a lot of that
has to – that has to depend on – if you look at people buying tablets today, particularly in the iPad arena, they are
people that have started out with PCs and very often, still use PCs. It's a complementary device. How that unfolds two,
three years from now, I don't think anyone knows.
What I am very excited about and I alluded to this in my opening comments, is this notion of bringing the convenience
that's in this, the instant-on capability and the touch of a tablet combined with the productivity, the compatibility and
the usefulness of a keyboard into the same device. And you'll see a number of these shipping second half of this year as
the energies of our OEMs and the ODMs gets unleashed onto this category. And I think that it's way too early to have a
debate on ultrabook versus tablet because in fact, in my view, the long-term form factor is probably somewhere in
between those two devices.

<Q - Vivek Arya>: Got it. And, Paul, secondly, on your smartphone and tablet strategy, I mean if I look at the
industry, it's clear that Apple and Samsung are now accounting for an increasing number of units and even more,
almost half of the industry's sales. So does that leave enough room in the market for you to go after and have an impact
on your sales and profitability? Is it enough potential for you to go after this market?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, sure. I mean, any numbers that we look at going forward has smartphones going from
sort of 450 million to close to 1 billion as smartphones – as most phones become smartphones. And even if you take
out half of the market, which I would be loath to do, but even if you take it out, it's still a very large number. I'd point
out too, that those are both companies that we are continuing to have dialogue with in terms of our product line. And
Samsung doesn't universally use its chips in its phones. They use other vendors. And that's certainly an account we
would love to go in for phones. I can't ever speak for Apple, but we know where they are and they know where we are.

Your next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gus P. Richard>: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Stacy, just a follow up on a comment on gross margins
and the ramp on 32. When I go back and I look at 2010, in Q2, your margins peaked. And so if you were following the
historic patterns, I would expect margins to be rising here and not falling and I'm just not sure if the ramp on – has
shifted in time or if there's something else going on that I don't understand.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, you have to go back one quarter. The – it was Q1 of 2010, not Q2 of 2010.
<Q - Gus P. Richard>: Okay. So there was – all right. So there was a slight drop. So that the...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: It's offset by one quarter. If you look at margin, you see that our costs in Q1 of 2010 went up. I
don't remember the exact number but it was pretty significantly based on the ramp of 32-nanometer just as we're seeing
as we get into that part of the ramp on 22-nanometer.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Craig S. Berger>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you help us understand what your capacity
growth looks like by the time we're in the second half of the year versus, say, last year's second half? And what
utilizations are at, what might they be ramping to in the second quarter, second half?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, the first part of your question is a little – the CapEx that we're spending is more to
transition from one generation to the next. There is some capacity growth in there, but it's probably less than you're
thinking. We expect utilization rates to be high through the year, and you can see it in Q2. We're selling every Ivy
Bridge unit we can make, and we think that continues.
<Q - Craig S. Berger>: Okay. And then just as a follow up, can you help us understand I think depreciation's supposed
to be $1.6 billion in the second quarter. Where might that go in the back half of the year as any additional 22-nanometer
factories turn on?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Right. I think you can kind of see the – you can interpolate the depreciation number because
you've seen Q1 actual Q2 forecast and then the back half and then the forecast for the year. I think at the base of your
question, it's probably going up less than you anticipating. This comes back to my comment in the January call. You
have to keep in mind that a pretty large proportion of our capacity or our CapEx in 2012 is in building factories and that
has a much longer depreciation schedule, than does putting equipment into the factories. I think back in January I said it
was over a third, actually refined that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total amount of CapEx
that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings and fabs as opposed to equipment. So I think that's why you're
seeing less of an impact to depreciation than maybe your historical models would suggest.

Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thank you very much for taking my question. The first one is just looking at this idea of high
single digit growth for the year, it implies that the back half is at least seasonal if not it should be higher than normal
seasonal. And I have heard your comment on data center being very strong, but if we looked across PC clients and
maybe potential for handset or micro server, maybe software, where do you see the above seasonal strength coming
from in the back half of the year?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, I think the biggest part of this is that we're exiting Q1 with historically low levels of
inventory. There's not much of a replenishment in Q2 and then as Ivy Bridge ramps and as people gear up for the kind
of a normal Q4 selling season, we expect inventory levels to replenish some in the third quarter. That's the biggest shift,
and we talked about that at the beginning of the year. That's what kind of causes the shift of the units to the back half.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Okay. Fair enough. Second question, Paul, is for you. As you talk to your customers or your
potential customers in handset, can you talk about to what extent two things matter to them: one, your technology
roadmap, particularly as you're able to talk to them about 14-nanometer; and then two, just the fact that you actually
have or will have the capacity available because obviously elsewhere, we're seeing very tight supply on what's now
28-nanometer.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, the roadmap is certainly the best door opener we have in talking to these customers but
it's not the only asset we have here. Then there's two classes of handset customers. There's obviously the traditional
OEM manufacturers, and we've announced a number of those. But there's also carriers that are interested in doing
private label. We've announced one of those with Orange in Europe. And the relationships that we have with carriers
globally are pretty strong and they go back a number of years. And those have to do with a lot of the work that Intel's
done in their data centers and in the re-configuration of the cellular network infrastructure.
As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, what they want to do is find ways to provide differentiation
from what's out there and service platforms for themselves. That's where the other element of our strategy, the
non-silicon element of our strategy, becomes much more critical. So what's our security roadmap as it relates to that
and what's our location based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we build into the handset? All of those are
really hardware-centered features that employ software that allow someone to create a service annuity stream. That
discussion is much more sophisticated and complex than just showing a roadmap. That's the level that we're at today
with most customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross Clark Seymore>: Hi guys. Congrats on a strong start to the year. The first question for Stacy, I think you
mentioned earlier that the DCG group would start growing double digits. Did you mean year-over-year or
quarter-over-quarter in that second quarter comment? And how should we think about the contribution of the network
and storage traction that you really haven't been addressing as much in the past?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Year-over-year, and thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. So yeah, when I think about
DCG, I'm always doing year-over-year comps because of the growth rate of that business. And I'll hold off, I think,
ongoing through the various segments of the DCG business. We will talk a lot about that in May. If I take you back to
what we said last May, which I still believe to be true, we're seeing secular demand drivers that are driving the classic
server business. And that's the build out of these big IP data centers. And then from an Intel perspective, we're
benefiting by the fact that our architecture is now extending into things like storage and networking and even some of
the backplane infrastructure in the data center and so that's giving us added growth. But we'll go through that in a lot

more detail in May.
<Q - Ross Clark Seymore>: Great. Then the follow-up question is one for Paul and it's a bigger picture manufacturing
one. In your preamble you mentioned about Intel being able to do things others couldn't from a manufacturing point of
view. To that end, as you're able to pull further ahead of the competition on Moore's Law, how should we think about
that benefit manifesting itself either strategically for Intel or on the types of markets you can address, the revenue gross
margins, or even the business model implications that you can do with things like potentially entering the foundry
business, et cetera?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, the business model that we have today is one that I'm extremely comfortable with and
we're working as hard as possible to maintain, which is – and I described this last year in the Analyst Meeting. As
compared to other nonintegrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our products. We get paid the equivalent
of a foundry margin and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin. And that allows us to generate fairly
nice margins. As long as we can fill up all of the factories that we can build with Intel products at those kinds of
rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us.
Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yeah,
perhaps. I've said that before. You've seen some small announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some
companies for some foundry activity over the next several years.
I would look at those and I would ask you to look at those as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're
doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers as a company to be able to
use quick time to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity, for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best
way to test those is to have some third party customers to really validate how good they are, or where they need some
work. So it's a learning experience for us. It is for profit. It is not done strictly just to get to know how to do this. And in
terms of where it goes long-term, I'll leave that point open.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: If I can maybe just add, one of the tactical benefits we see of being an integrated design and
manufacturing house is the speed at which we can ramp these factories. We'll have 25% of our shipment volume in Q2
coming from Ivy Bridge on 22-nanometer. That's just an incredibly fast ramp rate. Even compared to what we did on
32-nanometer. That's a lot faster than what we were able to do.
So we can just transition the market to these great new products. And I think you've seen some of the non-integrated
models where they really struggle with ramp rates and yields and things like that. So it's a benefit in the long term to
the product lineup and it's a benefit tactically to our ability to transition the product line.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Hey, thanks, guys. Actually, Paul, just to follow-up on Ross' question. I mean, is there
anything that would prevent you from getting Apple's processor business for the foundry? Or Qualcomm's business? I
mean it would be kind of competing against the Atom. But is that theoretically possible? Are you opposed to anything
like that?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, anything is theoretically possible. But things that would stand in the way with that, of
both of those, would be the right commercial agreement. I have to say that from a – from the kind of taste it would
leave in my mouth, the Apple win would be a lot more attractive than the Qualcomm win.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Something tells me that it would help the stock too. As my follow-up, can you just maybe
give us your sense of just the trend in PC demand out there? And in particular, if you could just spend a little time on
the various geo's, what you see happening in China and North America and Europe. Is it seasonal yet? Is it better than
seasonal? Worse than seasonal? Getting better? Getting worse? Any words would be appreciated.

<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Our geo managers are in this week and we just – we're going through the reviews. And the
question I've been asking everyone as they come through here is, do you see the year any differently than you did three
months ago, the last time we were all together face-to-face? And the answer is universally no.
This is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only three months into the year, but given that we now have
line of sight to Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out
towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave
an indication of our view of some inventory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up.
I'll remind you that we are going into a new – a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and
that traditionally has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to
participate with a mainstream operating system around touch and I'm very excited about that.
So you add those things up and I think the battle for the consumer dollars, even in a soft consumer environment, can be
– is not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps was the last year.
And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about the fact that the
third-party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point
of difference between us. So we're looking for a relatively decent year with strength in emerging markets in all
segments, strength in enterprise globally and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentially, the United
States markets.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Great. Thank you so much, guys. I appreciate you fitting me in. Stacy, relative to the balance
sheet, you guys have done an absolutely terrific job returning cash to shareholders, dividends and buy-backs. And you
certainly have a terrific capital position, but cash is coming down because your free cash flow is kind of neutral and
then obviously, with the dividends and buy-backs, that's drawing the cash level down. How low do you feel
comfortable drawing down the cash and still feeling like you're in a tremendous capital position that gives you an
advantage?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, so one cautionary note. I think you want to be a little careful on the free cash flow
generated in Q1 relative to the long-term trend. You have a couple of issues in Q1. First is, it's pretty depressed given
what happened with hard disk drives, and as our business recovers, the cash flow's going to improve. And then
secondly, remember there's things we accrue for all year long; we have big payments in Q1. That's kind of a couple of
billion dollars' worth of shift in free cash flow. So that's on the free cash flow side.
In terms of cash balances, what – we don't peg a specific number out there, although, I think as you know, we have
very specific conversations with the Board. I think you can see in the first quarter, we – we're obviously pretty
comfortable with our cash balances. They changed a little bit, but we've kind of been now bouncing around this number
for a couple of quarters.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Okay. And then if I can ask for my follow-up, relative to the view that ultrabook adoption
will pick up steam as the price points get down to a "mainstream" price point, if I look at consumer activity today, the
iPad 3 is already at a higher price point of where ultrabooks are today and obviously had tremendous adoption almost
immediately. So how do we get comfortable that it's really a price point issue and not a product preference issue?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, I don't think – I'm not a subscriber that it takes mainstream price points to get us to high
volume. I mean, I think that just helps, and what you're going to see is an incredible amount of differentiation from
$699 to $1,299 and I love that. People are doing different experiments with different screen sizes. I talked earlier about
convertibles and hybrids and slide out keyboards and things like that. Some people are putting touch in, which is a cost

adder. So I really don't see that the need to get to those price points to deliver the value proposition. The price points
make everything work better because it lowers the bill of materials costs on some of these previously very expensive
niche components.

Your final question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.
<Q - C. J. Muse>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question as you think about a
PC recovery in the second half, curious what you think will be a bigger driver there between Windows 8 and
ultrabooks?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think it's way too – it's a little hard for us to predict that. I mean, the ultrabook, even as we hit
our numbers, we said it's going to be 40% of consumer notebooks at year-end. So that's still not the majority of PCs. I
think the general issue is that this has been a market, which, as we've talked about, has not had a lot of new and exciting
products in the last few years and so this year you've got a one-two punch with Intel and Microsoft both delivering
dynamite products that are the results of years of innovation and lots of R&D. We're hoping, we are optimistic that the
combination of those two will bring growth.
<Q - C. J. Muse>: That's helpful. As a quick follow up, you talked earlier about your manufacturing leadership and
clearly no doubt there. I'm curious if you could provide an update on your plans for the 14-nanometer ramp in terms of
equipment installation and when you think you'll come to market there.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: No.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: We'll give you some better granularity to that in the Analyst Meeting in May, but generally, it's
every other year. I mean, from a rule of thumb standpoint, that's as granular as I think I want to be right now.
