David E. Simon
Good morning. Our results for the quarter were excellent. Here are some highlights. FFO was $1.99 per share, up
16.4% from the third quarter of 2011. Year to date FFO was almost $2.1 billion or $5.77 per share, up 14.7% over
2011. FFO once again exceeded the first call consensus by $0.07 this quarter.
For our malls and premium outlets comparable property NOI grew 4.7%. Keep in mind our comp NOI growth in the
third quarter of 2011 was 3.8%. Our comp NOI growth year to date was 5.3%. Tenant sales were up 9.3% to $562 per
foot. Occupancy was up 80 basis points to 94.6%. Base minimum rent per square foot increased by 3.8%. The releasing
spread was a positive 10.4% or $4.86 per square foot. Capital market activity, as you know, on July 20 we redeemed
for cash 2 million units of our operating partnership owned by an affiliate of JCPenney at $124 per unit or share.
We've been active in the secured debt markets. Year to date we closed or locked rate on 24 new mortgages totaling $2.6
billion, of which our share is $1.7 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the loans is 4.1% and the weighted
average term is 8.1 years. Subsequent to quarter-end we disposed of our investment in Capital Shopping Centres and
Capital & Counties Properties, generating total proceeds of approximately $327 million.
Development activity, last Friday was the grand opening of our new outlet center in Texas City. Very strong opening,
97% leased. Traffic was great on opening day, with backups, long lines; Coach, Nike, Michael Kors and several other
tenants have reported very strong sales numbers. Construction is underway on five additional premium outlet centers,
all scheduled to open in 2013. Two are in the U.S.: Chandler, Arizona, which is a suburb of Phoenix, and Chesterfield,
Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. One is in Canada, in Toronto. We have one in Japan, and our fifth is in Busan, Korea.
Our share of the development costs of these assets is expected to approximate $325 million.
As you know there have been a select few markets where competing new outlet centers have been announced or
identified. This is not unusual in the long history of shopping center development, 60 plus years, as ours is a very
competitive business. Rest assured we know what we're doing. We have opened 19 premium outlets in the U.S. and
Asia since our acquisition of Chelsea Property Group, delivering high returns and high quality assets. We will not
waver from this approach, and we shouldn't think, given our track record, that the market should overreact to a couple
of competitive situations.
Progress continues on our first outlet center in Brazil. Our joint venture partner is the well-respected BR Malls. We
expect to start construction shortly for a November 2013 opening, which will then add to our fifth – will bring our total
of under-construction outlets to six openings for next year. We've also identified a couple of other sites with BR malls
for Brazil activity.
Construction is underway on 24 redevelopment and expansion projects throughout our portfolio, all with 2012 and
2013 completion dates, several of which are quite significant in size and scope. This redevelopment pipeline was
identified in 2010. The scope of projects range from addition of department stores, restaurants, specialty store tenants to
the redevelopment of the entire asset. We identified these opportunities very early in the recovery phase of our
economy, and more than half of the projects will be completed in 2012 and 2013, increasing our cash flow growth. As
projects are completed, a new group of redevelopment properties, which have already been identified, will take their
place in the pipeline. This program is big and ambitious and impactful to our future growth, and it should not be
overlooked.

We also continue to strengthen our franchise assets with the addition of strong anchor tenants. Recent announced
examples include Neiman Marcus at Roosevelt Field on Long Island; a new Bloomingdales at Stanford Shopping
Center, which will lead to the redevelopment of that asset; a new Nordstrom at St. Johns Town Center in Jacksonville;
and additionally a Target at Coddingtown Mall in Santa Rosa, California. We expect our share of development and
redevelopment spend to approximate $1 billion in 2012 and at least $1 billion in 2013 and in 2014.
Let me turn to Klepierre. As you know they reported revenues on Monday. Their tenant rents for the nine months were
up 3.2% or 2% on a comparable basis. Rents for the shopping center segment were up 4.1% or 1.7% on a comparable
basis. They are ahead of schedule in the disposition program, with more than €0.5 billion sold, which is above their
target, and during the quarter they completed a seven-year €500 million bond issuance at a 2.75% coupon. They are on
track to meet their 2012 targets and their liquidity has never been stronger. Additionally we added to the leadership
team in hiring Jean-Marc Jestin as COO. He previously ran Unibail's €5 billion office portfolio. Prior to working at
Unibail, he was the COO of our successful Simon Ivanhoe venture. He understands our culture and our expectations.
Let me turn to dividends. We announced the fifth consecutive increase in our quarterly dividend from $1.05 to $1.10.
The total dividend paid in 2012 is $4.10 as compared to $3.50 per share paid in 2011. That represents an increase of
17.1%. Our dividend is now 22.2% higher than it was immediately prior to the great recession. This is the highest
increase among SPG's retail peers, the second highest among all S&P 500 REITs behind public storage. Current
dividend levels, as you know, from any REITs, remain well below their 2008 levels.
Let me turn to guidance. We increased our guidance again from a range of $7.60 per share to $7.70 per share to our
current guidance of $7.80 to $7.85 per share. As you recall our initial guidance for 2012 was $7.20 to $7.30 per share.
The primary factor has been our continued strong operating performance.
Our 2012 FFO is expected to be at least 21% higher than SPG's 2008 FFO immediately prior to the great recession.
And this is a significantly higher percentage than any of our SPG retail REIT peers.
Now let me conclude. We're pleased with the strong performance. Our operating metrics at our properties remain
fundamentally sound. We're producing industry-leading growth. Our investment activities year to date with Klepierre
and Mills have been immediately accretive and additive to our franchise and also providing future growth. Our
development and redevelopment activities are significant in size and scope and are delivering double-digit returns on
investment. And all of this has been accomplished while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet. We are now
ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley [Citigroup Global
Markets]. Please proceed.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Hi. Good morning. Just in terms of the outlets, I know St. Louis and Charlotte are only going
to be a very small proportion of your growth assets. But given the competition that we're seeing, it feels like there could
be more projects where you're competing head to head with some of the other REITS and potentially product
[indiscernible] (12:27). Can you just sort of give us a sense of how many there might be out there, how many more
announcements that we might see where there are sort of these competing projects?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, there's potential for a couple more of these situations to arise. I know we've got –
Quentin, we've built 19 of these since we have acquired CPG. We have been extremely successful. We're also
expanding a handful of our industry-leading shopping centers. So again, we have a very good perspective of this. If we
didn't think we could at least produce quality projects, we would not do it. We have all the confidence of our track
record and our team to continue to produce the results that the market and more importantly what I have grown
accustomed to.

And if there's one or two of these things that might pop up, so be it. That's the nature of real estate development for 60
years. It used to be Simon DeBartolo competed for malls. It's not all that different. But I think we have earned the
respect and the confidence of our retailer partners, and when we announce an outlet center development we expect to
lease it, and they have all the confidence in the world that we'll be able to do so. There's none that come to mind
immediately on that front, Quentin, and we'll just see how the next couple years move forward.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. And then just in terms of the strength of your operating metrics, sales up almost 10%,
leasing spreads gaining momentum, up over 10%. Is this consistent across both the malls and the outlets? Or are your
premium outlets outperforming the malls a little?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. It's relatively consistent. The mall, I'll turn it to Rick, but generally the demand – since
2009, 2010 the demand for the outlets has been relatively strong. What we're seeing in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 is that
the malls have caught up from the retailer base, and demand for our mall activity has been very strong. Rick, do you
want to add anything?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing I would add is to David's point about where all of our development dollars
are going, if you look where most of the anchors are being added and most of the boxes are being added and where
we're doing our redevelopments, they're in the mall portfolio where we are having an increasing amount of demand. So
it's pretty equal in terms of the momentum and the platforms.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Good morning, guys. David, if I could actually ask Quentin's question maybe from a
different angle. The outlet industry development pipeline does seem bigger than ever. And rather than just the question
of them bumping into one another, how do you think about the risk of over-building in this business? Do you think it's
one where metro markets can ultimately sustain two, three, four outlet centers and we just haven't scratched the surface
here in new unit potential?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look. I can only answer from our perspective. We will not make any outlet mistakes.
Okay? The reason we won't is because we're the leader in the business. We have 70 premium outlets in the world. We
have the best franchise in this business. I just know that we won't make a mistake. I can't say the same thing for others.
That's not my job to worry about what others do. Undoubtedly there will be development mistakes made. They've been
made in the lifestyle business and the power center business and the mall business. But they won't be made by us.
And I've said this for the last year or two. I don't think – I do not think there will be as much built as people think.
There's been a list of 50 potential deals that have been kicked around and there are still going to be three or four of
these things built a year, maybe. And not as much as you think. But it's not my responsibility to opine for others.
They'll make mistakes. We won't. And we are not going to – you can lease something, too, if you give away the
building. We're not going to do that either just to get something built.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: And a follow-up for Rick. Thanks, David. What are retailers – I know it's a little early, but
maybe telling you about their expectations for this holiday season? How do you think that affects their unit expansion
plans for 2013 and 2014? Does it influence it heavily?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I don't think there's much of a connection. I think people are cautiously optimistic for this
holiday. I don't think they are bullish. There's the – sales have been holding up; consumer confidence is back above
levels where it was in 2007. Studies are showing that the consumers have a higher percentage of disposable income
now than they've had in the recent past, so all that augurs pretty well for the holiday. That said, I think the retailers'

balance sheets, their growth plans are still very well articulated, and we're still seeing pretty substantial demand, and I
don't think that will be materially impacted by whether holiday sales are 1% or 2% plus or minus expectations.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt, Bank of America.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Yes, was wondering, I know that you're looking at your options, but what's happening
with the Del Amo asset?
<A - David E. Simon>: We are making terrific, terrific progress. The redevelopment of that will commence in 2013. I
think we'll have some very positive announcements to make in the not too distant future and pretty much all systems
are go there. We finally turned a corner on what we want to do there and we're getting the right kind of commitments
from the right retailers.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. And then in terms of the level of activity, that actually seems to be accelerating
in terms of new anchor. Are we still in the ascension of that or is that starting to plateau in terms of demand for new
anchors to take new space?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It is accelerating and if you look at our announced anchor activity from quarter to quarter,
just as an example, in the 8-K we had for the second quarter there was 69 listed and now we're at 76 and there's still a
whole lot more we're working on. So we are still seeing demand in the portfolio across all the platforms from the
anchors.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: And would you say the private people running the malls have access to capital that
will accommodate that increase? Or is that an advantage you still hold?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm not sure. Say it – we missed it.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: I guess one of the advantages of the team to me that you obviously have constant
access to capital to be able to pursue these kinds of projects, $1 billion it looks like for the next three possible years.
Are the private players able to take part in this expansion of new anchors to the same degree?
<A - David E. Simon>: No way. No. No. I don't think so. No. But it's more than just capital. It's operational expertise.
But no, I think that's why we're able to secure these kind of commitments from these terrific retailers. Capital is part of
the equation, but it's also the ability to execute. But capital clearly governs a lot of activity, and that's why you've seen
not a lot of redevelopment but essentially no new projects done by kind of the typical group of folks that might be able
to secure capital prior to the great recession.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Doing well. It's a busy earnings day. First question is just going to the big picture on
Pershing Square, and if you look year to date through August when they put out their letter you guys were
outperforming. Subsequent you guys have been underperforming. Steve was at a conference, was very clear in what he
said, but yet the stock is still underperforming. And you know, Ackman is talking, or media reports suggest he may
launch a proxy battle next year. Is there any way for you guys to be more clear of your position so that this weight over
the stock can be lifted and you don't have to deal with it? Or is this one of these technical things and you guys just have
to run your business and do the stuff that you do and there's not much that you can do with this external?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, Steve speaks for the organization, and that's not to say that – if we had a problem
with what anybody said, we would clarify it. But Steve speaks for the organization and Steve spoke. So I don't know
what else we could do other than what we've done. Additionally, just to make it clear, we have no dog in that hunt. This
is a discussion between GGP, Brookfield and Pershing Square, and we're focused on running our business, and there's
nothing other than what I just said that I could add to that. And we hope the market understands that.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. That's helpful. And then a question for Steve. Is there an opportunity for you
guys to do – now that you're in – you know, you have the Klepierre and you're doing a little more stuff in Brazil and
Asia, is there an opportunity to do a multi-currency offering or the complexities and the pricing means that just keeping
it U.S. only is more than sufficient and gives you the cheapest cost of capital?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, it's a good question, Alex. I mean, our base currency is the U.S.; most of our
activities are in the U.S., but as you know, we have euros outstanding on our line that are acting as part of the hedge for
our equity investment in Klepierre. We could certainly raise capital in a currency like euros. That window of
opportunity would be open for us.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Is that something that's attractive as you think about the next few years of growth? Or
the U.S. is deep enough and with the floating rate line of credits, et cetera that you have overseas, there's not really a
need for it?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It's certainly something that we'd give consideration to. Sure.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: I would just add there's a lot of multinational companies that are tapping outside the U.S. to
broaden their investor base.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: And vice versa.
<A - David E. Simon>: Right.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: And Europeans that are coming here.
<A - David E. Simon>: So, it's not -
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It's not inconceivable.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, ISI Group.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks. Dave, it's a bit of a technical question. I don't know if you guys can answer it here. But
when you guys look at the releasings numbers and the actual starting rents and the ending rents on page 20 of the 8-K,

those have actually been going down in just kind of absolute terms from almost $56, I guess, back in the first quarter of
2011.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's just the mix. That's an absolute mix issue. That's happened historically before and that's
just a function of what properties are rolling over.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Is it a function of the properties? I would think law of large numbers would take care of that. Or is
that more a function of putting anchor deals in that might have lower rents?
<A - David E. Simon>: There's been no change in definition. It's just a function of the mix.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: One of the other things that would be driving it to a degree, Steve, is that over the years the
percentage of the outlet business as a percentage of our total business has been going up. And as you know the
historical occupancy costs there have been lower even with comparable sales productivity.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Right, okay. And then Steve, just a question for you. I think kind of the regional costs were down
fairly sharply quarter to quarter, second quarter to third quarter. Were those fees that were in there from say Klepierre
or as there something else pushing that decline down? And is third quarter a good run rate?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: No, Steve, that's just the cost side. It's just our costs were $3 million lower this quarter than
a year ago and that cost structure that flowed through in the third quarter of 2012 is a decent run rate.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's a good idea though; we should get fees for Klepierre. I like that idea. I'm not sure all
the shareholders would like that. We certainly would. But there are no fees from Klepierre.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: No, I was talking more professional fees that maybe you guys had incurred as opposed to fees you
were collecting.
<A - David E. Simon>: No.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: No.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I'm free of service over there.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance, Green Street Advisors.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. David, how many regional malls do you think will be built in Europe over the
next decade? And how well positioned do you think is Klepierre in capturing its fair share of those developments?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think just like the U.S., the idea of new development in Europe has got to be
reevaluated. One of the things that we're focused on in Europe is just how do you improve the yields on new and
extension-oriented projects. I've always found them to be not where they should be. And so one of the things we've
been working with Klepierre is to really try to drive the returns higher on anything, and primarily now going forward
it's going to be extensions.
I just don't -I just view it as the U.S. in a sense that the ultimate new projects will more than likely come from
extending existing centers. There's a couple of them on the drawing board. Unibail is I think about to start a mall in
Stockholm. Gecina got their deal on Paris. But a lot of that stuff already kind of was in the pipeline. I just don't see a lot
of new stuff. I think it ought to mirror the U.S. for quite some time.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. And then going back to the U.S., when I look at page 31 you've got a number of
outlets listed as your other properties, which I assume will probably be gone over time. How is the market for selling
lower-quality outlets at this point?

<A - David E. Simon>: These are factory stores. These are so small they're basically single-unit businesses – or
single-unit boxes that Chelsea got when they did one of their deals. These things produce like $0.5 million of cash
flow. That market is very thin but we're slowly selling those out. But I wouldn't even call them outlet centers. I mean
they're basically factory stores that are single-purpose buildings.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yes, hi. A couple questions, first, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit about
dividend policy? I mean the way you've been raising the dividend every quarter this year it seems like an efficient way
to do it. Is that something you plan on continuing as you move into 2013 or are you considering kind of putting in place
more of a normal increase the dividend once a year or so?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's hard to say. We're in the process now of doing 2013 and what our taxable income is
projected to be, and the likelihood right now is probably to continue to what we did in 2012, but we're still evaluating
that. We expect – again obviously we have a board to deal with, but the board is constrained by our taxable income and
we want to maintain our REIT status. So our taxable income is projected to be higher than what we're paying out today.
So our dividend's still on that trajectory. My guess is we might do it quarter by quarter. But that remains to be discussed
with the Board.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. And second, I guess kind of following up on the last question, how focused are you
on asset sales at this point? And I'm thinking a little bit more on the mall side as opposed to the smaller remaining
quasi-outlets.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. We're going to try and sell a few assets. It still is a very challenging market to do. But I
think there's more and more players coming into the market. There's more and more financing that seems to be
available to some of these entrepreneurs. So I would hope that we would continue to kind of get back in selling a few
non-core assets like we did before kind of the financing market bottom fell out.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple, Hilliard Lyons.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good morning. With your new outlet you announced last week in Charlotte, why did you all
decide to go with a partner on that instead of keeping it to yourself?
<A - David E. Simon>: It wasn't our site.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense then.
<A - David E. Simon>: I think if we had the site, we probably wouldn't have partnered with anybody. But it's just not
our site.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Okay. And then with the sale of the Capital Shopping Centres securities and the Capital &
Counties properties, how much will your dividend income decrease?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Harris [Imperial Capital LLC]. Please proceed.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Thanks. Here's a question related to your French connection, David. I won't ask it in
French. So a couple of weeks ago, the French industry minister talked about raising taxes on the property sector. Now
this is an issue we kind of aired a couple of quarters ago, but my question as it relates to this is if you sit there thinking
about allocating dollars, either domestically or overseas, what sort of premium do you think is justified for overseas
investment to try and capture these sort of risks, which I think are implicit in allocating that dollar overseas?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the good news since we last talked, David, the stock is above where we bought it and the
euro is above where we made our initial investment. So look, I think the value that we got in helps to deal with those
risks. Business has risk wherever it goes. We certainly have tax risk in the United States of America – if you hadn't
been reading the newspapers lately – for individuals and all sorts of things. So I think at the end of the day there's been
a lot of studies on the CIC structure there and how it's helped the French treasury. And I don't expect any material
change.
But the point is that in any jurisdiction that you're in, Brazil, France, Japan, Korea, just to name a few places that we
are in, I mean you have to underwrite what your true tax cost is, and that's got to be implicit in the returns that you
want. But I think we're generating above – the returns that we're generating there with the future opportunities that I
think will exist in the continent, at this point we feel comfortable with it and I wouldn't necessarily overreact to
comments here and there about what certain French authorities might do. There's been a lot of studies that supported
the French CIC and I just don't see any change whatsoever on that front. They need to maintain the competitive balance
and there's been talk in the U.S. but we don't overreact to that as well.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Okay. Then a couple weeks ago I read that Amazon is in discussions with a number of
brand names. Some of those brand names kind of seem to be very big occupiers of sort of outlet space – for example,
Coach, Burberry, Ralph Lauren – and they seem to go upscale on some of these, like Prada and Gucci were also
mentioned. Any thoughts as to what that might do to bricks-and-mortar demand in the outlets? Which I suspect many
people have not really thought of being as vulnerable as they may be if some of that business gravitates to the internet.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, I don't know what papers you're reading, but I'm going to start to look at your –
look, I think all of those retailers want to control their brand. So I would be really surprised if they delegated that
responsibility to Amazon.

<Q - David Bryan Harris>: I mean, the comment, the article that I read was actually in the Financial Times. It said
this is the hottest button any issue for high-end brand retailers.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, I...
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: And that was an independent third-party consultant. So you know, they know a lot more
than I do, I'm sure.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. Listen, David, we know these retailers very well. I would be really surprised if they were
going to give up control of their brand and be umbrellaed under an Amazon, you know, an Amazon model. I just can't
imagine it. They're very selective in how they deal with their outlet operations. It's got to be brand positive, it's got to fit
with their wholesale accounts, very complicated equation that they have. That's why I think a number of these outlets
that are being bandied about with those kind of – you know, in terms of the full demand will be very selective because
they're just not going to go to any and all centers. I think those retailers want to control. They want to be omni-channel.
I just don't – I just can't imagine they're going to end up delegating and losing control over that.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Good. Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Your next question is from Rich Moore, RBC Capital.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Good. Going back to that page 31 that Cedrik was talking about, I noticed from last quarter
that in the list last quarter we had Discover Mills and Lakeforest Mall.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, they've both...
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: And I think Discover was maybe – yes, go ahead.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, they've both been – again, they're still in TMLP and we didn't buy all the assets out of
TMLP.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yes, were those underwater, David? Are you giving those back to the lenders?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, Discover Mills – I'm sorry, it's renamed. It's now Sugarloaf Mills because the marketing
contract with Discover expired. So that's all that happened there.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Good. I was going to ask you what Sugarloaf was. Yes, good. Thank you. But I had seen
that – but is that one you're trying to sell, is that the idea?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. We're leasing, managing it. It's on our books for nothing. It's levered but the deal's been
extended. We think over time it will get better and better. But we didn't want to buy it out of the partnership. It's a no
harm, no foul kind of deal.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Got you. And then Lakeforest, is that one you got rid of?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: But not a sale; that was a give back to the lender.
<A - David E. Simon>: It was – actually it was a sale.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: It was a sale. Okay, great. Thanks.

<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Then Steve, the credit line has a balance, and it's a big credit line, but it does have $2 billion
of outstanding debt on it. Is there any plan to take that out, or are you comfortable with where that's at?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, it's actually two credit facilities, Rich. So there's $6 billion of aggregate capacity.
Someone asked earlier about the potential of raising capital in euros. More than half of the outstandings right now, $1.2
billion, is euro-denominated and is acting as a hedge for our equity investment in Klepierre. So potentially terming that
out would be one opportunity. But we're running with $4 billion of liquidity, availability in our credit facility, if you
will, plus another $1 billion of cash in the bank between wholly owned and our shared JVs, so plenty of firepower,
Rich.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. Yes, it sounds good. Then the provision for credit loss just seems to keep shrinking.
Is that a pretty good indication from you guys that the retail community by and large is I guess extremely healthy?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Certainly, receivables are low and write-offs have been also at historically low levels, and
you're seeing the result of that with the lack of bad debt experience. There are always a handful of tenants, Rich, that
we are monitoring and paying attention to, but the overall health of the tenant base is pretty good.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. Good. Thank you. And then the last thing I had was the year-end target for
occupancy, Rick, you guys are up there pretty high at this point. Does it actually get higher from here or are we pretty
much done at the 94.5% sort of level?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're working, and I think you're still going to see a little more growth from where it is
today.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Great. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Just wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about the sales increases we've seen in your
portfolio, the higher end mall portfolios, over the last couple years versus I guess the lower sales per square foot
portfolios. From where we sit it's hard to look at the information and determine exactly what's happening here.
Obviously we've seen much lower increases in sales at the lower sales per square foot malls, so what's happening here?
I mean what do you think over the next couple of years, what's the consumer saying? Where are they spending? Is it
more the discounters? I mean what are you seeing from your centers? Any concern here on these lower sales per square
foot malls? And I'm not sure if that's below 300, below 350, below 250.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I'll let Rick – I want somebody to ask Rick to list tenants. Okay? We could start at St.
Louis and list all the commitments we have if you really want. So please, somebody ask Rick, because if we don't have
a call where we can't list the tenants that are doing business, we're in trouble.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: I had that down next.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Good. Thank you. But let me just say this. The good news that we're seeing in the
mall business is that the demand from the general retailer population seems to be moving down the sales per square
foot spectrum. And so that's just the one point that I would make and then I'll let Rick say the rest.

<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I would point you to two things. One, I believe our properties are taking share in their
markets. And if you look at where we're adding our anchors, to David's point, those anchors are being added across the
quality spectrum within our portfolio. They're not being solely added to the higher productivity malls, and as we add
anchors we're renovating 15 properties a year. We're making our properties better and we are, I believe, gaining share.
The other thing that's going on is that higher productivity tenants will continue to outperform because they're going
from a higher date, and they have higher per sales per foot productivity, and that's going to drive overall sales. So you
put those two things together, I think that's what's contributing to the trends you're seeing.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. And then shifting to the redevelopments, I guess can you talk a little bit more about your
plans over the next few years versus, let's say, five or seven years ago when lots of malls were under redevelopment I
think for different purposes, somewhat to defend against new competition. What's the strategy here? Is it just bottom
line that you saved money for a few years there during the crisis and it's time to renovate? Or are you also trying to
defend against new competition? Or is that not really a fear?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we're economic animals here. So I think over the years the market has seen that
when we invest capital we want a return for it. We don't build just for the sake of building, but we do it with the idea
that the cash flow growth from that asset will accelerate or that we'll have a return. And I would say to you the primary
driver of this is that we've got great properties that we think we can make better, and the reason we can make better is
because we have the retailer demand to come into that center, but we just don't have the space. Or we have space
because it's a center that's been around that can be better configured to allow for a better retailer to come into the place.
And if you'll look at our list of activity it's all disclosed there. You're seeing it.
The good news is our big, big projects, the Roosevelt Fields, the Copleys, the Del Amos, to name a few off the top of
my head, are still not at the point where we're ready to go. But we're getting very, very close on those and that is really
exciting. And I think what it allows us to do is just to take a great property and make it the place to be. And we had an
outset in essentially 2009 that we had this great portfolio but we really wanted to make some of these centers iconic in
nature and transform them to gain market share for the twenty-first century. And that's what we're doing.
And as I said in my comments the market tends to overlook this stuff. I got to tell you we're never been busier in this
effort and the stuff that we're doing is exciting. It's transforming on these properties. We had very good economic
returns. We got a lot of resources dedicated to it. In some cases we're drinking from the fire hose that we're so busy, but
the good news is stuff is coming online already for the end of this year and next year.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. Thanks. And then before we get to the tenant side, I'm sorry, I'm not sure if you
discussed this already, but I was just curious your view on some of the recent mall transactions pricing: Kings Plaza,
Green Acres, the Woodfield sale, Woodfield I guess hearing high fours, others kind of low five to mid-five. What do
you think about the pricing and what this is saying about the sales productivity at those malls, what that all means?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we did not bid or participate in Green Acres and Kings Plaza, so I really have no
comment on the pricing there, but I'd say generally I mean the marketplace understands the relative attractiveness of
strong malls. It ebbs and flows. Sometimes people overreact to potential external threats to the mall business. I will tell
you that good malls, despite all of its competitive threats, including the internet, if they're properly run and maintained
and have the exciting retailers in it, that cash flow is going to grow. I mean we have evidence of that in so many
different places. I don't know what else to say. It doesn't surprise me that these values in this kind of low interest rate
environment are there, and that's a generic statement. It's not a specific statement on any of those transactions you
mentioned.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: And so when we think about those transactions and the pricing you said that it is challenging to
sell some of the non-core mall properties that you own. Can you just quickly say I guess when you say non-core what
are we talking about? Sales under 250, under 300?
<A - David E. Simon>: When we sell it, you'll know it.

<A - David E. Simon>: Until that time, we're running every property as if it's our only one.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. And then, Rick, can you talk about tenant demand and where are you seeing the most
store openings?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well the tenant demand is pretty much across the platforms. We're seeing very good
demand in the malls, in the mills, in the premium outlets. Premium outlets, you're having a number of retailers that
have traditionally not been in that sector wanting to get involved in that sector in a pretty large way. We've got some
tenants coming over internationally that are getting more aggressive with their U.S. presence. And we have some brand
extensions. I mean the best example is Limited Brands' Pink. That started out as a sub-brand inside of the Victoria's
Secret stores, and now they're very aggressively rolling that out as a free-standing retail concept. And it's a great retailer
with great credit with a beautiful store. So these are the types of things that make the properties better.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum, Simon Property Group (sic) [UBS].
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hi. It's Ross from UBS. I didn't know that I was an employee.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's right. You're gonna really have to bring a hard question for us just to...
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Well, if you want to talk, I'm all ears. Can you talk about, David, you just said – I thought
you said you didn't participate in looking at Kings Plaza and Green Acres. Why was that?
<A - David E. Simon>: We just did not have an interest in those centers. I mean it's not – much to the market's
surprise, we don't look at every and any deal that's out there.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay. Next question. I don't know, David, if you want to take this, or Steve. If I look at
your expense reimbursements, which handily beat us this quarter and has been trending upwards frankly for five years
now, you're now running effectively at the highest occupancy rate you've ever run at. Your expense reimbursement
ratio is also as high as it's ever been. How do we think about the potential upside in your ability to capture future, I
guess, an uptick in that reimbursement level, and occupancy while we're at it?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, I think the way you have to think about, Ross, is that there's been a de-linking over
the last 10 years between the reimbursement line and the cost line, as the industry migrated to fixed CAM. So fixed
CAM is now just another charge that has an annual escalator associated with it. And you can see the trend in the
reimbursement revenue line there.
The expense side, quite frankly, as a company we've done a really good job over the last four or five years of bringing
expenses out of the properties. They are at a low level. We've also benefited from some cyclical things like lack of
snow this year and low energy costs. You're going to need to make your assumption about where those costs are going
to go in the future. But we've certainly got the benefit of a cycle that has been helpful to us, which has caused the
disparity in the reimbursements and caused that recovery ratio to continue to increase.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: What percentage of your tenants are now on fixed CAM?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Over 90%.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: So is it fair to say that we're now going to start seeing a leveling off in that expense
reimbursement ratio versus the uptrend over the last five years?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, most of those tenants who are on fixed CAM have an annual escalator in that charge.
So the impact on the net recovery will be do the expenses grow at a rate faster or slower than the aggregate recovery

increase from the escalators.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: But the fact is it boils down to also how we negotiate what the CAM charge is. Right? So I
wouldn't say necessarily it levels off. It just depends on how good we negotiate what the CAM charge is. We'll see.
When retail demand is strong we can negotiate a better rate than when it's not.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Do the retailers look – the way that we calculate it, you captured 113% of your operating
expenses this quarter. Do the retailers say, hey, wait a minute, why are we paying $1.13 for every $1 of cost?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. Other than since you're pointing it out, maybe they will now.
<A - David E. Simon>: I thought you worked for us. Okay? I thought you were part of Simon Property Group.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: You don't pay me enough.
<A - David E. Simon>: The fact is it's a negotiation. They don't look at that as really a function of what sales
productivity they'll generate out of that space. Our people are very focused on it. But I'd also just say this. It's also
pretty good evidence of our ability to run a big organization and take advantage of our scale. Part of the reason why
we're able to drive down operating cost is because we have systems in place. We've got the procedures. We've got
vendor relationships. So the fact of the matter is that retailers should not look at that. They should really look at
whether or not they're getting a fair deal for their space. And our organization with its size and scale is able to really
drive these costs down. That's been our model from a long, long time.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Good. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Donnelly, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Yes, David, just explain that extra 13% of the baggage handling or fuel surcharge fees
since those seem to be en vogue these days. I was curious because last quarter I think you were talking about like cap
rates on B malls would be coming lower. Is that a view you still hold and has there been much that you've seen to
support that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think there should be more trades happening. It seems like with the financing market
coming back there should be a few more trades coming on board and I think it'll support that thesis.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: I'm curious, where would you peg them today if you had them?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think you've got to be really careful on – 6.8%, 7.5%. I really think it's a function of that asset
and its historical cash flow and its future growth. I would be remiss to give you a number. I don't think it means
anything; it's such an asset-specific basis. I will tell you though that the market clearly is paying for stability and stable
cash flow. So it really depends if it has to be redone in some fashion or is it the stable non-sexy property. It all kind of
goes in. It's really real estate specific, as it should be.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: And just a last question, more a housekeeping one. Any decision on whether Copley is
going to end up as a for sale or for rent project, wholly owned or JV?
<A - David E. Simon>: Still evaluating all that. Our view today, we might partner with somebody, but our view today
is that it'll more than likely be a rental building as opposed to when we first thought about it more for sale. And it may
be a little bit of both, but the view today is it'll be for rental.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley [Citigroup Global Markets].
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Actually it's Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, I wanted to come back just
to Amazon just for a second because clearly I think they've dropped some of the tax battles that they have, and at least
in the context that I've been hearing about they're actually even thinking about going into malls. Part of that is to open
up some pop-ups, show case the Kindle Fires, Kindle HDs and effectively open people up that they didn't know about
Amazon yet to the shopping experience. I'm just curious whether you're sort of in contact with them. Clearly having the
largest mall platform, that would be an easy way for them to get access and distribution. So how are you thinking about
involving them?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, Amazon is an absolute fantastic company, a force. I think if you talk to Mr. Bezos
he would tell you that there's a role for the way he sells good, but there's also, I think he'd be the first to say that there's
a significant role for how we present our retailers' products. Ultimately I'm sure they'll at some point converge.
Retailers are certainly converging. We're seeing more and more retailers ship out of stores, have pickup out of stores,
and that seems to be a trend aggressively that they're doing, which I think is very beneficial for us, the mall owner, in
that if you can pick up or ship out of stores.
Returns happen. Additional visits happen. And it helps them on their costs because they don't have to put the extra
resources in distribution facilities. So we would expect that trend to continue and I would say look, if Amazon or
anyone else wanted to talk to us about how to create benefit for our consumer we'd certainly have an open mind. To
your specific point, I have not heard that they want to own any physical or operate any physical stores. So we have not
heard that.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: I guess as you think about – you know you talked about the tenants being able to ship
out of store, pick up in store, have those started now, as that percentage increases, and I don't know how those sales are
tracked, I assume they're not tracked at the store level, which means you're not entitled...
<A - David E. Simon>: They are tracked at the store level. Absolutely.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So you're going to get percentage rents and effectively drive your rental income? It's
not becoming a point of contention between you and the tenant, the fact that the sale may be...
<A - David E. Simon>: You know, sure it's going to be a discussion. But we're going to hold firm on it. But sure, no,
it'll be a discussion, just like, unfortunately, everything in the lease document. But, no, we would expect to be very
firm. Just like they can't offset returns against it if they buy it from – it's not generated from that store in the first place.
So that'll be something to discuss. But our view of that is pretty straightforward. And we expect over time that that will
be customary.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: This question is for Steve. So you look at guidance today $7.80 to $7.85, relative to
$7.35, $7.50 when you announced Klepierre and Mills. So let's call it a midpoint increase of $0.40. It's about $145
million of FFO. Can you just – I don't know if you have this analysis, but can you just break out maybe the big
components of that $145 million? Where you're getting it from? What's coming in better than expectations? Perhaps
how much is better – Klepierre performing better than you originally underwrote? Just to give us a sense of what's been
driving a significant increase over the course of the year.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Mike, I'd give you two or three thoughts. Sales have remained very robust, more so than
we would have anticipated nine months ago. That has led to higher percentage rents. The fact that sales are higher also
has to have a second derivative effect on leasing. So that would all be rolled in there. The cost environment has
remained very muted, and so to one of the earlier questions, recovery ratios would be a little higher. And then we
would have assumed that borrowing costs would have gone up a bit. They have not. And even though we've decreased

our exposure to floating-rate debt from 16% down to 10%, we have benefited from a lower interest rate environment. I
think those would be the three or four big thoughts.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Klepierre's not driving any bit of an increase at all?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, Michael, the Klepierre transaction was accretive. We told you it was accretive at the
time of the acquisition. I think David mentioned in his prepared remarks it's performing exactly as we thought it would.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: And then I don't know if Matt is there or not in the room.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: He is not.
<A - David E. Simon>: No.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: I'm just curious, maybe David, on your take next and then out four months, sort of
what – clearly you've liquidated Capital Shopping Centres and Capital & Counties. I don't know if that was his
decision. I mean I know you've been frustrated with the ultimate transaction that occurred last year.
<A - David E. Simon>: The buck stops here, brother.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: No, no, I know. What has Matt – what has happened in the last four months? What
has he brought to the organization?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, he's – there is going to be a lot of opportunities for this company, and given the amount
of activity that we already have with our existing asset base, we needed a thoughtful pair of hands to help in all of the
stuff that we're doing. He's got ideas and he's looking at all sorts of things both domestically and internationally. I'd say
Steve and I, who have the most exposure to him, have been very pleased with what he's contributed, and he's looking at
all sorts of things, which I think over time we'll do some things, and that'll be helpful to the company's profile.
So the bottom line here is there's not one deal that we need to do, period, end of story. What we really need to do, if I
had to tell you what we really need to do, is we really have to execute at the highest level on our redevelopment and
development pipeline. That's what we've really got to do. That's why we brought Contis on board, because we needed,
given the volume of activity, we needed really someone that could really help in that effort, and he's already done that,
and he's been instrumental I think finally in getting the llama where it is. We've got a great outlet team and they're
executing, but Rick and I have to sit on them and prod them and poke them. And then Goodman with the Mills is doing
a very good job and I think you've seen the performance there.
So the bottom line is the one thing we've got to do is we've got to execute our redevelopment pipeline. That's huge. The
deal business, if it ain't a good deal I'm not doing it. It's that simple. And that's why if we don't do another deal and
Matt's here for three years before he does a deal, it's okay with me because we're only going to do deals that make sense
for this company. But he's a great set of eyes. He's a breath of fresh air. He's younger because we've got some older
guys so it's always good to have a younger guy. A nice guy, fits in well with the team, and he'll pick up and he'll go to
far away places at a moment's notice, and that's helpful, and he represents the company well.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Just one last one for Rick. You have a bunch of these retailers, Walmart, Target, Best
Buy, all effectively saying we'll price match relative to Amazon and online. What's your expectation as owning these
assets and what potentially could be happening to the shopping experience during this holiday season in guarantees like
that?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, to the extent that they are going to be aggressively pricing, that can only help
increase traffic to our properties and increase our sales. So to that degree that'll be helpful. I will tell you that like a
Walmart and a Best Buy, our exposure to those retailers is relatively low. I mean our retailers are more positioned in
the moderate to better price points and it's not a commodity product. As David said earlier each of these retailers are
very jealous about their brand and their brand equity and protecting their brand and pricing strategy is part of that. But
to the extent that our property and our retailers are going to be more competitive price-wise, that can only inure to our
benefit in terms of increased traffic and sales.

<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya, Jefferies & Co.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I hope I didn't miss this earlier, because I've been on a
whole bunch of calls, but did you talk about Charlotte, North Carolina, at all and how ultimately how you envision that
market to evolve? Specifically, I wanted to know if you feel both competing projects can be built and what the potential
impact to Concord Mills may be.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, yes, we did talk about it briefly. You know at the end of the day, my guess is only one
will get built there. And you know, it will be a competition of which one gets built. But I don't anticipate – you know,
you've got two very experienced – three for that matter – very experienced outlet developers in Charlotte. You've got
Tanger, you've got us, and Paragon. So I think at the end of the day, it'll be a competition to who gets the retailers. And
the experience will ultimately dictate that somebody will get the project and somebody won't and there will be one
built. And I don't think, given where the locations of both are, I don't think it'll have, if you know Charlotte, I don't
think it's going to have an impact on Concord Mills at all. If it does it'll have a marginal one.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: That's helpful. And then one other thing. When I take a look at your geographic footprint, I
think the one thing that always strikes me is your minimal presence in kind of like the highly dense urban cities like
New York, for example. And I'm just curious, is that just a strategic thing with the company is that you just don't like
those markets? Or do you continue to kind of look for opportunities to get into some of those markets given that access
in those markets? They generally tend to perform pretty well.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I don't know. I mean in New York we've got Westchester, Woodbury Commons. We're
redeveloping Nanuet in Nyack, New York. In Long Island we've got Roosevelt Field, Smith Haven, Walt Whitman,
which we've all redeveloped or are under redevelopment. In New Jersey, we've got a number of properties in New
Jersey. So are we in Brooklyn? The answer is no. But like I said, that's fine for us. We've got plenty to do.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi. I'm just curious about what you think about the JCPenney's shop-in-shop model and the
competitiveness of what they may be trying to do with inline space in the malls adjacent to their stores.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Rick and I visited the prototype store, when? At the end of August?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yes. A couple months ago.
<A - David E. Simon>: So look, I thought it was impressive. I think it's got a real potential there to be something that
we'd love to see as an anchor to our centers in terms of driving traffic. When you talk to the folks that, like a Sephora,
that are in Penney and are in the mall, they view it as two different shoppers, and it really does not affect how they
think about it. And it really gives them an opportunity probably to go to some markets where they're too small for them
to have an individual store. So I think it's beneficial. I think it won't be an overly competitive scenario, and hopefully
it'll drive traffic to Penney, which will drive traffic to the mall.

<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing I would add is if you look at the department store construct, what we
have found is there are a number of our full-price retailers that have wholesale businesses within the department stores.
And that's a very good source to us of new lease opportunities, because if they open in a department store, do business,
they see there's a market there, and they will now come to us and then say we want to open a full line store because
we're missing sales that are going on in the mall as opposed to just in that store.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: So would that – how do you think in the context of those comments about something like the
Finish Line and Macy's deal? That's a retailer who would be in a lot of the malls already and is going into like 450 or so
of their stores.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We've had that conversation with Finish Line and their view is, and we agree with it, is
that it's going to be a different shopper. It's just going to expand their footprint and expose themselves to a shopper that
was otherwise not going to be available to them in their mall stores.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. Great. And then my other question is just on the same-store NOI. You've got $1 billion
or so of NOI that is in the noncomparable pool. A lot of that I guess is the community and lifestyle business. Do you
have a rough sense of kind of what that would do if you were to include a lot of what you exclude that is still a same
kind of a same center number. If you were to include that in your same-store NOI growth, what it would be?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, Paul, the comp center NOI growth is for our malls and our outlets only, so Mills as
an example is not in there, although the growth rate of Mills has been at or higher...
<A - David E. Simon>: It would only improve it...
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: But it doesn't have the community centers either, does it?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It does but that's a small part. That's $150 million annual EBITDA on a $4 billion basis.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yes, it's a very small part.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: But for the premium and outlets the comparable portfolio is $218 million...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: $216 million profit.
<A - David E. Simon>: $216 million.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: I mean it's a big pool...
<A - David E. Simon>: So it's a big pool. It's not like $10 million or $15 million; it's $218 million.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: On the outlets out of a total of – when you add those two up, I don't have it off the top of my
head, but the outlets and the...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Like 60/30.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: 60 plus outlets and...
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, no. Just in the U.S.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Oh, just in the U.S.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. So anyway, in any event it's the vast majority of our portfolio.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Great.
<A - David E. Simon>: And again we're only taking out like the deals that are under construction. Yes.

<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. And just last question on the rent spread. It's a little bit hard to compare going back to
the past because you changed the reporting gross spreads, but where are we now versus the types of numbers that you
would have reported in 2005, 2006 when your base rent spreads were 20% to 25%? If you were to think about it just in
terms of kind of your negotiation leverage and kind of the type of markups you're able to get, even though we don't see
those numbers historically, where are we today?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, I think, Paul, one of the things that's changed is that as an example, over the last
several years we've gone to annual escalators in minimum rent as well. The number we give you is an ending cash rent
to a beginning cash rent of the new lease. But the fact is because we're getting many more annual escalators in our rent
streams now, you're comparing a bit of an apple and an orange if you try to go back and look at it five or six years ago.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I would just say this though. Going from pro rata to fixed, you're not going to see much
of a bump there, right? Because if the tenant was paying $15 pro rata, you can't suddenly say, well, I'm going to charge
you $18 fixed. They may give you a little bit because it takes you out of the equation. So when you add that in there,
you're going to see a lower spread, but it's mostly driven by the rental spread.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: So is 10% about what we should expect?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. Sure.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee from Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Hi. Good afternoon. As the focus starts to turn now to 2013, you've had the close to 5%
same-store growth in 2012. Given what you've seen from leasing done already for 2013 with almost full occupancy,
how should we think about the 2013 growth? Is it conceivable to think that the growth could match or even accelerate
from where we've gone in 2012?
<A - David E. Simon>: We'll let you know as soon as we finish our 2013 budget. I will say this, Nate. One of the
things you have to keep in mind with our comp NOI numbers is we've been, again, the vast majority of our portfolio in
the U.S. is comp. I mean, it's 80%, 90%, 90% if I have the numbers right. So we've also – so we don't – it's the
portfolio. So just to underline that.
But the other point I'd say to you is if you look back in 2010 and 2011, importantly, we were growing our comp NOI
portfolio where some of our peers had big decreases or were flat. So you have to keep that in mind, in perspective, in
terms of how you look. I mean it's great to take a retailer when they post minus 10% comp NOI, or I'm sorry, sales.
And then the next year it's up 5%, you've got to go back to the minus 10 to look at what plus 5 means.
We have been growing our comp NOI. We were flat in 2009. We had positives in 2010. We had positives in 2011,
industry-leading positives. 90% of our 220 U.S. mall and outlet portfolio is in that number. And so you just have to put
that in context. But the fact is I'm not going to answer your question until we will at the beginning of next year.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: All right. And then you've made a big push on today's call to highlight the redevelopment, the $1
billion a year over the next few years. We've heard from some players that there's been a change in tone from Sears in
terms of store closures and store sales. As you contemplate the $1 billion a year, is that assuming a pretty static
environment with Sears? And if that changes for you and Sears, would you say that that $1 billion a year could go up
significantly?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay.

<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, being that if we were suddenly to buy a bunch of Sears stores, that number would go up.
Yes, and a couple of them may be – the redevelopment may take a different form because now if you add the Sears
store back you would do something different that you might otherwise do. But I think, Nate, that's right. That number
would go up if we suddenly saw a lot of Sears activity.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Would you say that the tone of the conversations with Sears has changed?
<A - David E. Simon>: Not really, Rick, not really.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: No, I think that we're continuing to have our conversations with them and it's been pretty
consistent over the last months.
<A - David E. Simon>: I mean I do think, as you mentioned, Nate, I mean I do think they'll sell stores. But it's not
going to be – they have 800 mall stores, if I last remember. It's not going to be you're going to see 200 mall stores sold.
I mean you're going to sell a handful here and there I think.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: No, but if you can get 30 or 40...
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. No, no, I agree. I'm just saying. But I was really talking about your broader Sears
question. I don't see a big change in their selling a lot of stores. A couple here and there.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think it's important to emphasize they're still very focused on running a retail business.
And that's their business. And all of our conversations with them are certainly grounded by that underlying premise that
they're an ongoing, viable retailer looking to get better and increase their market share.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Have you seen them more willing to cut the store, give you back half?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: They're analyzing their business. They're doing a lot of things internally with their
business. And we're just continuing to have conversations with them to see how we make that box in our centers as
productive as it can be, both under their ownership and if they decide they want to talk to us about something,
obviously we're here.
<A - David E. Simon>: Just for those that are still on and interested, which we appreciate, our comparable U.S. outlets
and malls for this quarter was 216 out of 220. Not included were a couple malls that are going through major
redevelopment, Walt Whitman and Keystone. And then with Merrimack opening and Silver Sands, that was the only
two outlets that weren't in it.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: All right, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang, Evercore Partners.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yes, hi. Thanks. David or Rick, I think you commented earlier on seeing increasing retailer
demand at some of your lower sales-per-square-foot malls though? I was just wondering if you can maybe elaborate a
bit. Kind of how far down the sales-per-square-foot spectrum would those occupancy posts look like? Are there maybe
any preferred geographies for these retailers as well?
<A - David E. Simon>: In terms of geography, no, but you've got a number of retailers that are growing that have
basically staked out a more moderate consumer and they have a strategy to serve that consumer and they're doing it
very well. And we're doing an increasing amount of business with them across a broader swath of our portfolio...
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: I mean but is there a tipping point in sales where they won't look at malls that do less than
maybe like 350 a foot? Or do they go as far down as...

<A - David E. Simon>: No. It all depends on the market and the real estate. It's not really a function of the 322 or 371.
I mean it's really whether they think they can do business and make money.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. And then just final one. Do you ever envision a time in the near future where maybe if
you get some better [indiscernible] (1:31:30) growth out of the B malls over your A malls given obviously the rents are
higher in the As, the occupancy levels are higher in the As, I mean do you think that's something that we'll see anytime
soon?
<A - David E. Simon>: You mean changing the operating trends from the Bs accelerating higher than the As?
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yes. Basically getting better growth, core growth out of the Bs, rather than the As.
<A - David E. Simon>: I wouldn't want to categorize it by quality. Certainly where we have done things in a number
of our properties to reposition them, we've seen growth rates commensurate with that capital expended. It's a
property-by-property analysis.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: No worries. Okay.
