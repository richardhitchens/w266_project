operating and financial team in the room today.
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will start with the
presentation materials included in our website presentation. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call
for questions.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $1.85 billion, which was $1.78 per share for the second
quarter of 2015. The net loss attributable to common stock included net charges totaling $2 billion or $1.92 per share
for the second quarter, primarily for the reduction of carrying values of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these
special items, FCX's adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $143 million or $0.14 per share.
Copper sales during the second quarter totaled 964 million pounds. We sold gold of 352,000 ounces. And our oil and
gas sales totaled 13.1 million barrels of oil equivalent. In the second quarter, we realized an average copper price of
$2.71 per pound, that was below last year's second quarter of $3.16 per pound; gold prices of $11.74 per ounce
compared with the prior year quarter of $12.96 per ounce; and our average realized price for crude oil during the
second quarter 2015 was $67.61 per barrel, which included $11.79 per barrel of realized cash gains on our derivative
contracts.
We generated operating cash flows of $1.1 billion during the quarter and our capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion.
We ended the quarter with $20.9 billion of consolidated debt and consolidated cash was just under $500 million. We
also ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of approximately $3 billion and under the Cerro Verde
project loan of just over $500 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who'll provide additional details on our results and operations and outlook.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our call. I want to report on the
operating and cost performance highlights of our second quarter and the first half of the year, of course in the context of
a weak commodity price environment. But we have positive things to report. Our Morenci project, which is an
important project for us, is operating at full rates. Our Cerro Verde project in Peru is progressing very well. It's now
more than 87% complete, in line to a start-up later this year and we're very pleased with the progress there.
We've had improved operations at Grasberg, our mining rate, our recoveries. We are moving towards having access to
higher grade ores in late 2015 and, 2016 and 2017 as we complete mining in the open pit. Our labor situation is stable
during the second quarter. So from a mining standpoint, we are positioned for near-term growth in production and also
to get the benefits financially of declining costs and declining capital expenditures as we complete our expansion
projects.
We had a good operating quarter in our oil and gas business that Jim will be talking about in a few minutes. The Lucius
production reached full capacity. We had positive drilling results with our tie-in projects for our Holstein and Horn
Mountain facilities. We now have seven tieback wells available for completion that will provide incremental
production volumes in future years.
We previously reported that on June 23 we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for our potential initial public offering of a minority interest in our oil and gas subsidiary. I'll just point out
we are in registration, so we have some limitations on what we can say today. But we can report on our results and our
plans for our operations as we go forward.
Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights and you can see that across the board, our actual results were consistent with
our guidance. We were able to access some higher grade gold ore at Grasberg and so our gold production was up
roughly 15%.
Our cost performance was good with our net cash operating cost in our mining business being at $1.50 per pound and
$19 per barrel in the oil and gas business. So again, if you look at our financial highlights, it reflects a strong quarter

operationally.
Our company remains highly impacted by copper prices, of course, and highly leveraged to the copper prices. And
copper prices have dropped here late in the second quarter and as we've gone into the third quarter. And copper is, of
course, the commodity that's probably most affected by global economic conditions and the current uncertainties there.
The stronger dollar have contributed to the current price situation.
The slowdown in the China economy is a factor and the carry-on effects of the drop in stock prices in China and the
impact on financial investors is certainly being shown in the copper price. Within China, we do our business there. We
see requirements for copper growing in absolute terms and China continuing to be a significant consumer of copper.
And with the country's commitment to infrastructure investment, with the government's commitment to addressing the
economic slowdown, we don't see China having a hard-landing type situation as some are predicting. But we have to be
prepared to deal with the conditions as they evolve. And we certainly will be able to do that as we've shown our ability
to do in the past.
As we talk with our customers, our downstream customer in the U.S., and of course, we're a very significant supplier of
copper to the U.S., we see recovery continuing at moderate rates and our customers being well-positioned and
confident about the outlook for the second half of this year, a gradual recovery in Europe.
So, as we have been for some time, we are facing near-term price uncertainty in the copper business and having to
address our business in light of that uncertainty. You can develop reasonable scenarios now for our prices either staying
where they are, dropping or increasing. But none of that deters us from our long-range positive view of the long term
fundamentals about the copper business.
The supply side that miners face continued to be constrained. Inventory levels, while they rose in the first quarter of
2015, remain modest by historical levels. And our company is strongly positioned with our large volumes of copper
production and our very large inventory of reserves and resources to take advantage of what we remain confident will
be a long term positive future for the copper business.
Just to give you something that I've shown some of you before, but just to illustrate that in broad terms on slide 6, we
show the largest copper mines in the world in terms of reserves on the left chart and in 2014 on the right chart. There's
a limited number of mines here, the top 10 copper-producing mines in 2014 produced less than 5 million tons per year.
Another factor when we think about supply situation in the copper business, there are 16 mines on these two charts.
Only 4 of them were discovered in the last 50 years.
Only 4 discovered in the last 50 years, the discovery of world-class copper mines is very rare. They last for decades and
these mines provide growth opportunities as you go forward. But it is a commodity where the expectations or the
likelihood of discovery of a new mine of world-class significance is something that is rare. And then when we look at
the longer term copper market fundamentals, we use some Wood Mackenzie data here. Other analysts use other data.
Some are more optimistic, some are less. But in Wood Mackenzie's analysis, if you assume global growth at 2.4% a
year for the next two years, which is not an aggressive view, that would include Chinese growth at – for the next 10
years, that would include Chinese growth at 3.7% whereas China has grown at roughly 10% for the past 10 years. You
would see a requirement for copper of 7.6 million tons.
Over the same period, production from existing mines will decline as grades drop and as mines move underground and
the expectation for Wood Mackenzie is that would create an incremental requirement of 2.8 million tons. So when you
look at growth at those levels, declining production from existing mines, there's, over the next 10 years, a 10.4 million
ton shortfall in copper that would need to be made up by expansions, new projects or scrap. And as I mentioned, the top
10 mines only produced 5 million tons last year. So that's just an indication of the longer term needs of the world for
copper and why we believe our company is well positioned to benefit from that and we're focused on that.
Slide 8 shows our unit cost situations. You can see that we were consistent in achieving our objectives. Our
consolidated net cost was $1.50 a pound, showing some benefit of the incremental gold at Grasberg, which has had net
unit cost of $0.81 a pound. Tenke Fungurume in Africa is performing well at approximately $1 a pound cost and our

North American operations are performing well.
You can see the production from our mines by region on the bottom part of this chart. The growth in North America
reflects the ramp-up of Morenci and it is up 40% from last year with our expansion capacity. South America reflects
the sale of Candelaria which is in the last year's numbers and not in this year's numbers and our Cerro Verde fell short
of its production this year for operational reasons but overall a good quarter.
Slide 9, looks at our three major expansion projects that we targeted in 2010 following the financial crisis. We
reviewed our portfolio and identified three major projects to pursue. The Tenke Fungurume Phase II expansion was
started in the second quarter of 2011. It was completed in 2013, meeting our target for capital expenditures and
incremental copper. The Morenci project, the mill expansion, mine expansion there was completed last year. It is
completed perform well and now Cerro Verde is approaching completion. In total, these three projects will add roughly
a billion pounds of copper production for us and involves an aggregate expenditures of just over $7 billion. Very proud
of our project management team and our operations teams for effectively executing these projects.
At Cerro Verde, which is a world class project, make it a world class mine. The detailed engineering and major
procurement is complete. On completion, this will be the mine with the world's largest concentrating facilities, 360,000
tons a day, which is massive and impressive. Construction is advancing on schedule. It's more than 87% complete.
We're preparing to begin commissioning. I'm getting videos daily of pieces of equipment beginning to operate. Our
team there is very excited and highly motivated.
We've been able to work closely with the community in doing this project and have had minimal interruptions from a
labor and virtually none from a community standpoint, adding 600 million pounds of copper per year. We will expect
to complete this on our capital budget. To date, we've incurred about $4 billion and committed to more than that, but
it's going very well.
Slide 11 shows our growing copper production profile for the remainder of 2015. And what we're looking for in 2016,
we will be having increasing production as we go forward into the second half of 2015. So here, we've been working
for a number of years to benefit from these projects by giving us higher volumes and lower costs and that's what we're
achieving. And you can see as we go forward, the impact of that using today's cost levels of declining unit cost for our
company and also declining capital expenditures as we go forward.
An important area of attention for our company has been working with the government of Indonesia in terms of
securing a mutually acceptable agreement on our long-term operating rights. We have in place a contract of work, our
second contract that was signed in Indonesia. But it was a contract that was signed in 1991 that had a 30-year primary
term extending to 2021 and by its terms giving us the rights to two 10-year extensions beyond that, in accordance with
the terms of that contract.
That contract provides us the necessary legal and physical assurance that gives us the confidence to be able to make the
long-term capital investments, and we're investing $15 billion to develop our underground resources to replace the open
pit reserves as it's depleted.
This extension requires approval by the government of Indonesia. But under the contract, that cannot be unreasonably
withheld. We've had discussions now for a number of months with the government on how to deal with our contractual
rights with new mining laws and regulations that have been adopted in the country of Indonesia.
And what we have worked together with the government to do is to find a mutually satisfactory solution that provides
our shareholders the confidence they need for us to continue making investments and also be responsive to the
aspirations of the government in Indonesia and the new mining law regime.
The rights under our contract currently continue until we agree to find a way forward which may involve some
amendments to it. As part of our efforts to be responsive to the government, we are working on developing new
smelting capacity in Indonesia. And we've made significant progress in terms of identifying sites and partnership
arrangements and contract arrangements for that project. That would be in parallel with our resolution of our COW
situation.

We have submitted our application for renewal for our export license for the next six months. And we're making
progress with the government in securing that. We do have a long term record that goes back 40 years now of working
successfully in Indonesia in a positive way in a partnership with the government and local community. Our operations
have been the primary economic driver for development in Papua. And we want to continue to contribute to that and be
part of that as well as providing significant overall benefits to the Indonesian economy. The direct benefits have been
$18 billion over the past seven years. And the split of those benefits have been 60% for the government, 40% for
Freeport.
Our Chairman, Jim Bob Moffett, has been in Indonesia directly involved in discussions with government officials. He
is there now. And Jim Bob, I'd like to turn the call over to you make whatever comments you'd like to make.
James R. Moffett
I'll save any other comments for Q&A, but let me get started with we're making good progress. We expect to get our
export license. We expect to get the kind of assurances renewed for us to continue under our amended COW, which
[inaudible] (21:34-21:38) primary term for 2021 and two 10-year extensions.
So, I'm here trying to make sure that we get this right, since we're talking about 2041 being an important time because
in that period of time, we will be finishing the underground operations and going under the open pit mine and bringing
our deep level mines on production. It becomes the largest underground mine in the world. And as you've seen, we
continue to have great engineering success in Papua. As you've seen from the press clippings, the Minister of Mines has
indicated, has said that all these things are going well. And we hope we can clear this here in the next several days.
Thank you, Richard. I will save the rest of my remarks for the Q&A.
Richard C. Adkerson
All right. Thanks, Jim Bob. Turning to slide 13, operationally, we've completed development of access to these
underground ore bodies which include the Deep MLZ zone which is an extension of our existing producing
underground mine and the development of the Grasberg Block Cave which lies underneath the pit. And we expect the
Deep MLZ to start up late this year, it's on schedule to do that and the Grasberg Block Cave to now begin production in
2018.
The key development activities have been involved with ore flow systems and Grasberg Block Cave shaft.
Development capital to date is totaled $3.3 billion, $2.6 billion net to PT Freeport Indonesia after Rio Tinto's
participation. And our share of underground mine development is expected to average $700 billion a year over the next
five years.
As you can see in the chart below, when the Deep MLZ comes onstream and then the Grasberg Block Cave, both these
mines have very significant positive grades of copper and gold, as does with Grasberg open pit. And we expect after we
move into the underground era to have large volumes of copper and gold, with copper being in the range of 1.1 billion,
1.2 billion, and gold, 1.4 million to 1.5 million ounces annually from 2018 to 2022.
And now, to conclude the opening part of our presentation, I'd like to focus on our really significant inventory
resources on slide 14. Our company has proved reserves, that are based on mine plans of $2 copper, of over 100 billion
pounds. In addition to that, we have mineralized material that is based on $2.20 million copper of an incremental 100
billion pounds, and beyond that, we've identified additional resource potential at our existing mines. These are not
greenfield projects but places where we already have infrastructure footprint, operations of another 170 million pounds.
So we have, as far as we can see in the future, opportunities to invest in growth projects when the market warrants it.
We're going to be very prudent about doing that. And when we can do it in a low-risk basis and use our track record of
successfully doing projects in a consistent way, windows of opportunities warrant themselves and we are working
diligently on looking at the next phase of growth projects as we look forward.

With that, Jim Flores is here to talk about oil and gas business.
James C. Flores
Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I'm on page 15, second quarter 2015 oil and gas highlights. Couple
comments. We've had an excellent quarter operationally both on the operating side but also on the financial side,
getting the S-1 filed for our potential IPO later this year. And that will guide a lot of the restrictions on the comments
I'll be able to make today.
But from the operations standpoint, we focused on low-risk drilling and tieback opportunities. As stated on page 15,
we've been 10 for 10, very successful wells since 2014. This had helped tie in all of our seismic and all the resources
that we capture over the last couple of years in the lease sales and also acquisitions. And now we're enjoying bearing
the fruits of all that labor.
We placed three wells on production here in 2014 second half and first half of 2015 that have really impacted
production. You can see where production's increased in the second quarter over first quarter because of that activity.
Also our cash operating margin has increased mainly due to prices and also lower production cost. And we see our
production cost gone from $20.26 a barrel down to $19.04. That trend is going to continue as we continue to add
volumes to our fixed infrastructure and our fixed cost structure out there.
And when you look at the economics of our business, it's worth noting here that that is one of the key metrics. We look
at our cash operating margin which is in one of the industry-lead cash operating margin from a standpoint because our
cost structure is low but also kind of continue to trend lower. We're forecasting going from $19 to $12 on our LOEs
over the next four to five years as we continue to ramp up production here. And our corporate cost, around $4, we'll
probably be able to cut those in half.
So, when you look at that, our cash margin has got a real opportunity to grow by controlling on the cost side and even
in this low-price environment from there. With our DD&A rate now around $26 going forward, and our F&D cost
below $25 a barrel, we're basically going to be able to earn some money even at this $50 oil price. It'd be much better if
it's $60, $65, but we're tuning our business for the lower oil prices for as long as it takes before they adjust back to
more normalized levels.
Back to the drilling, we've continued to have good success on a lot of tieback wells, going forward, the next 12 months
to 2017. And what investors will get a vision of is as we pile up all these successes, is exactly what the timing of that
production is coming on. And the aspects of being able to build models as far as the value being created with the
drillbit here is quite special.
With Lucius coming on at full rates, a very successful project operated by Anadarko. We have the sister project,
Heidelberg, coming on mid-2016. It's on schedule. And actually, the facility is in place and secured. We've had a
successful well in the Vito basin which is our Power Nap well, and we've already spudded an offset opportunity called
Deep Sleep that we have high hopes for as well.
On page 16, the subsea development tieback strategy that's going to drive a lot of value for our company, our investors,
is off to a great start across the board. At our 100%-owned Holstein well and Horn Mountain facilities, we've actually
drilled and completed a well in each area or a couple wells in each area and have tied back wells into Marlin and also
Horn Mountain. We also have the big Holstein Deep development that we're going to be tying back next year in 2016.
Over the next two years, as we bring these wells on, it's going to require some downtime in each facility, a few weeks
or whatever, to hook them up. And so it will actually be the following 6 to 12 months after that, you'll see full
production response without any platform interruptions as we all get the success turned to the tanks.
And a big key about our strategy in the deepwater that makes us so unique is the timing of these tiebacks, the cycle
time. We're making discoveries and having full-production barrels come on like in Dorado, 3 months. On page 17,
Holstein Deep, 12 to 18 months. And King, 9 to 12 months. This will accelerate going forward as we get the initial

subsea template infrastructure in place as we add wells and flow lines to the subsea connections which will be much
easier than trying to bring them all the way back to the platform.
So we're off and running. The teams are all doing great. And we've overcome any kind of obstacles or challenges so
far. And we look like we have some blue sky ahead as far as doing things on a more repetitive basis and take some of
the risk out of the situation.
And page 18, Lucius, we talked about it, it's been a great discovery we made in 2009. It's up to 80,000 barrels a day. It's
actually processing 400 million cubic feet of gas, but about 100 million cubic feet of that's ours that we have an interest
in. And to 6 subsea wells, water depth is 7,200 feet, really pushing the water depth out there and it's just been a
fantastic project, on time and at cost. The Heidelberg project, it seems to be going just the same. It's moving forward. A
lot of lessons learned at Lucius have helped us at Heidelberg and so forth. And we have a smaller interest there, 12.5%,
but still significant for our 2016 volumes.
When you look on page 19, kind of showing the near-term growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017. From the capital budget we
have now, the production growth is going to be important but muted from 143 MBOE/d, 151 MBOE/d, 173 MBOE/d
because of timing of spending to accelerate the production on wells that we've already drilled. And that's one way we'll
be able to delay CapEx during this low price environment and manage our business.
We filed an S-1 for the IPO. If we raise capital in the IPO to accelerate our business, then you look at the higher
numbers of 143 MBOE/d, 175 MBOE/d and 215 MBOE/d as potential flow rates as we put on wells faster that we've
already drilled here this year than next.
When you look at page 20, it's a sensitivity of what prices do at various production rates. You can plug in whatever you
want in your model and figure out where our cash flows live and so forth, but this – we're obviously planning on our
side operationally for the low end and the rest of the company is hoping for the high end. So you can look at that. You
can see that growing the volumes does matter. It drops right to the bottom line and it's going to be a very significant
part of our business is getting those volumes up to 225 MBOE/d.
As far as helping sustaining that or increasing that from that 225 MBOE/d level is our Atwater Valley area. We entered
this basin post the Vito discovery with an 18.67% interest in the Vito and we subsequently drilled the Power Nap
discovery with a 50% working interest, very excited about that. And now we're drilling the other side of the basin with
our Deep Sleep exploration well and we should be down some time this quarter and hope to be getting results on that
going forward.
On page 22, you can see kind of the pipeline we have built of, we think, a very strong set of projects that we own that
are going to move the needle here at the company, so you can be able to keep track of how we're doing and what
projects going forward. We hope to keep the success rate up and drive these volumes going forward.
Richard, back to you on page 23.

Okay. Thanks, Jim. Just to update our 2015 outlook. Our copper sales outlook is the same as last quarter at 4.2 billion
pounds, gold at 1.3 million ounces for the year, and molybdenum down a couple million pounds and with oil
equivalents at 52.3 million barrels, 67% crude oil. And our unit costs for copper we're not changing at $1.53 per pound,
that will depend on any number of factors including byproduct pricing which is built into here at $1,150 gold and $6
molybdenum for the rest of the year and oil at $19.
That would model out with operating cash flows at $2.50 copper for $3.6 billion. Each $0.10 change in copper for the
remainder of the year is $190 million. Capital expenditures have been reduced by a $200 million as we deduct some
capital in our mining business to $6.3 billion for the year. Our sales profile looking beyond the current year, you can
see the growth in 2016 and 2017 both from our expansion projects but also from the high grades that we'll be having
with our mine plan in Grasberg. You can see that in the gold sales going to 1.9 million ounces and 2.4 million ounces in

2016 and 2017.
On a quarterly basis on slide 25, as I mentioned earlier, we will be having higher volumes of copper in the second half
of the year. Strong gold quarters as we take advantage of the grades that are available to us at Grasberg. And you can
see our outlook quarterly for our oil and gas business and our molybdenum business.
Slide 26 gives the details of our net unit production cost, which consolidates $1.53. But you can see the strong numbers
in Indonesia and Africa and really strong numbers in the Americas as well. And you can see our sales volumes at the
bottom.
On a consolidated basis and looking at cash flows, we have shown here averages for 2016 and 2017 and showing
copper prices ranging from $2.50 to $3.50. And EBITDA numbers at $2.50, copper of $8.5 billion, $11 billion at $3
billion. And then with operating cash flows which would take into account cash taxes, cash interest excluding working
capital changes, so $6.5 billion for $2.50 and $8.3 million for $3.
Sensitivities for that are shown for adjusting that as you see fit on page 28. And then our capital expenditures are shown
on page 29. You can see capital expenditures declining this year from last year and will decline further as we go
forward with basically a constant level of spending under this plan for our oil and gas business and dropping CapEx in
our mining business as we complete our mining projects.
Our board is committed to balance sheet management, and we've got a strong track record of doing that both in good
times and times with weak commodity prices. We're able to do this because of our large resource base, the cash flows
that it generates and our capital discipline.
We have and will continue to take steps to reduce cost and CapEx, look for opportunities to bring values forward
through asset sales. Of course, we have suspended our common stock dividend and look forward to the time when we
can restore that. Our company is committed to returning cash to shareholders. But increasing volumes, declining CapEx
will enhance our credit metrics even in low commodity price environments.
We've talked about looking for external funding in the oil and gas business through this IPO that we'll be considering.
That has to go through an SEC review process, which we are making progress with now. That'll give us the opportunity
to look to go to market here in the second half of the year and for other opportunities that might be there as well.
We have $3 billion of liquidity under our FCX revolver and $0.5 billion under our Cerro Verde facility. Our total debt
at the end of the quarter was $20.9 billion with $500 million of cash. And as I said, we'll be looking forward to
improving the credit metrics.
In conclusion, our three priorities are going to focused in this kind of commodity price environment on protecting our
balance sheet. We'll do that by managing our operation and CapEx to maximize cash flows. We're looking for oil and
gas funding to take advantage of these near term growth opportunities that Jim talked about. Completing, we totally
focused on completing our Cerro Verde project and taking advantage of our expanding operations at Morenci and
Tenke Fungurume, and generating values in the long run from our large resource base. So execution, execution,
execution is our focus during these challenging market conditions.
With that, we would like to open the line for questions.

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go

<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question given the decline across
the board in pricing, I'm wondering are you considering additional asset sales in this environment, i.e., in addition to

the energy IPO?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we're looking at all alternatives. You know, asset sales is potentially one, other
alternatives will be dialing back some of our operations to reflect the economics of the current environment. For
example, we're doing that in our molybdenum business where prices are weak. We benefit in that marketplace because
of our really strong position. 80% of the market, right Mike, of the chemical business, to focus on that where
realizations are higher. But we may limit molybdenum production in some of our byproduct operations in response to
prices.
In 2008, we curtailed production at high cost mines to reduce cost and we're looking at that. Presently, all of our mines
are positive cash flow generators. But if markets deteriorate further, we're prepared to take steps to be responsive to
that.
So Dave, we're looking across the board at opportunities. Asset sales in the mining business are a possibility. The
market's not great as you can see from recent transactions. And with our long-term positive view of the marketplace,
that will be taken into account. But all things like that are on the table and under consideration.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. My follow-up, on Indonesia, I had – it's a two-part
question. First of all, on the export permit, can you talk us through in the event that it's not renewed, what does happen
there given what's happened previously? And then the second part of that question, any other dates that we need to be
thinking about for Indonesia? I thought there was a labor contract coming due at some point in 2015. That's it.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Let me start with the labor contract. In Indonesia we have to negotiate new
labor contracts every two years. That's by law. And so, we do have our existing contract expiring in the second half in
the third quarter. And so we're engaged in negotiations with the union now and all reports are that those negotiations
are going well and we expect to get that contract renewed as we did with our last contract. And actually, as I
mentioned, labor relations at our operations are really good right now, are positive. With the export permit, we expect
that to be renewed. We've met the requirements of the government, and then we're going through the process of
working with the government to get that done as we speak. So, we expect to get it renewed.
It is important to us at the present time. Without the export permit, of course, we can't export. And right now, the PT
smelter at Gresik has faced an operational issue that's requiring some repairs and it's currently shut down. So, it's
important to us to get this export permit. We believe we've got a process going that will allow us to do that. It's not in
anybody's interest – the government, communities, workers, of course, our shareholders – for that not to be renewed.
We expect it to be renewed.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Thanks, Dave.

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thanks very much. Hi, everyone. I wanted to also focus on the cash burn and just to follow up
on Dave's question a little bit. And I was very pleased to hear you, Richard, mention about throttling back possibly in
the production side and asset sales as well. Do you have any further flexibility in terms of capital spending? And also,
what about the possible equity issuances beyond an oil and gas IPO? How would you view those other – or are they
options?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, as I said, all options are on the table. None of us want to sell equity at this stock
price. I mean, that's not something that any of us, as shareholders and, as you know, we're all shareholders, would want
to do. Ultimately, the board is going to protect the balance sheet, so we're going to look at all options and see what we
might need to do.

As we look forward in running our business, we are going to be prepared to act to be consistent with what the market
brings to us. So if, in fact, prices do deteriorate, we have flexibility in our business to cut certain costs, both in the
mining and in the oil and gas business, and we'll have contingency plans that allow us to do that. So, we are optimistic
about markets longer run, prepared to deal with short run's uncertainty, prepared to bridge our business if we have to do
it and operationally we have the capability of doing it. And Tony, I know I don't need to remind you just how effective
we were in doing that in 2008 and 2009.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: I think that would be well received if that was possibly joined in terms of efforts to throttle
back on output because the market surplus, at least what the consultants are saying right now, might not be that much
out of whack and if there were some movement sooner rather than later, it might help the market from getting too far
out of whack. I think that would be well received.
The other question I had was on Indonesia, and there's some reports that have indicated recently that you guys have
agreed to a transition from a COW to a special mining license. And I guess, first, are these reports accurate? And what
would – if you could help us understand what the main differences might be between the COW and this special mining
license. Would the new license arrangement, would it afford you similar levels of protection or might it be more subject
to more frequent changes? Is there anything you can comment on at this point?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: There has been a wide range of options that have been discussed with the government
and different ideas have been raised for consideration at different times. There has not been a decision to convert from
the contract to a mining license. If that were to be done, and I'm not suggesting that that's likely, but if that were to be
done, it would be done on the basis of having an accompanying contract that would give us the kinds of assurances on
fiscal terms and legal terms that we would require. So that's what we're really focused on is how do we have a
preservations of our rights to operate beyond the primary term of our existing COW. It has a 20-year provision for
continued operations.
And then to ensure that the terms fiscally and legally that we have beyond the COW through an extension of the COW,
give us that degree of assurance. And we've indicated a degree of flexibility in working with the government so long as
that's achievable. Achieving that within the framework of the existing laws and regulations in the country is
complicated. And probably the most straightforward way would be to find a way of reaching a mutual agreement on
continuing the COW. But we've expressed that we would be flexible in dealing with that so long as we could achieve
our fundamental objectives of assurance about operating rights, fiscal terms, legal enforceability for the long run.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Is an additional sell-down of the stake in PT-FI – is that also part and parcel, part of these
discussions as well?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Absolutely. I mean, a year ago, we signed a memorandum of understanding that covered
six points that we indicated we'd be prepared to go forward with in conjunction with achieving the continued rights to
operate with the assurance of terms that I just mentioned.
And one of those is that we agreed that we would agree to sell an incremental interest in PT-FI's equity to get up to a
30% Indonesian ownership. Right now, the government owns 9.36%. We agreed to do that provided we had the
extension of our contract under acceptable terms and that that would be done at fair market value. But that was part of
the memorandum of understanding that we've had with the government now for roughly a year.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Right. Understood. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Just a follow-up question on Tony's on Grasberg and the contract. Is it your
understanding that – or the company's understanding that you will not go forward without some type of whether a
COW, hybrid between the COW and a licensing agreement, but that one provision that you need is some certainty of
operations through 2041?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. That's right, Mike. Because right now, more than 75% of our reserves are going to
be produced after 2021. And so these investments that we're making right now to develop the underground and we've
agreed to develop smelting capacity, all of that is for the benefit of operations beyond 2021.
So we need to have those rights under acceptable terms to justify the investments that we've already made and the
continued investments. And the government understands that and that's what we're working to deal with. And the
complication has been how you do that in the context of the current laws and regulations in Indonesia, and how that
interrelates to our contractual rights, but that's a necessary element.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: I mean, what's the government's response when you tell them that your contract that
you signed back in 1991 supersedes any changes in Indonesian government law?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: There is an issue with the public perception of how does the contract interact with the
laws. The legal situation is clear-cut. And so we have opted – and I really believe this is the right answer, and Jim Bob
and our board support it, is that we will be much better suited if we can find a way of dealing with this in a cooperative
fashion that is responsive to the public opinion and aspirations of the government rather than just digging our heels in
and saying the contract is the contract.
You know, Mike, we've been through this before in other countries and other places. And so that's what we're trying to
do. We're trying to achieve our objectives in a way that's cooperative, that preserves the partnership, and that is
sensitive to government officials who are subject to elections and the democratic process. They have to be sensitive to
public opinion, just like our guys here.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Mike, this is Jim Bob. Let me just comment on a couple of things. As you've seen in the
press in the last couple of days, the government has indicated that they're going to extend our contract and they're going
to do give us the export license. We and they are talking because, as a matter of fact, when the MOU expires on July
25, two days from now, the COW, the company controlling document, and that COW other than the few amendments
we've agreed to is still in force and effect through 2021.
And the reason that language is still in force and effect, as you've seen from some of the government announcements, it
basically says that we have not changed anything and the reason that we [indiscernible] (54:19-54:21) is before we
make any kind of concessions or the government makes any kind of concessions, we're trying to end up with a win-win
situation. And that's where this thing's headed.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: One last question on Grasberg. On slide 29 of your presentation today, where you
talk about the CapEx for the company going through 2017. I'm assuming that does not include any assumptions for a
new smelter in Indonesia? Is that correct?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's correct, Mike. The new smelter would involve an aggregate investment of $2
billion to $2.5 billion. And we are working on a structure that would involve project financing for it, as we did with the
smelter that we built in the mid-1990s, and also the potential involvement of other partners in it. But that is not
included in our CapEx numbers.
The bulk of that CapEx will be spent beyond 2016-2017 because we'll do substantial work between now and then, but a
lot of that work will be done on site preparation. There's substantial amount of reclamation of land in preparation of the
building sites because this will be located in Eastern Java, in the Gresik area near our existing smelter and the fertilizer
operation of Petrokimia Gresik, the state-owned fertilizer company.

<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: From the estimated $2 billion to $2.5 billion cost and then using, as you said,
bringing in partners, project financing, how low can you get that down to for Freeport? Can you get it down to $0.5
billion?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me do some calculations in my head. I was going to just answer you as low as we
can get it. I mean, we're going to do it as low as we can get it. If we say – yeah. That could be in that range. Now, also
not included, Mike, is also the proceeds that would come to us from these divestments that we talked about. I mean,
we're talking about a substantial value for just over a 20% interest in PT-FI, and that would occur over time. But those
proceeds are also not included in our outlook numbers.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Thanks. I've also got a question on Indonesia, Richard. I think in the past, you guys have laid
out numbers about the financial benefits to Indonesia under the COW, and then under the new mining laws. And as you
guys are going through the discussions, if we look at the possible financial impact. If you were to switch under the new
mining laws, is it still correct that financially there would not be a material impact between royalties, tax rates and other
pieces to those?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. Well, when they talk about going to the new mining law, they are insisting that we
continue with our current 35% income tax rate which is higher than the general income tax rate in Indonesia of 25%.
Beginning last year, we agreed to pay the higher royalties under the mining law to get the export ban out of the way.
So, the financial impact right now would be essentially the same that we've had under the COW. The issue for us is to
fix these terms, so that we would not be subject to imposing incremental taxes, import fees, either by – duties, either by
the central government or the provincial government.
So, we haven't been arguing about increasing fiscal terms for the government. We've all kind of agreed on that. The
issue for us is, okay, we agree to this, this is what we live with going forward and not be subject to potential imposition
of new taxes, royalties, duties and fees by the succeeding governments over a long term. And when you look at our deal
with Indonesia where the government now gets 60% of the financial benefits, that's stronger than anywhere else in the
world. By international standards, this is a very positive deal for the government of Indonesia.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. And second question, maybe switching topics, page 19 where you have outlined the
potential growth on the energy assets. What's the incremental capital that would be required to get to the 215 barrels per
day? And then along those same lines, I think it was commented that you would do it only if the IPO is successful.
Would you have to raise more than what's required to bridge existing free cash flow shortfall? Or is there some number
that we can guide to or you can guide us to to figure out when you might go forward with the more accelerated rate?
<A - James C. Flores>: I think, Brian – this is Jim. I think the question is one and the same, right? It's what the capital
it's going to take to get to 215 barrels, that's the whole purpose of doing the IPO. It's somewhere between $1.2 billion
and $1.6 billion depending on how we time everything of additional proceeds to get there. So it depends on how much
money we raise in the IPO and what percentage of the company we want to sell as to how fast we accelerate.
But it's strictly about that lay of flow lines and umbilicals and hooking up wells that are already drilled. So it's just
timing of capital. So if we don't hit 2015 – if we only raise $500 million and we want to phase in the spending, and we
want to hit 215 barrels in 2018, we can time that as well. So just give you – we got a lot of flexibility as to how much
we raise and how much and how fast we spend it. But that's – to support this plan, it's between $1.2 billion and $1.6
billion. Does that answer your question?
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Yeah, I think kind of. So, if I understand correctly, if the funds, let's say that the IPO were to
go through, whatever funds would be raised would be targeted towards growing production, not necessarily bridging

the existing free cash flow shortfall? Is that correct?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, the aspect of that, it would allow us to spend that money earlier, it gets production up
and you would have a lot less free cash flow shortfall with 215,000 to 225,000 barrels a day. And therefore, your free
cash flow shortfall would be a lot smaller.

Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. And just staying with oil and gas, if we may.
Jim, you commented that you can get your operating cost in your oil and gas operations down to $12 BOE. What level
of production would you need to get to those with that number?
<A - James C. Flores>: About 250,000 barrels a day. And the key about that, Oscar, is where that production comes
from. When it comes up from our existing 100%-owned platforms, that has the highest or the most dramatic impact
lowering the LOE costs, obviously. Because we're just doing division there with higher volumes versus the same cost
structure. And that's where we're focused, all our dollars.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. And then got to ask a question on Grasberg. There's a comment on your press release
that says that you may reduce or defer investment activity, pending negotiations on the amendment of the contract of
work. Would you just put context around that? Would this be if there's no resolution by the July 25 deadline, how are
you thinking about this?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The comment is just a statement of fact that without resolution of the long-term
situation, we would be faced with discontinuing spending money for that long-term production need. And so that's what
we've been trying to avoid that's not in our interest, our workforce's interest, the local community's interest or the
government's interest. So that's just a consequence of what would happen if we have a failure at getting this resolved.
We believe we'll get it resolved. As Jim Bob said, the government is saying we're going to get it resolved. So that's –
we believe that's what will happen. And so far, we continue to progress our development activity based on our
confidence that we'll get it resolved.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Thanks for that, Richard. And just one more thing, if I may. In your development CapEx
of $3.3 billion, that increased a little bit from the previous quarter and in some of the projects of development projects
around the world, CapEx has been coming down. Is there any reason for the increase? Anything to do with the
metallurgy or something that's happening in the underground that's increasing the CapEx there?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Oscar, are you referring to $3.3 billion that we've incurred to date or what number are you
referring to?
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: This is the slide where you quote the amount of money that you're spending per year. So $700
million now was $600 million last quarter?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. There was some timing changes in some of the underground spend. And it worked
out from a rounding standpoint to get from $600 million to $700 million, but there was no material change in any of the
plans. And the progress on the underground development continues to go very well in us achieving what we have set
out to achieve in terms of the development.
But there has been no significant changes from last quarter, just some timing things that came into the five years and
some rounding changes.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go
ahead.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you very much for the generous call and the length of the call and accepting my
question. Concerning the Grasberg contract negotiations, is there any guidance concerning the proceeds from the
government stepping up to 20%? Will FCX get any cash to make a dent in the debt, or would that be financed by an
earnout or a loan from FCX to the government?
And secondly, could you talk a little bit about the $1.2 billion mining CapEx budgeted for projects for 2017? Does that
equal $0.7 million for Grasberg underground, and then what would the other pieces of it be? And thirdly, could you tell
us what are the bigger bites in the $2.9 billion oil and gas CapEx, say, in 2017?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Let's start with the questions in order that you raised them. On divestiture, there's
a process that is established in Indonesia of where incremental interest would first be offered to the government, as you
suggested. It would not be all at one time but it would be done in steps. And any transaction, John, with the government
would be a cash transaction where we would not be providing financing. If the government opts not to buy the shares
itself, and that may well occur, we have talked with the government about the possibility of having an IPO of PT-FI
shares on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. And that would be a standard IPO that would be syndicated and we would
receive the cash proceeds from that.
We've also talked about the possibility of having some interest, certainly not 20% interest but some smaller piece of
that, perhaps going to the provincial government in some sort of trust form and we might provide some financing for
that piece. Otherwise, other Indonesian investors might have an interest in doing it and those would be on a cash
business-to-business type basis.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: John, it's Kathleen. The second part of your question regarding...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let's see, John, does that cover...
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: I was just going to say, on the CapEx, in addition to the underground development spend,
we also have $200 million for the smelter expansion at Miami. And then, we've also got in our plans to commence the
stripping for the Lone Star project which would extend the life of – Lone Star oxides which will extend the life of
Safford. So we've got some stripping costs reflected in 2017 as well, and those are the three major components of that
number.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.
<A - James C. Flores>: All right. John, on the oil and gas side – this is Jim – you've got about $1.7 million in Marlin,
Horn Mountain and Holstein, which is our three key projects. Most of that – about half of it in Horn Mountain and the
second half split between Marlin and Holstein. Spend about $300 million in California, and about $650 million in the
Vito Basin, and then $100 million at Lucius and another $90 million in our gas business.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.
<A - James C. Flores>: And then you've got a corporate allocation of about $220 million on top of that to get you up
to the $2.9 million.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Hi. Good morning. Sorry to go back to Grasberg again because I had the same question
John did. So just so I understand this, if you did a provincial thing, it might be like the [indiscernible] (01:10:39) was
done in the past, so that's the only piece that you would actually potentially provide financing, and then the rest would
just be either sell down to whoever, either the government or someone else, where at that time you would get cash in.
And if that didn't work, that's when you'd go to the public markets and just take whatever the valuation was at the time?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No. And this is still a work in progress, Brian. But we and government officials for some
time have seen the benefit of the public market listing that would – first of all, Indonesia's Stock Exchange has
developed into a actively traded fair marketplace. And we all see mutual benefits of having PT-FI listed as an
Indonesian company on that exchange, provided we get a fair market value which we could in that marketplace. So we
think that would probably be something that we would pursue with the government following the government's
decision on its own desires for investing in the shares itself.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Okay. So really the concept of just giving money to the provincial [indiscernible]
(01:12:00) is probably very low on it. So you're really thinking about any way you do it, it would be cash in the door
right away at the time?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: For the bulk of what we're talking about. For community relation situations and again to
be responsive to the aspirations of the province, we can see some benefits of working on a structured deal with the
province from that standpoint for a portion of this interest. But that all has to remain to be worked out. The province
has indicated to us they might provide third-party financing for that. We and the central government want to ensure that
if we do a deal with the province, it benefits the people of the province itself and not any third-party investors, so all of
that has to be factored in to the process.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Yeah. Thanks. Did I hear Jim Bob right that you guys expect to reach an agreement on a contract
of work and also those permits in the next couple of days?
<A - James R. Moffett>: Yeah, that's exactly right. Let me just review the Dow Jones clip that came out yesterday,
7/22/15. [inaudible] (01:13:28-01:13:40). It talks about the investment that we're going to be making if we increase and
extend the contract for another 20 years. This is quoted from the minister. [inaudible] (01:13:52) had said earlier the
government of Indonesia does not have any intention to terminate the contract after 2021.
So, the government and we both are trying to get the agreement finalized. And if you go down to the next clip which is
7/22/15, [ph] Indonesia Finance Today (01:14:15), which is a Bloomberg announcement, it says from the minister once
again, do not forget that Freeport shale has a valid contract until 2021. The president said prepare for an investment, not
to cut ties. So the answer is, the reason why I'm trying to measure my words is when you're in negotiations, it's very
hard on a call like this to talk about the negotiation.
[indiscernible] (01:14:56) on public statements, you've seen that the government [inaudible] (01:15:02) that they want
us to continue. And we obviously have every reason to continue under proper terms. And the proper terms are going to
be we need to get [indiscernible] (01:15:13) as we said, continuously that the contract that we're currently [inaudible]
(01:15:19-01:15:27) or COW. We need to have the same [inaudible] (01:15:31). And that's why I'm staying here to
make sure that we accomplish that.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Yes. Hello. Just going back to slide 19 and whether or not you go through with the
incremental, I think you said $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in CapEx to potentially accelerate drilling. Is this more about
kind of how much money you might raise in an IPO or more about where oil prices are or a combination of both?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, yeah. This will be our – me and my team started IPO, it's about to solicit funds and to
attract investors. They've got to get a return for that new capital coming in the door. So the aspect that's going to have a
growth component, but what we're basically able to do is accelerate putting these wells on and create more cash flow
for the company going forward. I think the investors will have a positive look on oil prices longer term irrespective of
what oil prices are at the time of the IPO. I mean, in their kind of sense, lower is better because it's higher in the future.
And so, the aspect of that is if you look at higher volumes and better prices, I mean, by 2017, cash flow neutral is a
reality. If you look at lower prices longer and higher volumes, you're going to push that out to 2018.
So it's really going to be how you look at the business and your viewpoint going forward as far as what the investor
appetite is. When it comes to size, we can sell up to 19.9% of the business and still achieve our objectives here at
Freeport. So if we sell 8% of the business, 10%, 12%, 15% based on price and that amount of capital will regulate how
our business will be run going forward to make sure we get into a cash neutral situation.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe, is there a potential update on timing of when you
might look to do this?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, we're still hoping this fall. Like Richard said, it's up to the SEC. We've moved back and
forth with our document and we're making progress there. And so, everything looks like it's on track to be available.
And obviously market conditions are going to be something we're going to be watching. So I think we'll be actual this
fall, I guess is an answer.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Great. Thanks very much and good luck.
