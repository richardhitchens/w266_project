MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by. Welcome to today's American Express First Quarter 2011
Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer

With that, I'd like to turn today's call over to our host, Mr. Ron Stovall, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations.
Please go ahead, sir.
Ronald C. Stovall

In the first quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are
now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP
financial measures used by the company, and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to
review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review
some key points related to the quarter's earnings with a series of slides included in the earnings documents distributed,
and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will
announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask
questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do
have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Daniel T. Henry
Okay, thanks, Ron. So, let's start on slide 2, summary of financial information. So, total revenues net of interest
expense was $7 billion, up 7%, compared to last year. And that's 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Income was $1.177
billion, up 33% from the prior year. EPS was $0.97, and return on equity was 28%. So, revenues, while not robust,
were an improvement from 4% growth in the fourth quarter, and are better than what we see in the industry.
So let's go to slide 3, metrics. We'll start off, billed business. So, billed business was up 17% on a recorded basis, 15%
on an FX adjusted basis. So, this is the fifth straight quarter that we've had build business in the 15% range. And the
first quarter of 2011 is the strongest first quarter in billings in American Express's history, both on a reported and an FX
basis. Looking at cards in force, it's up 5%. We had growth in GNS of 14%, and in the U.S. Consumer and Small
Business group, growth of 2%.
Average basic cardmember spending continued to be strong at 13% growth on an FX adjusted basis, and cardmember
loans were flat basically with last year as loans have stabilized, which is a positive. Worldwide travel sales is really
being driven by air sales, a combination of both higher average price and a higher number of transactions, and we're
seeing that both in the corporate business, and the consumer business.
So we move to slide 4, so this is billed business growth by segment. And as you can see by the chart, we continue to
have strong growth across all of our segments. The U.S. Consumer and Small Business group grew 13%; the
International Consumer business on an FX adjusted basis was 10%; Global Commercial Services 17%; and GNS 24%,
for a total of 15%.
If we move to slide 5, this is billed business growth by region. And again, as you can see on the chart, all geographies
are having strong growth. In the U.S., growth was 15%; in EMEA on a FX adjusted basis, 10%; JPAA, which is Asia,
on an FX adjusted basis was 18%. Now, within there is Japan, and the growth rate in Japan has declined. We've seen an
impact on inbound business, but we still have double-digit growth in the Japanese market. And Latin America and
Canada grew 16%.
So if we move to slide 6, so this is lending billed business, compared to – and, as well as managed loan growth. So,
spending on lending products, as you know, is no longer correlated with the growth in loans. And this is due to the fact
that we are focused on premium lending. We've significantly reduced balance transfers, and there's been a change in
cardmember behavior since the recession.
Now if you looked at the lending trust, you would see that paydown rate continued to increase. So, in March of 2011,
the paydown rate was 30.4%, and that compares to March of 2010 when it was 27%. As you can also see from the
chart, as I mentioned before, the loan balances have stabilized.
So next we move to slide 7, so this is U.S.CS net interest yield. Now, historically, prior to 2009, the net interest yield
was generally in the high 8% to 9% range. In anticipation of the CARD Act, we increased prices and you can see that

reflected in the bars related to 2009, as well as the first quarter of 2010. As the Credit CARD Act became effective,
yields as we expected have started to migrate back towards historical levels. But in this quarter the yield was 9.1%,
compared to 10% in the first quarter of 2010. So, this decrease is resulting in a decrease in net interest income.
So moving to slide 8, which is our revenue performance, we see that discount revenue is at 14%. Held billed business
was at 17%. And some of the factors contributing to the 14% growth was the fact that GNS billed business is growing
faster than the average as we've discussed before. Billed business on GNS is lower than on proprietary business. Also
we have a number of contra revenue items, including corporate incentive payments, partner payments, and cash back
rewards, which are deductions from discount revenue.
Now the discount rate stands at 2.55%, the same level as last year, which is very good. Now, as we know going
forward, as the mix of our billings changes to more everyday spend, we would expect the discount rate to decline.
However, over the past three years, it's held up very well.
If we look at net card fees, you can see it's up 3%. We actually had an adjustment in the first quarter of $10 to $11
million. So, excluding that, it's relatively flat. If we look at travel commissions and fees, up 18%, that's really being
driven by air sales, as I discussed on a prior page.
Now other commissions and fees are up 6%. And here we have foreign exchange conversion revenue, increasing based
on higher spend. We also have one month of Loyalty Partner revenue, and that's offset by lower delinquency fees.
If we look at other revenues, which is up 12%, we have higher GNS partner royalty revenues, higher merchant-related
fee revenues, higher foreign exchange fees, and higher global prepaid revenues. And net interest income is down as our
loans are flat, and the yields that we just discussed are lower.
If we move to slide 9, so this is provision for losses. So, charge card, the write-off rate in the first quarter of this year is
the same as last year. Receivables are about 11% higher. Now, the charge card provision is a little lower here, as we
had a modest build in reserves in the first quarter of 2010, and a modest reduction or reserve release in the first quarter
of 2011. So, charge card, as you know, has performed very well during the recession, and now that we're in a recovery
period.
Now looking at lending, provision is $800 million lower year-over-year. It was $688 million in the first quarter of
2010, and there's actually a credit of $120 million in the first quarter of this year. Now, there are two factors: one is
lower write-off rates, and the second is a larger reserve release. So, the write-off rate in the first quarter of 2010 was
7%, and the write-off rate in the first quarter of this year is 3.7%. So, write-off dollars in the period are about $600
million lower.
In the first quarter of 2010, we had a reserve release of $485 million, and in the first quarter of this year, we have a
reserve release of about $700 million, so $200 million greater. So, credit continues to improve. We're improving faster
than the industry, and write-offs are below historical levels.
Next I'll move to slide 10. So, here in the beginning, I'll basically talk to the first three columns on the left-hand side,
the comparison of the first quarter of '11 to the first quarter of 2010. Now, we do have total growth in expenses of 19%,
and that's a combination of what I'll call business-as-usual expenses, one item in rewards, which I'll explain in a minute,
plus we're investing to build our business momentum going forward. And that's really being enabled by the strong
billed business volumes, improving credit, as well as the Visa and MasterCard payments we receive.
So we can see here that marketing and promotion is up 15% year-over-year, and I'll discuss this in a little bit more
detail on the next slide. At the moment, I'll skip the rewards line, but we'll come back to it. Salaries and employee
benefits increased 15%. Employees are up about 3,300 from last year, or about 6%. We had an increase of about 1,400
employees, compared to the fourth quarter. 600 of those relate to Loyalty Partners, and we've had increases in
technologies, enterprise growth, as well as world service. It also reflects merit increases, higher benefit-related costs
and increase in incentive-related compensation accruals.
Next we'll look at professional services, which increased 18%. This includes technology consulting on development
projects, higher external sales agents in Global Merchant Services, and higher legal fees, some related to the DoJ suit

and some related to our acquisitions. Other is up primarily related to some accounting related to some foreign exchange
and interest hedges, which I'll talk about on a later slide.
The other thing I'd point out at this juncture is the fourth column, which is really showing the change in expenses in the
first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter. And I'd draw your attention to marketing and promotion, which is actually
down 15% from the fourth quarter, as well as professional services, which is 27% lower than the fourth quarter. So,
here we see expenses trending down from where we were in the fourth quarter.
So let me talk to cardmember rewards expense, which is up 27%. Now, a portion of this is simply the 15% growth that
we see in spending by cardmembers. The other part relates to the Membership Rewards program. We continue to
improve the Membership Rewards program and its value proposition. We've recently added a number of new
redemption options, including Amazon and certain other digital redemption options. We are seeing greater customer
engagement by the current program participants, which is reflected in an increase in redemption patterns.
Now as I've said in the past, higher redemptions and higher customer engagement is positive from a business
perspective. Cardmembers who are active redeemers spend more, attrite less, and we have a higher share of their
wallet. This program is attractive from both a cardmember and shareholder perspective. We continue to refine our
estimation process for the calculation of the ultimate redemption rate.
These refinements are captured in the recent increase in redemption patterns by our current program participants. This
resulted in our estimate of the ultimate redemption rate for current participants increasing from 91% at the end of last
year to 92% in the first quarter of 2011, which resulted in an increase in the MR reserve of $188 million. Going
forward, we will continue to refine the ultimate redemption estimation process as cardmember behaviors in the
program evolve.
So next I'll move to slide 11. Now, here we continue to have high levels of marketing, which again has been enabled by
strong cardmember spending, improved credit, and Visa and MasterCard payments. And while the last quarter of 2011
is lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, we are above historic levels and 15% higher than the first quarter of 2010.
The areas we're spending on in the U.S. Consumer and Small Business area are acquisition of charge and premium
lending cardmembers, and loyalty investments, including partner payments. In International Consumer, it's focused on
acquisition and loyalty spend stimulation, and in Global Merchant Services, it's a combination of contractual merchant
payments, merchant loyalty spend, perception of coverage, and brand advertising.
Moving to slide 12, so here we're going to discuss a number of investments that are recorded in operating expense.
Operating expense, which we're basically excluding marketing and rewards, increased 16%, 14% on an FX adjusted
basis. And you can see that support functions and Global Services are growing more slowly than the average. Now,
above the average are three bubbles that are growing as a function of the investments that we're making to drive future
business momentum. So, we look at the upper left, we see new business initiatives, and here we're focusing on driving
fee revenue. It includes investments in Loyalty Edge, Online and Mobile, Accertify, Loyalty Partners and Business
Insights.
If we look at the next item, it's sales force investments both in commercial card, and the merchant business. If we look
all the way to the right, we see variable technology investments, and these are technology investments to develop
technology solutions in both our core business, as well as our digital advancements.
Now there are two other bullets. One simply has to do with spending for bank holding company and Basel II regulatory
requirements. The other has to do with accounting for our debt and FX hedges. Now, here I may give you more
information than you actually want, but our FX hedges are functioning as designed. So, what we want to do is basically
lock in our U.S. dollar net income.
So in the first quarter of 2011, the U.S. dollar weakened. As a result, revenues and expenses are higher; therefore, net
income is higher. And in this case, we actually pay on the hedge until it's an expense. In the first quarter of 2010, the
opposite happened. The U.S. dollar strengthened; therefore, we reported lower revenues and expenses, and therefore,
net income. In that case we actually received a payment, which is a credit on this expense line.

The other item is our hedge on our fixed rate debt, where we convert – have a hedge that converts to fixed rate debt to
floating. And again, this hedge is functioning exactly as we intend. Accounting requires us to mark this to market, so in
some periods we have an expense; some items we have a credit. So, again here in 2011, we have a debit. Last year we
had a credit. Now, these mark to marks at the end been net to zero, and so there's no economics to it. I went through
this long explanation because a combination of these things actually had a negative year-over-year effect of $50
million.
So now moving to slide 13, so this is expense flexibility over time. So, these are expenses excluding provision, and
they're expenses as a percentage of total revenue net of interest expense. Now, we recognize that we are currently at
elevated expense levels, and again, this is being funded by improved credit and Visa and MasterCard payments.
Now that it's likely that the benefit in credit provision from credit reserve releases will diminish going forward, and the
Visa and MasterCard settlement payments will phase out in the second quarter, those are the MasterCard payments,
which are $150 million per quarter, and the fourth quarter, which are the Visa payments of $70 million a quarter. As a
result of that, we are – as we go forward, we're moving forward with plans to slow the growth in our operating expense
toward the end of this year and into 2012. So, we would expect this percentage to move down as we go forward.
So next is slide 14. So, this is charge card credit performance, and here we can see that U.S.CS write-off rates are the
same in the first quarter of this year as they were last year. In International Consumer and Global Commercial Services,
we can see that they've been pretty consistent over the last several quarters. The higher amount in the first quarter of
2010 reflected a refinement in the calculation. So, we would expect these metrics to tick up somewhat over time as we
continue to grow our business.
Moving to slide 15, lending net write-off rate. So, here both the U.S., and the international write-off rate continue to
improve. And as you know, our write-off rates started to improve before the industry. And as we've said, we moved
sooner in terms of credit actions, our actions have been very effective, and we have a higher quality base. So, our
write-off rate is now at 3.7%, the lowest in the industry. So, the write-offs in the first quarter were $541 million, which
is about $500 million lower than what they were in 2010.
So moving to slide 16, this is lending 30-day past due, and you can see that we continue to have improvement in the
U.S., and it has stabilized in international. These are at historical lows. So, I'd would point out that our objective is not
to have the lowest possible write-off rate for 30-day past due levels, but to make good economic decisions to drive
profitable growth.
So slide 17 is a slide we've looked at in terms of helping us think where we're going, going forward. Here I'd start on
the right-hand side, so you can see the number of bankruptcies are down notably in the first quarter for us, and this is
consistent with the trend seen in the industry. Regarding bankruptcies, I'd also point out that the average dollar amount
of each bankruptcy has been decreasing, and approximately two-thirds of all bankruptcies reported to us, we've already
written the account off.
So now looking at the chart on the upper left, and we've used this in the past year or so to be helpful, so here if you look
on that upper left chart and look at the green triangles, so these are the balances that rolled from current to past due in
August through September of 2010. And they will write off five months later if they remain delinquent, and they wrote
off in the first quarter of 2011.
Next to the green triangles, if you look at the next three blue triangles, they are lower than the green triangles. So, if the
30-day past due write-off, it's a write-off, which is on the bottom chart, remains constant, and early write-offs or
recoveries are unchanged, the second quarter 2011 write-offs would be lower than the write-offs we had in the first
quarter of 2011.
The other item that I'd point out on this chart are the next two blue triangles, which are the last two blue triangles, are
flat with the prior triangle. Now, looking at the bottom chart, the 30-day past due to write-off rate, so through March,
this past due write-off rate is – remains pretty consistent with the recent prior periods.

Let me go now to slide 18, so this is a new chart. It's worldwide lending reserve releases. And if you look across the
top, you'll see the amount of reserve releases, the dollar amount of reserve releases each quarter. And this indicates that
in the first quarter of 2011, we released $700 million. Now, if we look at the bars, the light blue bars are the dollar
amount of write-offs in the respective quarters. The dark blue bars are provision. So, it's write-offs less reserve releases
give you provision.
So it's important to realize that the improvement in provision has both been a combination of lower write-offs, and the
reserve releases. So, if you use the first quarter of 2010 as an example, you can see that the write-offs were about $1.2
billion, reserve releases were $500 million, and so the provision was about $700 million. And that ties back to slide
number 9.
If we look at the first quarter of 2011, we actually have a credit in lending provision, and that's because the reserve
release of $700 million is larger than the write-offs in the quarter, which were approximately $600 million. We would
expect the write-off rate to remain below historical levels in the near future. Although I would note that if you went
back to the first quarter of 2010, our reserves for loans stood at $5.3 billion, and at the end of the first quarter of 2011,
it's $2.9 billion. So, going forward, we would expect reserve releases to diminish.
If we go to slide 19, these are lending reserve ratios – coverage ratios. And as credit metrics have improved, our
lending reserve coverage has started to come down, and you can see that in U.S. Card, as well as worldwide. Reserves
as a percentage of past due and principal month coverage have also ticked down. And, although we had reserve releases
of $700 million in the quarter, our reserve coverage remains at appropriate levels.
Next is slide 20, capital ratios. You can see our Tier 1 common is 11.8%, compared to 11.1% in the fourth quarter. So,
this increase is primarily driven by lower risk weighted assets. So, it reflects the seasonal change in loan balances,
which have declined, as well as there was certain cash that was considered restricted cash in the fourth quarter. It is
now free cash. Those were the two main drivers.
These ratios continue to be strong. I would point out that we do not plan to maintain the Tier 1 common ratio above
11%. Our target is to have it between 10% and 11%. I'd note here that we plan to restart our share repurchase in the
second quarter.
Now if the Basel III guidelines were implemented in the first quarter of 2011, we would estimate that it would reduce
our ratio by about 80 basis points. And that compares to an estimate we had in the fourth quarter of about 50 basis
points. And that's just really a refinement in the calculation that we've made as we continue to gain a broader
understanding and quite frankly, some of the factors quarter-to-quarter will change.
So moving to slide 21, our liquidity snapshot, we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the
next 12 months of funding maturities, which is our stated objective. Now, we're somewhat above that in the first
quarter and that's because Personal Savings, our direct deposit program, actually was somewhat stronger than we
expected.
And we can see that on the next slide, slide 22, so this is a summary of our U.S. retail deposit program. And you can
see that the direct deposits increased by $3.4 billion in the first quarter. And you also see third party CDs declined by
$1.9 billion. And on those CDs, the weighted average remaining maturity is about 19.5 months.
Now we don't expect direct deposit growth to continue at this level over the balance of the year. In fact, what happened
is we kind of got stuck in the one or two position on the rate table, which is not what we want. However, we had sent
out marketing materials, and when others dropped their rates, we didn't want to drop our rates right on the heels of
sending out marketing materials. We have moved our rate down on the HYSes from 1.3% to 1.5% and if needed, we
will continue to move that rate so we are not in the first or second position. Deposits now total $31 billion.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive
business trends evident during last year. Spending growth remains strong across all business segments and geographic
regions, despite increasingly difficult prior year comparisons. We also saw further improvement in lending credit
trends.

Some of it is due to our strategic and risk-related actions, and some reflecting the post-recession behavior of customers.
The divergence between consumer spending and borrowing levels continues to illustrate this change in behavior, as
well as our shift in focus to a more premium lending customer. The net effect of all these factors is an improvement in
the risk profile of the overall company.
Revenue growth, which continued to improve in the quarter, but still is below our long-term target, continued to
outpace our large issuer competitors as strong cardmember spending volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan
yield. As expected, our strong billings growth and improved credit trends once again provided the opportunity to invest
in the business at high level, while also generating strong earnings. These investments continue to be focused on
driving current metrics and building capabilities that will benefit the medium- to long-term success of the company.
One example of a longer-term initiative was the recent launch of Serve, our next-generation digital payment platform.
While many investments are reflected in marketing and operating expense, others involve using our strong capital base
such as our recent Loyalty Partner acquisition, and the Payfone equity investment announced last week.
Despite strong momentum across our business, the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain. In
addition, as you know, later this year we will stop receiving the quarterly Visa and MasterCard litigation payments, and
year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult in light of the strong 2010 credit and volume trends. In light of these
factors, we are moving forward with plans to slow the growth of our operating expenses toward the end of this year and
into 2012.
The bottom line is our strong competitive position and unique business model are yielding high quality results, as
spending on our network continues to be well above industry average, and our credit performance remains the best
among major card issuers. We are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to
manage through the changing environment, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us, and continue to win in the
marketplace.
Thanks for listening, and I'm now ready to take questions.

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Thank you very much. And the first question will come from the line of Craig
Maurer with CLSA. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, good evening. First let me congratulate Ron on completing his final earnings release.
<A - Ronald C. Stovall>: Thank you, Craig.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Moving on to the hot topic, which is expenses, a couple questions there. If we were to add in
the $220 million contra expense item regarding the settlement payments to the other expense line, will this quarter
represent a good run rate for that line? As it seems this is about where you were running pre-recession, on average on a
quarterly basis.
And also, if you can just help us with a little flavor in terms of going into next year, you talk about moving the
expenses as a percentage of managed revenue ratio back down toward pre-recession levels. I mean, what type of move
can we think about for next year, with the understanding that this is a multi-year effort.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay, so I think that some of the elevation in operating expense is going to continue. So, to
the extent we have invested in sales force, that's going to continue at that level and we think it'll generate revenues that
make it a worthwhile investment. You know, our investments to build teams that enable projects like Business Insights
or Enterprise Growth, again those are expenses that will continue going forward, and will be supported by the revenues
that they will generate.

Now there are some investments that we elevated, particularly in the technologies area, which are projects that have a
very finite life to them, and we won't necessarily see those at the levels that we've seen over the last several quarters.
So I think we will calibrate our expenses and be mindful that when some of the resources we currently have, such as
the release of credit reserves, and when the payments with Visa and MasterCard come to an end, that we have expense
levels that are appropriate for our revenues. And as I said, we would expect expense growth later in the year to scale
down and slow. So, it's kind of a combination of some will continue, but others will decrease as we move forward.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Okay, so specifically in the other revenue line, were we at a good run rate there concerning
the settlement payment as a contra expense? And I guess in a slightly different fashion, if we think about the reserve
release slowing that you talked about, and the reduction in spending that would be commensurate with that, is that – I
mean, should we look for a reduction in HR? Should – I mean, where are we looking for that reduction is what I'm
trying to get at.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, I guess I would look at operating expenses, kind of the line items together. So, I'd look
at expenses, exclude provision obviously, exclude marketing, exclude rewards. If we exclude those, those are the
operating expenses that I'm addressing. And I'm not specifically saying that you're going to see a decrease in that line
item. I think there'll be a decrease in certain elements of that line item.
What I'm saying is you're not going to see the growth rates on that line that you've been seeing over the last several
quarters, okay, but not necessarily a decrease. A decrease in certain items, but not necessarily a decrease when you look
at operating expenses in total. If that were the case, as we move through the year, the growth rates would decline.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Okay.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Thanks, Dan.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yep.
Operator
Thank you very much. Next we'll hear from the line of Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Rick Shane>: Thanks, Dan. When we look at the rewards expense, it's basically a function – the growth rate's a
function of three things. It's the billed business growth, whatever you do – whatever incentives you're providing or
programs you're running during the quarter, and then in this quarter, the change in assumption on the long-term
redemption rate.
Going forward, the way I'm thinking that we should model this, and correct me if I'm wrong here, is that we should see
it really, at least on the margin as a function, is the growth in the billed business, that the change in assumption this
quarter, the incremental somewhere between $165 million and $185 million was a one-time event?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, generally, you would expect rewards to grow in line with billed business, unless we are
increasing certain programs. Now – so I think it's reasonable to expect rewards to grow with business, okay? However,
what I would say is that we continue to refine our estimation process around the ultimate redemption rate.
And to the extent either cardmember behavior changes or we evolve the program in such a way that we're increasing
redemptions, in those cases, we would expect to see increases in expense when we identify those, okay? So I think on
an ongoing basis, we're always looking at our estimation process and continue to refine it as appropriate. I would point
out that this line is both a combination of Membership Rewards, as well as our co-brand products.
The other element that you didn't mention, when you think about expense in the quarter, it's volume related to
Membership Rewards, it's volume, it's the ultimate redemption rate, and it's the cost per point, okay? And cost per point
during some periods will increase, depending on the mix of redemption by customers; and in some points, it could

decrease, again based on their behaviors, or new redemption options that we put into the programs. So, that's the other
factor that you need to keep in mind.
<Q - Rick Shane>: Great, and if I could have just one quick follow-up, is the test for the redemption rate a quarterly
test, or is that something you review annually?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: It's a quarterly test.
<Q - Rick Shane>: Great, thank you, Dan.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Thanks very much. Just wanted to shift to the capital ratio comment that you had -
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: You indicated common Tier 1 10% to 11% was really more in line with where you'd like it to
be, or that's your long-term goal. Are you anticipating any type of timeframe to get there? Is that something that you're
targeting by year-end?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I would say our target of 10% to 11% is where we are absent further guidance from the
regulators, right? When they finally come out with their rules, depending where it is, we may modify that. But in the
moderate term, I would say it's 10% to 11%.
This ratio will obviously move based on the amount of share buybacks we do. We could have periods where a certain
amount of cash – we're required to take certain cash prior to the redemption of certain securitizations, and put it into
restricted cash. To the extent that happens, those type of things could impact the ratio in the short term.
If you think about share buyback, you should really talk – think about the guidance we've given that we basically want
to return about 50% of our earnings to shareholders, either through dividends or share buybacks, plus we would have
buybacks equal to the amount of capital that's raised through employee plans.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And – but you indicated too that the ratio could be – decline by about 80 basis points or so
from your current 11.8%. Did I hear you right?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so I'm not making a prediction that we're going to drop it by 80 basis points next
quarter -
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: I'm just saying our moderate term target is between 10% and 11%, right? At the moment we
happen to be at 11.8%. Next quarter, we're going to have movement on our balance sheet, we're going to have our share
repurchases, and we're going to have earnings.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Whatever the composite of that is, is where we'll wind up -
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: – which could be, could be above 11%, or it might be in the 10% to 11% range.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, and you indicated your buyback started next quarter through this quarter, so you're not
waiting for anything from the [indiscernible] (45:25) buffer. You also at one point indicated that you didn't think you

were a systemic risk bank. Does that assessment still hold?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: We are – so we have heard back from the Fed, which had no objection to our plan that we
submitted.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right, right.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: We are certainly one of the 19 large banks in the U.S. Although to the extent there are global
significant banks, we don't believe we're one of those banks.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, got it, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I had a question on the ultimate redemption rate change again. I'm just trying to
understand how much of that change was a conscious decision for greater engagement versus some kind of structural
change in the competitive environment. Could you just help us think about that? Because all else equal, it would seem
like you'd have less discretion to spend money elsewhere, and obviously, you're looking to take expenses down. So,
maybe you could just talk about that? And then just how does the current redemption rate assumption track what your
assumption is? Thanks.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Right, so I don't think there's any necessarily structural change in the competitive
environment. I think we have continued to look to enhance the value proposition of Membership Rewards. To the
extent we're successful doing that, we're going to have greater cardmember engagement. To the extent we have greater
cardmember engagement, we're going to have higher redemption levels.
So I think as you think about how we deploy our resources, we do make conscious decisions about the amount we're
going to allocate to rewards versus marketing, how much we're going to have in loyalty programs or acquisition of
customers. So, all those things are similar levers, and we make conscious decisions about – in terms of how we're going
to allocate our resources at the end of the day.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: And then just on that redemption rate currently tracking to your expectation?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So the ultimate redemption rate is going to be based on cardmember behavior. And you know,
we do a quarterly calculation where we're endeavoring to estimate what we think the ultimate redemption rate's going
to be. If cardmember behavior changes, the estimate will change. And at times, we do refinements of the estimation
process, and that will result in potential changes as well. So, it's a combination of all those things that impacted the rate
in this quarter, and will impact the rate every quarter going forward.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much. Next we'll hear from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust. Go ahead, please.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Thank you. Dan, just – I hate to come back to cardmember rewards, but was there a step-up
function in this quarter, like one-time in nature such that you'd have like a build of the reserve, such that it would start
correlating a lot more with spending and more towards the point made earlier? Or should we start thinking about this at
a similar level relative to growth and discount revenue?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay, so what the expense is in each quarter is a function of spend, ultimate redemption rate
estimate, and the weighted average cost per point. Those are the elements that drive expense each quarter, okay? The
weighted average cost per point, we actually use a weighted arrange of the last 12 months as the best estimate for that,

Page 11 of 17
okay? Spend is going to be whatever our cardmembers spend in a quarter. If the average weighted cost per point, and
the URR does not change in a quarter, then rewards should grow equal to the growth in billed business, okay?
In this quarter, we refined our methodology, and it resulted in an increase based on the behaviors of our customers in
the ultimate redemption rate estimate, from 91% up to 92% for our active participants, okay? So each quarter, it'll be
the same process that I just described.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Okay, thank you. And then one other final thing, as you talked about expenses and potentially the
growth rate of expenses changing, but you also referenced expenses relative to operating margins sort of commensurate
with the revenue growth that you're anticipating from the investment spending. And in some of your prior
presentations, you alluded to getting back to kind of pre-recession operating margins, or certainly things that we've
been talking about. Is that still a stated goal, and what is kind of the timeframe for us to be thinking about that stated
goal that we've kind of had in the past?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I think on average and over time perspective, I think we want to be at historical margins.
It's not a stated objective, but I think that's basically where we want to get back to. Now, the actual mix of expenses
within those margins could change. We could decide to increase the amount that we allocate to – or we target for
marketing and promotion, or we could target to take that down. We could decide that from an overall perspective, the
best thing to do is to increase the value proposition in our rewards programs, and then that would become a larger
perspective – a larger percentage, rather.
So I think we're constantly looking at that and calibrating it to achieve the right returns on our investments, and the
right financial performance on average and over time, in line with our stated objective of 8%-plus revenue growth, 12%
to 15% EPS growth, and ROE of 25%-plus. So, those are all things that we use to calibrate the decisions that we make.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Hi, do you have a target for when operating leverage will turn positive?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So just – if you'll just tell me exactly what that calculation is?
<Q - Brian Foran>: So revenue growth exceeding expense growth on a year-over-year basis, I'm just trying to piece
together, we've got operating expense slowing, we've got marketing budget, which I guess is fairly discretionary, we've
got presumably the rewards expense growing in line with discount revenues. But just when will that revenue growth
line start exceeding the expense growth line? Is that also something that we could expect to happen at the end of this
year and into next, or will that be different because of the trajectory of rewards and marketing?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I wouldn't do a forecast of revenue growth or expense growth going forward. Although I
would go back and say that the targets that I just alluded to in terms of EPS growth, which are on average and over
time, I think we've said that 2010 is a good base to think about in terms of achieving those targets on average and over
time going forward. So, that would give you an idea of what our expectation is both for revenues, as well as for EPS
growth.
<Q - Brian Foran>: And then just a clean-up question on tax rate, is the tax rate we saw this quarter what we should
expect over time, or what should we use a long-term tax rate?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: I think our rate was 31-ish%?
<A - Ronald C. Stovall>: 32%.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: 32%, okay, so I think we've said on average over time again, we would expect the tax rate in
the 30% to 32% range. You know, in particular, quarters, there may be discrete tax items that would cause it to either

be lower or higher, but that's about the right range that you should expect, 30% to 32%.

<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thanks, good evening. I guess I'd like to second the congratulations for Ron. Appreciate your
help over the many years.
<A - Ronald C. Stovall>: Oh, thank you very much.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: The first question I have is, you're obviously seeing the lending side of the equation stabilize
much earlier than others, and I'm interested if you could give us any context as to what is supporting the balances
stabilizing at these levels? Is it new card acquisitions that are coming in with balances? Is it purely just more spending?
Could you give us any context for what's driving that superior performance relative to the industry, please?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay, so we are focused, from a card acquisition perspective, on charge card and premium
lending, okay? So I think the nature of the customers we're acquiring is reflective of that strategy. And so they tend to
be customers that may be more transactors in nature, may revolve to a lesser degree than customers did historically. I
think you're seeing that in the paydown rates that I alluded to before. In March of this year, we were up about 30%,
compared to paydown rate of 27% in March of 2010.
So I think we're having high quality acquisitions. Those customers are spending, you can see that. And the whole I
think – our customer base, as well as others, are tending to delever. And I think all of those things are coming into play.
As you said, our customers, when the recession was at its height in the beginning of 2009, pulled back sooner. Even
though they had the capacity to spend and pay, they were cautious.
Now those customers have come back very strongly. We saw our improvements in spending by our customers really
move to very strong levels in the first quarter of '09. That's continued. And I think it's really the nature of our customer
base, the quality of our customer base that is causing us to move in advance of the rest of the industry on spending, on
credit behavior, as well as from loan balances.
Now the other thing you have to remember, too, is we've changed strategy. We're not looking to balance transfers as a
way of bringing customers on board. We're not using teaser rates, so that's another thing that's coming into play. So, I
think what you're seeing on the loan side is very much a function of our strategy. Now, how customer behavior will
change over the next 24 months, we'll have to wait and see, but I think all of those things come into play in terms of
what we're seeing in the loan balances.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Okay, and as a follow-up – I don't want to beat the expense horse to death. It's pretty obvious
that you have a lot of flexibility in terms of how you manage expenses over time. What is a little less predictable or a
little less manageable is really in the revenue side, and I'm wondering if you could give us any perspective on how you
are looking at the investments that you have made, if you're feeling that the returns in terms of the revenue opportunity
is coming in either in line or better or worse than budgeted? Or how are you thinking about these investments, if you
can give us any context around when we would see the revenue side?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so I think you are already seeing the revenue side. I mean, I think we're very pleased.
We have over the last five quarters said we want to invest in part to drive near-term metrics, and in part, to build
capabilities that'll enable the success of the company over the moderate to long term. So, when you look at our billed
business growth of 17%, I think that's a very clear reflection that the investments that we're making in cardmember
acquisition and in our loyalty and rewards program are paying off. And those growth rates are not only terrific on an
absolute basis, they're notably better than the rest of the industry. So, I think that's very positive.

I think the investments that we're making in terms of fee businesses, businesses that'll generate fee revenues, I think
we're making good progress there. We're pleased with the results to-date. Investments in the digital space: Serve is a
very good example. We bought Revolution Money in January of 2010. We invested in building the capabilities over the
next 15 months. We launched Serve in March of this year. We'll continue to build out the capabilities of Serve. So, I
think there are very tangible indications that our investments are paying off.
Now revenue growth of 7% again, is really the best in the industry. Now, it is being impacted by the fact that loans are
flat. But they've stabilized, so that's good. Our yield is at 9.1%. It's down 10% last year. But we knew that. We
expected as the CARD Act came in, that's exactly what would happen. Notwithstanding that, it's putting a drag on
revenue growth. So, you know, we're cognizant of that, but there are a lot of very positive signs related to both the
strategy that we've put in place, the investments we've made, the execution on those investments, and then the resulting
positive output.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead, please.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask two separate questions. As a follow-up to, Dan, your just prior
comments about the fee-based business making good progress. I think you've said in a public forum that you were
targeting generating – I can't remember if it was $3 billion, or $4 billion in revenue from those initiatives. Are you still
comfortable with those targets? That's the first question. And then separately, I was wondering if you might be able to
provide us an update on the DoJ litigation? Thank you.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay, so our target for $3 billion in fee revenues has not changed. And as I said, I think we're
making good progress on that front, so there's no change there.
As it relates to your second question, the main development on the DoJ front is that there was a hearing on March the
2nd, and it laid out a schedule of discovery in terms of document discovery, expert discovery, filing of briefs and
arguments. And the final pre-trial conference is scheduled to be held in February of 2013. Now, obviously any of the
parties could ask for an extension if they had good reason for that. But that's the update in terms of the schedule related
to DoJ.
I guess I'd also point out that despite the DoJ suit being out there, our relationships with merchants continue to operate
in a very business as usual form. We continue to renew contracts. You can see by the discount rate that it continues to
hold at 2.55%. So, we view those all as very positive aspects as we think about really the strength of our network,
which is helping to enable the spend of our customers.
<Q - James Friedman>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next we'll hear from the line of Mike Taiano, I believe, with Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Michael P. Taiano>: Hi, thanks. Dan, just had a question on how we should think about revenue growth. So, 7%
year-on-year, you're pretty close to I think what your long-term target of 8% is. How should we think of it in terms of
relative to billed business, because the gap is pretty wide?
Should we expect that gap to narrow over time, but for billed business growth to remain at slightly higher than your
revenue growth over time? And then also if you could just remind us with respect to the overall economy, if you think
that you can achieve sort of your long-term targets under current conditions or if you really need a pick-up in GDP?

Page 14 of 17
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so I guess what I would say is that if GDP is around 3%, I think in normal conditions
that we would be able to achieve our revenue target on average over time. In this current environment, because we're
coming out of the recession, and the fact that we have the decrease in yield, that's a drag on the percentage on an
aggregate basis. And you know, I would look to fee businesses to help to contribute to the growth in revenues as those
investments start to kick in.
As you know, any time we – well, as I know, any time we make kind of BAU kind of investments in card acquisition,
we have a very good ability to estimate what we're going to achieve. Any time you do something new, which is some
of what we're doing in the fee revenue space, and with Serve, there's a higher degree of execution risk. But we have, as
I said before, we're making good progress in this area and I think fee revenues over time will be a contributor that'll
enable us to achieve revenue growth in excess of 8%
And if you look back over the last 10 years, we've been very successful with our investments. So, we have taken share
over year since 2002 through 2008. There was a slight dip in 2009, but we had very good share gains in 2010. So, that's
really another thing that's been contributing to our ability to outperform the marketplace. So, again, we achieved 7%
revenue growth in the quarter with zero growth in loans and a declining yield. So, I think our ability to achieve 8-plus%
in revenue growth, assuming a reasonable economy, which I described as GDP of 3%, is very achievable.
<Q - Michael P. Taiano>: Okay, and then just one last point of clarification on the capital ratio, when you say 10% to
11% Tier 1 common, are you talking in terms of Basel III?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I've been talking really in terms of our current calculation. But even if we went to Basel
III, and it was 80 basis points lower, based on our current numbers, we would be within that range. And when we – by
the time Basel III actually comes into effect, hopefully we'll actually have specific guidance in terms of where the Fed
would expect us to be. So, we'll refine that more as we get the final rules and we get closer to the Basel III
implementation.
But certainly we have terrific earnings power to create free cash flow. This quarter we had $1.177 billion in earnings.
Our dividend is only about $200 million. So, we would be throwing off almost $1 billion in capital in the quarter. So, if
we needed to increase that percentage in a given period, we have a lot of wherewithal to do that.
<Q - Michael P. Taiano>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Dan, you had previously mentioned apart from the $3 billion target for fee-based
revenues by the end of 2014, you'd previously indicated that in 2009 you generated about $800 million in fee-based
revenues. So, that suggests that you were expecting roughly a 30% compound annual growth rate over that period. Can
you tell us what the 2010 fee-based revenues were?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so it's not a number we've disclosed. We will give I think some disclosures on this as
we go forward. I think there will be – I don't think this is a straight line from $800 million to $3 billion, right? I think it
requires heavy investment, which we're doing right now in the first part of that period. And then we'll get escalating
results as we move through the period. So, we don't have a specific disclosure on that, but I would say we're making
good progress.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay, so there's no number that you can share for 2010?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Not at this time.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay, and then just for perspective so we kind of understand as we're moving forward, is there –
can we expect at some point to get kind of more granular insight into how each of the various fee businesses are doing
and kind of – as they kind of contribute to that overall target?

<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I think it would be fair as we move over the course of 2012 through '14, to figure out what
the right disclosures are as an indication that we're actually making progress against our target for 2014.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay, finally, if I could have just one last follow-up on – there have been some concerns that
some investors have expressed about your ability to continue to be able to command premium pricing on AmEx
spending in light of the relatively lower economics that the Serve product would generate. Can you just talk to that
point and just discuss how you intend to handle any potential merchant push-back on different pricing for these
different products, particularly at the time of contract renegotiation? Thanks.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, I think these are two separate products, right? I mean, as you think about it, our current
product set are charge cards and lending products, and we have a certain set of economics attached to those. I think
many of the customers that the Serve product will attract are people who today use cash or debit or prepaid. And those
transactions will attract a different discount rate. But those are very different products meeting different customer
needs, and I think merchants will view them as different in nature. So, I think they both will cooperate, they both will
meet needs of customers in the marketplace but, you know, they're different customers.
Now that's not to say that some of our current cardmembers may not decide to open up a Serve account, but I think
they'll use them in different ways. So, we'll see how the economic model evolves within Serve, but we don't think that
it'll create any additional – or any additional pressure with merchants. I think with merchants for our charge and credit
products, we negotiate with them all the time when contracts are renewed. And we agree on pricing based on the value
that we bring to them over our network.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Thank you, and just to clarify just on the revenue side I guess, on the loan growth, I mean,
your 25% of revenue net interest income this quarter is down 9% year-over-year. The margin really fell off in the
second quarter. So, I mean, the comparison, you should have a slight bit of loan growth in 2Q '11 possibly, or flat or
slight loan growth, but you'll have pretty flat margins. So, that by itself probably gets you over the 8% revenue growth
target?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: I'm not going to forecast what's going to happen in the second quarter. But certainly to the
extent the yields year-over-year start to equalize, which is going to happen in the very near future, that will be a factor
that will be less of a drag on revenue growth than it was last year or in this quarter. So, I think that's a fair observation.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: And what did Loyalty Partners – what was the revenue of Loyalty Partners into the month
that you had it, or what is the annual run rate for LP?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I think what we've said is that last year it was about $300 million, so you can kind of use
that as a guidepost in terms of what revenues in this quarter were.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: And then just one big expense item, and I know -
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, we only had one month of Loyalty Partner in this quarter.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Thank you. And just one expense item, and I know this is built into your 12% to 15% and
you have flexibility, but if comp expense is up 15% year-over-year, employees up 6% and some incentive, I mean,
were there some unusual – I mean, we shouldn't expect comp expense to grow at a level that would be much above the
employee growth rate, should we?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, I think in the normal course, you would have employee growth and you'd have merit
increases.

<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Right.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: I think that's what you think about as normal growth. In this particular quarter, the incentive
compensation accruals we're making in this quarter are higher than the ones we made in the first quarter of last year.
And there were just some other employee-related benefit items that grew at a slightly higher rate.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay, we'll just take one more question.
Operator
One more question, okay. That comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Hi, Dan, just wonder if you have a better sense on what the impact of the CFPB might be on
your business? And also, if you're hearing anything on the merchant settlement that might indicate that they're moving
towards credit interchange reduction?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, first, in terms of the CFPB, we have to wait and see. There's been a lot of discussion
about exactly what they'll do. Until they're actually up and operational, which I think happens in the summer, and they
actually name the person who will lead that organization, we won't know that. But we are certainly staying in close
contact to the discussions in that area. So, that's something that we'll have to just wait and see.
Now as relates to the merchant settlement, I guess I'm not sure exactly, which merchant settlement you're referring to.
So, if you're referring to the Visa and MasterCard -
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yeah, there's been some concern that as part of – outside of a monetary settlement, there may
be a business practice change with respect to credit interchange. I was wondering if you've gotten any indications that it
might be moving in that direction or if you have any concerns around that?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so I would just say we don't really have any insights in terms of the Visa or MasterCard
talks that they're having, so I can't shed any light on that.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Okay, thank you.
Daniel T. Henry
Okay, so just before we end, as a couple people have mentioned, Ron Stovall is retiring in 16 days. If you were sitting
here, you could see him smile. So, Ron has extraordinary knowledge, has been a terrific advocate for the company, but
in a very balanced way, and I think we're very happy about that. So, I want to thank him for his significant
contributions that he's made. And I think you, the investment community, will be in good hands going forward, as Rick
Petrino is taking leadership of the investor relations group, and Toby Willard, who's been a key part of that team and
doing a terrific job, will continue. So, I congratulate Ron, but I have full faith in our team that we'll continue to be able
to be responsive to your questions and your needs. So, thank you very much.
