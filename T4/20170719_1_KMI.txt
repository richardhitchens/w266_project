Let me begin the call by saying that at the end of 2015, we made a very difficult decision to reduce our dividend for the
first and only time in KMI's history. We said we would work hard to strengthen our balance sheet and fund our growth
CapEx from our internally generated cash flow without having to issue equity or additional debt and that when we had
made sufficient progress on those goals, we would begin to return additional value to our shareholders through some
combination of dividend increases and our stock repurchases.
Since that time, we have reduced our debt by approximately $5.8 billion and funded all of our CapEx out of operating
cash flow while paying a dividend of $0.50 per share per year. Today, we're happy to announce multiple steps to return
significant value to our shareholders.
We plan to increase our dividend for 2018 by 60% from the current level of $0.50 per year to $0.80 per year, beginning
with the dividend payable for Q1 of 2018. We then expect to continue to increase the dividend by 25% per year for
2019 and 2020, resulting in a dividend of $1.19 and $1.25 in 2020. Additionally, our board today authorized a $2
billion share buyback program also expected to begin in 2018.
We intend to take these steps while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet by funding all our growth capital needs
at KMI out of operating cash flow, without the need to issue equity or incur additional debt. We expect to maintain
best-in-class coverage for our dividend. For example, about 2.5 times coverage in 2018 and 2 times or better in 2019
and 2020.
To sum up, we intend to fund our growth CapEx needs at KMI from internally generated cash flow and return excess
cash to our shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
Okay, that's the big announcement. I'm going to take you through KMI performance highlights, and then turn it over to
Kim Dang, KMI's CFO, to take you through the financials. Following that, I will update you on KML and turn it over
to Dax Sanders, CFO of KML, to give you the KML financial updates. And then we'll take your questions on both KMI
and KML.
So starting with KMI, we had a good second quarter and a good first half of the year. Performance was a little better
than planned for the quarter and the first half of the year. As we've said on the first quarter call, we're calling that
timing and expect to be essentially flat to plan for the year after adjusting for the impact of the IPO of 30% of all of our
Canadian Pipelines and Terminals assets as a result of the IPO.
Also, we have now completed the two key steps that we outlined at the beginning of the year to strengthen our balance
sheet and put us in a position to return value to shareholders as Rich told you. Number one, we completed that JV of
our Elba Island liquefaction project in the first quarter. That was consistent with our budget assumption. And in this
quarter, we secured acceptable financing for our Trans Mountain Expansion Project. With those steps now complete,
we project to end 2017 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.2 times versus the 5.4 times we projected at the beginning of
the year.
It's worth noting a couple of things from the KMI perspective on KML. By creating an entity with all of Kinder
Morgan's existing Canadian assets and taking that entity public, we established a business that is broader than the
expansion project. These assets include our existing Pipeline and Terminals asset networks in Canada, including what
we believe is the best merchant terminal position in the Edmonton hub.
The Edmonton position is a network with facilities interconnected with each other and with Trans Mountain and
third-party pipelines. We continue to expand that network with our Base Line Terminal Project, which I'll get into in
the KML portion.

The Canadian Pipelines and Terminals businesses produced a little under CAD 400 million of EBITDA in 2016. The
strength of this business and its opportunity to grow further creates an entity that can raise its own capital for the CAD
6.1 billion of remaining spend on the expansion. In fact, we closed shortly after the IPO on a construction credit facility
that Dax is going to take you through in a bit. So we were able to strengthen KMI's balance sheet using the IPO
proceeds to pay down debt, secure an acceptable means of funding our largest expansion capital project which will
benefit both KMI and KML shareholders alike.
Now, a few KMI business segment performance highlights for the quarter. First, the backlog currently stands at $12.2
billion. That's an increase from last quarter. We had new project additions in Gas and CO2, which outpaced projects
that were placed in service primarily in the Terminals segment.
We continue building out this backlog, which we expect will contribute significant EBITDA to the segments when
complete. Overall project management performance has also been quite good, delivering results that are consistent with
our investment decisions.
We are also – and I would say especially in Natural Gas – seeing additional opportunities on the horizon across
multiple fronts, whether it's producer-push projects out of the Permian, additional power plant connections, export
needs to Mexico, and LNG as well as storage opportunities. In our Natural Gas segment, we saw transport volumes
increase year over year Q2 to Q2 by 3%. Key contributors were Mexico exports, which were up 8% year over year,
higher LNG exports coming off of our pipes, and partially offset by lower power demand.
On the other hand, our gas gathering volumes were down year over year by 12%. Gathered gas volumes are up in the
Bakken but down in both Eagle Ford and Haynesville. And overall, we're seeing volumes flattening to slightly
recovering in our key basins. Recall that our Gas segment is 55% of our segment earnings before DD&A, and gathering
and processing is only 18% of that number.
We signed an additional 280 MMcf a day of long-term firm transport agreements in the quarter bringing the
year-to-date increment to 680 MMcf a day and our total signup over the last 3.5 years to 8.7 Bcf a day, of which 2.4
Bcf was existing previously unsold capacity, showing again that the rise of natural gas production and demand creates
expansion opportunities but also adds value to the existing network.
We continue to make good progress on our 1.8 Bcf a day Gulf Coast Express proposed project, which goes from the
Permian to a connection at Agua Dulce in South Texas with our existing Texas Intrastate system. We're not putting it in
our backlog at this point, but we've got a good offering to the market, and we're progressing our commercial
discussions toward firm commitments. We also continue to see interest in our Permian capacity on EPNG, which has
some very economic, that is, low-capital expansion opportunities to get more gas to Waha.
The overall summary on Gas is that we continue to expect long-term benefit in this sector from increased LNG and
Mexico exports, powered industrial demand, and those should continue to drive the demand for the transportation and
storage infrastructure that we own.
Shifting over to our Products Pipelines segment, refined products volumes, NGLs, and crude and condensate transport
volumes were all up year over year. The benefits of these higher volumes were offset by some settlements, a project
write-off on Plantation, and the sale of our interest in Parkway Pipeline last year, all of which weigh in to leave us
slightly down year over year on a segment earnings before DD&A basis.
Getting back to the volumes, refined products volumes are up 2.2% year over year versus an EIA overall market
growth number for April and May of 1.5%. NGL volumes are up 14% year over year.
And in contrast to our gathered volumes, our crude and condensate transport volumes are up year over year on our
Eagle Ford, that is, our KMCC asset and our Bakken pipes. Bakken performance is due in part to the delay of DAPL.
The KMCC volumes I think are an indicator of the great connectivity and superior location of that system.
We've made excellent progress during the quarter on our Utopia Pipeline project. Recall that we received an adverse
decision on eminent domain in one of the Ohio circuit courts last year. Our team did an excellent job of acquiring the
necessary right-of-way, including reroutes and the purchase of an existing pipeline. And so in the quarter, we finished

acquiring all of the required right-of-way, and we are now about one-third complete on pipeline construction and on
target for our scheduled January 1, 2018 in-service. Really fine work and fine recovery by the project team on Utopia.
And again, scheduled to be on time on January 1, 2018.
In our Terminals business, the segment earnings before DD&A were up 2% versus Q2 last year, primarily as a result of
contributions from projects coming online in our liquids business, which makes up about 80% of this segment. Our
leasable capacity in liquids was up 2%. Our utilization remained very strong at 95%. Bulk volumes were also up year
over year 4.7%, which was led by performance in petcoke and steel.
Our commercial team wisely remained aggressive in keeping all of our Jones Act vessels under charter and discounting
as necessary to do so, and we have all of those vessels under charter today and took delivery of two during the quarter,
one at the very end of the previous quarter and one during the quarter.
In CO2, we experienced a lower effective oil price compared to last year and lower oil volumes, but we are on plan in
this segment. We experienced record CO2 production in April and higher volumes year over year for the quarter Q2
this year to Q2 last year. We're also seeing promising results from our recent pattern activation programs at SACROC
and from our Tall Cotton Residual Oil Zone development, which is now producing over 2,000 barrels a day.
So overall, a strong quarter, strong financial performance, continued progress on our project execution, completion of a
key milestone in our effort to strengthen our balance sheet and position us to return value to shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim Dang.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve.
We're declaring a dividend today of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget. On the performance, let me hit the
high points first and then I'll take you through the details. I'll start with the GAAP numbers, and then I'll move to DCF,
which is the way that we look at and think about the numbers and performance.
Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share are both flat versus the second quarter of 2016. DCF per share,
which is the primary way we judge our performance, is $0.01 lower versus the second quarter of 2016 or approximately
$28 million, primarily attributable to the sale of 50% of SNG, the KML IPO transaction in which we sold a 30%
interest in our Canadian assets, as well as higher sustaining CapEx and cash taxes.
For the second quarter and year to date, DCF per share is ahead of our budget. But that's largely timing with sustaining
CapEx being the largest contributor. For the full year, after the impact of the KML IPO, we would expect DCF to be on
budget. Taking the impact of the KML IPO into account, we expect DCF to be less than 1% below budget.
On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 5.1 times debt-to-EBITDA, down from 5.3 times at the end of last year
and at the end of the first quarter, as a result of paying down debt with the approximately $1.25 billion in net proceeds
that we received from the KML IPO.
Our debt balance for the second quarter came in lower than what we expected, primarily because some expansion
CapEx got shifted from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. Therefore, we still expect to end the year
at 5.2 times, as we previously communicated.
On the expansion CapEx front, we're forecasting $3.1 billion for the year. That is down from our budget of $3.2 billion.
The $3.1 billion does not include any KML CapEx, including spending on Trans Mountain from June forward, as we
expect KML to be a self-funding entity.
Because of the equity that KMI has contributed to fund the Trans Mountain Project prior to the IPO, KML has the
capacity to draw on its construction facility to fund its CapEx for the balance of the year. If you take a broader view,
the Trans Mountain expansion has $6.1 billion in remaining spend. It's got a $4 billion revolver and so there's about a

$2.1 billion gap. And we expect KML to be able to finance the balance itself, which Dax will take you through when he
walks through KML.
Now for some details, looking at the preliminary GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are up by 7% in
the quarter, but cost of sales is up by more, resulting in a $114 million reduction in gross margin, a similar phenomenon
to what we saw in the first quarter of this year.
The sale of 50% interest in SNG accounts for $112 million or 98% of the [indiscernible] (15:49). Therefore, if you
exclude the sale, gross margin would be essentially flat which is pretty consistent with how we view our overall results
for the quarter.
As I said earlier, both earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share are flat for the quarter versus the comparable
prior period. Net income available to common shareholders in the quarter was $337 million or $0.15 per share versus
$333 million, also $0.15 per share, in the second quarter of 2016. Net income available to common shareholders before
certain items or adjusted earnings were $304 million or $0.14 per share versus the adjusted number in 2016 of $322
million, also $0.14 per share.
Certain items in the first quarter of this year were a benefit of $34 million. The most significant was the reserve release
on a litigation matter we settled. Certain items in the first quarter of 2016 were a net benefit of $8 million.
Now I'm going to turn to the second page of financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year to date and is
reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. As I said earlier, DCF is the primary financial measure on
which management judges its performance. We've generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.022 billion versus $1.05
billion for the comparable period in 2016, down $28 million or 3%.
I'm looking at the breakdown of the quarter-to-quarter change. Segment earnings before DD&A and certain items is
down $66 million. Natural Gas is the largest driver, down $54 million. The SNG joint venture impact was
approximately $73 million in the quarter. So absent the sale, the Natural Gas segment would be up slightly.
Although the SNG transaction overall was dilutive to DCF, the segment impact of $73 million overstates this impact as
there are benefits reflected in other lines with the primary benefit coming in interest expense as we used the proceeds
from that transaction associated with lower oil production at SACROC, primarily as we reallocated capital to projects
that had higher returns but longer lead times. The Terminals and Products variances in the quarter are small and largely
offset. The Kinder Morgan Canada variance is also small.
G&A has a net benefit of $16 million quarter to quarter, primarily as a result of the SNG sale and lower franchise taxes.
Interest expense has a benefit of $43 million in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the SNG
joint venture transaction and the KML IPO because we used the entire net proceeds from both transactions to pay down
debt.
Cash taxes and sustaining CapEx are higher by about $30 million versus the second quarter of last year. But we
expected a budget of both cash taxes and sustaining CapEx to be higher than last year by even more than the $30
million.
So there's some timing on these items between the first half of the year and the second half of the year relative to our
budget. Totaling those quarter to quarter variances, segment's down $66 million; G&A, a benefit of $16 million;
interest, a benefit of $43 million and cash and sustaining, a combined increase of $30 million results in a variance of
$37 million.
The last piece of the variance relates to SNG. In our adjustments to convert net income to DCF, we add back JV
DD&A and subtract out sustaining CapEx to more closely reflect the cash we expect to receive from our JV. Because
SNG is a JV in the second quarter of 2017 versus fully consolidated asset in the second quarter of 2016, there's
approximately a $10 million benefit to JV DD&A between the two periods.
The net impact of KML for the period is buried in some of the line items I've discussed because it's small. It's less than
about $5 million when taking into account the interest benefit. DCF per share was $0.46 versus $0.47 for the first

quarter of the prior year or down $0.01, all of which is associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through.
The $0.46 per share results in over $740 million of excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the
quarter and $1.68 billion year to date.
As I've said earlier, for the quarter and year to date, we are ahead of our budget. But for the full year, we expect to be
on our budget when you exclude the impact of the KML IPO. The effect of the IPO will be seen primarily in two
places; one, in net income attributable to non-controlling interest, which will reflect an expense for the public's 30% of
net income, which will be somewhat offset by interest expense which will reflect a benefit as we used the IPO proceeds
to pay down debt. Including the impact of the KML IPO, we expect DCF to be less than 1% below budget.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt of $36.6 billion and net debt to
adjusted EBITDA of 5.1 times. Debt is down year to date $1.56 billion. And it is down in the quarter $1.24 billion. To
reconcile that for you, in the quarter, it's pretty easy. We're down $1.24 billion in debt and the IPO proceeds were $1.25
billion. So essentially, everything else nets out.
But to take you through some of the details, DCF was $1.022 billion as I previously mentioned. Investments, our
investing program, expansion, CapEx and contributions to equity investments was a little over $875 million. We paid
dividends of $280 million. And then we have working capital and other items of $129 million. Source of working
capital which was primarily associated with accrued interest as most of our interest payments are made in the first and
third quarters.
Year to date, we have reduced debt by $1.56 billion. And so to break that down for you, we generated DCF of $2.24
billion. We have $1.64 billion in investing activities between expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments.
We received $1.25 billion in IPO proceeds. We had a little over $450 million from asset sales and JV proceeds;
primarily the Elba promote, our partner's catch-up of its equity contributions and the sale of some of our non-core
terminals.
We paid dividends of $560 million. And we have working capital and other items that were a use of capital of $178
million, which were a whole host of items but include use of cash for inventory, primarily natural gas purchases,
property tax payments, a lot of which occurred in the first quarter, debt issuance costs associated with the KML
construction facility and accrued interest.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Steven.
Steven J. Kean
Okay. Now we're going to turn to KML. I'll give the update and Dax will take you through the numbers and also a
couple of key updates.
So just a reminder. KML consists of all of the Kinder Morgan Canadian Pipelines and Terminals assets. So those
include our existing Trans Mountain Pipeline system which runs full and is the only outlet for Alberta Crude to a world
oil market price. It also includes, of course, the CAD 7.4 billion expansion to triple the capacity of that system.
KML also includes the Puget Sound system which takes oil from the Trans Mountain Pipeline and delivers it to
Northwest Washington State refineries, a market that we would expect to grow over time. KML includes the Canadian
portion of the Cochin system which delivers condensate to Alberta for blending with the oil sands crude for transport.
Crude comes down from the oil sands to our merchant terminal position in Edmonton, among other places, where it can
move down Trans Mountain or a third-party pipeline or through one of our joint venture crude-by-rail facilities. We've
built our Edmonton position over the last 10 years and continue to expand it with our Base Line Terminal joint venture
with Keyera, which is a CAD 366 million investment to our share. That's on time and on budget with the first tanks
coming online in January of 2018.
Finally, Vancouver Wharves, our multi-commodity bulk terminal in Vancouver harbor and the gateway terminal for
mineral concentrates both coming into and out of Western Canada, is also a part of KML. So in all, KML is comprised

of two strong, existing business platforms that are integral to fulfilling the transportation, blending and storage needs of
producers and refiners. It has substantial upside associated with Trans Mountain Expansion, as well as other potential
expansions.
On the Trans Mountain Project, I'll remind you that in Q1 we reached a significant milestone. We increased our cost
estimate above the contractual cap. The cap was CAD 6.8 billion, and our revised estimate is CAD 7.42 billion. That
gave our shippers the right to turn back capacity.
At the investor conference in January we expressed our confidence in the market need for the project, and in fact, when
all was said and done, all 708,000 barrels remain under long-term contract but now with the increased tolls, which
include return on the additional capital we'll spend as well. We ended up with only 3% of the barrels turned back and
those were taken up in an open season. The contracts are predominantly 20 years, with one 15-year contract. So we
have essentially reconfirmed the value and need for the project with a 2017 lineup of shipper needs based on 2017
market conditions, including oil sands conditions.
Also recall that we have built in protections for the costs that are more difficult for us to estimate and control on the
project. These uncapped costs associated with, among other things, the most difficult mountain and difficult urban
portions of the build, is higher than shown in our cost estimate, results in an adjustment to our toll which includes not
only recovery of the costs, but also the project return on those costs incurred.
Now, by the same token, reduced costs will accrue to the benefit of our shippers, and our shippers benefit from the fact
that other portions of our costs are capped and we would absorb the overrun there, if any.
We also received our environmental approval from British Columbia earlier in the year, and of course, our federal
government approval finding that the project is in the public interest of Canada.
So in the quarter, we made our final investment decision approving the project. We made a public offering that
included all of Kinder Morgan's Canadian assets, and we secured financing.
As we are moving into project execution, we're finalizing rates with contractors, we're ordering materials readying for
construction start in September. And we're doing that with substantial First Nation support, support from the federal
government on a project of vital national interest, support from the Alberta government and with our BC environmental
order in hand, and with significant financing sources already secured.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dax.
Dax A. Sanders
Thanks, Steve. Before I get into the results and outlook, I want to highlight a couple of occurrences on the bank capital
mortgage front. First, we received our initial ratings from the agencies, and consistent with our expectation, we
received a rating of BBB from S&P and BBB high from DBRS.
On the financing front, as Steve mentioned, we closed on a financing package that consists of a $4 billion base facility,
a $1 billion contingent facility, and a $500 million working capital facility, all of which positions us well to access a
significant portion of the capital we need to build the Trans Mountain Project, including accessing the Canadian prep
market, as we discussed on the roadshow.
As I move into a review of the results, I want to preface my comments with the caveat that while I will be offering
quarter-over-quarter comparisons, those comparisons are of limited value at this point given that we are reporting a
quarter where KML is owned by public for part of the quarter and will be compared to a quarter where it was
wholly-owned by KMI. And during those periods prior to the IPO, there were shareholder loans in place that generated
significant FX, most of which is unrealized; interest and other items not reflective of the true earnings power of KML.
Therefore, we would ask you to focus on the outlook for 2017, which you will see is consistent with what we discussed
on the roadshow. Quarter-over-quarter variances will mean more over time and obviously we don't have a published

budget for KML as a standalone company, but starting with our budget cycle this year we will publish one just as KMI
does.
Now, moving to the results and outlook for 2017. Today we're announcing that the KML board has declared a dividend
for the second quarter and an inaugural dividend for KML of CAD 0.0571 per restricted voting share which
corresponds to the pro rata percentage of the CAD 0.65 annualized we suggested on the roadshow adjusted for the 32
days in the second quarter that KML was public.
With respect to performance, and as Kim did with KMI, I'm going to walk you through some summary items and then
we'll provide incremental details, starting with the GAAP numbers and moving on to DCF, which is the metric we
believe is most reflective in performance.
With respect to earnings and net income, earnings per restricted voting share was CAD 0.11 for the quarter which is
derived from CAD 25 million of net income, which is down from approximately CAD 52 million of net income for the
same quarter in 2016.
Adjusted earnings, which adjusts for certain items, was CAD 36 million compared to CAD 46 million for the same
quarter in 2016. With respect to DCF, DCF per restricted voting share was CAD 0.00083 for the quarter, which is
derived from total DCF for the quarter of approximately CAD 79 million versus CAD 86 million for the comparable
period in 2016, down CAD 7 million or approximately 8%. That provides coverage of approximately CAD 2.8 million
and reflects a payout ratio of approximately 69%, again consistent with what we talked about on the roadshow.
Now, moving to the details, looking at the preliminary GAAP income statement, I want to point out the unusual item
that is driving the almost CAD 27 million decrease. FX moved from a gain of CAD 5.8 million to a loss of CAD 16
million. That CAD 21.8 million swing was mostly related to the revaluation of the intercompany loans between KMI
and KML that were repaid at the consummation of the IPO, again, consistent with the message on the roadshow.
And the items that drove CAD 18.5 million of that CAD 21.8 million were classified as a Certain Item. The remaining
CAD 3.3 million of the swing not attributable to certain items and included in the variances for net income, EBITDA,
and DCF was largely attributable to the settlement of intercompany AR and AP between KMI and KML and the
revaluation of U.S. dollar bank accounts at KML. Going forward, while there may be some unrealized FX associated
with intercompany AR and AP, now that KML is a standalone public company, those items will be settled on a
monthly basis and unrealized FX should be much less.
Now let's turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF and is reconciled for our GAAP numbers in
the earnings release. Segment EBDA before certain items is down CAD 10 million compared to Q2 2016, with the
Pipelines segment down approximately CAD 11 million and the Terminals segment up about CAD 1 million. The
largest pieces in the Pipelines segment were timing on integrity spend at Cochin, OpEx at Trans Mountain and lower
revenue on Puget. At the Terminals segment, we had higher Vancouver work throughput and revenue offset by higher
O&M at Vancouver Wharves.
G&A is essentially flat. Interest cost is CAD 4.4 million lower versus Q2 2016, primarily as a result of the repayment
of the intercompany loans and greater capitalized interest associated with the project. Total certain items for the quarter
were CAD 10.5 million tax-affected, with the largest piece being the intercompany FX that I mentioned. The remaining
CAD 1.3 million is related to certain JV IPO costs that were booked to the Canadian business prior to the IPO. Both
cash taxes and sustaining capital were essentially flat compared to the same quarter in 2016.
Now, moving on to some specifics for the full year 2017, we expect EBITDA for the full year 2017, including pre and
post-IPO periods, to be just under CAD 400 million, and we expect DCF to come in at approximately CAD 320
million. Both of those are consistent with the CAD 395 million and CAD 318 million of 2016 EBITDA and DCF
respectively that we highlighted during the IPO.
One item to highlight, you will recall that we recognize equity A&DC as part of both EBITDA and DCF, which is a
product of how much CapEx we've spent on the project. So EBITDA and DCF will be affected by the amount and
timing of spend on the project.

And with that, I'll move on to a few short comments on the balance sheet. From the end of the year to June 30, cash
increased approximately CAD 35 million, which is mainly due to a draw on the construction debt/working capital
facilities that I mentioned. Other assets increased CAD 290 million, which was primarily driven with the CapEx
spending.
On the right-hand side of the balance sheet, debt decreased by almost CAD 1.2 billion, and that was a result of paying
off the intercompany loans. As of June 30, KML had total debt of CAD 189 million, which was attributable to CAD
190 million drawn on the construction and working capital facilities.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session in today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Jean Ann.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Hi, everyone. So now with the IPOs now behind you, I was wondering if you could give a
little more color on the concurrent processes that you were running and how you decided on the IPO, and anything in
hindsight that you would have done differently or maybe just communicated differently?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, we were I think very clear in that we were pursuing both projects simultaneously and we
were maintaining a certain amount of competitive tension as a result, so we fully prosecuted both processes
simultaneously.
I think the considerations around the IPO that were attractive were project governance. You can only have one driver of
the car when you're executing on a project of this magnitude. Certainly, we viewed the value proposition as good. We
thought that by combining all of our Canadian assets into one entity, we were creating a very attractive prospect for the
market and had the ability to self-fund the capital needs of the entity going forward. So overall, it made sense for us to
do the IPO, and that's the result we ended with.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: That makes sense. And could you just give a little more color on why you decided to do
the split between the share buybacks and the dividend raise? I know you had many trajectories that you could have
followed.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes, so we think that we're generating cash that's in excess, that's surplus. So it's in excess of
our needs for our capital projects while we're building them out, and so we see the room to return essentially all of that
excess cash to shareholders. And we chose a significant dividend increase – I think that's very positive for shareholders
– but also a share repurchase, which is unique in our sector. That gives us the ability to be opportunistic when we see
an opportunity to return value to shareholders through a share repurchase rather than locking it all in on a dividend
increase.

So we think it's a good mix of ways to return capital to shareholders, return value to shareholders; substantially
growing dividends, still very well covered, extremely well covered, as Rich pointed out, with a share buyback program
as a backstop, which gives us some flexibility to take advantage of opportunities.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And certainly, I would add that opportunistic purchase of shares is certainly something we
would be interested in, particularly since right now our share-to-DCF ratio is about 5 turns below our peer group
average, so we think it's mispriced in that sense.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: That makes sense, thank you for putting out that trajectory. That's all for me. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brandon. How are you?
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: I'm good, Rich. It sounds like a pretty good day on your side of the phone.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We think so.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: So I guess let's start with KML, a decent equity currency there. Clearly, there's a little bit
of equity funding to come. But maybe it's too early and not a fair question, but where do you see that entity ultimately
going to in terms of public float size? What kind of strategic things could you do with that particular entity over time?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: So first, in terms of the public, we do not intend as KMI to sell down additional shares from our
interests. But the entity may do primary offerings to help raise the capital needed to fund its expansion. We also talked
about on the road that it is a good currency, and there are opportunities on the M&A front that we would like to
consider, and we will do that. Those are very hard to predict or to call or forecast, as you know, but we think there are
some good opportunities up there and we like a lot of the assets that we see in Western Canada. So I think it is a good
currency. We think it will help us raise capital and also maybe in acquisition currency.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Nice answer. More detailed question. Gulf Coast Express, what's the timeline to getting
that into the backlog as you see it today?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: So as I said, we're trying to ripen some very strong interest into firm agreements. We think that
that is a matter of weeks to months in order to get that done. Again, we think we're making a very good offering to the
market out there. We provide good takeaway capacity from Waha into South Texas where it connects with our
intrastate system, which we're very proud of. It reaches all the key markets that I think producers will be looking for
takeaway to.
Houston Ship Channel's now a premium market in the gas market and that's driven by the fact that we've got LNG
power gen, petchem development and Mexico demand that pulls very hard on our system. And so we think we have a
very fine offering and there is a strong degree of interest in it, but we're not counting it until we've got them all in.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Fair enough. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open, sir.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. Just for starting off with Jean's question about
the buyback versus the dividend, I guess I was wondering how much did the current stock price in your current
multiple relative to peers play into the decision to shoot for a buyback. And then I was wondering if you can comment
about the duration or the expectation of how long it will take you to execute the buyback. Is that something we should
think as ratably over three years, or something that you'd like to achieve sooner than that?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think first of all, what we've given you is an outline of the future for the time period 2018,
2019 and 2020, so I think you can expect it over those three years. Obviously, we will be opportunistic in the way that
we utilize those funds for stock repurchases. But we think this is a very strong combination of having the dividend
increase that is substantial, 60% next year and 25% two years after that, together with some firepower reserves for
opportunistically buying back our own stock, while at the same time, funding all of our expansion CapEx with
internally-generated funds. And that really does two things. It keeps a very nice ratio of coverage of the dividend,
which I think is important.
And secondly, it continually improves the balance sheet because we are using our own internally-generated funds to
produce assets that will generate more EBITDA. So I think it's a win-win all the way around the horn. And that's our
reasoning process.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Good answer. And as a follow-up question, with respect to Gulf Coast Express, I
know there was a lot of interest in the open season and, from your prepared comments, 2019 sort of seems to be the
target. Do you sense if that can potentially be brought up sooner than that, just given the level of interest? And any
sense on how much would it cost? Is there kind of like an estimate per mile that we should be thinking about?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We are in a competitive situation and we're not giving our cost estimate, for reasons I'm sure
you understand. I think, look, the producer timing is a little bit different. It varies from one to another, and there are
some shippers who are more in a hurry than others. And because we are talking about a Texas intrastate bill, not a
FERC certificate bill, we may be able to accommodate earlier in-service dates for those customers who are in a bigger
hurry, at least getting them to some market outlets. And so we're definitely in discussions about how we can go about
doing that. And having it as a Texas intrastate project gives us the flexibility to do that, that we wouldn't have in an
interstate natural gas pipeline project.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And just two little housekeeping questions on TMX. Is there any sign-offs you
need from BC to keep the construction date on schedule? And do you have the CO2 spend for the quarter?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: You want to do the CO2 spend first?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. CO2 spend for the quarter was $118 million, including our overhead allocations.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. And Ian Anderson, President of KML, is here and he can answer your question on BC.
<A - Ian D. Anderson>: Yes. On BC, as you know, we've got our primary environmental certificate for BC we got
earlier this year, and we continue to need a good number of local permits from British Columbia and Alberta, for that
matter, as they relate to crossings, road crossings, utility access, Crown lands, et cetera. And those permits are
continuing to be advanced and filed and work continues on them with British Columbia and with Alberta, in line with
our construction schedule that will have us commencing in September.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much, guys.

<Q - Theodore Durbin>: I'm okay, Rich. Thanks. Just following up on that last question, I guess. We do have a new
government and it does seem that they are opposed, it sounds like, to TMX expansion. I guess how are you going to
navigate some of the objections that have been brought up by this new government? What roadblocks or obstacles
might we need to watch for as you move forward into construction?
<A - Ian D. Anderson>: Ted, as I said, the permitting process is ongoing. It's continuing to progress, and we feel
comfortable with that, in line with our construction plans. I'm not going to speculate on what an NDP government
might do in British Columbia at this stage in order to advance their views. We remain very confident in the federal
decision that we have and the jurisdiction that the project has federally. I've worked cooperatively with several
provincial and federal governments over the years for the development of this project. And I want to do the same with
Premier Horgan's government. I do look forward to talking to him soon and updating him on the project and our
ongoing commitments to engage with communities and First Nations to advance a project that's in the national interest.
So I think we'll just wait and see what Premier Horgan wants to do and I look forward to his call.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay, great. And then if I can come back to the buyback and not just buyback versus
dividend but buyback versus – let's call it organic growth. I guess would you be buying back shares now given the
choice of using your capital there versus sanctioning a new project at, let's just say, the average build multiple, maybe a
seven times build multiple that you have in backlog right now? How do think about that choice?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We think about it in terms of the return for the capital that we're deploying. And we think that
at the current stock price, that is an attractive investment opportunity for us. We have a significant buildout which
we've already accounted for in our backlog in determining what the surplus cash was and have the flexibility to add
additional projects to it. But the commitment we're making is that over and above the cash that we need in order to
invest in capital projects, we're going to return essentially all of that to shareholders. It's going to be in the form of a
dividend but also in the form of share buybacks where those make sense.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay, great. And then one last one and I just wanted to be clear on this because there is a
mention of Kinder Morgan Canada being self-funding. Does that imply that you will no longer consolidate the debt that
you'll incur to build TMX? Or is that still going to come through in terms of your debt-to-EBITDA calculation?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: No. We will consolidate KML.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We'll consolidate the EBITDA and we will consolidate the debt. And so that will be in
our numbers. What I meant by self-funding is we don't expect at this point that KMI will have to contribute equity into
KML or buy KML's equity is another way to say it in order to help KML fund the expansion project.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And just to be clear, those numbers starting with the CAD 6.1 billion remaining funds
necessary to construct were Canadian dollar numbers that Kim was mentioning. So I think she gave you, Ted, a pretty
clear path showing how KML really will be self-funding.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Makes total sense. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Darren.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good afternoon, Rich. Hope you all are doing well and congratulations on the
announcements to enhance shareholder value. My first question, Steve, with regard to the Permian gas volumes out of
Waha into South Texas and you all have done a good job outlining this. But can you just give us at least a rough sense
of what you think the scale and cost of EPNG capacity expansions could look like? And more importantly, how you
balance committing capacity on that line versus Gulf Coast Express?

Obviously, if Gulf Coast Express, at least by our math, gets committed to 1.7 Bcf or 1.8 Bcf a day; it's going to be north
of $1 billion project. That's going to have a different return threshold relative to what you can do on EPNG, again by
our math. And then bigger picture, do you think logistically it's just a situation where the magnitude of downstream
demand pulled out of Waha could handle both the potential for 1.8 Bcf of commitments on Gulf Coast Express to Agua
Dulce as well as scaling up EPNG?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay, yeah. Good questions. And so the key thing to understand is really the expansions on
EPNG are really complementary to the Gulf Coast Express Project. So the EPNG expansions are about getting gas to
Waha. And just simplistically, what Gulf Coast Express is about is about getting gas away from Waha to the premium
market that is now in East Texas. And so they're very complementary.
In terms of the capital on EPNG, as I mentioned, we've got some fairly significant volume opportunities, one tranche of
which is out in an open season right now and then potentially a subsequent open season. Now there's numbers like 500
million cubic feet a day, Tom (sic) [Darren] on one of the open seasons. And there isn't a significant amount of capital
that's required. So think of things like just being able to direct more gas to Waha by installing backpressure valves and
additional meters and the like. Those things – those are relatively modest capital expenditures. And so very, we think,
very attractive and again very complementary of what we're trying to accomplish on Gulf Coast Express.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: As a follow-up, Steve, how much of a competitive advantage is it of yours that you guys
can help backstop not only the capacity on Gulf Coast Express but also some of these expansions, the complementary
expansions on EPNG, just given the fact that you guys can buy 1-plus Bcf a day of gas across the system?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes, and we think it gives us an advantage. And it is on both ends of the system as you point
out. EPNG has a nice network in the Permian. And to the extent we can feed additional gas to Waha, which we believe
we can at attractive returns for the small amount of capital that we would spend there, that provides a good supply end
for Gulf Coast Express. And then on the market end, as I mentioned, we think we've got an excellent Texas Intrastate
system that's tied in with Mexico, LNG, petchem demand, power demand, Houston Ship Channel, industrial demand
and utility demand in the Greater Houston area. It's a great network with great connectivity. And so Agua Dulce used to
kind of be in the middle of nowhere. You can get to Agua Dulce and now you can get to Houston, which is all of a
sudden really somewhere in terms of value for the gas molecule.

Our next question comes from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Craig. Good afternoon.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good afternoon, Rich. What you said about no borrowings to support growth CapEx, was that
intended to mean through 2020?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And do you think that's long term sufficient or are you questioning the size of your
growth CapEx -
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: No, look, in developing our dividend policy for the next three years, which we are
unveiling this afternoon, we looked at our expected capital needs from now through 2020 and obviously concluded that
we had room to raise the dividend, still fund all of our capital needs internally and we use the excess to buy back
shares. So that's all factored in. And we anticipate that we will continue to fund all of that growth capital with internally
generated funds. I think we sometimes miss in all of the noise what a huge consistent generator of cash flow this
company really is. And I think what we're talking about this afternoon really demonstrates that when you look at what
we're talking about in terms of being able to maintain a significant capital expenditure budget and still increase the

dividend and still have money left over for buying back shares on an opportunistic basis.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And so the other important aspect of that, Craig, is that it helps us continue with some natural
delevering and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So for the longer term, and we've been saying this for a while,
what we're really aiming for is a strong investment-grade balance sheet. And we expect to see some natural continuing
delevering there. We're not done with that. A growing return of value to our shareholders in the form of a growing and
well-covered dividend and share repurchases, both of which we discussed today – announced today, and then having
the continued capacity to fund new capital investments. And so we think that we have struck this right in terms of
what's going to create value for our shareholders overall.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Steve or maybe Kim, if you want to chime in, do you see at the end of this three-year
timeframe getting to a point where you don't really need to worry about enhancing the balance sheet and maybe it
would be more opportune into the next decade to start funding half of growth CapEx for opportunity sets, let's say, 7
times EBITDA with some low-cost debt?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes, absolutely.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: That sounds good. And then my last follow-up, all this is predicated on the ability to sustain
long-term new project origination. Can you comment in the quarter about the specifics about the gas pipes and CO2
projects originated? And can you opine about the recurring opportunity set to get to that $2.5 billion a year figure? Do
you see the EPNG and Gulf Coast Express that you've talked about as indicative of the opportunities in front of you and
that there will be more of that over time?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, so narrowly, we have been constantly reallocating capital and adding some capital to
CO2 where we see good return in projects. In Gas, we had a project for an LDC customer as well as some gathering
and processing CapEx that got added. And what that was offsetting was in the Terminals business we had taken
delivery of a ship that's now under charter, that has been under charter. So those were the small pieces.
But really as I said, particularly in Gas, we're seeing opportunities. Gulf Coast Express is the headline one. But we're
seeing good opportunities that are being driven by power demand, the need to connect power plants, to some extent by
gathering and processing, but also Mexico and LNG. And so we're seeing the need. Natural gas demand and production
is growing over the longer term, and that's going to drive some opportunities for us. And we have a great network. And
so that means it doesn't have to be a greenfield expansion. It could be an expansion off of an existing – in fact, it's
better if it's expansion off of an existing part of our network where we can potentially gain higher returns. So we're
starting to see that, I would say, particularly in the Natural Gas sector.

today and with the capital opportunities we see today, we believe that's going to leave a substantial amount of cash
that's available for share repurchase over the period.
And then finally, we do expect to be opportunistic, which means that we will be price-sensitive in how we do our share
repurchases. We haven't set a target price and we're also not just going to be mechanically buying at the market. So
those are broad parameters, I know. But I think we've given a pretty good set of guidance on a $2 billion share buyback
program over this three-year period.
<Q - Jeremy Bryan Tonet>: Great, thanks for that. And just wanted to follow up on the capital markets. It sounds like
you guys don't need to access the equity or debt markets because surplus cash flow is going to cover all your growth
CapEx. Would it be fair to say you'd only go to the markets if something upside materializes and you wanted the
capital for that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: What we're trying to do is position ourselves – what we have done is position ourselves not to
have to access the capital markets, whether that's debt or equity. It's hard to project whether there might be some set of
circumstances in which that makes sense to do. But what we've done is make sure that we don't have to.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And we will be accessing...
<Q - Jeremy Bryan Tonet>: Great.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: ...debt markets to refinance the maturing debt. But what we're talking about here is
finance growth CapEx.
<Q - Jeremy Bryan Tonet>: Great, and just one last one. I just wanted to follow up on TMX timeline extension. I just
wanted to see when is the activity really going to pick up for the construction? Have you guys ordered the pipe yet, or
how should we think about the CapEx outlay at KML then?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: As far as the construction planning goes, we have initiated our first pipe order. We're finalizing
our contracts with our general contractors, and I expect those to be finalized sometime between now and the middle of
August. Construction activity will commence in September, according to plan. We won't have mechanical construction
of the pipeline underway until early next year, and that was always the plan. And that's all in line with the completion
date of the end of 2019.
<Q - Jeremy Bryan Tonet>: Great, thanks so much.

Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Hey, Rich. Thanks a lot for the time this evening and thanks for taking my
questions. I just have a couple follow-ups on some of the topics already hit. I guess to start, the dividend and share
repurchase questions. I'm obviously not trying to pin you to any firm commitment in terms of timing or cadence. But
the KMI of old, dividend increases were nearly a quarterly event. So I'm just curious if you're planning to resume that
type of cadence, or if it's still like an annual step-up like a utility company, for example, might do?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It's an annual step-up. But what we're saying is and we've said in the release that the
increase, Chris, is next year going $0.50 to $0.80. That will begin with the first quarter of next year. So in other words,
the dividend that we pay for the first quarter of 2018 will be $0.20, and it will be flat for the year. And then again, we
would anticipate taking that from $0.80 to $1.00 and then $1.00 to $1.25, and we would just flatten that out over the
year.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Got it, okay, perfect. And then just – I think I understand it but just want to clarify
it. In terms of the authorization, I guess I'm a little bit curious as to how the board determined the magnitude of the

share repurchase authorization. It sounds like – but I don't want to read in if this is not what you intended. It sounds like
$2 billion is the number that you could envision executing or exhausting between 2018 and 2020. Is that the right way
to interpret that, or was it just a nice round number that we could have out there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It is a nice round number. You have interpreted it correctly. Look, we did a lot of work,
hundreds of hours, Kim and her team, with input from all of our business segments to develop this on a bottoms-up
basis. And what we came out with, we stress-tested. We looked at it from a lot of different vantage points. And this we
thought was the optimum structure. And that's the number that came out in the wash now. We'll see how all this plays
out over those three years. But that's certainly our game plan, as we said, is to take the dividend up and to have that
amount of money left to buy back shares, and again and very importantly, continue to improve the balance sheet
because we're funding our capital expenditures out of cash flow.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay, but two additional questions, if I could. Just a clarification on the KML
side. I get the point around, obviously, the consolidation. So, Kim, just to clarify your comment about $3.1 billion of
expansion CapEx, that was sort of the net to KMI portion. But what we should see represented on the cash flow
statement is a consolidated figure over time.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: I'm sorry...
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: ...in our 10-Qs, we've put in a CapEx table in there of the CapEx that we're expecting for
the year. And we're going to break it out between KMI and KML because we'll be consolidating KML so that you can
see the total consolidated and you can see the KMI-only piece.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. And then related to Steve's – I think, Steve, you fielded a question about
KML's financing strategy. In the S-1, you guys were talking about perhaps and maybe some distribution recycling. I
was just curious. I know you said you're not planning to sell down KMI's interest. But do you have any refined
guidance as to what you're planning to do with the cash distributions on the KMI loan portion? Does that get recycled
at all, or is that...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: On the KMI piece, we'll probably do – 25% of our distribution we would reinvest.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. And do we just think about that then, Kim, as you effectively using that to
buy additional equity, but keep the cash on the balance sheet use up there to fund the program?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Right. It's funding the expansion CapEx, yes.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Yeah, okay. And then just final question for me. The debt fair value adjustment
figure came down precipitously in 2016. It's been hovering around $1.1 billion for the last couple of quarters. Just
curious. As you go through the refinancing, as debt maturities come up and you place new debt to replace that, should
we see that number continue to drift lower or any guidance as to how we can think about that might be helpful?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: The debt fair value number moves for a number of different reasons; one, as interest
rates move, and two, as our credit spreads move. And so if you can – knowing where interest rates are going to go –
you have to know where interest rates are going to go and where our credit spreads are going to go to be able to predict
what's going to happen with that over time. And so if you look at where we can finance a 10-year right now, we can
issue around 4%. And the maturities that are coming up in the near term are going to be at higher rates than that.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay, thanks again for all the time this evening. I appreciate it.

<Q - Michael Blum>: Hey. Thank you very much. I guess first question is you previously talked about a 5 times target
for leverage. Is that still the target? And if so, what do you think is the timeline to achieve it now?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. I think that is still the target. And I think we've made substantial progress towards
that target, which is why we felt comfortable with the dividend and share repurchase guidance that we're giving today.
If you look at our debt balance at 9/30 of 2015, which was the end of the last quarter before we reduced the dividend,
we paid down over $5.8 billion in debt since that period in time. And so now I think the deleveraging is going to come
through two methods. One is EBITDA growth as these projects come on. And two, because we're funding our projects
with 100% equity because we're funding it with the retained cash flow. And so we will continue to make progress
towards the 5 times. But it's going to be a little slower in reducing that leverage than we have been to date because we
are returning some value to shareholders at this point in time given that we have a little bit more flexibility with our
balance sheet.
<Q - Michael Blum>: Okay. And then for your dividend guidance out to 2020, you gave some coverage targets as
well. What are you assuming for growth capital as a run rate from 2018 to 2020 to sort of pay out that dividend,
maintain the coverage, the buybacks, et cetera?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It varies by year. And so, basically, we ran out the backlog. And then we made some
assumptions around what we thought opportunities would look like. So we just put in some unidentified capital in
there. And to the extent that we've had high-probability projects that weren't in the backlog, we would have included
those as well. So we tried to take a holistic look at what we thought CapEx would look like going forward, not just
running out the backlog.
<Q - Michael Blum>: Can you say what the kind of average annual is for the three years?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: I don't remember what it was, Michael.
<Q - Michael Blum>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from Linda Ezergailis from TD Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Linda Ezergailis>: Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the update on the Trans Mountain Expansion
permitting and construction timelines. I was just wondering if you could maybe also give us a sense of what might
define the tempo of construction in terms of potentially any sort of gating factors tied to permitting or other
considerations that might affect the pace of construction or what sort of slack you've built in to account for some
uncertainties?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I think, Linda, the way to think about it is that commencing this fall, the bulk of the work
is going to be preparation for major construction commencing next year and that was always the plan. So the permit
acquisition and the priority of permitting activities is built around that. So I think that you look at what do you need to
do to prepare to construct and with things like clearing and terminal work and preparation of sites, et cetera. And so
that's the kind of activity that we'll likely be involved in this year commencing in September with more of the heavy
lifting occurring early next year.
<Q - Linda Ezergailis>: Thank you. And would you be able to perhaps stratify the remaining CAD 6.1 billion cost
between parts, labor and anything else?
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: I don't have that breakdown in front of me, Linda. Obviously, the bulk of the costs are labor
costs. And the bulk of those costs will be incurred in 2018 and 2019 with a peak some time in later 2018. But I don't
have it stratified any greater than that.

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. And so I think this is – if you look at it, then construction is still to come. So that's going
to be construction, equipment, materials, all of those things. The amounts that would have been spent to this point
would have been more around land acquisition and permitting costs and the like. So now the costs going forward are
going to be more of construction and the materials and equipment. Construction, including labor.
<Q - Linda Ezergailis>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisors.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Becca. How are you?
<Q - Becca Followill>: I'm good. Thank you. Just following up on Michael's question. You're targeting, I think, 5.1
times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2017. Target is to get to 5 times. If you're funding 100% of your capital needs with
cash flow, that seems like that would take you well under or just slightly under the 5 times going into 2018. So you
would already be there. Then you'd have excess cash. So can you help me reconcile that with a buyback over a
three-year period and the target of 5 times?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think what we've said is we're at 5.1 times today at the end of
the second quarter, that we would expect to end the year at 5.2 times, that we ended the quarter on our debt balance a
little bit lower than we were expecting because some of our expansion capital pushed to the second half of the year. So
I think we're still on target to end next year at 5.2 times. And then -
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: To end 2017.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: To end 2017 at 5.2 times. Then next year on a fully-consolidated basis, we're going to
show the Trans Mountain revolver, the Trans Mountain construction facility in our numbers. And so our
debt-to-EBITDA numbers will be bearing the full load of the expansion CapEx. And so it will take some time – even
though we're funding all of our other CapEx with 100% equity, it will take some time to bring that down to 5.0 times.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. That's exactly what I needed. Thank you.
