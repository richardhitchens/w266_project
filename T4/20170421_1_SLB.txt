Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will
be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant
Thank you. Hello and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2017 results conference call. Today's call is
being hosted from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call
today are Paal Kibsgaard, Simon Ayat, and Patrick Schorn.
We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we'll open up for questions. However, before we
begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today
are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from
those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.
Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website.
With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat, who will present the first quarter corporate results and also review the
results by group.

Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per
share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represent a decrease of $0.02 sequentially and $0.15 when
compared to the same quarter last year.
During the current quarter, we recorded $0.05 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our first quarter revenue of
$6.9 billion decreased 3% sequentially, largely driven by the Cameron Group as a result of project completions and
reduced product sales. Pre-tax operating margin only decreased by 42 basis points to 11%.
Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased
3% sequentially, primarily due to project completions in Testing & Process systems and seasonally lower SIS software
and multiclient license sales. These decreases were offset in part by progress on early production facility projects in the
Middle East and improved Wireline revenue in North America. Margin decreased 170 basis points to 17%, driven by
the lower contribution from SIS software and multiclient sales.
The Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, while margins were sequentially flat at 11.5%.
Strong activity in North America was offset by lower activity and pricing pressure internationally across the group.
Production Group revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, and margins fell by 78 basis points to 5%. These
results were primarily driven by strong pressure pumping activity and pricing recovery in North America land, which
was offset by seasonally lower completion product sales and lower SPM revenue.
The Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 9% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by
OneSubsea as a result of declining project volumes, reduced product sales in Surface Systems and a further drop in
Drilling Systems also contributed to the decline. Margins decreased 80 basis points to 13%. Despite the revenue
decline, OneSubsea margins still exceeded 20% for the third straight quarter as a result of strong project execution.
While the drilling backlog was essentially flat, the OneSubsea backlog increase largely reflected the Mad Dog 2 award.
The book-to-bill ratio for our long cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these
businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 15.3% in the first
quarter compared to 15.8% in the previous quarter. Looking forward, the ETR will be very sensitive to the geographic
mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. With a continued recovery in North America, we
anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the course of the year.
We generated $656 million of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we
typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation, as
well as the payment of $140 million in severance during the quarter. We also continued to experience payment delays
from certain customers, primarily in Latin America.
Our net debt increased $1.3 billion during the quarter to $11.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and
investments of $7.6 billion. During the quarter, we spent $372 million to repurchase 4.7 million shares at an average
price of $78.97. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $380 million on CapEx and
investments of approximately $145 million in SPM projects, and $115 million in multiclient. During the quarter, we
also made $696 million of dividend payments and $221 million in Borr Drilling. Full-year 2017 CapEx, excluding
SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.
And now I will turn the conference over to Patrick.
Patrick Schorn
Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Starting off with North America, our first quarter revenue increased
6% sequentially, as growth in U.S. land and Western Canada was partially offset by further activity reductions in the

U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada. As expected, the North America land market continued to strengthen during
the first quarter in terms of both activity and pricing, leading us to start full-scale deployment of idle capacity for most
product lines. Revenue growth was led by hydraulic fracturing and drilling services, but also increasingly supported by
Artificial Lift, Service Systems and Valves & Measurement.
In spite of our capacity reactivation being heavily backend loaded, as we continue to adhere to our profitable growth
strategy, we still generated 16% sequential revenue growth in our hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling services
in U.S. land. And even more importantly, we delivered incremental margins of 66% for these services combined in
U.S. land, driven by productive customer engagements around pricing recovery and operational efficiency, together
with timely resource additions, new technology sales, and proactive supply chain management.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the first quarter revenue declined again sequentially, as the deepwater rig count dropped 15
at the end of March, which represents a reduction of 74% compared to the peak activity level of 2014.
In addition to the low drilling activity, we also saw a further sequential drop in seismic multiclient sales, leaving
offshore revenues at unprecedented low levels. In parallel with these record low level activity, products and services
pricing has in several recent cases fallen to levels that make it impossible for us to uphold our operating standards, and
at the same time turn a profit, in this extremely challenging operating environment. We are, therefore, in the process of
redeploying both service capacity and technical support resources from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to other more viable
markets.
Internationally, the first quarter revenue fell 7% sequentially, driven by stronger-than-expected seasonal decline in
activity and product sales, in – particularly in the North Sea, Russia land and China, and also by lower sequential
activity in key parts of the Middle East. On a positive note, revenues in Latin America were flat sequentially,
confirming that this region has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle.
The results were driven by solid activity in Brazil, further supported by multiclient seismic sales and strong OneSubsea
and Cameron Drilling Systems activity. This was offset by a range of activity challenges impacting our hydraulic
fracturing operations in Argentina, which has now been resolved, as well as production constraints imposed on our
Shushufindi SPM project in Ecuador.
Revenue in Europe, CIS, and Africa decreased 10% sequentially, driven primarily by the completion of large
OneSubsea project, lower Cameron Service Systems sales, reduced SIS software license sales, and a more severe
seasonal reduction in drilling-related activity throughout Russia, Kazakhstan, and the North Sea. Still, the activity in the
northern parts of ECA is expected to recover in the second quarter and we maintain a constructive outlook for the year
for both Russia and the North Sea.
In Africa, revenue was flat sequentially, which clearly indicates that this region has also reached the bottom of the
cycle. In North Africa, activity remained stable in Algeria during the first quarter and we also started preparations for
reentering Libya, and expect to start a small scale land operation in the second quarter after having been shut down on
land for the past three years.
Sub-Sahara Africa revenue was also flat sequentially, as early termination of ongoing drilling activity in Angola and
Gabon was offset by the start-up of two new deepwater projects in Congo and Senegal, as well as by strong growth in
land activity in Chad, Congo, and Ethiopia.
In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 7% sequentially, driven by lower product sales from the Cameron
Service and Drilling Systems product lines, and also by lower activity in service pricing pressures throughout the
Middle East, particularly impacting the Production Group.
In Asia, revenues in China and Australia were lower sequentially due to lower offshore drilling activity and by severe
seasonal weather impacting our land operation in both countries. And finally, the first quarter revenue in Malaysia and
Indonesia flat sequentially, confirming that we have reached the bottom of the cycle also here, but with no clear signs
yet of any significant activity recovery in this region.
With that, I will hand the call over to Paal.

Paal Kibsgaard
Think you, Patrick. Following the review of our first quarter results from Simon and Patrick, I will next provide you
with an updated business outlook. But before I do that, I would like to say a few words about the Cameron Group, as
we just passed the one-year mark since the closing of the transaction.
Over the past 12 months, we have successfully implemented the first phase of our integration plan, which included
three main themes. First, the co-location of 1,700 employees into joint facilities around the world; second, combining
Schlumberger and Cameron businesses to deliver enhanced offerings to our customers, such as our new Testing &
Process systems product line; and third, bringing together Cameron and Schlumberger technologies, for instance, in
hydraulic fracturing and in OneDrill, and by launching as many as 32 integrated R&D projects to further expand our
integrated technology offering.
At the same time, OneSubsea, which is now in its fifth year of existence, has firmly established a leadership position in
the subsea market through the pore-to-pipeline approach, as seen by the higher rate of project awards in recent quarters,
as well as their industry-leading operating margins. Overall, the entire Cameron integration program has exceeded the
ambitious first year synergy target we set and delivered approximately $400 million in operating income synergies, as
well as $600 million in new orders.
The first quarter results from the Cameron Group were again very solid, and I would like to compliment the entire
Cameron organization and the integration team on a job well done, where they had jointly ensured that the largest
transaction Schlumberger has done to-date has turned out to be a great success.
Turning next to the business outlook, we maintain our constructive view of the oil market and [Technical Difficulty]
(15:27) further inventory draws in the second quarter driven by the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts put in place
in January.
At present, [Technical Difficulty] (15:36) region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in
2017 is North America land, although investment levels in the Middle East and Russia are also expected to remain
resilient this year. However, for the rest of the world, which still make up more than 50 million barrels per day of oil
production, we are heading towards a third year of significant underinvestment, which increases the likelihood of a
medium-term supply deficit as produced reserves are not replaced in sufficient volume.
In particular, the market continues to focus on headline decline numbers that suggest that production is holding up well,
while a closer examination on the underlying data clearly shows that the rate of depletion of proven developed reserves
is rapidly accelerating in several key non-OPEC countries.
The current level of under-investments is most visible in exploration, where the record low investments, including both
drilling and seismic, led to a total amount of industry discoveries of less than 5 billion barrels in 2016 versus a
produced volume of over 30 billion barrels, dropping the industry-wide reserves replacement ratio to 32%.
Still at present there is no clear sign of any general increase in exploration spend, with the one exception being Mexico,
where we are seeing an increasing interest in the offshore multiclient surveys we have acquired over the past two years.
Looking next at our business outlook by region, the recovery will clearly be led by North America land, where
investment levels are expected to increase by 50% in 2017, leading to a strong increase in activity and an overdue
correction to service and product pricing. Through the organic and inorganic investments we have made in our North
America land business in recent years, we are very well set up to take a leading position in serving our customers in the
coming growth cycle.
In drilling, we have built a market-leading position by expanding our offering through the Smith and M-I SWACO
acquisitions, and through a broad, organic R&D program targeting the North America land market. As drilling
complexity continues to increase with even longer laterals, our purpose design technologies are starting to have a
significant impact on our customers' drilling performance. One example of this is the strong uptake of our AxeBlade

drillbit, which by itself has demonstrated a record 35% increase in rate of penetration for Matador in the Permian.
Furthermore, our PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable technology continues to be sold out for a third successive quarter.
And in an 80-well campaign for Parsley Energy in the Midland and Delaware basins, this technology contributed to a
17% reduction in the average drilling time per well and a 30% reduction in the drilling cost per lateral foot. Both of
these examples show the performance potential new technologies hold in the North America land market and
demonstrate the growth opportunities for our drilling offering as we continue to prepare for the introduction of our
OneDrill platform in the second half of this year.
We are also starting to see growth momentum in North America land for our market leading Artificial Lift offering,
where we recently also acquired a 49.9% stake in the HEAL technology from Production Plus Energy Services based in
Calgary. HEAL, which can be used in wells together with our ESP, plunger lift, and rod lift offering reduces fluid
slugging, depresses foam generation, contains solid and separates gas, which all together improves production and
reduces the need for workovers. We are presently at the introduction stage of this exciting new technology, which over
the first 140 installations have delivered an average production increase of 45%.
Within our hydraulic fracturing and completions offering, we have also made significant investments in recent years,
including the development of a fully automated surface delivery system and also by acquiring our own sand mines and
the associated vertically integrated distribution system, which will greatly improve our full cycle returns.
In terms of well productivity, the market uptake of our geoengineered completions continues to grow and the offering
is delivering significant value for our customers, as seen by the 18-well program we recently completed for Lonestar
Resources in the Eagle Ford Shale. Here we optimize drilling, stimulation, and completion plans across the long laterals
supported by our ThruBit formation evaluation data and BroadBand Sequence diversion technology. As a result, the
wells produced up to 86% more hydrocarbon per 1,000 feet of lateral, compared to offset wells in two other fields.
With proppant prices and distribution costs now starting to rapidly increase, we are also expecting to see a recovery in
the use of our HiWAY technology, which reduces proppant use by 40% and water use by 25%. Building on this broad
technology platform, the pending OneStim JV with Weatherford will give us the required scale in terms of both
hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions technologies to drive efficiency and market penetration in all the
unconventional basins in North America land. At this stage, the regulatory filings have been completed and as we await
the required approvals to close the OneStim transaction, the integration teams are making all the necessary preparations
for a successful day one of the new company.
Looking next at Latin America, the flat sequential revenue in the first quarter was a long-awaited positive confirmation
that this market has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. Going forward, there are emerging positive signs for our
business in the region, including opportunities for new commercial models in Brazil, as Petrobras continues its assets
divestment program and as a new focus is brought to mature land basins.
In Argentina, new plans to bring stability to natural gas prices should lead to higher investment levels, and we are also
excited about our recent agreement with YPF for a joint development in the Vaca Muerta shale.
In Europe, CIS and Africa, we see strengthening activity in the North Sea, Russia, and the Caspian region in the
coming quarters, as the winter season ends and new projects start-up. In Africa, we expect some activity improvement
in the North as we started a small-scale land operation in Libya after being shut down for the past three years. While we
see a slow, but steady, improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa over the coming quarters driven by a mix of land activity in
Chad, Congo and Ethiopia, and a limited number of deepwater startups in Congo, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast.
In the Middle East, activity will continue to be driven by the GCC countries. However, we do not expect significant
sequential growth from this region over the coming quarters, while in Asia we will see the normal seasonal recovery in
China.
Overall, it's clear that activity in international market has reached bottom in all regions. But even though we see
positive signs in many countries, we expect only moderate sequential activity growth in the coming quarters. This slow
recovery, together with the lingering pricing pressure, means that we will likely face another challenging year in the

international markets, while we expect an acceleration of the activity growth towards the backend of 2017 and into
2018.
With this market backdrop, we continue to actively position Schlumberger at the forefront of an industry that needs to
evolve. We do this by proactively managing our base business and responding to ongoing pressures of commoditization
by tailoring our offering, resources, and service performance to prevailing market conditions.
In parallel, we constantly look to expand our opportunity set in a period where the industry in many ways lacks overall
direction. This includes driving a broad and very active M&A program, engaging with existing and new customers to
establish closer collaboration and more aligned business models, and also expanding our offering from technical
support to now also taking a financial position alongside our customers in applicable projects, all with the aim of
generating more activity for our 19 product lines.
As we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the
future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for
the industry players that are ready and able to think new and to act new.
Thank you. With that, we will open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And one moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of
James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good afternoon, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good afternoon.
<Q - James West>: So given that you guys are holding your call from the Kingdom, the board meeting was well held
in the Kingdom as well, I'd love to hear kind of what – as you and the board talk about strategic focus over the next
several quarters, but also several years, and talk about the implementation of those strategies, what are the key kind of
top one, two, three items that you or that Schlumberger is most focused on in the near term and especially given your
broad international focus? And I think we understand where you stand in North America.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you are asking about particularly in Saudi Arabia, let me first say that the board has
spent actually a full week in Saudi Arabia, in between Jeddah, Riyadh, Shaybah, and Dhahran. We have visited the
KAUST University, a range of government institutions focused on science, technology and innovation, and of course,
we spent a lot of time with our largest customer, Saudi Aramco, both at their headquarters in Dhahran and in their field
operations in the south in Shaybah.
The board had a particular interest in broadening its understanding of both the Vision 2030 for the country as well as
the In-Kingdom Total Value Add program, which is also very important, and in particular how Schlumberger continues
to actively support these programs and also how we further strengthen our position in the Kingdom. Now, as part of our
visit, we also had the privilege of meeting His Excellency Khalid Al-Falih to discuss the state of the oil market, which
was also very useful for our board to do.
Now everywhere we went, we have been met by exceptional hospitality, and the board was actually very impressed
with everything that we saw and everything that is going on in the Kingdom. So this has really served as a further
extension of our understanding of all the details of what's going on in the country, and that is helping both the board
and the senior management team, which was also here, to further adjust and, I would say, accelerate our plans of
investment in the country.

<Q - James West>: Okay. That's great. It's very helpful, Paal. Maybe just a quick follow-up for me. You recently
announced the new special venture fund and you made some very quick moves there with that fund. Could you perhaps
elaborate a little bit on the mandate here for the fund and what you see as the opportunity set?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. So just to be clear on what the fund is, so this is a new avenue for project investments
alongside our customers, and this is basically to enable closer collaboration and alignment with our customers. It is also
there to facilitate and support additional E&P investments and also for us, very importantly, to secure preferred supplier
agreements for our products and services for whatever these investments that we facilitate. So this is the overall driver
behind it.
Now, we understand that many of our customers do not see a need for this, but some customers do, and the key
principle for us that this fund and these investment opportunities is open to all customers. So the basic thing here is that
it's simply aiming to enable growth in the base business. Now the scope of the fund, again, is relatively open. We will
evaluate each project based on its standalone merits. We haven't at this stage set a limit for the size of the fund, but I
think, importantly as well, we're also open to possibly co-invest with third parties.
And, obviously, the fund will be subject to the same, I will say, governance and risk management processes that we
have for the base business. And ultimately, all the investment decisions will be approved by our CFO. So it's something
that is in place to facilitate further growth for the base business. I think that's the best summary of it.
<Q - James West>: Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you, James.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angeline M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning – good afternoon, guys, as well.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Angeline M. Sedita>: So, Paal, so could we go back to the U.S. a little bit? And obviously, the OneStim is a
surprising JV and interesting to see. So could you talk a little bit about your strategy there as far as redeploying the frac
fleet into the U.S. market? And if you could even have a target horsepower as you exit 2017? And maybe a little bit
about the logistics of the JV.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. I think we need to separate the JV from our current hydraulic fracturing business in North
America land. The JV will, obviously, include all that business when it's closed. But as of now, we continue to manage
our business in a standalone fashion, while we are preparing, obviously, to close the JV as soon as possible. So I will
comment briefly on our plans for activation of capacity for the base business today, and I'll have Patrick give you a few
comments around the OneStim JV and the plans post closure.
So if you look at the situation today on our fracking business, we always said that as soon as we have a clear pathway
towards profitability, we will start actively reactivating our idle capacity. This point in time actually passed in the first
quarter, so towards the back end of the first quarter we actually started actively reactivating our idle capacity. And this
process is going to accelerate in the second quarter and also going into H2. So based on the current plan we have at this
stage, we plan to have our entire idle capacity from the Schlumberger side deployed during the fourth quarter of this
year. So this is the current plan of reactivation.
We are getting, I would say, significant traction on pricing. We are actively hiring people both for the well side
operations and for the vertical integration part, including the transportation side of things as well. And I think the
balance we have between the in-sourcing of our vertical supply chain, together with still a very close working
relationship with our suppliers – and just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate. We will have a
certain amount of our capacity vertically integrated, and we will continue also to work closely with our suppliers both

on the sand mine side as well as transportation and distribution.
So we will continue now in the coming quarters to actively redeploy. And, obviously, when we close the OneStim JV,
these resources and these businesses will all be combined in OneStim, which will then just continue on the same
process.
So, Patrick, you want to say a few words about where we stand on OneStim and plans?
<A - Patrick Schorn>: So regarding the OneStim joint venture, which is a 70/30 joint venture with Weatherford for
North America land for hydraulic fracturing and completion, it really creates a new industry leader in terms of
hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions. Through its scale, it will offer a cost-effective and competitive
service delivery platform, which is uniquely positioned to provide customers with leading operational efficiency and
best-in-class hydraulic fracturing and completion technologies. Importantly, reliable equipment availability for our
customers and it will also improve significantly the full cycle shareholder returns from this particular market.
So in this case, Weatherford is contributing its leading multistage completions portfolio around 1 million horsepower in
pumping equipment and pump damper freighting business. And what we will end up with is a very capital-efficient
structure pooling the hydraulic horsepower to gain economies of scale, which clearly is very much timed to benefit
from the current market recovery. [indiscernible] (33:28) with that.
<Q - Angeline M. Sedita>: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful color. So as an unrelated follow-up, maybe you can
give a little bit of color on Cameron and what your outlook is for subsea overall as far as large projects and pricing and
even the Rig of the Future. Any update there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Patrick, do you want to cover that?
<A - Patrick Schorn>: Sure. So, firstly, we exceeded our first year synergy target and we realized approximately $400
million in savings there, and we already secured around $600 million in new synergy orders. So from that perspective,
the transaction is working well and the integration is going extremely well. So what we are focused on in Cameron is
really creating a fully integrated drilling and production system, combining our leading well and subsurface offering
with Cameron's leading service technology, further [Technical Difficulty] (34:30) instrumentation and software control
and optimization capabilities.
During Q1 overall the revenue was seasonally down, driven mainly by OneSubsea and Service Systems. And Service
and V&M posted [Technical Difficulty] (34:48) in U.S. land and a step change in bookings, and that is maybe the most
important, as was already mentioned by Simon as well, where we are starting to see that the book-to-bill is starting to
go over 1. The margin declined somewhat, but through strong execution and cost control, we limited the margin decline
to approximately 80 basis points.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: All right. Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much. I wonder whether – Paal or Simon, whether you could elaborate a little bit
on the increased participation in the customer projects. Under SPM you've highlighted in the prepared remarks that
payment from certain Latin America customers have slowed down and – how do you see the evolution, the impact on
return on capital? How big will the committed capital become? I think that's a line of questioning I think I get in every
single investor meeting when the topic of Schlumberger comes up.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I'll say going back to what I mentioned about the fund [Technical Difficulty] (36:09),
Ole. The fund itself is there to facilitate growth in the base business. So the way we look at the fund is that if we do
make investments alongside our customers, these investments will need to meet the return criteria that we have overall
as a company, and also the base business that we get associated with the project through preferred supplier agreements,

we'd also obviously need to meet the same return criteria. So I think the way to look at the fund is that we have a strong
balance sheet, we have strong cash flow, and we have a fair bit of cash on hand, and what we are doing on a selective
basis is looking for investment opportunities to facilitate more base business for the company.
Our revenues are still at around 50% of what they were eight, nine quarters ago, and we are trying very actively to
make sure that we can get baseline growth, not just in North America land, but also globally. And given the capabilities
that we have as a company, in particular around subsurface understanding and drilling and completions, we see this as a
very good way of [Technical Difficulty] (37:22) to drive, I would say, short and medium-term activity, but very
importantly these contracts that we enter into here could have durations of 10 to 15 to 20 years, which will also provide
us with a very good baseline of activity and earnings throughout the coming cycles as well.
So I don't think there should be a huge reason for concern around the capital intensity. We have capital available to
invest and we are trying to invest this wisely into projects that have good returns standalone, but also that facilitate
growth opportunities for the base business.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Thank you. On the revenue synergies with Cameron, $600 million, it's very difficult for us
to see what – will that come through with or without the joint venture. So can you elaborate a little bit about what type
of business is it that you've signed up that you don't think either Schlumberger or Cameron would have achieved on a
standalone basis? And maybe in the context of that, also comment a little bit on your rationale by investing in
[indiscernible] (38:29) Borr?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Patrick, why don't you talk about Cameron? I'll cover Borr when you're done with that.
<A - Patrick Schorn>: All right. So talking about some of the examples of revenue synergies, I think one of the
obvious one is clearly the expanding of Cameron's geographical reach, and using, as such, the Schlumberger existing
footprint to reach a far larger customer base. What it also helps with is accelerating the implementation of the
OneSubsea vision and plan as the cooperation between the companies is much closer today. And one of the first points
we had brought up when we started talking about opportunities was addressing the significant industry [indiscernible]
(39:14) issues related to BOPs, and here you have to really think about monitoring and how we would optimize the use
in that side.
And then where we really focus, and this might link into what we have discussed in the past when it comes to issues
like Rig of the Future, is creating an integrated drilling system, which would include all the service and [Technical
Difficulty] (39:37) service components that we offer, and obviously then optimize the drilling process to such an extent
that neither one of the single companies could achieve. That is really the main examples of revenue synergies.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. Thanks, Patrick. So, Ole, let me just comment quickly on Borr then. So as you've seen,
we made a $221 million investment to take a 20% stake in this new company. Now there are several drivers behind the
investment, but the main driver is really to create a platform where we can collaborate closely with Borr to offer
performance drilling offshore in shallow water. We see this as, I think, a significant opportunity for Schlumberger and
also for Borr to offer this new type of contract model, which is now heavily used on land, but also now to be used in
shallow water. Now, just for the record, we are also open to work with other offshore drillers on similar type of
performance contracts.
Now back to Borr, Borr also represents a significant potential market for Cameron Drilling, both in terms of BOPs and
drilling packages. And I will say lastly, looking at the company and the plans going forward, we also expect this to be a
very good financial investment. So this is the main rationale behind the investment.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. A question with regard to the incremental that you generated in
Lower 48 for frac and directional 66% I think for Q1. Patrick and Paal, just given the reactivation slate that you have in
front of you, which seems to be pretty large, do you expect to generate either that level of profit improvement over the
course of this year, or something within that neighborhood as you reactivate assets? The rest of the industry seems to
have difficulty with regard to revenue growth and converging that with profit improvement. That hasn't happened. But
in your case, it looks like the profit improvement was actually fairly considerable, and I'm just curious as to the
relationship between reactivation growth and margin improvement in light of that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: That's a good question, so I will kind of split it into two. When it comes to the one-time cost of
reactivating, yes, we will have some impact of that in the coming quarters. I will say, the underlying incrementals that
we are aiming for is going to be around this level, but we will be subject to some additional activation costs, I would
say, probably in the second and the third quarter, which might, for those two quarters, basically deliver slightly lower
incrementals overall. But the underlying, I will say, drive we have between getting customer price increases and driving
efficiency through scale as we reactivate, and also managing our supply chain, underlying we are aiming for those type
of incrementals, which we have talked about for the company for the past couple of years. We will have some
headwinds around one-time reactivation costs in the coming quarters, but beyond that we are looking to manage at this
level.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thank you. And then secondly with regard to Shushufindi, and I guess the
challenges that were reported in the media in recent weeks with regard to Ecuador, can you update us with regard to
what the forward path on that project looks like?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes, I can. And first of all, let me just clarify that we have several SPM projects in Ecuador
and the issues we are discussing are only pertaining to Shushufindi, all right?
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Just to give you some background on Shushufindi, we are now in the fifth successful year of
operations here. And in between the Shushufindi consortium, which we lead, and Petroamazonas, the state oil
company, we have a very solid governance model, and we have annual budgets and annual production targets which
are set and agreed.
And if you back for these five years, we have exceeded all these production targets, but what has happened is that with
the lower oil price, this has led to cash flow challenges for Petroamazonas. And they're also selling the oil that we
produce from the Shushufindi field. So they've basically then fallen behind on our payments, and this is really the key
issue. So the proposal they have made to address the payment issues is not acceptable, and the situation over the first
quarter has been further aggravated by the fact that they have imposed also production constraints on the output from
the Shushufindi field.
So bottom line, we find this treatment of a partner who has made significant investments in the country somewhat
disappointing, but still we are very confident that the issues are going to be resolved, either amicably or by using the
dispute resolution provisions that are in the contract. So that's kind of where we are. How long it's going to take to get it
resolved, I can't say at this stage, but we are ready to sit down again and continue discussions, and there have been a
number of meetings and discussions over the past couple of months. We are ready to continue these discussions as soon
as the imposed production constraints are lifted.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.

huge surprise, but the activity reduction did stand out to me. I was just wondering is there a specific country that's
experiencing this. And do you think this comes back later in the year, or is this more of an adjustment to the drilling
programs? I just wondered if you could just provide a little bit more color on the GCCs.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, so I wouldn't use the word weakness, David. I think we have a slight decline in overall
activity and revenue in the Middle East. Obviously, [Technical Difficulty] (45:51) in Asia that weighs in on the overall
MEA numbers. So I don't think there's anything that concerns us or worries us that should concern or worry you, but
we are not seeing any significant growth in the coming quarters. We are slightly down, like I said, [Technical
Difficulty] (46:10). This is more around, I would say, project mix, priorities and so forth, right?
So I would say the underlying business in the Middle East is very resilient. There are strong and clear plans in each of
the countries we operate here, so no major worries. It's just that there is no, I would say, significant steady [Technical
Difficulty] (46:32) growth either in Q1 or in the coming quarters. Just a very steady, resilient base business.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up would be on the offshore side. It seems like IOCs just
don't seem eager to invest offshore. We haven't really seen much on the step out and tieback front. I was just wondering
if you could maybe elaborate. We had talked in the past maybe five-day big projects potentially being announced in the
back part of the year. Has your views on offshore shifted a little bit? I was just wondering if you could help us kind of
what is the roadmap you think to recovery in offshore. Is this getting pushed out maybe more into an 2018 event and
when we start to see some of these projects awarded?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, we see the same as you, all right? So there has [Technical Difficulty] (47:13) so far of
significant FIDs plans being discussed of things going on offshore. If you look at jackup utilization, I think there is a
slight uptick on it, so I think there is probably some early signs that we'll get some light work coming our way as an
industry in the next couple of quarters. But in terms of bigger projects, I agree with you, we haven't seen anything yet.
So I think the main thing here is, I think for the IOC customers to basically get a better medium-term view on oil prices
– and, obviously, the positive uptick we've seen over the past couple of quarters is [Technical Difficulty] (47:55). But I
would assume that they're also looking for what the floor could be and maybe awaiting potentially what OPEC is going
to do as we go into the May – or the late May meeting around whether they extend the production cuts or not.
So I agree with you. I think the increase in offshore activity or shallow water activity is probably more going to be a
second half of the year event leading into 2018. So with that, though, it's still very important for us as a company to at
least secure the work that is coming out of projects that are being FID'd, and that's why we are very happy and excited
the fact that we landed the Mad Dog 2 project, for instance.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. Thank you, Paal.

<Q - James Wicklund>: A lot of questions asked, so if I could drill down a little bit on North America. Patrick, you
made comments about increased vertical participation in sand and additional sand mines. Can you tell us what you guys
have done here in the last couple of quarters in terms of assuring capacity, delivery and making a little extra money, I
guess, too in North American sand?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I'll cover that, Jim. So what we have done, we basically started this vertical integration
investment program towards the back end of 2014. And we have made a number of investments in sand mines, which

are now starting to come on production. And in addition to that, we obviously also invested further into owning rail
cars, owning transloading facilities. And we also are now – we have established our own trucking fleet, where we are
now hiring people into manning the trucks that we have both and that we are currently buying.
But just to be clear, we are not looking to vertically integrate 100% of our capacity need. We will do a fair bit of it, but
we are still going to rely on the long-term suppliers that we've had, both in the upturn as well as in future downturns.
But we see the investments that we make into this with the rapid cost inflations that you typically see starting at this
part of the cycle as a very good investment and a way to insulate ourselves from the massive supply chain inflation that
we saw in the previous cycle, right? So it's going to be a balancing between vertical integration 100% owned by us, as
well as using the supply chain capabilities that we have in the open market.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay. And my follow-up in kind of the same vein, you talk about the completion capacity
that Weatherford brings in OneStim. I know that 80% of the completions that we do in the U.S., 80% plus are
plug-and-perf, and sliding sleeve has been marginalized. I know that Weatherford does both plug-and-perf and sliding
sleeve. What is Schlumberger's view of how those two technologies are going to develop? And is everything going to
be plug-and-perf in a couple years, or can you talk about where that technology is going to go? We don't really know a
whole lot of details about the breakdown of Weatherford's business. Well, frankly, of yours in that regard. So if you
give us some guidance on where the market is headed, that'd be appreciated.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. Well, I think first of all, the multistage completion offering that Weatherford brings into
the JV and also combined with ours will have a complete range of both open hole and cased hole solutions. Now, if you
look at where the market has been heading I would say in the last three, four, five years, it has been gradually moving
more and more to plug-and-perf, with less, I would say, open hole completions and sliding sleeves. There's still more of
that type of completions in Canada compared to what you have in U.S. land.
So I would say that we are basically set up for – if the market continues the current trend towards more plug-and-perf
and cased hole, or whether there is a reemergence of the open hole, so I think we have a very good balance and we can
go either way. I think it's going to come down to well performance, productivity, and completion costs in terms of
what's going to govern this, but we are set up well in either way, Jim.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Great. Hey, awesome information flow so far, so I figured I'd kind of get right to the crux
of probably what a lot of people are trying to gauge from all this great information is, how do you feel about the
progression on the Street numbers as we look out into the second quarter?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, there the question came. That's good. Well, I would say that in the second quarter, first
of all, at a high level we are expecting to see a continuation of the main trends that we saw in the first quarter. And then
if you break out North America and international, for North America we expect solid top-line growth in Q2, and this is
going to be driven, again, by what we saw in Q1 as well, further growth in the rig activity, for us additional pricing and
market share gains in directional drilling, and also, as we talked about earlier on the call, an acceleration of the capacity
reactivation in fracking.

Now underlying incremental margins, as I commented on earlier, should be solid. But in Q2 and probably Q3 as well,
they're going to be partly offset by some of these one-time startup costs that we are having. And also in the second
quarter we are, as usual, also footing the cost of the Canadian breakup. But overall, I would say, strong top-line growth
and decent earnings growth for us in North America in the second quarter, with some small headwinds around the
startup costs.
Internationally, as I said earlier, we have reached bottom in all markets, but for the second quarter we only see at this
stage flat underlying activity in Q2. So really the only growth that we are going to see in the second quarter is going to
be limited to the seasonal recovery in the North Sea, Russia, and China.
Now, on the Cameron side, revenue is also expected to be more or less flat, where we are seeing solid growth in the
short cycle businesses of Service and V&M, but it's going to be offset by the slowing decline on the long cycle
businesses, so OneSubsea and Drilling. So if you combine all of this, I believe that a sequential EPS growth of around
15% to 20% between Q1 and Q2 is a reasonable expectation.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great. That's fantastic. Now, based on your commentary about pricing pressures in the
international market, and it sounded like a recovery still at hand in the second half of the year internationally, then it
would – I guess, we can assume that the first quarter is going to be the low point for earnings of the year, and then
you'll get sequential growth throughout the year. Is that kind of how you see it setting up?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, in principle, yes. I would say, like I said, the underlying activity internationally Q2 isn't
showing any great signs of improving, but we will have at least a seasonal recovery in some of the key markets to help
us.
In terms of [Technical Difficulty] (55:46) pricing, we are still seeing continued pricing pressure on new tenders. But at
the same time, some of this we are looking to offset by [Technical Difficulty] (56:01) our unsustainable contracts. We
still have some of these contracts that we are looking to resolve, either by shutting the contract down, or by getting the
pricing increases that we need in order to make this a viable business proposition for us.
So yes, I would say, in principle the Q1 should be the low end of earnings for the year in international market, with still
only limited growth in Q2, but more of an acceleration in the second half of the year.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe a quick follow-up here just on your commentary about
the investing alongside your customers and the YPF deal and Borr Drilling and so on. So, Paal, you guys have
indicated in the past that all your SPM investments have effectively been margin and returns accretive in aggregate
compared to the corporate average. As you're making more and more investments in your – like, what is the criteria,
right? How should we think about it? If you're going to invest, say, $200 million in Borr Drilling, how do we think
about that in terms of incremental revenue or incremental profitability? Could you give us just some general gauge on
how to assess that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, the investment in equity of Borr Drilling should bring a return on investment or capital
employed which is accretive to the company. That's why we made the investment. And for future investments, that's
again what we are going to look for when we spend cash on these type of investments. Hand-in-hand with that is also,
obviously, the revenue opportunity that this brings, and with this, like I said, we're going to focus in on two things.
With that big fleet of jackups, this is a very good market potential for Cameron Drilling, but even more importantly,
what we are really driving at here is to introduce performance drilling in the offshore market.
So this is just one example, but when we make these investments, there will be synergies and business opportunities
and revenue opportunities associated with them. The investments will stand on their own two feet and we aim for them
to be accretive to our return on capital employed for the company, but they all need to be associated with the business
opportunities for the rest of the company.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. That's great. I appreciate that color. Thanks so much.

And your final question today comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to Cameron, some of the recent projects
that you entered into, Mad Dog and others. How should we think about long-term margins for these new projects
versus what OneSubsea has been generating before?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, obviously, if you look at the commercial environment at this stage versus the
commercial environment three [Technical Difficulty] (59:23) years ago when the project that we are currently
executing were bid, it's obviously more challenging. So to think that we can, I would say, achieve the exactly same
margins on these latest projects that we are currently delivering on OneSubsea, that might be challenging.
But I would say for all the bids that we are making and the contracts that we ultimately secure, we have very clear
return expectations on them. Somewhat lower than what OneSubsea is currently operating at, but we are still looking
for this to be a very good business for us going forward, and continuous improvement, for instance, OneSubsea is
showing and the plans they have in place going forward as well to even further improve the way they execute projects.
There should also be opportunities for the projects we bid and secure these days to have potentially margin upsides as
we go forward. So it's a tough business, but I would say I'm very pleased with how OneSubsea is navigating the
commercial environment and also executing and delivering on the projects that we take on.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: And then just my follow-up question on integration-related expenses. When do you think you're
going to stop reporting those?
<A - Simon Ayat>: As we said earlier, we will continue to be reporting them -announcing them separately for the year,
but starting next year we will drop this. This is normally our style for the first year, after the acquisition we continue to
incur them and announce them, and from there on they become part of our ongoing run rate of cost.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Waqar. So just before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the three most important points
that we've discussed. So first, the only region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is
North America land, where activity has been growing for the last few quarters. And in line with our profitable growth
strategy, we have begun redeploying our idle capacity and pressure pumping, and we will accelerate this in the second
quarter. Through the organic and inorganic investments we've made in our North America land business over the past
seven years, we are very well-positioned to take a leading role in serving our customers as they expand their activity in
the coming year.
Second, the performance of our international areas in the first quarter confirmed our belief that activity has now
reached bottom in all regions. And, although we see positive signs in many countries, both on land and offshore, we
expect only moderate sequential growth over the coming quarters. The slower speed of recovery, together with the
lingering pricing pressure, means that we expect another challenging year in the international markets in 2017 before a
clearer acceleration of activity in 2018.
And third, as we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic
about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of
opportunity for the industry players that are ready to think new and to act new.
Thank you very much for listening in.
