Vicki A. Hollub
Thank you, Richard, and good morning everyone. On the first quarter earnings call, we announced our plan to achieve
cash flow breakeven after funding the dividend and growth capital. As a reminder, over the past few years, we executed
a strategic initiative to divest of lower margin, lower return oil and gas production with a plan to replace it with higher
margin, higher return production from our Permian Resources business. This was a returns-focused strategy with the
objective of ensuring that every dollar we invest delivers the highest possible returns.
To reach the cash flow needed to be breakeven at $50 WTI and cash flow neutral at $40 WTI, we determined we would
need incremental production of 80,000 BOE per day from Permian Resources along with the additional cash flow that
was expected from our Chemicals and Midstream businesses. Today I'll update our progress with the plan, but first I'll
share some second quarter highlights.
On July 13, the board approved an increase to our quarterly dividends. This is the 15th consecutive year we've
increased our dividend and is indicative of our core belief that dividend growth drives long-term share price
appreciation. We believe dividend growth, along with the earnings growth that will be generated from our
returns-focused pathway to breakeven will maximize shareholder return over the long term. The confidence that I, our
board and our management team have in our ability to significantly grow shareholder value is based on the quality of
our assets, the capability of our organization and the strength of our pathway to breakeven.
Our pathway to breakeven begins with the best portfolio of assets that OXY has had in its nearly 100 year history. But
it's not enough to have great assets. We must also ensure we continue to increase margins through further cost
reductions. To accomplish this, we've implemented a value-based development approach along with innovative
operations and technology applications. We're seeing exciting progress across all of our assets.
Our value-based development approach has already resulted in 400 additional Permian Resources locations year to date
with breakevens under $50. We expect further additions through the remainder of the year, exceeding our original
guidance of 400 location additions during 2017. And finally, with the efforts of the Al Hosn gas team, the plant reached
operating rates of 75,000 BOE per day net to OXY.
We're also managing our portfolio. During the quarter, we announced multiple Permian transactions which resulted in
the addition of low-decline assets that will increase our operating cash flow by $80 million in 2019 with no incremental
cash outlay.
Turning to slide 5, we have clarified what it means for OXY to be breakeven at lower oil prices. Upon completion of
our plan, we'll be cash flow neutral at $40 WTI, meaning we'll cover the dividend and the production-sustaining capital
within operating cash flow. At $50 WTI, we'll also be able to generate 5% to 8% production growth. This chart walks
you through the milestones we need to achieve this plan. Our entire organization is laser focused on our breakeven
plan. In fact, we introduced this plan as a key metric for our compensation across the organization. All the decisions
that management will make in the upcoming quarters will align with achieving these goals.
Slide 6 illustrates our progress towards the breakeven plan. The Chemical segment achieved a full quarter of operations
at the new Ingleside ethylene cracker. However, our first cash distribution from the JV will be received in the third
quarter due to funding of JV working capital during the second quarter. We did benefit from additional caustic soda
volumes associated with a full quarter of operations from the cracker. Additional Chemicals cash flow will come in
2018 from the start-up of the 4CPe plan in the fourth quarter of this year, and from improving product prices.
The Midstream segment improved substantially due to widening differentials between Midland and the Gulf Coast.
Improved marketing spread was partially offset by sequential declines in NGL prices and gas processing fees. Further
increases in volume through the export terminal, as well as additional debottlenecking of Al Hosn will also add to cash
flow.
Our Oil and Gas segment added 9,000 BOE per day of high margin production from Permian Resources, bringing us
closer to our production target. And finally, as I said earlier, Permian transactions will improve annual cash flow
generation by $80 million in 2019 at $50 WTI. Each quarter we'll show the progress towards our pathway to breakeven

on the same slide.
Slide 7 quantifies the liquidity we have available to fund the gap between cash flow from operations and the capital
needed to achieve our goal of cash flow breakeven at low oil prices. At the end of the second quarter, we had $2.2
billion of cash, as well as PAGP units with a market value of about $800 million. We'll manage our portfolio to
contribute at least an additional $500 million to ensure we bridge the cash gap if prices average $40 through 2018. To
be clear, even with an average oil price of $40 through 2018, we have sufficient cash and liquidity to cover sustaining
capital, the dividend and our resources growth needed for the $50 breakeven plan.
I'll now turn the call over to Cedric Burgher.
Cedric W. Burgher
Thanks, Vicki. Jody will cover our Permian activity, so I will address other significant items. Total reported production
was 601,000 BOE per day, with ongoing production coming in at 594,000 BOE per day, which was at the top end of
our guidance range. Domestic operating costs were below guidance, and capital costs are on track to meet total year
guidance. We spent approximately $800 million in our capital program, with the majority of our $3.6 billion capital
budget anticipated for the second half of the year. As a reminder, we received our tax refund of approximately $750
million during the second quarter.
Second quarter core earnings per share was $0.15, with cash flow on track for our breakeven plan. Reported income
included one-time gains on the sale of domestic oil and gas assets, including South Texas, and a non-cash fair value
gain on our Plains equity investment.
Chemicals second quarter earnings were well above our guidance as caustic soda prices continued to increase based on
a favorable supply and demand balance and low inventory levels. Chemical production and sales volumes were
stronger than anticipated across most product lines, slightly offset by higher ethylene and natural gas costs. The second
quarter Chemicals income also benefited from a full quarter of contributions from the joint venture ethylene cracker in
Ingleside, Texas. However, our first cash distribution will not be received until the third quarter. The cash distribution
will be approximately $50 million, which includes some catch-up from the second quarter.
Midstream second quarter core earnings also came in above our previous guidance, reflecting improved Midland to
Gulf Coast spreads, higher volumes to the Ingleside crude terminal and improved foreign pipeline income, with the
completion of the Dolphin pipeline and Al Hosn planned maintenance in the first quarter. Midstream improvements
were partially offset by lower NGL prices and gas processing fees.
On slide 10, second quarter cash flows included $600 million in proceeds from the sales of assets, including South
Texas, and $360 million in acquisition payments, primarily related to the Permian Resources and international
operations.
With respect to guidance, please refer to slide 11 in today's investor presentation. Our full year 2017 ongoing
production guidance has been narrowed to a range of 597,000 to 605,000 BOE per day from prior guidance of 595,000
to 615,000 BOE per day. The low end was raised to reflect the new production increase from the previously announced
Permian transactions. The high end of the range was reduced as we finalized our ramp-up schedule in the Permian
Resources and recognized cumulative uncertainty in OPEC quota extensions, Colombia downtime and our
non-operated production growth timing.
Permian Resources total year production guidance has been narrowed with an adjustment only to the top end of our
guidance to reflect the sale of our Permian Resources acreage and our non-operated production growth timing. EOR
production guidance has been increased to reflect the other part of that transaction. We continue to expect production in
Permian Resources to exit this year at a growth pace approximately 30% higher than 2016 levels. We expect our capital
expenditures to ramp up to about $1 billion for both the third and the fourth quarters, and our full-year capital spending
to be about $3.6 billion.

Lastly, I would like to call your attention to our investor slides appendix which has been reorganized to include
additional details on our business, including several slides on our environmental, safety and governance framework and
commitment. Since joining OXY in late May, I have been thrilled to learn more about OXY's industry-leading efforts
in carbon sequestration, which we have highlighted on slide 34.
I'll now turn the call over to Jody.
Jody Elliott
Thank you, Cedric. Today I'll provide an update on our Permian business and the improvements we've made to the
portfolio that will contribute to OXY's cash flow breakeven goals. In June, we announced a series of transactions that
monetize non-strategic Permian Resources acreage to accomplish two things for us: one, enhance our low decline
Permian EOR business and two, core up in an area of Glasscock County that will now become a new development area.
The Permian Resources acreage we divested had less value in OXY's portfolio because of the expected timing of
development, so we used it to provide liquidity to accelerate OXY's pathway to cash flow breakeven and increase the
value of our portfolio. We will continue to evaluate the tail of our Permian Resources portfolio for additional
value-adding opportunities.
The Seminole-San Andres Unit we acquired produces from the world-class San Andres reservoir, and is a natural fit in
our industry-leading Permian EOR portfolio. OXY has strategically pursued this asset since we became a non-operated
partner in 2001, with an initial working interest of 7%. Over time, we increased our working interest to 53% before the
recent acquisition and now will operate the assets with an 87% working interest.
Our reservoir management expertise, operating experience and scale provide cost reduction and production
optimization opportunities that will increase the value of this asset for OXY. We've identified cost improvements of $5
per BOE that we target to realize by year-end 2017, and have an upside target of $10 per BOE that will bring the
Seminole-San Andres Unit's OpEx to parity with OXY's nearby Denver Unit C02 flood.
Turning to slide 14, beyond the operating cost opportunity, we have provided an initial estimate of resource potential
for the Seminole-San Andres Unit. We estimate approximately 100 million barrels of resource potential with less than
$6 per BOE future development cost which brings our Permian EOR total inventory of less than $6 F&D to almost 1
billion barrels. We believe that OXY's value-based development approach which is grounded in subsurface
characterization, operating capability and innovative technology along with the synergistic benefits from our scale in
the area will provide significant upside to our initial resource estimates.
I'd also like to highlight one additional milestone in the EOR business. In January, the U.S. EPA approved a second
monitoring, reporting and verification plan for injecting and storing C02 safely in the Permian Basin as part of our C02
EOR operations. OXY was the first company to receive EPA authorization for EOR with C02 sequestration in 2015.
EPA approval of these plans represents an important milestone in the development and commercialization of carbon
capture, utilization and storage technology as an approach for long-term management of greenhouse gas emissions. We
believe OXY's assets and expertise in enhanced oil recovery and C02 sequestration provide a long-term competitive
advantage under various possible carbon pricing scenarios in the future.
Moving to Permian Resources on slide 15, we've achieved our 2017 target of adding 400 locations to our less than $50
WTI breakeven inventory. We now have approximately 16 years of inventory at a 10-rig pace with less than a $50
breakeven. Improved capital efficiency and well performance added 255 locations and are based on repeated
performance improvements from well design and technology that are sustainable and have further room for
improvement.
We've traded approximately 7,000 total net acres this year, enabling us to convert shorter wells into higher value
extended laterals bringing our less than $50 breakeven average lateral length to 8,600 feet. We've also evaluated
approximately 15,000 new net acres which added 100 locations to our less than $50 breakeven inventory. Our
inventory now covers approximately 302,000 net acres which includes the effect of the divestitures during the year.

As we progress our value-based development approach, we see continued potential for improvement in our inventory
by applying new technology and enhancing operating efficiency. We continue our subsurface characterization to
customize the development plans and well designs that will maximize the value of each section. Although we met our
2017 less than $50 breakeven target of 400 locations, we believe we still have opportunity to further grow this number
by year-end.
On slide 16, we've updated our all-in capital intensity outlook through 2019. This metric provides an estimate of total
annual CapEx for each 1,000 barrels of annual average wedge production during a given calendar year. Our
improvements in 2017 through 2019 are the result of thoughtful development planning and creative facilities and
infrastructure designs that increase facility utilization over the life of the field. We've also progressed our subsurface
characterization and focused on understanding the why, as opposed to just the what.
For example, in Barilla Draw we utilized our advanced subsurface characterization to pinpoint a specific landing zone
that would allow for maximizing SRV within the Wolfcamp A. This identification and execution of the why resulted in
a well-specific landing point for the Lyda 16H, which contributed to an OXY record 30-day IP of 3,200 BOE per day.
As with our inventory, we believe there's still upside to further improve our growth plans. All of our forecast
assumptions are based on demonstrated performance where we have enough data to conclude that the improvements
are sustainable. Our most recent improvements in well productivity, capital efficiency and improvements from
applications of new data analytics projects represent upside opportunities.
We also expect cost savings from logistics hubs, multilateral drilling and additional water recycling that have not been
recognized in the plan. We estimate there could be at least another 10% improvement as we continue development in
our core areas through 2019. We believe our capital intensity is best-in-class and will be the primary driver in providing
OXY's growth while generating cash in 2019 and beyond.
Turning to slide 17, I'll provide an update on Permian Resources drilling activity. Permian Resources exited 2Q with 11
operated rigs, an increase of four from the end of the first quarter. The increase in second quarter activity was late in the
quarter, which will primarily benefit production in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. In the
second half of 2017, we'll operate five rigs in the Greater Sand Dunes area, four rigs in the Greater Barilla Draw area
and two rigs in the Midland Basin.
As we build out infrastructure and progress our subsurface characterization, we expect to move additional activity to
New Mexico in 2018 and beyond. Resources is currently on the 30% CAGR trajectory based on our current
development activity plans. You will also see that we lowered our expected rig count in 2018 and 2019 by one rig for
both scenarios which is a result of the value-based improvements we discussed that improved our inventory and
reduced the capital intensity.
I'll now turn the call back over to Vicki Hollub.
Vicki A. Hollub
Thank you, Jody. We're fully on track to achieve our plan as shown across our Oil and Gas, Chemicals and Midstream
businesses, as each beat our second quarter expectations. Additionally, our teams are exceeding goals to increase value
within the plan. We've already met our Permian Resources inventory improvement goal by adding 400 additional
locations below $50 breakeven and we expect to add more.
We were able to complete multiple Permian transactions to add value and enhance our plan as announced this quarter.
We ended the quarter with more cash on the balance sheet than we had at the end of the first quarter, and we have
ample liquidity to fully fund our plan at any oil price.
We will now open it up for your questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning everybody, and appreciate you taking my questions. I'm actually
quite impressed that she got my name pronunciation right. That's a first. Anyway, so Vicki, I wonder if I could just ask
you to elaborate a little bit on the full-year guidance. There seem to be a number of moving parts, and I know that it's
not easy to answer in a quick question, but CapEx is obviously back-end loaded, it looks like OpEx cut production. But
I'm also interested in slide 17 when you're showing the 13 rig count basically coming on about six months earlier. So
can you just walk us through what the nature of that, bringing the top end of the guidance is, and how it impacts your
timing of when you expect to get the incremental? I guess it's now 71,000 barrels a day in the Permian. I've got a
follow-up, please.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Our guidance really does not indicate any change in our confidence or in
our pathway to breakeven as we've laid out. Actually, this is just a narrowing of the guidance. Our business teams are
progressing and working and achieving exactly what we need them to, and actually we're, as I mentioned in my script,
we're really ahead of schedule in terms of performance. But there are several reasons that we did it. First, we increased
the low end of our range 2,000 barrels a day, to account for the increased second half production as a result of our
Permian transactions.
And then we secondly, we wanted to, we now have greater clarity on the redeployment of our South Texas sale
proceeds. For example, we had said we'd be able to deploy those into those proceeds into Permian Resources, which
we've done. And that activity is taking place in the second half of this year. And now we expect that with the pad
development that we have going on, some of that production will actually go into January and February. So the activity,
we've got better clarity on the timing of that.
Third, our updated range really reflects some uncertainties around a number of things that have happened. Earlier in the
year, we had expected that the announced six month quotas for OPEC would be in place and now that's been extended
for a full year. Also, we've had some impacts of electrical storms in Permian in the second quarter. We wanted to take
that into account. And we've also had some third party plant processing outages. In our own EOR business, we had two
unplanned plant outages, which are now behind us. And we wanted to be a little bit conservative with Colombia with
respect to pipeline outages. We've been able to manage that recently and expect to be able to manage it, but we don't
feel that there will be upside there.
And then with respect to our Permian non-operated position, we are seeing indications of a lot of companies now
starting to cut their capital. So we felt like there could be some risk on the upside. And again, these are risks on the
upside because we did increase the bottom side of our range. And having said all that, we felt like that it was small, but
we wanted to make sure that we provided clarity around what we expect.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So just to be clear, on slide 17, the earlier addition or move to 13 rigs, I guess you'll be there in a
couple months. Middle of next year looks like about the number for 80,000 barrels a day? Does that sound about right?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: The 80,000 barrel a day really is going to be dependent on our efficiency improvements and
how well we're able to move from pad to pad, logistics and several things. So I'm not prepared at this point to
accelerate that schedule. We've said that it would happen by the end of 2018 or first of 2019. I don't think that we see
anything right now that would prompt us to change that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. My follow up hopefully is a quick one. It's another slide question, I'm afraid, slide 7. It
looks, if I'm eyeballing this right, I mean I guess you've kind of broken it out, $0.5 billion to $2 billion of [ph] ourself
(25:29) portfolio management, I guess you've called it. Does that happen irrespective of the oil price, whether it's $40
or $50, Vicki? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.

<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: What we're going to do is we're going to make the right decisions from a monetization and
value standpoint. So where there are assets that we certainly feel would be best monetized for them to add value to the
shareholder, that's what we'll do. We're not going to monetize things that are not value adding, meaning that we're not
going to sell assets that we think would add more value if we kept them for development. So we'll look at that and
make the decisions as we go. We're not going to try to target any upper end. We just think we need to make the best
value decision.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks for the answers. I appreciate it.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Charles Robertson of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Charles Robertson>: Thank you, and thank you for all the updates on the operational side. But my question
comes, I would appreciate your thoughts behind the 15th consecutive year of raising your dividend. And if you could
expand on that, I would appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yes, as I said, we felt like that we have extreme confidence in our plan, and we know we can
execute this. So we felt it important to continue to increase our dividend. We know that there are holders that expect
that to happen and that needs to happen for some of the holders of our stock. We wanted to do a modest increase at this
point, and expect that as we achieve our cash flow neutrality and our breakeven, that we will then be able to grow our
dividend more in line with our value growth.
<Q - Charles Robertson>: All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good morning everybody and welcome back, Cedric.
<A - Cedric W. Burgher>: Thanks, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: My question on the strategic plan, your strategic plan now involves the lower stress case at $40.
And given the capital efficiencies, can you discuss the $50 side? And is the 5% to 8% growth, is that the sweet spot for
growth? Or where improvements would either lower the $50 threshold or could that allow the growth to drive higher?
I'm just trying to understand how you see the upper end evolving with improving productivity or commodity price.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Well, one thing that we do expect to see is we do expect efficiency improvements. This plan
that we've rolled out is very conservative. It does not include many of the things that Jody's team is working on in the
Permian Resources business. It also really doesn't take into account some of the things internationally that we're seeing
that great success with, with respect to some of the capital efficiency improvements there, as well as the improved
recovery and OpEx reduction. So I think that this – certainly our plan is conservative.
So with a $50 oil price, there would be potential for further increases in terms of production, but what we want to do is
make the best decision. So we would just look at market conditions. We'd look at our other opportunities for use of
capital and make a decision as to what's the best thing to do. I believe over time because of the assets we have, we have
the potential to grow more, but we'll make those decisions as we get to that point.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. And second on my second question on the Permian, in your locations you've achieved your
full year guidance to add the 400 horizontal locations sub $50 by mid year versus full year. Maybe you'd discuss what

<A - Jody Elliott>: Yeah, Evan, this is Jody. Thank you for the question. Yeah, we have achieved that goal that we set
out of 400. I'm still working on your stretch goal for me of 600 locations as well. But we do think we can continue to
progress that, better well productivity, some really innovative things around pad development sequencing, moving a
little more activity over the next year into New Mexico, longer laterals. You see in the slides that we've extended our
average lateral length in the inventory, and that doesn't stop, right. So I think that will continue to add sub $50
inventory. Plus we're marching through the other 300,000, 350,000 acres that we really haven't fully evaluated. We
knocked off another 15,000 of that this last time. So probably not every quarter an update on inventory, but maybe
every other quarter we would provide an update.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jody Elliott>: Thanks, Evan.

And our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Vicki, I think one of the concerns I've heard from investors with the
cash flow targets that have been outlined is just the timing of it. You mentioned end of 2018, early 2019. So I was just
hoping maybe you can frame up some of the interim milestones you're thinking about here, potentially exit rate 2017,
how much of this you think you might be able to achieve. And I guess I'm thinking perhaps the Midstream, the
Chemicals pieces, et cetera. Do you think you could get $500 million to $600 million of this by the end of 2017? Or
anything else you'd be comfortable sharing on that front.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: I think that certainly, I think by the end of this year we'll make more progress. We're going to
see probably our biggest incremental changes beginning in Q1 of 2018 because a lot of the ramp-up in Permian
Resources will really start to pay off in Q1. So I would certainly expect to have significant incremental progress toward
our goal by that time. But some of the other things will happen in mid to late 2018.
For example, we expect the Al Hosn expansion will be certainly before the end of 2018. The 4CPe will be at the
beginning of 2018. That's the plant in Louisiana. We're going to see next quarter as we mentioned, the cash flow from
the cracker starting to come in from the JV, so that should actually be happening next quarter, will help toward the end
of this year. We expect that we'll see incremental from the export terminal. We do plan to expand it a bit, but we're not
sure of the timing on that, but that could also occur later in 2018.
So the closer things are immediate cash flow next quarter from the JV, the 4CPe beginning of 2018, and then we're
looking at Al Hosn toward the end. And the incremental growth from the Permian, while it wasn't a straight line from
the time we announced it, it's over the next couple of quarters is really they're ramping up. They're going to start –
they'll see good fourth quarter production and then they're on a very strong trajectory going into 2018. So the growth in
2018 is going to be well above the 30% CAGR for Permian Resources.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Got it. Okay. And then you've outlined how you see the balance sheet progressing, from a
cash standpoint how you see things progressing to help fund your growth plan. I'm wondering how you think about
acquisitions at this point. You did the swap, et cetera. But would you say that there are in the next 12 to 18 months,
acquisitions are still something you're looking at, or is it more just the organic growth and the portfolio management on
the other side?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: That's going to be mostly organic growth. Where we see opportunities to continue to increase
our working interest or do both on acquisitions, we would do those. But we're so confident with this organic execution
plan that we have, that we're really focused on it and making sure that happens.

<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Okay. If I could just ask one last one. Vicki, I kind of asked you about this at our conference a
month ago. But perhaps you could just refresh us on the 5% to 8% growth rate and this long-term target versus maybe
targeting a slightly lower growth rate and covering the dividend sooner. And I asked this kind of in the context of
you're seeing a lot of E&P companies out there missing numbers, stocks getting hit on weaker production outlooks.
And it seems like the cash flow oriented stocks have been the ones that have been doing much better on the execution
front and from a share price perspective. So just curious on your thoughts on this.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yes. I want to emphasize that our growth rate right now and what we're doing over the next 18
months is, we're just replacing cash flow from those assets that we exited or divested. So this high growth rate that
you're seeing, it's a consequence of that. We need to replace the cash flow. We want to do that as quickly as we can.
And beyond that, once we're cash-flow neutral at $40 and breakeven at $50 with a 5% to 8%, we will stay within cash
flow. And we expect over time our cash flow to continue to increase. And that's our goal.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Okay. Thanks, Vicki.
Operator
And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe to follow up on Phil's question there on the dividend, well,
the growth rate potentially. Why not talk about maybe a higher growth rate in the dividend or some growth rate in the
dividend versus a slightly slower production growth number at $50?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: I'm sorry, Phil. Could you repeat that question? You're asking why not grow – I'm sorry,
Roger, you're asking why not grow more?
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yes. So the dividend is laid out at $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and then the production growth.
And just getting back to the question that Phil asked, why not talk about dividend growth blended with production
growth, as opposed to just a production growth number? Or is just the goal here, the toggle is always production growth
and the dividend is secure at $40? I'm just trying to make sure I understand where you kind of – you're laying out sort
of a drilling plan to 2019 and a productivity plan. How does that come back to the dividend?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Right. In this interim as we are on this breakeven plan, the dividend is going to be, the
increases will be modest, as we've just shown you. However, once we get beyond that, the growth in the dividend will
be consistent with our value proposition in that we'll grow that accordingly. So as we're growing production and
growing value, growing cash flow beyond the breakeven plan, then our dividend at that point will certainly start to
resume a healthier growth rate. And it will be according to, at that point, what the best use of capital is. Best use of
cash. But it's not that the dividend will not grow. It will beyond this breakeven plan.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Great
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Does that answer your question, Roger?
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yes, it does. More of a timing issue here of getting through this period and then focus on it.
Okay. And then Jody, maybe switching gears to you or Vicki, if you want to keep on with it. In the appendix, slide 25,
26, I think there was one or two more showed it looked like out-performance versus type curves. I was just wondering,
is that predominantly lateral length which looks like some of it, or what's driving that improvement?
<A - Jody Elliott>: Yes, Roger. It's a combination of things. It is better, continued subsurface understanding and
progression and refining our landing points, changing our stimulation designs to maximize stimulated rock volumes so
that connection to the reservoir and lateral length. It's really all of those things. If I had to weight them, I'd probably say
that the landing point and stimulation changes are driving the bulk of that.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.

And our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, everyone. I guess it would be remiss of me not to ask you about gas/oil ratios given your
position in the Permian, the scale of your position and your experience. What's your perspective on this latest
controversy that's emerged as regards OXY's competitive position? Thanks.
<A - Jody Elliott>: Paul, this is Jody. Thank you. I think as we've talked all along, we really emphasize our subsurface
work, whether that's geologic work or reservoir engineering and so the understanding of GOR behavior, it's not new to
us. This is not a surprise for our assumptions. We model. We do more than just decline curve analysis. We have
multiple B factor changes that go through the life of this well. We model the GOR increase when you get to bubble
point. We use rate transient analysis. We use reservoir modeling. So it is a full cycle engineering analysis and so our
plans have got those reservoir behaviors built into our forecast. Over the next couple years, our GORs actually stay
fairly flat based on the mix of new development and declining development. So that's well understood by us and built
into our plan.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Well certainly I was playing gas/oil ratio bingo there and you scored a point for bubble point but
you didn't manage to throw in big data.
<A - Jody Elliott>: Thanks. The big data, really it's analytics. It's not big data. It's analytics that helps us get even
better at that. Right, so we're adding statistical models on top of the engineering analysis, whether it's in reservoir,
whether it's in geology, completions, drilling, we're seeing that across the board with our analytics projects. And that
just refines our confidence on our EUR predictions, on our type curve predictions, even more as we move forward. It's
some of the technology things that Vicki mentions that really aren't baked into this cash flow to breakeven plan. They
act as upsides for us as we continue to solve those kind of tough problems out there.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Can you contrast – I mean I know you're all over the Permian – but can you talk about how things
differ across acreage and where you might be differentiated or not as the case may be as we go off some of these
issues?
<A - Jody Elliott>: So our activity set over the next several years is predominantly in the Delaware Basin. Where
we're positioned, we have good rock positions. It's geo-pressured for most of those benches that extends the period of
time before you start having GOR effects. So I think we're well positioned kind of from an inventory standpoint
relative to some of our competitors with respect to GOR.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Got it. Vicki, if I could just pin you down slightly. You know, you're talking a lot about
breakevens and then in due course, dividend increases. I think the market's getting tired of what is quite a modest name
ultimately to be at breakeven. But it feels as if the opportunity set is better than it ever has been. And can you not be
more ambitious about your dividend growth over time? I mean, for example pinning it to future volume growth
assuming that margins were constant? Wouldn't it be reasonable to say that in the future we can get a 5% to 8%
annualized dividend growth as our target? Thanks.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: I do expect that to be not only possible but likely. I just didn't want to pin myself down to a
range on that.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Well, you fell for that trap.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: But that's really what we're trying to target. Yeah, I know. But that's our goal. It's in the
interim, we're just trying to get to the milestone of being able to then refocus and get our dividend growth back.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thank you.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Thank you.

And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question. You've broken out your PAGP holding of $0.8 billion in
the slides. And I remember the last time you sold some of this, I think this was about two and a half years ago. Is there
a threshold for the yield on that stock where you would feel compelled to monetize it?
<A - Cedric W. Burgher>: Yes. Pavel, this is Cedric. We, really our approach is to be opportunistic. We have a
number of assets in our portfolio that don't produce cash or not much, and those would be likely candidates for sale
earlier. But clearly the Plains units, from a long-term perspective, are not core to our business, and therefore a source of
liquidity. But the way we look at it, they're throwing off good cash. We think it's a well-run company with good assets,
and so we're happy to continue to hold onto those units and look for an opportunistic time to sell them down the road.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. And a quick question about the sustaining capital under the $50 versus $40
scenarios. The difference is only 10%, $200 million. Is there a certain amount of conservatism? In other words, if oil
were $10 lower than your baseline, wouldn't sustaining capital be meaningfully lower than $2.1 billion potentially?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Sustaining capital does go down with oil prices because we would expect, as you're alluding
to, service company costs and some of our C02 is tied to oil prices. So it would go lower. With the estimate that we
have on our slide, though, is what we believe today without significant efficiency improvements. So it's conservative.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. Clear enough. Appreciate it.

And the next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions on -
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Singer>: A couple questions on the Permian. You highlighted the coming shift in rigs into New Mexico
and wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the decision to do that and the implications on the returns there
versus the returns elsewhere in the Permian portfolio, like the southern Delaware and Midland basins. And also given
that it's topical, can you speak to how you see the risks associated with navigating drilling horizontal wells around areas
where there are legacy vertical wells, particularly in the Midland?
<A - Jody Elliott>: Yes. Brian, the reason for the shift to New Mexico is really kind of grounded in our capital
intensity calculations. New Mexico, because of the stack pays and very good stack pays, it's not like you have a
primary bench and then three or four secondaries. There's three or four primary benches that compete very well, very
high returns. And so it's that nature that drives us toward more New Mexico. Kind of second in the tier would be the
Texas Delaware and then Midland Basin. I mean, those two aren't that different, but they just have different production
profiles with the wells as we drill them. That's why we're more dominated with our activity set over on the Delaware
side.
The risks of drilling with vertical wells, a lot of the areas we're developing are not historical vertical development, or
they were done in a way that you still have a lot of room between those vertical wells for not having any collision areas.
A lot of our New Mexico development that we're going to is clean acreage and very little historical development, and if
it was, it was in shallower reservoirs. We've got a long history with this. You got to remember, we've been in the
Permian for a long time, at 25,000 wells, a lot of experience dealing with both vertical and now horizontal activity.
We're doing more horizontal activity in our legacy EOR properties and on the Central Basin Platform. So it's something
very manageable for us, and I think the properties that we have set themselves up well for continued horizontal
development.

<Q - Brian Singer>: . Great, thanks. And then on the technology side, can you give us an update of some of the
technology solutions you're deploying such as – I think multilateral wells, one that you've highlighted in the past? And
if there's more to say on some of the predictive analytics slide than you already said, that would be great. But
specifically, what the impact is on production or capital costs today.
<A - Jody Elliott>: Yes. I mean, we've got a great – a number of slides in the appendix that lays out the different
projects that we're working. We've made a lot of progress here recently in one around reservoir management of our
injectants. So both in Ken's business in Mukhaizna with steam and then northern Oman with the water flood, and then
in our EOR business with C02 floods, we're deploying kind of the early versions of those tools that combine essentially
low-fidelity reservoir models with a statistical model so that we can make changes in where our injectant goes on a
greater frequency.
And so what that does is, it allows us to get the biggest bang for the buck for every molecule of injectant that we put in
the ground. So those are starting to get rolled out. And from a technology standpoint, that's all being done in the cloud.
So from an IT standpoint, we're able to do this work from Oman all the way back here to Houston. And again, that's our
starting point, but that technology applies to all three geographic areas.
On the drilling side, we're pushing out our bit trajectory data analytics tools. So we've been through our early round of
validating where the bit is based on surveying equipment being 45 or 60 foot behind the bit. That's now starting – will
start beginning to get penetrated across multiple rigs. And what that does is it, again, it keeps you in zone. It allows you
to build your curves more accurately because you know where you are instead of projecting where you are. And that
results in better wells if you stay in zone longer. So I mean that's a couple of examples, but there's a long list that we
continue to push forward on the technology front.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thanks. And the multilateral wells, have there been any examples there, that presence?
<A - Jody Elliott>: We're continuing to, as we've spoke before, we have one that we have completed the stimulation
on. We have others planned. The impact of multilateral is really when we move into our second and third and fourth
bench developments. So we continue to move down that path. No new news there on multilateral.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thank you.
Operator
And our final question today will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Good morning. Vicki, I just wanted to ask you, I'm looking at the various illustrations of
the $40 and $50 per barrel spending and the 30% CAGR in the Permian Resources and your remarks about replacing
sold cash flows. Is the overall message that you're going to maintain this spending plan through 2018 regardless of oil
prices, or is there any chance that you would pull back if prices really swooned? And in particular, what I'm trying to
understand is if the spending that you're outlining is really necessary to drive the efficiencies that are going to continue
to lower costs further out.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Well, first of all, as long as we're investing our dollars in things that deliver rates of return that
are better than our cost of capital, we'll continue to execute this plan. That also assumes that the fundamentals are there
to support oil prices that are at least close to $40 because that's about where we get the returns that we feel are
appropriate for our dollar invested. With respect to. I think slide seven shows, slide seven shows the liquidity that we'll
have available to support that if that was the second part of your question at $40. And this all assumes $40.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Yes. But one other thing that I was just curious about is that in addition to investing for
rates of return and so forth, there's been a lot of illustration throughout the slides on driving costs lower over time.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yes.

<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: And I was wondering if also part of this is, you want to get to a certain scale over the next
18, 20 months, that that's going to help to drive costs further, even going further out
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah, we set the $40 and $50 as milestones and we do believe that going forward beyond that,
that then again, those are conservative because we haven't baked in a lot of the things that we're trying that we believe
have a good possibility of working out. So we do believe that over time we'll continue to lower our cash flow
neutrality, that we'll continue to improve our operations and drive our costs down and our margins up. So this to us is
just a milestone. And, Cedric, you had something to add?
<A - Cedric W. Burgher>: Yes. This is Cedric. I'd just say that the point of slide 7 was to show you at $40 that we've
got a liquidity path that works. Obviously, so we're planning for the worst, if you will. If things were to go below that
on a sustainable basis, then we would of course reassess. The whole world probably would. But even as low as $40
WTI, we've got a path that, this plan, we can execute from a liquidity standpoint.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Okay. Well that was really helpful. And just going back quickly, Jody, to your remarks
about the multiple core opportunities in New Mexico as opposed to Texas and Midland, slide 26 highlights that the
Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B are your core zones in the Midland Basin, but there has been pretty good success in
the lower Sprayberry in the Midland Basin as well. I was just wondering, is that a zone that you're looking at? Does
that have a possibility to maybe become a third core zone over time?
<A - Jody Elliott>: Yes it does, and in this new core development area that the transactions allowed us to develop their
Sprayberry activity there as well. In New Mexico, it's second Bone, it's first Bone, it's third Bone, it's the XY. It's
another zone in between the XY and the Wolfcamp. That's the beauty of New Mexico, again, is there is more what I
would call premium benches kind of per acre of opportunity that we have.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: And, if I could, just kind of going back to what Brian was asking about, when you look at
all those juicy basins in New Mexico, do you think of a minimum amount of development that you'll do with individual
well bores, and then at some point later on you'll come in with the multilaterals? Or I mean, how are you thinking about
that?
<A - Jody Elliott>: Yes, so we take the multilateral, we view multilateral as kind of an arrow in the quiver, right. It's
one of many tools we have in our development plan. So areas where we are location constrained, there are some
environmentally sensitive areas that we operate in. There's BLM acreage. We're trying to minimize our footprint. And
so if you have multiple benches, that's a lot of wellheads if you do them all by one well at a time. So we take that into
account when we think about the development plan of an area of whether we want to deploy multilateral in that future
development or not.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Yes, that's a great point. Thanks very much.

And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for
any closing remarks.
Vicki A. Hollub
Thank you. To close, I'd just like to reiterate our excitement and our confidence in our plan. The quality of our assets,
the capability of our organization and the strength of our pathway to our breakeven plan is well understood by our
organization, and we're completely aligned toward achieving our goals. But looking beyond our breakeven plan, we're
also confident in our ability to sustain our value proposition for the foreseeable future, and that does include
meaningful dividend growth beyond this breakeven plan.

In addition to the multi-decade reserves and resources that we have in the Permian Basin and the long-term cash flow
from OxyChem, we also have long-term contracts in the Middle East and Colombia, and they will provide significant
cash flow for multiple decades. So we do have sustainability.
