I'll now hand you over to George again to take you through the numbers.
George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Gerald. Our performance this quarter was in line with our expectations despite challenging conditions in a
number of our markets. We were particularly pleased with growth in U.S. pharmacy volume and market share as the
early benefits of our new pharmacy contracts started to come through. We continued to work hard to secure regulatory
clearance for the Rite Aid transaction and we're reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2017.
So now, let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter. As we expected, currency again had a negative impact,
with U.S. dollar being around 16% higher versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year. Sales for the quarter
were $29.4 billion, down 2.4% versus the comparable quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 0.9%.
Without the extra day in February last year, this would have been up 2.2%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a
decrease of 20.5%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, up 14%, and diluted
EPS was $0.98, up 15.3%.
Adjusted operating income was $2 billion, down 4.9% and in constant currency was down 2.7%. We estimate this
would have been broadly flat, taking into account the leap year impact.
Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.5 billion, up 3.7% and in constant currency up
6.2%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.36, up 3.8%, and in constant currency up 6.1%. The adjusted
effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 23.7%. This was
lower than in the same quarter last year, primarily due to a reduced estimated annual tax rate associated with our
current year pre-tax earnings and incremental discrete tax benefits. For the year-to-date, the tax rate on the same basis
was 24.5%.
For completeness, these are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2017. I will not go through these in great detail, but
you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.94, up 3.7% versus the same period a year ago.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $2.46, up 5.1% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis.
So let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail
Pharmacy USA sales were $21.8 billion, up 1.5% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 2.4%.
As 2016 was a leap year, when we calculate comparable sales and prescription figures, we exclude February 29, 2016.
Adjusted gross profit was $5.9 billion, down 0.6% over the year-ago quarter, with the impact of the extra day in 2016
holding back growth in adjusted gross profit by over 1%. Lower retail gross profit was partially offset by an increase in
pharmacy. Adjusted SG&A was 20% of sales, an improvement of 0.1 percentage points compared to the year-ago
quarter. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales has improved versus comparable quarters for 15 consecutive quarters.
As a result of the lower adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin was down 0.5 percentage points at 7.1%,
resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion, down 4.9%.
So now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 3.7%, mainly driven by increased retail
script volume. We filled 246.7 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of
5.9%. On a comparable basis for stores, which exclude central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 4.2%, with
scripts filled up 7.9%. This was the highest quarterly growth rate in more than seven years and was primarily due to
strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the strategic pharmacy partnerships which we announced last year.
We are pleased both with the progress of Medicare Part D and early indications of the benefits derived from our new
pharmacy contracts.
Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation was partially offset by reimbursement pressure, which was in line with
what we had anticipated and by the impact of generics. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter
on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.4%, up approximately 100 basis points over the year-ago quarter.

Total retail sales were down 2.7% on the same quarter last year. This includes the impact of previously announced
closure of certain e-commerce operations and the impact of the leap day in the prior year. Comparable retail sales were
down 0.8% in the quarter in what was a challenging environment. The declines in the consumables and general
merchandise and personal care categories partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness and beauty
categories.
Adjusted gross profit was lower than in the same quarter last year, primarily due to the decline in sales. Despite the
difficult market conditions, we were pleased with growth in our key categories. This was reflected by our absolute
performance as well as recent market share gains. Based on the latest Nielsen data for the 13 weeks ended the 25th of
February, we gained share in health and wellness, beauty, and personal care categories.
However, we know there is more to do and are, therefore, taking further actions to help drive future performance.
These include simplifying our product offering, further emphasis on our omni-channel capabilities and expansion of
our Beauty Differentiation program.
While still early in the journey, our own brands are performing well and currently represent over 15% of beauty sales in
our Beauty Differentiation stores. We have now recruited beauty advisors across more than 1,800 stores, which is
helping to drive No7 sales and gross profit.
Repurchase levels of No7 products have been very encouraging and Soap & Glory has also got off to a good start.
Following the successful introduction of No7 and Soap & Glory, we're planning to introduce another of our own
brands, Botanics, into our existing Beauty Differentiation stores in the next six months. Looking ahead, we are now
developing plans to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar
year.
So next, let's look at the progress of our cost transformation program. In our previously announced cost transformation
program, we set ourselves an ambitious target of delivering $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. I'm
delighted to announce that we achieved this target ahead of plan. We now expect that the cumulative pre-tax charges
associated with this program would be approximately $1.8 billion. This is in line with our expectations when the
expanded program was announced in April 2015.
These costs are higher than we anticipated in October, primarily as we now expect to close around 60 more stores. The
program will be completed as expected by the end of fiscal 2017 and the full benefits will be realized in future periods.
We continue to expect that approximately 60% of the program costs will be in cash over time, the principal items being
future lease obligations.
So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.1 billion,
down 1.9% in constant currency, again impacted by the leap year. Comparable store sales decreased 0.9% in constant
currency. Comparable Pharmacy sales were down 3.7% on a constant currency basis due to decline in the UK, which
was partially offset by growth in other markets.
In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 5.2%, mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy
funding. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.6%, reflecting Boots growth in the UK, the Republic of
Ireland and Thailand. Within the UK, Boots comparable retail sales increased 0.7% versus the year-ago quarter,
supported by solid December trading.
Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 4% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, mainly due to lower pharmacy
margins in the UK, reflecting the reduction in funding and the impact of the leap day in the prior year.
Adjusted SG&A in constant currency dollars was flat versus the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted SG&A as a
percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was 0.6 percentage points higher at 31% as a result of the largely fixed
cost elements of the cost base.
Adjusted operating margin was 7.8%, down 1.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted
operating income of $242 million, a decrease of 16.7%, again in constant currency.

So now, let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5 billion, up 0.6% versus the
same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Growth was held back by the sale of Alliance Healthcare Russia in
March last year and also by the leap year. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 5.2%. This was
behind the company's estimate of market growth, weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with challenging
market conditions in Continental Europe, partially offset by growth in emerging markets and the UK. Market growth
was particularly strong in certain emerging markets due to the timing of price increases.
Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.9%, up 0.2 percentage points on a constant currency basis.
Adjusted operating income was $226 million, up 59.4% in constant currency. Excluding the $79 million in adjusted
earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 8.4% in constant currency, reflecting procurement and cost
benefits.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.9 billion. During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $1.4 billion.
This reflected a seasonal reduction in inventories as well as an improved receivables position. Cash capital expenditure
in the quarter was $261 million. This was lower than in the first quarter, mainly due to phasing. As I said last quarter,
we continued to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and U.S. beauty program as well as the
upgrades to our IT systems which we have previously talked about.
This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.6 billion. Today, we announced a new share repurchase program of
up to $1 billion in this calendar year. We have a flexibility to do this due to the changes to the pending Rite Aid
transaction announced in January.
So turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we have maintained guidance and continue to expect adjusted diluted
net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.08. Remember, our guidance assumes current exchange rates
remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year and no material accretion from Rite Aid or from the new strategic
alliance with Prime announced on Monday.
So I'll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George. As you have seen, we have once again come to you with quarterly results pretty much in line with
our expectations. However, the drivers behind the results vary depending on where we are with the development and
continual transformation of our business. But we have many different levers to pull, to fine-tune the company and that
gives us some confidence in our ability to deliver solid financial performance.
This quarter, much of the most visible work we are reporting has been driving efficiency within the company, further
improving the cash flow from the business and the cost structure. We are doing these while we continue to operate a
slightly inefficient balance sheet as we work to complete our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid. Even in the balance
sheet, however, you can see the signs of our drive for constant improvement. We are returning an element of value to
the shareholders through our new share buyback program without undermining our intention to [ph] appropriately
leverage (19:27) the company following the closing of the proposed Rite Aid acquisition.
The U.S. pharmacy market is performing very much as we believed it would. Pricing pressures are increasing, to
address the steady and unrelenting volume growth in the use of medication. To meet these challenges, we believe that
collaboration and cooperation is vital. It is vital across the healthcare system as a whole and between all the
components of it, from the regulators to the individual pharmacies who serve their communities every day.
We have proved time and time again that by shaping our business to anticipate and address what is a clearly identifiable
trend, we can operate a growing and thriving business in this environment. As we grow and develop our company, we
seek to ensure that the structure and nature of our business is properly aligned with the needs of the market. In this, we
will never do anything that we are not convinced is in the long-term interest of our shareholders. If we do not believe
this to be the case, we will not do it, in fact. A very good example of our commitment to working in partnership is our
strategic alliance with Prime. This puts in place a new pharmacy contract between our two companies and brings

together our central specialty and mail order business infrastructure in which we have just over 50%. It is designed to
improve our scale and competitive position through enhanced service, competitive pricing and improved market access.
Relationships like these are about more than just improving what we have today. They can create an entirely new set of
opportunity for us to approach the market, achieving more together, quicker than either of us could do alone and in a
structure that helps ensure we both benefit fairly as a result.
While this will not have a significant impact on our adjusted earning per share this fiscal year, it is benefiting our
volume and sales. And as we integrate this business over time, we believe it will benefit our adjusted operating income.
Equally important, it establishes a strategically beneficial alliance to deliver future growth by better addressing the
needs of a changing market. Since the announcement, our strategic alliance has already contributed to Prime winning
two significant contracts, which demonstrates how well it is being received by the market.
As we are addressing some of the legacy business issue in Walgreens and are seeing script volumes return, we are in a
much better position to begin to address the operational challenges which market demands will continue to place upon
us. The retail market in the U.S. has its own economic and competitive pressure. There is no doubt that it is a harsh and
unforgiving economic climate in which to be reviewing and updating the retail offering. But we are making progress.
You have heard George talk about the early indication of success in our strategy for beauty of using our expertise and
brands to differentiate our offering. The growth we have seen in the health and wellness and beauty category sales and
underlying margin in our stores is encouraging. Our decision to expand the Beauty Differentiation strategy reflects the
positive response we have had from our customers. With the evolution of our Walgreens beauty offering, we expect to
see leading third-party beauty brands forming part of the growing range in our stores. Of course our work in beauty is
only part of the changes we intend to make, to change and announce the retail mix and offering across our stores. This
work is made simple [ph] real (24:33) quick as we do it, we must constantly monitor each individual change, carefully
balancing the space allocation with product needs and the overall customer experience. There are, however, plenty of
example of how successful this can be if you get it right.
Turning to Rite Aid, I am still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion, but there is no doubt
that the process of getting clearance for the transaction is taking longer than we expected. We are constantly and
currently collaborating with FTC, Rite Aid and Fred's to get the necessary approvals and close the transaction. At the
same time, we are working to be in a position to certify compliance. We believe that we can achieve this in the coming
weeks and are still working toward our revised timetable to obtain clearance by the end of July. The changes to the deal
that we agreed in January demonstrate our absolute commitment to ensure all transactions meet our demanding
financial and strategic requirements, while allowing us the ability to address any reasonable demand that may be made
of us in obtaining regulatory approval.
In terms of guidance, as George has said, we are reiterating our estimated range for the full fiscal year. Looking to the
second half and beyond, there are some big challenges ahead and a lot of hard work, but a huge amount of
opportunities. However, therefore, we have confidence in our ability to continue to generate and capture true value for
our shareholder for this year and beyond.
Thank you. Now, I will hand you back to Gerald.

<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great, thanks for the questions. Given the really strong same-store script comp this
quarter, that 7.9% you guys highlighted, can you share any thoughts on maybe why you didn't see a stronger
corresponding increase in the front end? Seems to be a little bit of a disconnect between the strength and the script
count and then the performance on the front end count.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Bob, morning, it's Alex here. Yes. I think as, in the prepared remarks, George and
both Stefano said, it was a tough market, first of all. So we saw good growth in a tough market, particularly in
healthcare, which you expect to see the link to the pharmacy business and also through our investment in beauty care,
we saw again some solid growth. Where we didn't see growth in the front end was really in the seasonal businesses.
It was a tough Valentine's Day for the whole market; and also in foods where there's [ph] clearly (28:06) a lot of
deflation, driven by competition on some commodity pricing that sort of affected us last summer and still running. We
do track as best we can link sales and we are confident that we're seeing the link we expected and also very confident
that as the market moves on, this new volume and the new footfall will improve the front end performance against the
strategy that we've clearly laid out.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And I guess just going back to the Rite Aid deal and the timing,
Stefano, you talked about this obviously dragging on longer than you anticipated. I guess where exactly aren't you and
the FTC seeing eye to eye? And then I'm curious, do you think the deal can get approved given the current
configuration of the FTC? Or does there need to be more commissioners added in order to gain approval?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, as I said, I am still positive on this deal. I believe that we have a strong argument to
defend this deal. I cannot comment on the organization of the FTC. It would be up to them to decide whether they have
enough people or not to judge on the quality of this deal. We are doing what we can together with Rite Aid and Fred's.
We are collaborating very well with the FTC, and as I said, we are preparing ourselves to be ready to certify
compliance if we will decide to do so.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question's from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you. Stefano, I'd like to come back to your comment around Prime. The [ph] FEP (30:13)
win was notable and not something we expected to see on their own; so it seems like early success. As you talk about
the opportunities mid-term and long-term, do you see your role as enabling fulfillment in dispensing? Or do you see
Walgreens as having a role in enabling pharmacy benefit management as well?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We believe that we are in the market that we have to follow the needs of the market and to be
as useful as possible.
<Q - Eric Percher>: And so are there elements of Walgreens negotiation with manufacturers or purchasing that you
think are of value in the pharmacy benefit space? Can you add on to what Prime has already created there?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: To be honest, I believe that the market is evolving, is changing. And for sure, we will have a
role to play in this market and we will try to [ph] seize (31:25) all the opportunities that we will have in this market.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Okay. Fair. And, George, quickly, is the buyback at all impacting fiscal year 2017 guidance?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I mean, given the timing that we've just earlier this week announced that there
would be the buyback of up to $1 billion, it won't have any material impact in this year's earnings were we to start
buying back shares.

Thank you. Our next question's from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa Gill>: Thanks very much and good morning. Just given your comments around the challenging front end
environment and the comments of not seeing as much pull-through on certain, whether you talk about seasonal or more
commodity or food, how do you think about the layout of your store going forward? Alex, I think I heard you say that
you did see pull-through on a little bit of beauty as well as healthcare. Do you think about your strategy around retail
clinic and maybe perhaps growing that more? How do you think about a strategy around lab? Not talking about like a
Theranos, but more blood drawn, more services in that aspect as we think about healthcare. And to Stefano's comments
around the changing and evolving landscape as we think about healthcare needs.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Lisa. Hi. It's Alex here. I think you're absolutely right. We've clearly got [ph] great
corners (32:49). The other platform I've got is a great visual platform; so we have definitely got the right presence in
the market. We don't have the right products in this space that we have physically in our stores and we're doing
something about that. I mean as George said in his prepared remarks, we're not going to accelerate the reduction of our
necessary SKUs. We've already been working hard in areas like seasonal before this and we're going to go further
particularly as we look at our lower volume stores going forward.
We're very committed to finding the right products and the right healthcare solutions for this space that we free up and
we've got good experience in Europe, for example, with our Opticians business and with the Hearingcare business and
of course we've got good experience here in America with clinics. So you're absolutely right. We are really thinking
very hard in testing and trialing different ways by which we can offer customers more particularly as we move to more
of a health, wellness and beauty convenience model and that's very much part of our thinking.
But it will take some time, I think as we said before, to get the right customer experience, the right partnerships in
particular and the right economics, but we're very [ph] confident (34:11) we'll find that model in this marketplace.
<Q - Lisa Gill>: Great. And then just one follow-up for George. If I look at the comps were basically up 8% on the
pharmacy side, but sales were up about [ph] 4% (34:13). How do I think about that? I mean, clearly I'm sure generics
was part of that, but is there something else? Is that the reimbursement component of it that's a drag?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: As ever, it's the combination, if you look at the relativity of generic deflation
relative what's happening on the branded, mix is always the other factor and to a much lesser extent the reimbursement
element.
<Q - Lisa Gill>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: It's a combination. Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, sir.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Sure, question, how do you guys think about the evolution of limited networks going
forward, right? The composition of those, in a lot of cases, is the economics more likely to be around Walgreen versus
a CVS in some of those networks? Or can it be kind of more of the two of you and other retailers not participating?
How do you think that evolves?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, John. It's Alex here. Yes. I think we play in the marketplace and the marketplace is
definitely evolving towards narrower networks. We really work hard to figure out what the payer or the marketplace
wants, whether that be the commercial marketplace, or Med D, and obviously Medicaid as well. And we work out an
economic model to see what the volume, the value looks like. So we don't try and drive the marketplace in that
direction. We believe strongly in partnerships. We have no vested interest apart from looking after our customers and
giving good value, a combination of price and service. But there's no doubt the marketplace is evolving towards

narrower networks and we have to operate and participate in that marketplace.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. And then completely different, given your expertise in beauty, is there an opportunity
for standalone beauty stores? And I say that from the perspective of getting access to brands that you might not be able
to inside a Walgreens box. Is that an opportunity? Or you simply have too much to do inside a drugstore to think about
that?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: We think the opportunity is very much inside of our drugstores and move towards
more of a health and beauty convenience specialist. That's where we're seeing the investment in the growth right now.
The future of the business will be focused on many ideas, but at the moment we're absolutely focused on making the
very most of the 8 million customers who use Walgreens today both online and in the pharmacies and also developing a
more appropriate beauty offer. And we're seeing some really good things happening in the early stage of this promotion
of the strategy and we're going to continue to drive. And as George has said already in his prepared remarks, we're
moving to another 1,000 stores with our Beauty Differentiation project. So that tells you the confidence we have in this
strategy.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the results. I guess just on the Prime
Therapeutics, the narrow network deal that started back on January 1, just curious if there's any more color on whether
the amount of additional Rx volume was in line with your expectations or perhaps slightly better? And also, are you
able to comment on how many of the 14 Blues plans have signed up for the Walgreens narrow network deal so far?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Hi, Steve. I can't obviously make, again, comments on the second one, but we can
tell you that it's absolutely in line with expectations. And I can also tell you that we are pleased and also Prime are
pleased on the – the owners of Prime are also pleased, the Blues plans who own Prime. So we're satisfied with the
progress we've made. The next phase for us to is give the members of the Blues a better value, and obviously we're
looking at ways we can do that as the market evolves.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. And then just quickly on Rite Aid, not sure if you can comment on this or not, but
just if for some reason the FTC were to decide that Fred's cannot be the buyer of the Rite Aid store divestitures, should
we assume that one option would be that Walgreens could then still go back to the drawing board with other potential
buyers of those divested stores? Or if Fred's is not the buyer, does that essentially kind of bring you then to the potential
Walgreens-Rite Aid merger? Just curious if you're able to comment on that or is it too early to think about that next
scenario?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: For the time being – Stefano here. For the time being, we believe that Fred is the right buyer.
We believe that they have, particularly in the configuration we are proposing now, they are absolutely a legitimate
player in this industry. If for some reason this would not be the case, we will review our options of course, and we will
take a decision.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.

<Q - Brian Gil Tanquilut>: Hey. Good morning, guys. George, it looks like you're continuing to make good progress
and leverage G&A, obviously slightly ahead of schedule of that $1.5 billion target. So how should we think about the
opportunity going forward and the flow-through for the rest of the year of the efforts that you've put in in the past in

terms of driving more G&A dollars down?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Well, this, I mean, on the particular program that we talked about today, we're
obviously very pleased to have achieved our target. The program will conclude as we previously announced at the –
around the end of this fiscal year.
Some of the benefits of that, we'll obviously continue to see and see more of in the coming years. Given that,
nevertheless, looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our sort of business is just a way of life. So we will
absolutely continue to look for opportunities year after year. They will come in different places. They may be in
different geographies, but there are always opportunities to drive efficiency and so it's just a never-ending we will
continue, this program will finish, but we'll continue to look for more opportunities.
<Q - Brian Gil Tanquilut>: Got it. And then – sorry, guys.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Sorry. People say while cutting cost is something that has an end, you cannot really rely on it
forever. But it's not just a matter of cutting costs. Synergies and savings are not just coming from reducing costs. Very
often, it depends – they can depend on a different organization. And so if you have a, let's say, an approach to the
business which is completely open-minded, you can continue to drive efficiency and reduce cost just changing the
organization.
And this is really what we have done for many, many years and what, I believe, we are relatively good at doing. And so
we continue to believe that we will be able to drive efficiency for many years, independently on the obvious cost
cutting that everybody can see.
<Q - Brian Gil Tanquilut>: Yes, appreciate that color, Stefano. To follow up on Eric's question earlier on SAP in
specialty, I was just wondering how would you describe your – the pipeline that you have right now in terms of that
partnership with Prime on the specialty side, in terms of pipeline for new contracts? Or should we think of this as a –
kind of like a one-off win where it's kind of choppy? And also what is the pitch that you guys make to potential clients
and what differentiates the Walgreens and Prime specialty offering?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, yeah. It's Alex here. I think it's pretty clear that what we've done here is got the
attention, particularly of the Blues plans which we're very pleased about and really the pitch is really quite a simple
one. Prime Therapeutics really works to make sure that the value it creates is passed through to the Blues members in
different ways. And what we do is really, as a back shop operator particularly of mail order and also specialty fill is to
make sure that we're really efficient and give great service directly in the dispensing process. So this was a win for
Prime Therapeutics, SAP. And obviously, we believe with our greater scale and our expertise in dispensing
prescriptions in specialty and central fill that, that gives extra capability to Prime and that appears to be seen by the
marketplace as well.
<Q - Brian Gil Tanquilut>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Hey. Just following up on the specialty question. So how is your sort of view of that market and
the right competitive landscape and the right level of profits sort of evolved as you've thought about the launch of
AllianceRx? Because it's obviously been an area – there's a lot of scrutiny; there's a lot of questions on what the right
dollar level per script or what services should be required or should not be required? How do you feel like you bring a
bit of a different viewpoint to maybe a market that had been somewhat stagnant the last couple years in terms of its
evolution?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. It's Alex again. Again, I think that we bring, as I said before that efficiency to the
marketplace. But [ph] we're not all (45:05) doing that for sure. There's others who are larger, who bring that efficiency
as well. Secondly, we bring the opportunity of the network pharmacies. As we said before, we don't just a central fill;

we actually own independent of AllianceRx the specialty network about 1,000 center of excellence, primarily based
around HIV. And also we have now a couple hundred specialty pharmacies which are either close to hospitals or close
to specialist doctors.
So again, we offer different routes to market and we offer a different approach. And we also believe strongly in this
area that we should be paid for the service and the care we provide. These are expensive, complicated medications. We
have pharmacists who are playing to the top of their certificates when they're taking care of patients who are on these
medications and we want to make sure that we are adequately [indiscernible] (46:03) that part of the process. And other
remunerations belong to other bits in the system; for example, the PBM; for example, the insurance company. We want
to be well rewarded for giving the care that our pharmacy gives in that way.
<Q - Ross Muken>: And maybe on the big picture side, a lot of the managed care organizations have talked about sort
of a more integrated model or have talked about wanting a presence closer to the individual. Obviously, you have some
of the best real estate and you've also been quite great at lowering costs and prices for individuals and bearing that high
level of service. How have your conversations with managed care around what else you can provide to them or how
your dispensing organization and other services fits in with their goals, how has that conversation evolved over time?
And what should we be focused on in terms of future opportunities, high level or big picture that could go on in those
relationships?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yes. Again, It's Alex again. So again, we have, as you've seen, outsourced effectively a
couple hundred now of our clinics in different ways. And in these conversations, we focus on really our strategic ability
to become a very efficient and available client dispensing service for them and that really resonates with them. And
secondly, we have, as you said, the real estate where they can actually come in and have the lower cost ways of
delivering services in the community outside of their more expensive systems. So these really are the two areas that we
talk about a lot of. We have a lot of different ways of doing that, lot of ways of working, whether it be with Advocate
here in Chicago. So again, it's an area where for sure the conversations are good and we're learning together. Again, it
goes back to partnership. We know what we're good at, I mean, all of the areas where we want support and for sure, the
clinic strategy, I think, is a great example of that.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Yes. Good morning. A couple of follow-up questions here. First of all, when we think
about the script comps, up 90 basis points quarter-to-quarter, should we think about these comps continuing to
accelerate through the back half of the year? When you think about the opportunity to capture membership in volume
from these partners, do you think that it was all captured in this first quarter or we'll see an uptick later in the year? And
same questions about, kind of like, the cadence of margins. Should we expect to start seeing margins that are associated
with these scripts improving in the back half of the year?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Ricky. It's Alex, again. Yes, I think that we did have a helpful uptick in seasonal
illness flu effectively for a few weeks, which spiked some of the numbers, for us certainly, in Q2. So the way I think
about it is that these are driven by two factors, there was a small uptick in flu we saw and also, all of these contracts
[ph] in the mean (49:34) started 1/1. So two months and then with DOD started, as you know, at 1/12, and remember
Med D, which again is, we've had a good season in Med D again, started 1/1. So we're confident that the rate we have
at the moment is what we expected and the strong volume will therefore continue.
In terms of margin, I would think, again, I'll go back to operating margin for us. It really is about leveraging our fixed
assets as we continue to offer market-competitive prices, not below-market, but market-competitive prices and drive
volume through our fixed assets and we expect to leverage that more as we've always said in the second half of the year
compared to the first half of the year. And it's important to look at the annual results, as George has reiterated, that

again, we are keeping our guidance for the full year at between, as you work that out, between 7% and 11% EBIT
growth, yeah.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: But remember – Stefano here, but remember that our goal has always been to keep the overall
operating margin as flat as possible and the dynamic in this market, in many other market is that you have to give more
to your customers. You can get a little more from your suppliers and you can become more efficient. And so at the end,
combining these three elements, you have to manage to have a margin overall year-on-year, more or less, flattish, if
possible.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. And following up on that, when we think about getting more from the suppliers
and getting more efficiencies on the back end, do you still see opportunities to improve kind of like purchasing
efficiencies or grow scale for WBAD? One contract that's kind of up in the market that comes to mind is the Express
Scripts/AmerisourceBergen contract. Do you see an opportunity there?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: There are always opportunities on the market, and we are looking at the market very carefully
and we will try to [ph] seize (51:48) all the opportunities that we will see in the market.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. But is this something that's kind of like already included in guidance or is that –
could be potential upside?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: When we give our guidance, we try to put in the guidance all the elements that we believe
certain or very likely. I cannot give you more details if you can easily understand.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: And then lastly on the tax rate. Tax rate came in lower than we anticipated. How should
we think about the tax rate, George, for the remaining of the year?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I think really always look at the year-to-date – the year-to-date effective tax rate.
And if you look at that from an adjusted basis, as I said, that was around 24.5%. So I think tax, obviously mix can
change quarter-by-quarter, but looking at year-to-date, I think, is perhaps the best way of thinking about this discrete
items. Of course, the timing of those are always a little bit uncertain and they can go up or down, but think of the
year-to-date.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Cherny>: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for all the details so far. Maybe to ask Ricky's
WBAD question a little bit of a different way, as you think about the generic deflation you're seeing across the market,
how do you think about the trade-off in terms of what you're seeing across the market and what you can't control versus
what you're doing with regards to sourcing and, on a go-forward basis, depending on how you're planning for what's an
uncertain generic deflationary environment? How does that position you in terms of being able to drive either
incremental sourcing or essentially eating some of the potential challenges you have on the pricing side?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We make certain assumptions and on the basis of these assumptions, we have our internal
targets. And, I repeat, the assumptions are taking really into account all the different pieces of information that we have
on the market.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Sorry, it's Alex here. I think we're in the market; so we see how the market's changing
in terms of price pressure and we accept that and we're always working on two areas. One is how do we actually buy
better and how do we continue to not just save money as Stefano said, but to really re-create the organization and move
money around to invest in areas where we can grow and grow volume. So I think we've never denied the fact that the
pricing pressures is there, but never – we've always been aware of it and always try and anticipate that in our guidance.
So the market is the market and we've got to operate within it and, for sure, we believe we have a strong strategy for the

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the question about operating margins in the
back half of the year. How should we think about it by segment? International retail operating margins in the back half,
should that continue to be challenged at a similar level as you saw in the quarter or are there opportunities there? And
also, the U.S., is that something that you would expect to flatten out in the back half?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Obviously, we haven't given specific guidance by segment [ph] of it, so first start
(55:42) by reiterating our overall guidance figures. I mean in terms of thinking about the modeling, there's going to be a
number of factors that you've got to think about. I mean, firstly, we are consolidating the new Prime deal from Monday
when we complete it and you need to think about that in factoring the U.S. model, recognizing obviously that that is a
specialty and mail business with different dynamics.
In terms of the International businesses, I think as we've said in the prepared remarks, there is still the challenge in the
UK with the NHS having cut the reimbursement. That will continue, though Boots has performed robustly as we said
over the key Christmas period, but retailing is still itself quite challenging, particularly in the UK, which is our largest
market.
And then on Wholesale, Wholesale is always a business or a division that operates in a number of markets. You can
always get a certain mix effect quarter-by-quarter, so it's tough to model, I know, quarter by quarter. But I did point out
in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets, we had some growth really in the period when you get
price changes in the market where people tend to buy in ahead of – customers buy in ahead of the price change and that
was the notable impact in the second quarter.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: And it's Alex here again. Just really quickly on the UK, as George has said, the
reimbursement pressure was the main reason for the decline. Really, there was two things the government did. One
they normally do, which is the buying margin which is normal in the UK contract. Then secondly, this year on
December, they actually removed some of the service payments, practice payments. And again, if you look on [ph]
newsreels (58:13), you'll see that's a big issue in the UK.
So that really is a reason why we've had that decrease in operating profit. The retail business had a good December and
we're focusing in on controlling our costs, really driving, as we always do, new innovative products particularly in
beauty into the marketplace and developing new pharmacy services. So we're looking to stabilize that business. But the
impact of the government action has been pretty strong this year for our main UK business.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Great. Thanks for the color. And just a quick follow-up on the beauty initiatives, the
remodels. Just wanted to get an update on what you've seen from those, if you've seen an uplift to comps not only into
the beauty section, but also the overall store in some of these newer markets? And if so, could you quantify that at all?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. It's Alex again. I mean, really, it's so early on. The 2,000 stores, if you recall, we
had about a marketplace in Phoenix which we tested in trials and we took the best model and implemented that really
last year into the first 2,000 stores. So, so far, so good. We're seeing the beauty brands growing, which we expected to
do. And over time, we'll develop the offer and the marketing around that new beauty offering. But it's too early to tell
the effects it's going to have on the rest of our business. But we remain confident it will have a positive impact.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is open.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Can you talk a bit about how you're going to roll up the Prime partnership into your
P&L? So like, for example, obviously with this $2.9 billion contract that Prime just won in specialty, how much of that
is going to flow through to your P&L? Like when we think about central fill for specialty, I guess what portion of
specialty would that be? Any color there would be great. Thanks.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Well, just on the accounting side, I mean, we will account for it on a fully
consolidated basis. So when you're looking at our sales, our adjusted operating income, then you will obviously see
100% of the entity's results coming through. But then when you're actually looking at then earnings attributable to our
shareholders, to the WBA shareholders, we strip out in the line the proportion that is attributable to Prime itself. And I
think we said, we own just over 50% of the business. So when you're thinking of EPS, then it will be our share. If
you're thinking of operating, it's 100%, that's the way the accounting works.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: That's great. So for the [ph] FEP (1:01:04) win, that $2.9 billion in revenue, all of that is
going to flow through onto your P&L? And then if they win, say, mail in a year or so, that would also all flow through
into your P&L, that – the full $2 billion or $3 billion for mail and $2 billion or $3 billion for specialty, for revenue?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Anything that goes through the venture, the new combined venture, as I say, we
show 100% in revenue, 100% in adjusted operating income, but then we strip out, as I say, the lower end of the P&L,
the Prime share. So when we're looking at adjusted earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, that's got their
share netted out.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. Great. And then I think Prime uses WBAD as well, right, through ADC. So the
value-add or pitch to managed care clients is both, I mean, there's a significant COGS benefit there, I would imagine,
right, for managed care?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We cannot comment on that. We cannot comment on the contract that Prime have or will have.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Oh, great. Thanks. Great. Thanks. Congrats on a good quarter.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just had one regarding
the U.S. profitability in the pharmacy as we look out. If the Rite Aid deal does not get approved, how should we frame
it as we move out over next year or two or three with all these contracts that have been signed, specifically the
profitability of the pharmacy?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Scott. It's Alex here. Again, as we've been really clear, we are independently
working hard on our pharmacy strategy independent of Rite Aid, and we feel very confident with the network we have
already is strong enough to be very competitive in the marketplace. Anything that we achieve when the FTC give a
decision to approve Rite Aid will be incremental as George has indicated in the EPS numbers and also in terms of the
synergies we announced as part of the deal.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And also, you will appreciate that we will not be able to integrate all the stores of Rite Aid
overnight, so there will be a period probably of a certain number of years, where we will have to rely mainly on our
stores. And in the meantime, we will integrate all the stores of Rite Aid. So you cannot see the effect immediately.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Right. And then looking at the front end, just obviously the beauty part of it seems to be
working out well and I just want to clarify, you say another 100 stores are going to get the enhanced beauty between
now and the end of the year? I just want to make sure I had that number correct.

<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: It's 1,000 Scott, so we've got roughly just under...
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: 1,000?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah. Roughly it's under 2,000 just now, and this moves up to roughly a few thousand
[indiscernible] (1:04:18) just approaching 8,300; so 3,000 will have this by the end of this – really the end of the
summer effectively, yeah.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. And then any thoughts on what those stores do in comparison to the rest? I think
you're at negative 0.8% comp on the chain, but do those stores perform 100 basis points – 200 basis points better? Any
parameters you have on that?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, again, it's really how we own and the way we're managing this really is about the
underlying retail margin, the operating margin in particular. And the more we see increases, relatively speaking, in
beauty care and healthcare, but in beauty care, the more we see the retail underlying margin improving over time in a
sustainable way. We're working around, I'd say, the rest of the model. As Stefano said in his opening remarks, we're
changing this model in quite a torrid time in the U.S. for market changes. So we're very pleased with the progress we're
making, but that's how we measure it.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. So then my final one is a pretty good quarter considering all the headwinds that the
business faced. As we look out over the next 6 to 12 months, do you see any change in the headwinds that the business
is facing? Do think it's abating? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Or is it – it's going to continue to be this
difficult as you move through the next 6 to 12 months? And that's it for me. Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, there are headwinds, but we hope that we will be able to have also some tailwinds. And
so we hope that at the end that we will be able to deliver what we have promised.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: I would just reiterate, if you just think of the guidance that we've given, we've
maintained our guidance today. If you do the math, then that implies a 7% to 11% year-over-year growth and that
includes approximately a 12% headwind for currency. So if you exclude the headwind and obviously currency can go
one way or the other, but if you execute the headwind, then the guidance implies 9% to 13% year-over-year growth in
underlying adjusted EPS.
So I think that really, I think, gives a strong indication of what our thinking is and what we see how the business is
performing overall. And as we said at the start of the year, this would be a more second half-weighted. And the year,
the first quarter/second quarter has come out very much in line with our expectations. So that's really how we are
thinking about how the business is performing at the moment.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Perfect, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.

how I would describe it.
