MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2011 earnings call. This call is being
recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.
Douglas L. Braunstein
Thanks, operator. It's Doug here. I'm going to be taking you through the earnings presentation. It's available on our
website, as you know. We'll take questions after walking through the presentation. And with that, let's turn to page one.
For the quarter, we generated net income of $5.6 billion, $1.28 a share, and that was on revenues of $25.8 billion. As
we've done historically, we're highlighting several significant items in the quarter right up front. I'm going to try and
cover them in some detail here, but they are included in the numbers for the lines of business.
First item is a $0.29 per share increase in earnings, and that comes from a reduction in the credit card services
allowance for loan losses. I'll talk you through the specifics of net charge-offs and our delinquency rates when we get to
credit card later on.

Second item is a $0.16 per share decrease in earnings. That's from a fair value adjustment to our MSR servicing asset.
And this adjustment really represents the impact of the actual and our anticipated increases in servicing cost, including
the compliance with our anticipated requirements that are going to be imposed through the OCC and Fed through a
consent order that we anticipate receiving later today.
The third item is a $0.10 per share decrease in earnings and expected costs for foreclosure related matters. And these
costs are really our best current estimate for affidavit related delays as well as certain legal expenses. We don't view
these costs as run-rate expenses. But to be clear, there could be further costs around this matter before we're finished.
We ended the quarter with Tier I common of $120 billion, strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 10% and 7.3%
respectively. You see those on the page, an increase of about 20 basis points quarter over quarter. You also see on the
next page ROE of 13%, ROTCE of 18%, also strong results. And broadly speaking, we had solid performance across
our businesses, but I'll dive into those.
I've covered all the items on page two. So if you skip to page three, we'll start talking about the Investment Bank;
circled net income here on the page of $2.4 billion. That's on revenues of $8.2 billion. Investment Banking fees in the
quarter were $1.8 billion, up 23% year on year. We continue to be ranked number one, but it remains a very highly
competitive market. The results this quarter reflect record debt underwriting fees. And if you go to page 19, you can see
our league table results.
Markets revenues this quarter, $6.6 billion; that really reflects very strong client based revenues. And it was generated
in part through the volatilities that we experienced in the first quarter in the markets and us helping our clients manage
through that volatility. While these numbers are slightly down from a record first quarter 2010, still very strong results.
$5.2 billion of revenue you see on the page in fixed income. There was strong performance across all of our asset
classes there: rates, FX, credit, securitized products, and strong performance in commodities. $1.4 billion in revenues in
equities this quarter, and that also represented strong performance across cash derivatives and prime services.
DVA for the quarter related to the structured notes both in fixed income and equities was not a material number. It was
a positive $20 million, and it really didn't change quarter-on-quarter performance.
You see here, CPG reported a revenue loss of $190 million. And just a reminder, there are three items in that number.
Typically, NII and fees on retained loans are going to be about $200 million plus or minus in a quarter. And then you
have the market impact of hedges on the loan book, which were negative this quarter; and the impact of CVA and
DVA, which were also negative in the quarter. And that led to the result.
Credit cost, $429 million benefit; and that really reflects a reduction in loan loss allowances, largely related to loan
sales and net repayments. And just a reminder again, here as we approach a more normalized credit environment, this
item is going to return to being an expense item on an ongoing basis.
Expenses in the quarter you see were $5 billion, up 4% year on year. That's really due to higher performance-based
compensation, and that has partially been offset by lower non-comp expense. Comp-to-revenue ratio you'll see on the
page is 40% this quarter. And just a reminder, it's going to vary slightly quarter on quarter based on business mix. But
we continue to expect our full-year guidance to be consistent with what we shared with you at the end of the fourth
quarter, which is 35% to 40%.
One final note here, you see the loan balances in the Investment Bank up 2%, modestly. And you'll see that uptick to
the extent that we continue to have active participation in the investment banking market, particularly the strategic
advisory business, and you'll see that in an uptick in our loan balances.
With that, I'll turn to page four, RFS. Just a moment on this page; this is a consolidated view. RFS for the quarter lost
$208 million on $6.3 billion worth of revenue. And let me jump into the details really on page five.
At the top, Retail Banking had solid performance, net income of a little under $900 million on revenues of $4.4 billion.
Revenue was up modestly year over year, and that was net of an impact of lower deposit related fees. There were some
key drivers on the prior page. I'd highlight deposit growth of 4% year over year, investment sales revenues up 11%. We

built 33 new branches in the quarter. Expenses in the quarter were up 9% year over year, and that's really the
continuing theme in investment. Our branch builds, our sales force build-out; we're up a little under 4,000 sales force
year over year in the branches.
Mortgage Banking, Auto and Consumer Lending, there was a net loss of $937 million here on revenues of a little under
$700 million. And the results here were impacted both on the revenue line and the expense line by the two significant
items that I covered on the first page. I'm not going to talk about those.
Revenues of $1.9 billion excluding the MSR risk management results really reflect $36 billion in mortgage loan
originations this quarter, higher volumes, wider margins than the first quarter of last year, but lower volumes and lower
margins than the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues here also reflected solid performance in the quarter for our auto
business.
The other number that's included in that $1.9 billion, you'll see, is repurchase losses of $420 million for the quarter.
That's a contra-revenue item. The repurchase losses here are really slightly above the trend line this quarter, and it's
primarily related to some refinement of certain of our repurchase estimates. But I would say going forward, we
continue to expect repurchase losses to be on a quarterly run rate consistent with our $1.2 billion plus or minus for the
year.
I've covered really the significant issues in MSR risk and expense. And other than those highlighted issues, the other
line items for costs and servicing really reflect our production and volumes in the quarter.
With that, I really want to turn our attention on page six to the real estate portfolios. I'll talk briefly on this page. Net
income loss of $162 million, that's on revenues of $1.2 billion. That's down a little under $400 million year over year.
The lower revenue number is really a decline in NII, and it's a result of the portfolio runoff. Balances declined year
over year a little under $32 billion, $7.5 billion quarter on quarter, and we've told you about that. Consistent with that,
you'd expect full-year NII to be down around $700 million. NII was also down on some spread compression.
On the credit side, what I'd like to do is go through the details on page seven. So if you turn to page seven and the
Home Lending update, you see circled net charge-offs on this page for the quarter were $1.1 billion. They're modestly
improved our prior quarter, but they're certainly in line with the delinquency trends that we saw in Q3 and Q4. If you
exclude the one-time adjustment that we talked about in the fourth quarter, you look at home equity and subprime net
charge-offs are relatively flat. And you see the prime mortgage net charge-offs actually improved quarter on quarter.
And then if you took a look at that graph we put on page 16 in the appendix, what you'll see is delinquency rates have
really declined modestly across all of our portfolios. And all other things being equal, that should have a positive
impact two quarters out on our future charge-offs.
The other comments I'd make on this page is you'll see we didn't make any changes at all to our reserves in either our
non-credit impaired or our purchase credit impaired portfolio in the quarter. And we continued, given some of the
uncertainties in the market, to maintain our net charge-off guidance of $1.2 billion plus or minus in the quarter.
Page eight, let's shift focus to Card Services. Circled net income on this page was $1.3 billion, revenues of
approximately $4 billion. Credit cost, really the focus in this quarter; they were down significantly to $226 million.
And if you look first at the bottom two circled numbers on the page, you see 6.20% is the charge-off rate for our Chase
portfolios. That's an improvement of 88 basis points quarter on quarter. That follows a 98 basis point improvement
from Q3 to Q4.
And then you see the 30-plus day delinquencies decline to 3.25% in this quarter. That's down 41 basis points quarter on
quarter, and we'd expect to see modest improvement there in the second quarter. The result of that improvement is the
reduction in our future estimated losses; and as a result of that, the $2 billion pre-tax loan loss reserve release that I
covered on page one.
Just one other moment here on our guidance for the second quarter, we'd expect the charge-off rate for the Chase
portfolio to be 5.5% plus or minus; and we do hope there's some modest upside in the ultimate rate for the second
quarter.

On the revenue line of $4 billion, it's down 10% year on year, 6% quarter on quarter. And again, there's a consistent
theme here on revenues. The lower revenues are driven by a $23 billion lower average balances outstanding year over
year. And also, we had 100% run rate impact for the CARD Act in this quarter relative to the first quarter of last year.
A positive note here, if you look at sales volumes, Chase volume was up 12% year over year, a little over $75 billion of
spend from Chase cards. And as I mentioned last quarter, we really believe we continue to outpace the industry sales
growth data. And that reflects itself ultimately in improved market share, which means when customers are going to
stores, they are taking out their Chase cards more often than any other. It also does reflect some underlying positive
sales trends for consumers in general.
One other quick note before I move on; on January 1, you'll see on this page and in the supplement, we transferred our
Commercial Card business from TSS to Card Services; a modest increase in revenues, increase in loan balances, and
actually a reduction in margin as a result of all of that.
Page nine, Commercial Bank; you see circled net income of $546 million. That's on revenues of $1.5 billion. Revenues
are up 7% year on year. That's a function of growth in loan balances, growth in liability balances, actually some wider
spreads year over year, higher Investment Banking fees year over year. And that's offset by continued spread
compression in our deposit taking businesses.
Credit costs in the quarter, $47 million; you see that on the middle of the page. That really reflects stable to improving
credit trends in this business. Losses really continue to be weighted towards our real estate portfolio, but the losses in
real estate also declined in the quarter. And again, I'd just caution that we will expect this portfolio over time to trend
towards the normal through-the-cycle net charge-off rate of about 50 basis points that we talked about at Investor Day.
Circled EOP loan balance, as you see on the page, of $100.2 billion; that's up modestly again this quarter, but I want to
dig a little deeper. Loan volumes for the C&I portfolio have increased now for four consecutive quarters. Middle
market loan balances, the average balances are up $4.3 billion or 13% year over year, which is quite substantial. And
balances have been up now for 12 consecutive months. And while we know that our loan growth in that area is a mix of
market share gains and demand, this type of trend speaks more in part to what we believe is increasing demand in the
space. Utilization rates in the first quarter have begun also to show the first signs of modest improvement, and it's the
first time we've seen uptick in several quarters there.
And then one last comment, you see the growth in liability balances, 17% year-over-year growth. We've got $156
billion of balances. Clients continue to generate cash, and we hold that cash for them. And I think that speaks, again, to
the quality of the customer base.
Treasury & Securities Services on page 10; circled net income of $316 million in the quarter; that's up 13% year on
year, 23% quarter on quarter. Revenue of $1.8 billion, that's up 5% year on year. And if you dive into WSS, revenue
was up 9%. That's really driven by net inflows and higher market values of assets under custody. You see the other
circled number on this page, $16.6 trillion of assets under custody. That's a record number.
TS revenues were up 1%. But if you exclude the move of Commercial Card to Card Services, revenues were actually
up 7% in the quarter. And you'll see in our supplement, the build-out, as we've talked about of our international
businesses, it's really reflected in trade loan balances. Those are $25.5 billion in the quarter. That's up 86% year over
year. It's up 21% quarter on quarter, and we hope to continue to grow that business.
Expenses continue to be up 4% year on year, and that is a function of the discussion we've talked about in terms of
investment, particularly around international. Although this quarter, it was offset by the transfer out of the Commercial
Card business.
And then one other quick item here; you see this credit allocation income expense. The details are in the footnote, but
we're basically trying to capture the sharing of the economics associated with the Corporate Bank credit book. That's
actually a net benefit this quarter of $27 million. And this line item is going to be a little more volatile than what we've
done historically, which is charge through the credit cycle charge to Treasury & Securities Services.

Page 5 of 20
Page 11, Asset Management; you see circled net income of $466 million in the quarter. That's up 19% year on year.
Circled revenues, $2.4 billion; that's up 13% year on year; and revenue growth was really based on a few factors. We
continued to have strong net inflows into products with higher margins; record asset under management inflows
actually into long-term products this quarter of $27 billion. That's the eighth consecutive quarter of long-term flows.
And that was offset by outflows in liquidity products of about $9 billion. We also had the benefit of higher market
levels this quarter; and on a quarter-on-quarter basis, lower mortgage production, but higher year over year.
Expense growth, the same theme we've talked about, up 15%, largely reflecting higher head count. We've added a little
over 1,100 people to our front office in the last year.
Page 12 now, Corporate and Private Equity; you see the top number, $383 million worth of net income from Private
Equity in the quarter. That's really reflecting gains in the number of realizations, also improvements in the market value
in our positions in the quarter. And you just remember here, financial results are going to vary based on the timing of
those realizations, market valuations, but you should expect to see an appropriate return over time for this portfolio.
Corporate net income reported, $339 million; this line item is also going to be lumpy, but over time, trending to $300
million plus or minus. CIO/Treasury will contribute to that. It's consistent with the guidance that we gave you this
quarter, but it's going to be volatile based on timing of our investments and gains in our positioning. As you'll see when
we release our Q, we continue to be positioned with the portfolio to take advantage of a rising rate environment, and
that's reflected in our NII in this quarter. Also, there are going to be a number of one-time items in the quarter. This
quarter, we had litigation expense of $350 million in Corporate.
Page 13, fortress balance sheet; I think I've really covered most of the points on this slide. What I will remind everyone
that hasn't focused on it is we did, as you know, increase our annual dividend to $1.00 a share, up from $0.20 a share.
And we also authorized this $15 billion multiyear share repurchase program, $8 billion of which we can repurchase in
2011.
Page 14 is the outlook page. I think I've covered all of this in the discussion.
And so what I'd like to do, operator, is open up the line and have Jamie and I available to answer questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - James Dimon>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just a quick question on the Investment Bank, first of all. Obviously, revenue was very
strong relative to, I think, probably what a lot of people might have expected. But you had a little bit of negative
operating leverage in that your expenses moved up more than your revenue. And in fact, revenue was down ever so
slightly. And your comp ratio, in particular, was 40%. That's an accrual, I guess, for this quarter versus 35% a year ago.
Can you give us a little color? Is that a mix shift? Are you trying to be a little more conservative on bonus accruals?
What's driving that?
<A - James Dimon>: A little bit of each.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And to the extent that is a mix shift, can you describe it to us a little bit?
<A - James Dimon>: It's just more client related business. We accrue higher in client related business.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And there has been some concern, I think, over the last few months in the
marketplace that large dealers like yourselves, given some of the uncertainty about capital costs, Basel III, et cetera, are

a little bit reluctant to put long-tailed derivative positions on. Is that being reflected at all in your results, and might that
have something to do with the decline in the margin?
<A - James Dimon>: So essentially, the capital and the risk-weighted already represent, in effect, Basel very close, or
at least our best estimates of Basel III. And while it's possible that some people are doing less long-tailed derivative
stuff, I would not put it in the material category. There's a lot of client volume, a lot of client flow, a lot of activity.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks for that. Your balance sheet shows a really significant increase in your deposits, both
year over year and sequentially, $65 billion, $70 billion. Can you give us a sense for what the big drivers are there?
<A - James Dimon>: I'll answer this question, but you've got to let someone else ask a question. Okay, Guy? So first
of all, if you look at the deposits, middle market – I mean Commercial Bank deposits are way up. TSS deposits are way
up. Private Bank deposits are way up. Retail deposits are up. Clients have a lot of money, and they're investing a lot.
And as you know, we keep on saying, there's a lot of money wash around the world. And obviously, we're a beneficiary
of some of that. You can see it by business if you go in deeper in the supplement.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, I'll step aside. Thank you.
<A - James Dimon>: Thanks, Guy.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - James Dimon>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: With respect to – you gave the credit card guidance of improved losses going down
to 5.5%; yet you're still carrying a 7.25% reserve. I guess ultimately, where should we see that number go to, and how
much does it lag the improvement in NCOs?
<A - James Dimon>: The reserve – look. Obviously, the reserves are coming down over time, precisely because of
what you mentioned. The reserves are based on a forward-looking view of charge-offs. As charges come down, the
reserve will come down. And eventually, they will be the same. If you're reserving effectively for 12 months of losses
and things are steady, eventually they will be the same. A normalized charge-off ratio will eventually be 4.5%. That's
through the cycle. It can obviously be lower than that or higher than that.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Got it. And then, Doug, on just one of the comments you made going through the
one-time items, you mentioned that some of those foreclosure costs should continue. With respect to the MSR
adjustment, is that, I guess, one-time and we shouldn't expect any other change go forward once we get this consent
order?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, Jason. The $1.1 billion is both our existing and our anticipated costs. That's the net
present value of those changes, and that's a one-time item. That's not to say the MSR asset we're going to constantly
revalue. The $650 million we don't believe is a run-rate item. But what I did say is there can clearly be further costs
associated with the foreclosure and affidavit issues before we're finished.
<A - James Dimon>: And it does not include any related penalties.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Right, okay. And then just lastly, in looking at – you give the Basel I and Basel III
Tier I common ratios. And it looks like the spread between the risk-weighted assets on both those numbers is about
$400 billion this quarter, but it was also about $400 billion in the year-ago quarter. Through mitigation and the like,
would we expect a further reduction in – or for that spread to narrow? Or how should we just think about it in terms of
– it doesn't look like there has been much mitigation on the RWAs for Basel III.

<A - James Dimon>: Because a lot of things went through RWA, but I think we said last time was that mitigation,
most of which, not all of which, most of which will happen by the end of this year, was $150 billion of risk-weighted
assets.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, and I would say it's towards – in fairness, Jason, you would expect to see more of
that towards the back end of the year as we get closer to market-based – market risk rules.
<A - James Dimon>: That's all things being equal, which they're not.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Right. We're going to be very – look, we've got ample capital, and we're going to be
very careful. To the extent that we choose to mitigate, it's got to make sense for us over the long term as an economic
matter.
<A - James Dimon>: We're not going to do it and lose money.
<Q - Jason M. Goldberg CFA>: Makes sense, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Yes, good morning. My question is really regarding capital again. You talk in the release about
managing, at least in the near term, to perhaps a 9% Basel I based Tier I common equity ratio versus your 10% level
currently. And obviously, the Basel III based ratio of 7.3% continues to build. So I'm wondering if you can give
perspective on what that means in terms of how you're thinking about driving excess capital into buybacks each
quarter. It looks like you could literally drive all of your retained earnings into buybacks and still be very adequately
capitalized. Are you thinking that you could do that much? If you're not willing to buy back that aggressively, how else
would you consider soaking up excess capital? Or would you indeed let those ratios just continue to build? I'm just
trying to get some perspective because capital seems to...
<A - James Dimon>: We can only buy back $8 billion of stock, according to the guidelines from the Fed. We are
going to buy back, regardless of price, $3 billion, which is what we issue, or approximately what we issue every year
for stock-related compensation. And the other part is discretionary; we're not going to automatically do it. It will be
price sensitive. And if we build up excess capital, so be it.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And Ed, the other thing I'd just remind you, we've got a lot of growth opportunities, and
we're really actually focused on investing that excess capital in those growth opportunities. And that's where our
priority is going to be.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. But I guess...
<A - James Dimon>: We also know the final Basel III guidelines that we have to hold to. We think 7% is plenty, but
that may not be the final guideline.
<Q - Ed R. Najarian>: Okay. So I guess the answer is you're willing to let those ratios continue to build in the near
term?
<A - James Dimon>: I would assume that that's going to happen because there's obviously very little we can do to stop

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi there. Doug, just a quickie. On the average rates on the balance sheet on page six, looking at
the trading assets. And it went up like 45 basis points, a pretty big jump on a one quarter basis. Is that just duration
extension on the mortgage assets or hedging related?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Is this Investment Banking or the whole company? I think this is the whole company?
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Whole company, whole company.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, I think that's really just a function of some better cost in dollar-roll financing, but
I'll get back to you specifically on it.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No problem. And sometimes this next one is just an allocation thing, but leverage at the IB, if
you just look at average assets to the equity allocated, is creeping up a little bit. And I just didn't know if the high teens
to 20% range is an okay resting range, if regulators have any commentary on that lately?
<A - James Dimon>: I think we've said the $40 billion anticipates the IB being at 8%. We're assuming some
mitigation here in the IB by the end of the year on a standalone basis. So remember; that balance sheet where that $250
billion or so is very, very short-term liquid stuff. So the adjusted assets are like $600 billion and the equity is $40
billion.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, that's cool. Last one is, Jamie, you made your points well in your shareholder letter on
why the 7% is enough and your thoughts around the SIFI buffer. But I guess my question is with Switzerland going at
10%-plus and now the UK coming out this week at 10%-plus, how much, if any, impact do those markets have, to your
understanding, with our regulators? And do our regulators take into account, say, risk-weighted assets to tangible assets
or total assets or bank assets to GDP, other metrics that might not make this an apples-to-apples comparison?
<A - James Dimon>: I think the baseline Basel stuff is attempting to be a global agreement to have a level playing
field for everybody. There are some flaws with that, which are also in my letter, because there are different laws now in
the United States regarding derivatives, Volcker, the uses of preferred dividends, et cetera. But I think it's an attempt by
regulators to have a global agreement.
Each country is going to set its own – they call it SIFI or global SIFI surcharge. So each country can do something in
addition to the 7%. But I personally don't think that because the UK or Switzerland does it that the United States should
feels like it has to do it. Each country is a slightly different thing. In Switzerland, their banks dwarf the size of their
economy. That's not true here. I also have a chart in my shareholder letter about that. So there are other reasons why
other countries might go to higher ratios.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Do you have any timing?
<A - James Dimon>: I think [ph] the authority (30:30) should do what's good for the United States, not what's good for
Europe.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Understood. Do you have any idea on timing, Jamie?
<A - James Dimon>: I believe we'll get more guidance maybe sometime late this summer.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, keep fighting the fight.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Thanks; two questions, one just a follow-up on the SIFI question. Does the size of the
SIFI charge change how you think about allocating capital or how you would think about doing M&A?
<A - James Dimon>: Honestly, if it's just a little bit more, no. If it's a lot more, probably; and we're going to have to
wait and see. I also think it's very important, if you think about it a little bit, the market is going to price things. Just

because a bank holds 10% doesn't mean the market is going to in effect use 10% to price something. So your
competitive market is going to be based upon something different. So it's hard to figure out exactly what that means.
My attitude would be we'd run the businesses at a 7% or 8% Basel III and hold the excess at Corporate.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Okay, and then a separate question just on mortgage. There's some discussion from the
FHFA on changing the servicing fees for the conventional Fannie/Freddie loans.
<A - James Dimon>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Can you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about how that would impact
your business model and what you would do differently if this fee change were to occur?
<A - James Dimon>: I actually think it's an intelligent thought about having different performing versus defaulted
loans. It's far more expensive to do a defaulted loan. So look, the devil is in the details. It's a good thought, a good
concept. And in general, it would eventually reduce the size of the MSR, which would be fine with us too.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: But you've been under-invested in mortgage relative to your peers. Would you be
looking to take more share if this were to go through?
<A - James Dimon>: It really depends how the whole mortgage business turns out. We've really got to wait and see
what the future liabilities are for future mortgage origination, et cetera, before you decide to do something like that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Okay, and then lastly on QRM and other risk retention proposals that came out a
couple weeks ago?
<A - James Dimon>: We think that the skin-in-the-game concept is a good idea. We think it would be fine with us. It
has a lot of consequences, but we'd be fine with that. And the QRM, either way can work as long as it's all properly
designed. So we really don't have an axe in this fight about how it's going to take place. But we just hope that however
it takes place, it's really well thought through, and we'd be happy to work with people to try to make sure that's done.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Okay. It does become more balance sheet intensive, though, right?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, but balance sheet intensive wouldn't bother us if they're good assets.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck CFA>: Right. Okay, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Hi. I'm trying to get a handle on what might be a normalized expense run rate relative
to the $6 billion base this quarter. So you pointed to the $650 million provision, Doug, for foreclosure issues, and I
think you said $350 million for litigation expense this quarter.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: John, that was only in Corporate.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Just in Corporate, okay. Were there litigation expenses elsewhere?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: We'll have them across all of the businesses.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay, but that's the only one you highlighted, correct?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: And then maybe just broader, Jamie or Doug, maybe you could give us some
thoughts about where expenses are cyclically elevated today throughout the company and might come down over time
as we start to think about what a normalized expense base is relative to what we see today.

<A - James Dimon>: We really do this by business. But you had a chart, Doug, that you showed me that showed...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: In fact, if you look at IB comp, back that out, and you look at the overhead, overhead is
largely, it has been consistent as a percentage of revenue. The nature of those expenses are different because we're
investing a lot in various business to grow them over time, and you're going to see some of that in the revenue items.
But if you back out all these one-time types of items and you separate out the IB comp, expenses are largely consistent
as a percentage of revenue for the last several quarters.
<A - James Dimon>: But it's a little elevated this quarter.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: A little elevated because it's largely IB comp.
<A - James Dimon>: But backing that out, those other expenses are up...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Modestly.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: But then from a broader perspective, I assume in RFS, you're carrying a lot more
people related to mortgage workouts and mods?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's going to stay at an elevated level for a period of time.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay. But that would be the main area if we're thinking about a few years out where
expenses might be cyclically elevated?
<A - James Dimon>: Eventually, overhead expenses from default and foreclosure REO will probably drop $300
million or $400 million a quarter.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: And that's not including the repurchased stock, which is another couple hundred million a
quarter.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And John, I think one of the charts, just to be helpful, if you go back to one of the
charts Charlie did at Investor Day, I think he tried to quantify over time what those expenses ought to come down by.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Right. All right, okay.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's a good place to look.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: And any thoughts for this year or more near term on the size of higher FDIC
expenses that you might see when that kicks in later this year?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, you're talking about a number for us that's now going to be north of $1 billion. And I think
last year, it was $800 million, so I think it may be $500 million more than it used to be.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: I object to how they went about that, and so there will be more conversations about how those
charges go through. The FDIC was supposed to be deposit insurance. And remember, we pay for the deposit insurance.
JPMorgan will have paid – it's a government program paid for by banks. So we'll have paid through this crisis about $5
billion in FDIC. But this is going to increase that for us.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And John, just as a technical matter, you won't actually be able to see, even though we
know there's an increase on the way, you won't actually see that in our numbers until the actual increase is
implemented, which is third quarter.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay, and then just one other separate question. What factors are driving your
outlook on card balance growth for a stabilization midyear and maybe a little growth in the back half?

<A - James Dimon>: Because we have two books of business that are running off, running down, WaMu and some of
this balance transfer stuff, and we actually had broken that out in an earlier presentation too. And those predominantly
will be completed by the third quarter. So there, we just know we're getting to stable balances.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay. And the card NIM, net interest margin, was up even as the balances shrank.
I'm just wondering how is that happening. Is that less suppression going on, are there some repricing benefits also in
there?
<A - James Dimon>: It's a lot of different things. But remember, there was some repricing, but it's also runoff of low
return balance transfers, so there are a lot of things in there.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: And remember also, John, in the NIM you get the reversals from declining charge-offs,
and so you're going to see that benefit. We're going to – that number is going to move around a bunch.
<Q - John E. McDonald CFA>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: It generally will head up a little bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I was just wondering. Doug, you had alluded to the fact that the trading profits
had been driven by the facilitated client activity. Was that activity uniform during the quarter? Was it lumpier? And if
you would, did it continue into April?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Fairly uniform.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. And just maybe a little more broadly, just as it relates to the mortgage business and all
of the related issues that you're going through with the servicing, can you relate that to the administration's plans for
Fannie and Freddie? And could there be – are they talking to one another in terms of those two sets of issues? And is
there some way that this could be – the banking industry could help out and perhaps get either assets or assets and
revenues out of this over some period of time?
<A - James Dimon>: I wrote about this a little bit in my Chairman's Letter. Look, the government laid out three
baseline ways to set up the GSEs and the mortgage markets. One of the points we've made is whichever one happens,
we all agree it should protect the taxpayer, that we want a healthy mortgage market, but it has be designed properly.
Any one of the three can actually work to do those things. And I think that's one of the reasons the Treasury laid it out
is so you can have a conversation and response and think through the effect in the markets, how quickly you can do it.
Obviously, there's a lot of politics around the GSE. So hopefully, we'll have a really good healthy mortgage market
when it's said and done. But a healthy mortgage market means it's got to be good for consumers and it's got to be good
for investors. Otherwise, you will not have a healthy mortgage market.

Moving on to the next question, your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Could you guys share with us? You had great success in your market share
numbers on the merger and advisory role in the Investment Bank in the U.S. I think it was over a 40% market share.
How did you guys get such a great market share?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Those market share numbers are going to move around. Large deals are going to move
it. We really do focus on longer-term trends. And we also focus on the revenue line because folks can be involved in

things and they're not making a lot of money, so I would focus really on the revenue line. Generally speaking, we had a
number one share in fees. That's because we've got a great client franchise across the Investment Banking platform.
<A - James Dimon>: In other words like most of the big transactions.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, we were in most of the big transactions this quarter, but that will move quarter
over quarter.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Does your strength on the balance sheet help with that M&A work as well?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: We look at our total relationship with clients. And the ability to actually provide them
financing is clearly one of the benefits that we bring to a client, and it works in significant transactions. The AT&T
transaction is a good example of that.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Sure.
<A - James Dimon>: And some of the smaller [ph] transactions (41:20), not having a balance sheet is helping them.
So I think it's both.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Can you share with us what you think the process is? If you wanted to raise your dividend
again later this year because your earnings are stronger than expected, do you have to go through the formal process
that you just went through, or is it less formal with the regulators to raise the dividend sooner than a year from now?
<A - James Dimon>: I wouldn't be looking for a dividend increase, if I were you, in the next couple of quarters. But
the regulators have made it clear that – which I think is a reasonable thing that you have quarterly stress tests and stuff
like that. We would have permission to do more on the dividend if we wanted to, a little bit more. But at one point, we
would obviously go ask them in this environment.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Sure. And then finally, recognizing your business has changed quite a bit in the last 10 years,
if we get to normalized net charge-offs, possibly 75 to 100 basis points, similar to what JPMorgan had in the late '90s,
do you think the loan loss reserves to total loans could come down to 200 basis points or less?
<A - James Dimon>: Sure, the answer is yes. But you also have all these new accounting laws and rules and stuff like
that. So we believe in strong reserves. We think it's a good thing to have an unquestioned balance sheet.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: Hi. In TSS, you have record assets under custody, but revenues versus the fourth quarter
were down a little bit. What's going on there? Are you cutting prices or what?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No, we have dividend season in WSS, and that's going to have a positive impact on the
second and the fourth quarters. It's nothing more than that.

<A - James Dimon>: It was a little bit less.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: And do you have the same figure for large corporate?
<A - James Dimon>: No, it's not a relevant figure for large corporate because large companies can access bonds,
loans, bilaterals. They go in and out for a whole bunch of different reasons, so we don't really actually track it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: Okay. And Capital Markets, what's the backlog like?
<A - James Dimon>: It's fine. It's good...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: It's fine, flat, up?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It was about 100 basis points less.
<A - James Dimon>: Again, the backlog itself is a very volatile number, and there are a lot of things that are being
worked on that are not on the backlog. So the flow of business looks good, and that's what it is. It looks like it's going
to be fine. Companies are pretty active financing and...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: On that topic, in terms of syndicated lending...
<A - James Dimon>: Last quarter, the middle market utilization was 34.1%, if this number is right.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: So 34.1% to 35%?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, about 100 basis points.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: But that's just for the $38 billion in middle market?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right. That's correct.
<A - James Dimon>: That is more relevant than some of other ones. The other ones bounce around a lot.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: And then lastly, on syndicated lending, you've been in the news. So how much in fees did
you get this quarter acting as an arranger? And how much did the syndicated loans contribute to the $9 billion of
growth in your wholesale loan balances?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: So we had in aggregate for our debt underwriting businesses, it was a record quarter,
and syndicated loans were a meaningful part of that. Our growth in loan balances, one of the comments I made is you
saw balances up quarter on quarter. That's...
<A - James Dimon>: That's not $9 billion.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: No, that was a $2 billion number.
<A - James Dimon>: Right, okay.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: I was looking at on the supplement, overall, wholesale loans of the company is...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's across TSS, Asset Management, the Commercial Bank, and the Investment
Bank. And that's quite frankly...
<A - James Dimon>: Trade loans are up a couple billion. Middle market is up a couple – $3 billion, so that's across the
whole spectrum of businesses.

be a lot.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, not a lot.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: So who buys a lot of this paper? The AT&T deal was clearly in the news, but you were
able to offload it pretty well. What's the demand for buying and who is buying it?
<A - James Dimon>: It's mostly other banks, but there are other buyers in there, certain funds and investors who also
buy them.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: And then in terms of the covenant-light deals, it seems like you're doing a lot more of
those. Do you feel good about the quality since you had more covenant-light deals in the first quarter than you did all
last year for the industry?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, I wouldn't say we're doing covenant-light deals uniquely. I think deals – covenants have
gotten lighter as lending has eased a little bit. But again, if you you're looking at the country, it's probably a pretty good
thing. I don't think it has gotten to the point where you would look at it as what it was like in the summer of '07.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo CFA>: Right.
<A - James Dimon>: And also, covenant-light is only one factor. You can have covenant-light and great credit. To me,
it's the credit, the deal, the leverage, not just the covenant.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Good morning, guys; a couple of things left. One, when I look at the Corporate segment,
and I know the guidance is to Corporate net income of plus or minus $300 million over time. One of the things that
really drove that higher was the spike in the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of a couple of years
ago. We're seeing that investment portfolio start going up again sequential quarter. Is that a function of just there's no
loan demand out there on the consumer side, so that's where you're putting capital? Or is there something else as far as
– I guess I was expecting the size of that portfolio to be declining, not increasing.
<A - James Dimon>: Right, but you've got to look at both sides of the balance sheet here because we have a lot of
deposits, which when we get the deposits, obviously, we invest it. So I would say it's largely related to both the deposits
and then our own, how we want to manage the interest rate exposure of the company. And remember, it's costing us
money how we're managing the interest rate exposures of the company. And some of that product that's in the CIO
portfolio, a lot of it, I forgot the exact number, a lot of is it what I call spread product. It's like zero duration but it's got
a spread in it to protect us from rising rates.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Okay. And you talked some about – I mean with middle – I guess what I'm going to try
and get at is the trend in commercial clients outlook or confidence. We see utilization rates up in middle market. The
Investment Banking backlog is still pretty good. Trading volumes are up. Have you noticed any change in how your
commercial clients are maybe looking at the world over the last six months with some of the volatility and events we've
seen?
<A - James Dimon>: I think if you look at corporate, mid-corporate, middle market, and even small business, they're
generally across the board stronger than they were. And that's, anecdotally, surveys. It's capital. It's cash. It's deposits.
It's lending conditions, financial conditions. So you're seeing confidence come back. Obviously, laying on top of that a
little bit is some of these things happening around the world, from Europe to Middle East and Japan. But it's not clear
that that's going to derail these companies going about their business, hiring people. And even small business demand,

small business loans were flat for our total company quarter over quarter. But this quarter is generally a very low
quarter, so it's a very good sign, in our opinion. We're starting to see real small business loan demand.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Yes, loan demand was up year over year in RFS over 50%.
<A - James Dimon>: And I assume we're going to see that with the competitors too, by the way. That's not just us.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Okay, because certainly things are stronger across the board than they were when we were

months, 12 months from now. In other words, those are going to start coming down at one point later in the year or
early 2012, not go up. That's a good sign, not a bad sign, even though they're still very elevated right now.
<Q - Jeffery Harte MBA>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: You mentioned some of the strength in trading or the bulk of the strength in trading
was client driven. And I guess specifically on the FICC revenues, they held up quite nicely year over year. I was
wondering if you could give a little bit more color from a product mix point of view. There's the Sempra deal in there,
and I think you have maybe a little more commodity...
<A - James Dimon>: Matt, before we do that, we're thinking about hiring Deutsche Bank to help us on our capital
structure here in the United States.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Matt, it was really – in fairness, it was across the board. Almost every asset class in
fixed income had very strong performance. And commodities was one of those asset classes that had very strong
performance. Part of that is we've made a number of investments in that business. That commodity revenue, like all of
the other businesses this quarter, was predominantly client flow.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: And can you just remind us from a mix point of view how much of FICC is commodity
driven?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: We're not going to – we don't give percentages because it's going to move, obviously,
based on quarter performance. It has had a very good first quarter. But it is an outside...
<A - James Dimon>: Emerging markets, credit, FX, rates, I thought I would add to it.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right. It's not outsized in any way, shape, or form relative to all those other
businesses.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: It's very consistent.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: And then I was debating. We hosted a dinner the other day, and there was some debate
on the FICC fee pool over the next several years. And some were debating that it would be a lot higher. Some were
debating that it would be a lot lower. And obviously, this is something that's virtually impossible to predict, but you do

have to have some view as you think about staffing levels. As you think about a continued macro recovery, higher
interest rates, maybe some leveling off of commodities, what does the FICC revenue pool look like a few years down
the road?
<A - James Dimon>: So if you just put aside for a second spreads, and put aside for a second how good you are at
trading, the underlying growth is going to be pretty good. If you look at global capital flow, global net worth, global
balance sheets, the growth of multinationals, the need for FX, the need for trade, the need for – the underlying numbers
are actually pretty good over a decade. You can, any one quarter, those could be dramatically different because of
spreads, how you're actually trading them. But I would say it's a pretty – the needs of investors are going to grow a lot
over the next 10 to 20 years, not a little.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: And that includes corporations, governments, supranationals, sovereign wealth funds. As a
matter of fact, if you go to my Chairman's Letter, I actually talk about some of these flows over the next 10 or 15 years.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, it's a follow-up to Glenn's question about
the average rate table on page six. The securities yield also went up quite a bit, from 2.44% to 2.89%. And I guess that's
a...
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: What page is that on?
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Page six of the supplement. And I guess that's a line item that doesn't fluctuate all that
much unless you're repositioning the securities book. I'm trying to get a better sense of maybe what's going on there.
And then obviously, we're all trying to figure out what the overall NIM might look like going forward as well.
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, so the portfolio we have, it's obviously moving around. It's also global. And I think I just
mentioned, we went to more of a spread product, and we invested more money, and we have a lot of mortgages. So
2.89%, you can go buy mortgages at far higher rates than that. We also put on some prime, about $2 billion of prime
jumbos coming out of the Private Bank at much higher rates there. So we can give you a better answer than that, but I
think it's just those things I just mentioned.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then any thoughts on just the overall NIM percent? I know you don't
manage that. You look business line by business line. But the NIM is relatively stable this quarter; any thoughts going
forward?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: I think you'd expect just from some mix a little pressure, modest pressure on NIM
overall next quarter.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.
<A - James Dimon>: Hi, Ron.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Thanks. Just following up on the NIM, you said there may be a little pressure in the second
quarter. And then you also said, Jamie, that it's expensive protecting against higher interest rates. So do you think the
NIM will keep going down, or will it stabilize now that market rates have stabilized? What's your thinking beyond just
the next three months?
<A - James Dimon>: I think Doug answered it. The underlying trend is down a little bit. But obviously, we could
make good decisions to change that very quickly. And if rates go up, our NIM can actually stand a little bit, which is
not, if you look at the implied curve, it's not going to happen right away. But if does happen, our NIM will actually go
up, not down.

<Q - Ron Mandle>: Right, okay. And then you also referred, Jamie, to the valuation reserve, loan loss reserve
eventually matching charge-offs. But right now, the reserve was up, let's say in round numbers, about 200 basis points
higher than the charge-off rate in the quarter. And with the new accounting proposals, will we really see that match, or
do you think that we'll have provisioning and reserving over the cycle that will be less volatile and have a bigger
difference than just the matches that you were referring to?
<A - James Dimon>: We don't know yet because these are all just proposals out there. And the proposals are different
for consumer, for defaulted, for wholesale. But I hope when it's said and done, we have a better matching and less
post-cyclicality. It will be more countercyclical; that would be my hope.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: Okay, we all share that opinion; and just one other question. In regard to Private Equity, you
noted in the outlook comments that it's likely to be volatile. But with the private equity shops looking for exits and
trying to monetize their investments and being pretty successful, it would seem like there's a possibility that you could
stay at that high level for well into this year and maybe longer. So I'm wondering if you have any elaboration on that
point?
<A - James Dimon>: Yes, I think Doug mentioned is it will be lumpy, but we like lumpy as long as it's 20% average.
And I think our folks, particularly in One Equity Partners, have done more than that over time. So yes, we hope. We're
optimistic, but we don't count on it.
<Q - Ron Mandle>: All right, okay. Thanks very much.
<A - James Dimon>: We tell them to just run your business and make your investments. And when you want to do
what's right for the investment, do it then. Don't worry about the timing for the company. But yes, we expect profits
from them over time.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning, thanks. An administrative question, and I'm sorry if I missed this if you
said it before. But what were the amounts of CVA/DVA included in the trading results this quarter?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Just in fixed income and equities, $20 million.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Almost nothing, I said it was non-material.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Right. And then in the Investment Bank, it looks as if non-accrual loans fell by about
24%. I'm curious as to whether or not that was driven entirely by sales. Or what else was going on there?
<A - James Dimon>: It was one big restructuring.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then finally in terms of the RFS portfolio; and, Doug, I think you talked about
this earlier in the call, core overhead ratio appeared to be in the low 60s. How much of that includes some of the
organic branch expansion Charlie talked about in the Analyst Day? Or is that largely just due to the mortgage costs that
you're bearing right now?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: In Retail itself, in that division, it's all about branch builds and the expenses associated
with that.
<A - James Dimon>: In Retail Banking.

<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: In Retail Banking, right? In aggregate for the division, the two significant items we
highlighted have a material impact on both the revenue and the expense line.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And in terms of the expenses, how much run rate is in there for the branch builds
specifically?
<A - James Dimon>: Dollar amount? I don't know the answer to that specifically.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - James Dimon>: But I think a lot of the head count add quarter over quarter is because of adding salespeople at
branches.
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: So that's not necessarily branch build-out per se, but it's more head count in the current
branches?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: We built 33 branches in the quarter. But over the year, we added almost 4,000 sales
force to the system, so we're adding salespeople both in our existing branches and the new branch builds. And I think
we're expecting to build out for the rest of the year 100 to 200 branches.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: So that build-out should accelerate over the course of the year relative to the Q1 run rate?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: That's right.

Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Yes, hey. Good morning, just a quick question on capital allocation in the card business. I
saw that you guys cut your capital allocated to that business by $2 billion. Is that mostly because of reduction,
particularly in the WaMu portfolio, or is there some other driver of that?
<A - James Dimon>: Mostly the reduction in the portfolio.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And if we think about the Retail, the RFS business, as that mortgage portfolio runs
off, should we also see some similar types of declines over time in the allocated capital to that business?
<A - Douglas L. Braunstein>: Over time, yes.
<A - James Dimon>: A little bit because we already gave them some credit for that in the number.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. All right, thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: Basically, the bottom – the baseline assumption should be to run these businesses at 7% Basel
III, and at IB a little bit higher. That's the bottom line assumption. Sometimes we give them a little benefit for
mitigation that we know is going to take place or something like that, but that's the bottom.

<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski MBA>: Actually that last comment was what I was wondering about. You've always
said that you didn't care so much about what reregulation was as long as it's an even playing field. And the SIFI buffer,
obviously, would be targeted at companies like you and Bank of America and so on. And I'm wondering about those
plain vanilla, middle-market, retailing banking, small business lending businesses. If at the corporate level, you're
forced to have 1% or 2% extra capital, can one still price effectively in those business? Or does it really...
<A - James Dimon>: I guess have you to, right? You're not going to price to lose. You're going to price to win the
business, and the market sets the price. And if the market is using 7% capital to set the price, then that's the capital
you're going to use to set the price, regardless of whether you're holding a little bit more or not. That was my whole
point.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski MBA>: Okay, all right. I'm done, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hey. I just wanted to follow up on the level playing field issue. One of the things, Jamie, that
you that pointed out in your shareholder letter was the less conservative calculation of RWA for some non-U.S. banks.
And I was wondering if you could drill into what you think are the most harmful aspects of that.
And then also maybe you could comment on what we were hearing yesterday about Deutsche Bank separating its
non-commercial banking businesses in the U.S. away from its bank?
<A - James Dimon>: I'm not going to comment on that because all I know is what I read in the paper this morning too.
The other one is, I guess you've got to look at regulation. We always believe in higher cap and higher liquidity. And the
regulators are talking about a level playing field. And they understand that the risk-weighted asset calculations aren't
done the same everywhere. So they say that they'll make sure that they incorporate that in their thinking.
That's not the only – you've got to look at all of it. If American banks can't have tax deductions for deferrals and
overseas banks can, that's one thing. If American banks have to demand margin from end users, which I'm not sure is
going to be the case, if [ph] a non financial end uses (1:03:30) derivatives, the business will go elsewhere. And so we
just want to make sure it's fair in total, including SIFI charges because if every country does that differently, that may
not be fair either.
So to me, I think the regulators and the government officials do say they want to have the level playing field. But why
was MSR deducted from capital? It's a perfectly good asset. Why would that be a deduct directly from capital but not
plant and equipment or some other assets or highly liquid loans? Why is the Ex-Im [Export-Import] Bank treated
differently than supranational banks are treated overseas? So when you dig into it, there are a lot of things in here that
just – they need to be clarified and cleaned up. I think people want to do that. And obviously, the banks have to run a
good business.
I would also point out, by the way, that when America was still in Basel I when the rest of the world was in Basel II, it
didn't he hurt us to be in Basel I. So you don't have to have exactly the same stuff either to be able to compete.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great, thank you for the color.
