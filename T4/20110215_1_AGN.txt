financial results for the quarter. Paul will conclude our presentation with our updated outlook for 2011. We'll then open
the call up for questions and answers.
Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Siggi Olafsson, Executive Vice President of our Global Generics

and the Form-10Q for the period ended September 30, 2010.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our focus on making Watson one of
the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the industry translated into a very strong year financially. I'll highlight
the fourth quarter and then give you a short overview of our overall 2010 accomplishments.
I am pleased to report that we concluded 2010 with strong results in the fourth quarter. Net revenue for the fourth
quarter increased 21%, to $953 million. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter increased 23%, to $117 million,
or $0.93 per share. And adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 17%, to $221 million. These results reflect
strong profitability with our adjusted Generic and Brand gross margins at about 50% and 80%, respectively. And we
accomplished these results while continuing to significantly increase investment in both our Generic and Brand R&D
over the fourth quarter of last year. Todd will provide you with more details shortly about that.
Turning to some of the highlights for the full year, in our Global Generics business, we filed 34 ANDAs in the U.S. and
over 145 applications around the world. In the U.S. we launched seven products and disclosed 17 new patent
challenges. We also announced an agreement to market generic Concerta in May, which will provide solid earnings and
cash flow foundation for 2011.
In our Global Brands business, we launched three new products in 2010 – a six-month formulation of Trelstar,
CRINONE, and ella. We received approval for a new oral contraceptive in December, which we plan to launch during
the second quarter of 2011. That product is a chewable 25-microgram ethinyl estradiol product with a unique 24/4
dosing regimen. Women using this product can expect to experience lighter, shorter periods. We announced the
initiation of our first biologic development candidate, recombinant FSH for infertility, which we licensed in from Itero
Pharmaceuticals. During the year, we completed the majority of the tech transfer to our Liverpool facility and have
established our clinical program, which will result in registrations for this product around the world.
Finally, working closely with our partner Columbia Labs, we announced the completion of the Phase III PREGNANT
study in December on Prochieve for the prevention of pre-term birth in women with a short cervix. The results were
statistically significant in reducing pre-term birth at multiple time points in the study. There was an improvement in
infant outcome, and the side effect rates were extremely low. Columbia plans to file an NDA in the second quarter.
Under an accelerated review, the product could be approved in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Our Anda Distribution business was also a significant contributor to our positive results and overall profitability, with a
28% increase in segment contribution for the year. Additionally, we made significant progress throughout the year as
we continued to strengthen our global supply chain. We initiated the closure of our Australian R&D facility and our
Toronto manufacturing facility, and we closed our Carmel, New York facility on schedule at the end of the year. More
recently, we announced plans to phase out and ultimately end generic R&D activities at our Corona facility. Activities
at that site will be reassigned to our other three global R&D sites.
I am very pleased with these efforts, which resulted in the overall improvement of our gross margins for 2010, and
those improvements should continue to provide benefits into 2011. Finally, we repaid over $450 million in long-term
debt for 2010 and generated over $570 million in cash from operations, giving us the flexibility to invest and grow in
our businesses – so, clearly, a very strong year.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Todd to take us through the financial results. Todd?
R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with our financial performance for 2010. We
received upgrades from all three rating agencies during the year, and our strong cash flow allowed us to prepay $150
million in short term debt obligations. We ended the year with over $290 million in cash and marketable securities, and
$500 million of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. We are well positioned to invest in additional growth
opportunities across all of our business units.
I will now review our fourth quarter financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. Consolidated net
revenues were $953 million, an increase of 21% over the prior-year period. Net revenues for our Global Generics
division were $646 million, up 38%. Generic product sales were $608 million, up 32%, reflecting the acquisition of our
international business in December of last year and higher sales of our extended-release products, including Metoprolol
ER and Diltiazem LA. Sales of extended-release products increased 53%, to $191.1 million. Oral contraceptives sales
increased 3% year-over-year, to $97.9 million.
Ex-U.S. net revenues were $148.6 million, which includes $25 million of other revenue earned in connection with a
third party development agreement. Excluding this item, international net revenues were up 24% sequentially as a
result of new product launches in the current quarter and lower third-quarter results due to seasonal factors. Adjusted
gross margin for the Generic division was 50.6%, up 3.9 percentage points over last year on increased sales of
extended-release products at favorable margins.
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $103.3 million, down 15% from the prior-year period. The decrease
reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by increased sales of RAPAFLO, GELNIQUE, Androderm, and
the addition of CRINONE. We ceased marketing Ferrlecit at the end of 2009. Brand adjusted gross margin was 80.3%,
down from 81.5% in the prior year.
Finally, net revenues from our Distribution segment was $203.4 million, up 3% from the prior-year period. Distribution
segment adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 13.7%, down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses, consolidated R&D for the fourth quarter was $99 million, up 63% over the
prior-year period as a result of increased development spending for both our Brand and Generic businesses. Brand
R&D increased $28.2 million from the prior year. This reflects a $17 million licensing payment for Esmya and a
fair-value adjustment for certain contingent liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the progesterone
gel business from Columbia Labs. Generic R&D increased $10.2 million as a result of higher international
development spending. For the full year 2011, we expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of
$290 million to $310 million.
SG&A for the fourth quarter was $205.9 million, an increase of $68.7 million over the prior-year period. The increase
reflects a $40 million charge related to our drug pricing litigation and SG&A expenses for our acquired international

business. For 2011, we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $650 million to $675
million.
Amortization for the fourth quarter was $52 million, up from $26.5 million last year, reflecting higher amortization
from our international business. For 2011 we expect amortization expense to be approximately $270 million. The
increase in amortization expense is primarily due to projected new product launches, including Atorvastatin in the
fourth quarter of 2011.
Our fourth quarter GAAP results include an impairment charge for certain in-process R&D acquired in connection with
the Arrow acquisition. This non-cash impairment charge for the fourth quarter was $28.6 million.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 47%. On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 36%. For
2011, we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 43%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our 2011
effective tax rate to be approximately 36%.
On a non-GAAP basis, earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.93 per share, up 9% from $0.85 per share in the
prior-year quarter. Our non-GAAP results exclude $52 million in amortization expense, a $40 million litigation charge,
$31 million in asset impairments, and $25 million in acquisition, licensing, and global supply chain expenses. A full
reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.15 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $220.8 million,
up 17% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $248 million.
During the quarter, we repaid a $250-million term loan that was due in late 2011 and our $35-million Lombard loan.
We ended the quarter with slightly over $1 billion of debt and $294 million in cash and marketable securities. Our debt
to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, and our debt to capital ratio improved to 24% from 33% at the end of 2009.
I am very pleased with Watson's financial performance in 2010. With our strong balance sheet, ample cash, and
undrawn revolver capacity, we are well positioned to invest in support of future growth. With that, I'll turn the call back
over to Paul for an update on our 2011 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Todd. Now I'd like to provide an update on the 2011 forecast. As we set out at our Analyst Day in January, our
estimate for full-year net revenue is approximately $4.2 billion. We expect our Global Generic segment revenue,
including our international revenues, to be between $2.8 billion and $3 billion.
Turning to the assumptions for the U.S. Generics business, we're assuming we will see additional competition on our
generic Toprol, generic Micro-K, and our generic oral contraceptive franchises in 2011. The impact of this additional
competition was modeled in throughout the year. Our U.S. Generics forecast includes contributions from new launches
of generic Lipitor, generic Concerta, and a small contribution from Paragraph IV patent challenges.
On the Brand side of the business, we expect net revenues to be between $470 million and $490 million for the year,
reflecting continued growth of RAPAFLO, GELNIQUE, Androderm, and ella, as well as the launch of our novel oral
contraceptive, but only a nominal amount of Prochieve sales late in the year.
In the Anda Distribution business, we anticipate revenue between $820 million and $840 million. Recall that reported
Anda revenues only include third-party sales, not Anda sales of Watson product. This year, sales of two of the largest
generic product launches, Concerta and Lipitor, will not be reported by Anda because they are Watson products.
We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $925 million and $1 billion, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.85 to
$4.15. We expect our non-GAAP EPS in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half, with the fourth
quarter being the strongest.
In summary, Watson is beginning 2011 with extraordinary momentum to grow across all of our businesses. We look
forward to executing on our plans and utilizing our strong balance sheet to fund investments for additional growth in all

Lastly, I would like to personally thank all of our Watson employees around the globe for their continued dedication
and tremendous efforts in 2010. It was a great year, and we look forward to continued success in 2011.
With that, let me turn the call back to Patty for question-and-answers.
Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate
Communications
Great. Thanks, Paul. And Cassandra, if you don't mind opening up the lines for Q&A, we'll get started.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Hey. First, Paul, on Lipitor, do you have any theories on why there are no tentative approvals
yet? And how much flexibility do you and your partner have to expand production significantly beyond current levels if
that is warranted? And then I have a follow-up on Prochieve.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well, on Lipitor, I really don't have any
explanation as to why there's no tentatives. Sometimes the agency doesn't grant tentatives. They just wait until the end
and grant final approvals. I'm not sure I would read all that much into that information. With respect to our ability to
launch and be able to supply, we believe we'll have plenty of capacity and plenty of product to be able to supply the
entire market, if need be, in November of 2011.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: What if the pie expands significantly due to therapeutic substitution that we would expect?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we'll be ready for that, as well.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We hope so. But we'll be ready.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Sure. And then on the Prochieve front, I know the products and markets are slightly different,
but do you have any comments on KV's actions of late – pricing strategy, et cetera – relative to your thinking on
Prochieve? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Gregg, I'm going to turn that over to Fred. He's
probably best able to answer that one.
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Good morning, Gregg. Yeah, we've obviously watched the KV approval, KV
announcements, and many of the discussions that have gone on following the MFM meeting, which was this last week.
They're in a slightly different marketplace. They're going out for women that have previous pre-term. We're in the
market for women with short cervix. I think all it does is really help aim our market research, which is ongoing, really
helps aim some of the pricing strategies that we're out testing right now, and helps us set up the marketplace so that we
can effectively market this once we're approved.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yeah.

The next question comes from the line of David Amsellem from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David Amsellem>: Hi. Thanks. Just a couple. On the R&D, can you talk about the split between brand and
generic R&D in 2011, and maybe give us a little more color on which R&D segment we should be thinking about as
growing more?
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. On a pro forma basis, we had R&D
spending at roughly $250 million in 2010. We're expecting a roughly 9% increase. And out of that 9% increase into
2011, about two-thirds of that increase is going to come on the brand side, and one-third will come on the generic side.
<Q - David Amsellem>: Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick Concerta question, wanted to come back to your
guidance, really, in 2013 about additional entrants. And wondering if you can talk about it, is that a function of just
conservatism on your part, or do you have any insights into what might change at the FDA between now and 2013 that
would result in greater entrants? And I guess the question is, how is the agency's thinking going to change regarding
approvals?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's a tough question. I think the agency is
still considering what to do with this question around partial AUC and what the blood levels need to look like in the
first eight-hour period. I'm not certain that they've concluded yet on what they want to do. It may take them some time
to do that. Right now, they probably are not looking very hard at Concerta applications because there's only – that, as
far as we know, there's only one other filer, and that filer's pretty early in the process. It's hard to predict how long it's
going to take them to get to the end on this. I think our view on timing of a new entrant is related more toward the
backlog at the FDA and the timing that it takes to get a product through the process, as well as any additional litigation
that could come up from that. And – well, that's, I guess, the point.
<Q - David Amsellem>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications>: Thanks, David.

Your next question comes from the line of David Maris from Credit Agricole.
<Q - David Maris>: Thank you. My question's been answered.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rich Silver from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Yeah, Paul, a macro question. It seems like settlement ban is back on the table in two forms,
both in terms of the legislation – legislative branch as well the budget. Do you care to comment on your latest thinking
on likelihood that we actually see something this year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, David, we're – or, David – I'm sorry, Rich. I am
very disappointed to see that in the president's budget. I think the CBO score for this is unbelievable, frankly. And what
troubles me sort of generally is that, if we know this issue as well as we do, and we understand the CBO score is that
badly wrong, how bad are all the rest of the scores in the president's budget? Because if this is the way we're building
budgets in the U.S., this is a serious problem. I think, as a trade association, we'll continue to fight this issue. Watson,
of course, is committed to fighting this issue. We think it's wrong. We think it hurts consumers. It certainly hurts the
industry, and it doesn't – it simply doesn't make sense.

So, on the legislative front, I think we feel pretty comfortable. On the budget front, we'll go fight that fight. I guess the
other issue, and maybe to put it out there, is that we've heard some rumblings about the FTC trying to get – what they
can't get legislatively and what they can't get judicially – through a regulatory process, where they change the
regulations. You know, it's amazing to me the activism being displayed here by the Federal Trade Commission, and I
think we'll continue to fight that and try to shine the light of day on this thing.
<Q - Richard Silver>: I guess that – well, I can ask it another way, maybe. Given that, at least on the legislative side,
it's died a few times, do you think that the latest developments give you any reason to be less optimistic than before?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think that the most surprising thing to me was
to see it in the president's budget as sort of a positive-pay-for. On the legislative side, I think we're in a good position to
continue to fight it. As we describe the situation to legislators, they get it, and they understand that it's just not the right
thing to do. So we haven't gotten to the White House yet, so we've got to fix that.
<Q - Richard Silver>: And one other question, product-specific on Mucinex. You don't have an approval yet. What's
your thinking in terms of the timeframe and whether this is one that could take a while before the FDA actually
approves it, and then likelihood that you would actually launch at risk?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, we did win the district court
decision, which is a very positive step. And we're going to push the agency for approval on our products. I guess
probably the most I can say at the moment is we're evaluating all of our options, and we'll kind of address each one of
those things as they come up. And hopefully, we can get the agency to get the approval quickly, and we can then have
additional options to consider. But we're very pleased with where this Mucinex sits right now and with the decision that
we have.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Risinger>: Thanks very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Risinger>: Hello. So I have a couple questions. Let me just sort of go one by one here. The first is just sort
of stating what I see as the fact that CRINONE appears to be inappropriately priced to be the benchmark for pre-term
birth. I guess, just at a simplistic level, is there an opportunity to re-base that pricing?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah, this is Fred Wilkinson. Obviously, we are looking at pricing. We're looking –
this is not an atypical situation for pharmaceutical products to face when they are participating in two unique
marketplaces. So we'll be looking at the opportunity to continue to participate in both, while taking advantage of the
new opportunity in pre-term birth. We have a very large market research and pricing study that is fielded right now, so
it really would be premature for me to go out and describe what our plans are, but we're watching very intently the
impact that KV will have on the pricing in this arena.
<Q - David Risinger>: Okay. Thanks, Fred. And then, Paul, maybe you can just comment on a couple of things that
you factored into your guidance. And my questions are, when does the guidance assume that KV launches – or
re-launches Metoprolol in the first half? And then, second, what has been the price impact that you've seen of KV's
launch – or re-launch, sorry, of generic potassium?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me address the Metoprolol question, and
then I'll turn it over to Siggi to handle the potassium question. On Metoprolol, currently, our guidance doesn't anticipate
KV coming back with that particular product. We know there are other people who may be coming back in the market,
like Sandoz and perhaps even another company, coming with Metoprolol. So what we tried to do with guidance this

easier for us to sort of maintain our guidance and track it a bit easier. So that's what we did for Metoprolol. And then,
Siggi, I'll have you handle the potassium question.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, David. It's Siggi here. On the potassium, we have seen that already that KV has
launched both the brand and the generic version of potassium, and we basically built that into our budget as it is. It's per
our budget, which we explained at the Analyst Day. So I think exactly what we are seeing in the marketplace today is
what we built in over the year, so no surprises.
<Q - David Risinger>: Oh. Thanks very much. And yeah, I had misspoken, so I meant Sandoz on Metoprolol, so just
to confirm, Paul, so you're assuming Sandoz and one other competitor coming in on Metoprolol this year, but not at an
exact point in time. Simply, you're factoring in declines in the franchise to reflect that anticipated new competition.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, I think – it's Siggi here. I think you're absolutely right, David. We expect an
increased competition on Metoprolol over the year. We have it declined over the year from first quarter to fourth
quarter, and there will be increased competition. Who that will be – will it be Sandoz or somebody else or some other
names – we don't know exactly. We don't know the exact timing, but the overall decline from first quarter to fourth
quarter, we have built in.
<Q - David Risinger>: Okay. Thanks, Siggi.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Co.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Thanks, guys. Just a quick question on Prochieve, as well. Just, Fred, maybe you could give us
a sense of just the total progesterone used currently right now with either the 17P injections, which I know Makena just
got approved, but also suppositories and CRINONE itself in pre-term birth. KV threw out a number around 150,000. I
know you're looking at it from purely cervical length, but can you give us a sense of how many patients per year you
think are receiving some form of progesterone, including all of the risk factors for pre-term birth, just so we can help
size this market?
And I know we're putting the cart before the horse on pricing, but I would assume you believe that the Makena
regulatory process clears the way very easily or a low hurdle now for your Prochieve. And then maybe if Paul could
comment on Sanctura, any expectations we should have in the next upcoming month on that product. Thank you.
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah, thank you. So the use of progesterone today, that probably perplexes you guys
as much as it does us because it's very difficult data to get to. On the use of CRINONE today, [inaudible] very little
based on the IMS audits. So there doesn't appear that there's a lot of CRINONE that is right now being prescribed for
the indication of pre-term birth.
As you know, the 17P product right now is a pharmacy compound – it's available through pharmacy compounding –
and none of the IMS data or any of the other services are really capable of gathering that data, so it's really only
people's guesses at this particular point. So, again, very difficult to recognize.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: And then, Fred, do you care to give a guess, or just not even try?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: I'm actually not going to.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Okay.
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: I think KV's done a nice job of setting out what their patient population is, which they
think is about 140,000 patients, as you saw in their press release. Remember, that's women who have a previous
pre-term, so that ignores all the women who have already – who have never had a baby before, so all the first-timers.
Our indication is going to be for all women with a short cervix, so that will include those that are on their first, second,

third, fourth, fifth baby, where a short cervix is recognized.
And we've kind of laid out some numbers during our investor call as to what fits in the pure definition of 1-2, 2-2.5,
and 2.5-3. And again, we're fielding research to see what kind of utilization might happen at the different lengths, so
we'll still have a lot more information to come. I think we're going to build the model out a little bit more as we get a
little closer.
To your last question as far as approvability, obviously, we were encouraged by the approval of the KV product. I think
it does give us a little more confidence on the approval process. But we've got our head down, and just judiciously
working with Columbia to make sure that the file goes in on time in second quarter.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Ken, I think you asked about Sanctura. I'm going
to have David give you a quick update on where we are from the legal perspective, but just remember, we do have
approval, and that's a very good position for us to be in. So, David, why don't you take it?
<A - David A. Buchen>: Hi, Ken. So we do have final approval from the FDA. As you know, we wrapped up the trial
last May, and we finished our post-trial briefing last June. We are waiting for a decision from the court. Last week, the
court asked us to send a letter in by the end of the day today, providing an opinion on what the impact would be if the
court decided to rule on the Orange Book patent but not yet rule on the non-Orange Book patent. The three patents
were all part of the same trial. So we're planning to send that letter in today, and we'll wait for the court's decision to
see whether we get a decision on at least the Orange Book patent, and what the impact of that may be. Right now,
there's an injunction in place, and our decision on the next step is going to depend in large measure on how the court
rules on this set of patents.

Your next question comes from the line of Corey Davis from Jefferies.
<A - Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications>: Good morning,
Corey. Are you with us?
<Q - Corey Davis>: Can you hear me?
<A - Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Corey Davis>: Okay. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on Sanctura, what you just answered. Assuming that the
decision goes in your favor – and I know you have FDA approval – is there anything else that might hinder an
immediate launch, things like manufacturing, supply? The other thing I'm thinking about is the REMS program with
the FDA. What do you have in place right now, because I think all of these immediate release products are undergoing
kind of a consolidated REMS overhaul that's not yet in place. Is that correct?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think on the REMS front, we're fine. We will
be certainly in a position to be able to take advantage of a positive result, so we don't see any particular issue standing
in the way from a manufacturing or regulatory standpoint. As part of the overall approval, the REMS program was
approved as part of that, so that's all been resolved. And I think we said in the past, we're very comfortable dealing with
REMS programs. We've dealt with them in the past, and we'll certainly deal with them a lot going forward, so we're
capable of that. I don't know if, David – legally, if there's any additional hurdles we have to address.
<A - David A. Buchen>: No. I think, based on the court's letter, we have to assess whether the court's going to rule on
all three patents, or just on the first two Orange Book patents. It probably comes as no surprise that we think that, if we
prevail on the Orange Book patents, we don't think the injunction should remain in place. That would be the only
additional hurdle, from a legal standpoint, that we'd have to clear before we could launch, would be getting that
injunction removed.

<Q - Corey Davis>: Can you elaborate a little bit more on why she asked the question on what would happen if she
only ruled on those two, as opposed to the third? What could she be getting at?
<A - David A. Buchen>: You know, I really can't elaborate on that. We evaluated it. I think the court is maybe taking
these two groups of patents serially, and understands that our 30-month stay has already run and that we have final
approval, and asked both sides to comment on what the impact would be if she only rules on the first two Orange Book
patents.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang from CRT Capital.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hi. Thanks. Given that you've got about two-and-a-half months before you launch Concerta, can
you talk a little bit more about what your expectations for launch quantities will be, also anything you can provide in
terms of market share, dynamics, pricing, that you expect you'll encounter, Paul?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I'm going to pass this one over to Siggi and let
him handle the market dynamics question [inaudible].
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Okay. On Concerta, we expect to launch in May. With regards to market share, there
will be a two-player market. It will be us and Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson have just raised the price – I
think you know that -just recently by double digits. I think the pricing in the market, clearly, there will be a price
erosion in the market when there's an introduction of an AB, and we have to see how that comes out. But overall, our
expectation is that we come and this will be a two-player market. And as Paul has said previously, we expect it to be a
two-player market for some time.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: And, Siggi, just one follow up to that, how much market share do you expect to get right at the
onset of the launch? Is there a ballpark range you have targeted?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: No, it's difficult to understand that until you see the market. Obviously, the mail order
pharmacies are on PBMs. We need to see how they react. Overall, I think we would be ready to take a very significant
market share in the market. We will have a supply to supply the whole market, if needed, but overall we have to see by
May the 1st how things will plan out.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay. Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Paul, I think we mentioned before that, after
2012, Risperdal will play a slightly bigger role in your thinking about the generic industry. Can you elaborate a little bit
like that about this issue? Where do you see Watson potentially playing in that market? And anything you could tell us
about what you see as the evolving climate of clinical trials for generics on the respiratory market.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, on the respiratory front, I do expect Watson to
be a player in the respiratory arena, along with others. And with regard to the clinical outputs or impact of that, we'll
certainly continue to evaluate what has to be done. I think the harder questions are around things like plume geometry
and all that kind of stuff that you have to deal with here, as well as the number of patents, protecting not only the
product, but also the device and then the use of that device and then the number of times per day. So it's a challenging
arena which, by the way, makes it such an attractive arena.

<Q - Ronny Gal>: Right.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Because if you can overcome the challenges, then
you probably have a long life cycle with those kinds of products. In addition, as well, they've done obviously quite
well, but we do expect Watson to be a player in that arena, and we certainly will be, as you know, launching the
Xopenex product in 2012. And we, of course, have the [inaudible] product that you know about, as well, that we hope
to be launching as soon as we can get through the legal morass on that one. Siggi, did you want to add anything?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, I think overall we have like a three-fold approach to the respiratory arena. Paul
mentioned Xopenex. That came as part of the Arrow acquisition. But also out of that, Arrow had the company called
Breath in the U.K.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Right.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Which focuses on respiratory development. On top of that, we are doing quite a
significant co-development project in this arena because, as you said yourself, 2012 and onward, the $1 billion growth
are focused in this arena. So we have a multiple approach, both in MDAs and other parts of this business which we
think that, in '13 and '14, will pay out. But again, highlight what Paul said, there is a significant investment in the
clinical studies to be able to get these product AB rated at the agencies.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. And one more question about the – you kind of mentioned up front about the issue about
OUS seasonality in pricing. Can you just give us a feel for, if we kind of go through a typical year, roughly what
percentage of revenue should be expected in each quarter based on seasonality of pricing in your OUS business?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Ronny, I'm not sure I know that issue. I don't think
we see seasonality, necessarily. To the extent we see seasonality in the ex-U.S. business.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: In the generic business.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Generally, the third quarter is the lightest quarter of
the year, and that's principally due to the holiday seasons throughout Europe, frankly. So I think, as we look at the
quarter-over-quarter international contribution, generally the fourth quarter is stronger. Second quarter is generally
strong, and you have – maybe the lightest quarter would be the third quarter, followed by the first, so – to the extent
there is a seasonality to it. As far as pricing changes, those market dynamics are a country-by-country issue, and right
now, we're seeing a bit of stability across many of the countries, although things change pretty rapidly when
governments try to balance budgets.
So we're trying to stay flexible and drive – for us, as we said at our Analyst Day, the most important factor for us in our
international franchises is making sure we have the right cost of goods. And if we maintain the right cost of goods, we
can be competitive in any pricing environment that we face. So that's what we're focused on doing, and we think that
will make us very successful.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Michael Faerm>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Can you comment on some of the drivers of the strength in the international revenues this
quarter versus the prior quarters, apart from seasonality? And also, what are your expectations for next year in terms of
international growth and any comments you can give on volume and pricing growth in particular?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. Hi, Michael. It's Siggi here. On the international market, I think fourth quarter
always benefits from the launches throughout the year. Overall, we have quite a few launches in our international
markets, where in fourth quarter you get the full benefit of that and you have a whole sale in that quarter. So, overall, I
think that played a significant part of the business. Also, I think we have the volume increase, both in Canada and our
French market, as we explained in the Analyst Day. So, overall, you see us, as Paul mentioned, before fourth quarter is
a little bit better than especially third quarter; second quarter comes as the second best quarter.
With regard to this year, after Analyst Day we gave the indication that we expect close to a 10% price erosion in this
market. This is on the high side and is probably a little bit higher than some of our competitors have said, but I think it's
also based a little bit on our portfolio. We are introducing a lot of new products in these markets. We have a multiple
new introduction in our key markets internationally throughout the year, so we – on that portfolio, always when there's
a new introduction into the international markets, especially in Europe, the price erosion is very quick, to begin with,
and then it slows down the further it goes.
So, overall, I think the growth for the international business is around – we expect a slow growth this year because we
don't get the benefit of the Watson portfolio, and already in 2012, the Watson portfolio products that we've added last
year will start to benefit the international markets, and that will see a faster growth going forward.

<A - Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications>: Jim, we can

<Q - James Dawson>: Okay, great. Could you get into a little more detail just on the percent of generic Micro-K and
Metoprolol XL in the fourth quarter and in the full year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The percent of revenue?
<Q - James Dawson>: Yeah, sales from those two products.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Jim, we don't break out by product our sales.
That gets us down a slippery slope, so we generally just pass on that. I would say that the Metoprolol was a significant
– both, but the Metoprolol was certainly a significant contributor, and so was Micro-K, as well. KV did not launch their
generic until the beginning of this year, so potassium was certainly a significant contributor in the fourth quarter.
<Q - James Dawson>: Okay. Thanks. And then on Makena and for that market, particularly with the high price that
they were talking about yesterday, what does that mean for your opportunity? Does that change your opportunity?
Could you just give a little more detail on that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think as we've already described, we've
watched the Makena pricing as it's been announced. We do have a significant pricing study that's fielded and in the
marketplace right now. This will be a new factor that we'll put into that study and help us guide what our pricing

our approach into that arena. As you know, we do have an OTC business here at Watson. We sell it under the Rugby
label. And we do have the experience with the gum, as you mentioned. So we do have a way to get into that market, but
we're evaluating all options that are at our disposal. And hopefully, we have some clever ways of getting this product to
