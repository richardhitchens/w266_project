MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Accenture's Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, we are recording today's conference.
And with that, I'd like to turn the conference over to Managing Director of Investor Relations, [ph] K.C. McClure.
K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, Doug, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2011 earnings announcement.
As Doug just mentioned, I'm K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an
opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.
Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you
through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational
metrics for the second quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning and progress against
our growth strategy. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2011, and then
we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or
net revenues.
Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, and you should keep in mind that these
forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not

limited to general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the Risk
Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliation of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, K.C., and thanks, everyone, for joining us. It's a pleasure for me to be with you today on my first earnings
call as Chief Executive Officer. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong second quarter, continuing the good
momentum of the past few quarters.
Let me share a few highlights. We're generating outstanding new bookings of $7 billion, our highest in 10 quarters,
including our second-highest consulting bookings ever. Revenues were $6 billion, exceeding the upper end of our
guiding range. We had very strong growth in both U.S. dollars and local currency across our operating groups and
geographic regions.
We delivered very strong earnings per share of $0.75, an increase of $0.15 or 25% over Q2 last year. Operating income
was $772 million, an increase of 19% over last year, and operating margin was 12.7%. And we continue to have a very
strong balance sheet with a cash balance of $4.7 billion. In addition, we just announced a semiannual cash dividend of
$0.45 per share, bringing the total dividend payments for the year to $0.90 per share.
Our very strong results in the second quarter, on top of our strong results in Q1, position us very well for the remainder
of the fiscal year and give us confidence to raise our revenue and EPS outlook for the full fiscal year.
Now I will turn the call over to Pam, who will provide some more detail on the numbers.
Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. I am pleased to tell you more about Accenture's fiscal
year 2011 second quarter financial results.
We delivered strong bookings, revenue growth, and EPS in Q2, and saw growing momentum in the business while
gaining market share. Year over year, local currency revenue grew double digits in both consulting and outsourcing,
and our strong performance established in the first half of the year positions us well to deliver double-digit top-line
growth and outstanding bottom-line growth for the full fiscal year.
Now let's get to the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are U.S. GAAP, except the items that are not part of
the financial statements or that are calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $6.98 billion and reflect a negative
1% foreign exchange impact compared with new bookings in the second quarter last year.
Consulting bookings were $3.8 billion, and outsourcing bookings were $3.18 billion. This level of bookings was the
highest in 10 quarters. On bookings, the management consulting clients are engaging you us to help them identify and
create critical value in their businesses, driven by their needs to take out cost, to drive more top-line growth, or to
change to meet new compliance requirements. We continue to see healthy demand for our offerings in finance and
performance management, supply chain optimization, customer service effectiveness, and sales and marketing
transformation.
Technology consulting bookings grew again this quarter. Our strength in this part of our business reflects our unique
position in the technology ecosystem. Clients value our independence and skills in design and integration. There is

significant activity in application modernization across our client base. We are helping our clients to rationalize the
operations of their infrastructures through virtualization, and large companies are also engaging us to help them with
their cloud computing initiatives.
Systems integration bookings were strong again this quarter and the highest in 10 quarters. The primarily driver is ERP,
as clients are streamlining their operations and reducing their costs due to globalization, M&A, and regulation. This
work reflects implementations on SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft platforms, as well as package enhancements and add-on
industry-specific software, including analytics, that need to be integrated. Additionally, we see demand for web-based
applications and portals, including delivery on mobile platforms, in order for clients to interact with their customers or
to promote e-commerce.
Turning to outsourcing. Bookings were solid, with good demand across our breadth of offerings. In technology
outsourcing, cost optimization remains paramount, and we continue to benefit from the vendor consolidation that has
occurred over the last couple of years. We are being asked to expand in many clients where we have already have an
established footprint for more volume, more scope, expansions to new geographies, as well as new work. Finally, BPO
bookings were up significantly and reflected continued demand for our horizontal offerings, especially finance and
accounting, and for our industry-specific solutions, particularly health and insurance.
Now turning to revenue. Net revenues for the second quarter were $6.05 billion, an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars and
18% in local currency from the same period last year. These revenues reflect a foreign exchange impact of negative 1%
compared with Q2 last year. These revenues were above our guided range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, a range that
had assumed a foreign exchange impact of negative 2%. So adjusting for actual exchange rates, our revenues came in
about $200 million higher than the top end of the range we provided in December. Consulting revenues were $3.51
billion, an increase of 20% in both U.S. dollars and local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $2.54 billion, an
increase of 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency.
There was strong, double-digit revenue growth across the dimensions of our business. Before I get into the operating
groups, let me note the record high revenues in the Americas, driven primarily by the United States, with Brazil and
Canada also posting exceptionally strong year-on-year growth.
Now turning to our operating groups.
Resources revenues grew 25% in local currency this quarter and reflected exceptional growth in consulting. Consulting
growth was driven by demand for ERP programs, global operating model design and rollout, supply chain
optimization, and smart grid projects. Similar to last quarter, outsourcing revenues are primarily for cost take-out in IT
and financial business processes.
In Financial Services, revenues grew 20% in local currency and were well balanced across all industry groups and
reflected renewed strength in outsourcing. Our services to help clients achieve compliance with risk and regulatory
changes drove momentum this quarter. Demand for our services also continued in the areas of business transformation,
post-merger integration, and investment in core systems for banking, insurance, and trading.
Communications & High Tech revenues increased 16% in local currency and reflected strong growth in both consulting
and outsourcing around the world. Consulting demand continues to be driven by cost takeout, customer acquisition and
retention, web development, as well as deploying new technologies to support growing wireless services demand.
Outsourcing revenues in C&HT experienced very strong growth as well in Q2, as clients continued to be focused on
cost takeout and improving operation efficiency.
The Products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 15% that was driven by very strong growth in
consulting and was well balanced across the Products industries. Management consulting and ERP continue to be major
themes. More clients are beginning bigger ERP transformation programs, particularly in North America. Our Products
operating group is also doing some of our most pioneering and innovative work.
Health & Public Service revenues increased 14%. Starting with health, we experienced very strong growth, reflecting
demand for cost reduction services and for our offerings in back office transformation, health administration, and

electronic medical records. In U.S. federal, we are seeing increased volumes on existing transaction-based outsourcing
contracts, as well as increased demand for ERP services. Our progress to reposition our business in the public sector
continues, particularly in EMEA. The second quarter revenue growth in Health & Public Service was positively
impacted significantly by the compare to Q2 last year, when we had inefficient delivery on a contract.
In summary, we continue to see revenue results that are evidence of healthy and balanced demand globally for our
offerings across the industries we serve.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 31.7%, down from 32.7% in Q2 last year, a 100 basis point
decrease. Our contract profitability was lower than the same period last year, particularly in consulting, as we continue
our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more
efficient resource mix. Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition
of a larger number of new employees to meet demand.
Sales and marketing costs were $710 million or 11.7% of net revenues, compared with $623 million or 12% of net
revenues for the second quarter last year. General and administrative costs were $435 million or 7.2% of net revenues,
compared with $413 million or 8% of net revenues for the second quarter last year. We continue to focus on driving
efficiencies in our cost base as we grow our business.
Operating income for the quarter increased 19% to $772 million, resulting in a 12.7% operating margin. This compares
with a 12.6% operating margin in Q2 last year. The operating margin in Products was negatively impacted by lower
contract profitability compared to the prior year, as we have not yet fully recovered higher cost increases through
pricing for our services and products. Products operating results were also impacted by expected lower margins on
certain contracts.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%, compared with 28% in the second quarter last year. The lower rate this
year was due to a number of factors that impacted geographic distribution of income.
Net income was $566 million for the second quarter, compared with $462 million for the same quarter last year, an
increase of 22%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.75, an increase of $0.15 or 25% compared with $0.60 in the
second quarter last year. This difference reflects an $0.11 increase from higher revenue and operating results in local
currency, a $0.03 increase from a lower share count, a $0.01 increase from a lower effective income tax rate, a $0.01
increase from higher non-operating income, offset by a $0.01 decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
Now let's turn to some key parts of our cash flow and balance sheet. Free cash flow for the quarter was $523 million,
rounded, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $601 million, net of property and equipment additions
of $79 million.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 32 days, down from 33 days in the first quarter and up from 30
days in the same quarter last year. Our people continue to deliver very strong cash flow. Our total cash balance at
February 28th was $4.7 billion versus $4.8 billion at the end of August.
Turning to some key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with global head count of more than 215,000 people,
and we now have more than 122,000 people in our global delivery network. In Q2 our utilization was 86%. Attrition,
which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14%, down from 15% in Q1. Lastly, we are on track to hire more than
64,000 people around the world this year.
Before I turn things back to Pierre, I will comment on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through
share repurchases and dividends. In the second quarter we repurchased or redeemed approximately 3.6 million shares
for $177 million at an average price of $48.90 per share. Year to date, we have purchased 18.3 million shares for $797
million. At February 28th, we had $2.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Earlier today, our board announced the second part of our semiannual cash dividend in the amount of $0.45 per share.
This dividend will be paid on May 13, 2011. This is in line with the semiannual dividend of $0.45 we paid in
November and represents a $0.075 or 20% increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year. We continue to
expect to return at least $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends in fiscal

'11.
In summary, I am very pleased with our strong results in the first half of fiscal '11. We continue to be well positioned in
the markets we serve as we go into the second half of our fiscal year.
Now let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you his thoughts on how we are executing on our growth strategy.
Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Pam.
Since becoming CEO on January 1st, I've been meeting with our clients and our clients' service teams all over the
world and across many different industries. And I'm hearing a very consistent story from our clients about the trends
that are affecting their businesses and, as a result, driving demand for our services. Some of the key trends include
globalization, which is driving more consolidation and fueling demand for our M&S services, as well as demand for
global operating model transformation. Operational excellence to achieve greater productivity is driving demand for
our core capability, in ERP, process reengineering, and technology rationalization.
Increasing regulation is driving growing demand for risk and regulatory compliance activities, the development of new
capabilities, and an accelerated focus on sustainability-related solution. And innovation, whether helping our clients
bring new products to market, navigate new technology waves, or enhance their customer experience, innovation is
driving demand for next-generation solutions. These trends continue to present tremendous opportunities for Accenture
across our business, including in our core business, in the many new initiatives we've been focusing on and investing
in, and for our geographic expansion agenda.
I am very pleased with our discipline and execution. We continue to drive the business with consistency and deep
focus. And we are capturing profitable growth opportunities everywhere. Our client teams are incredibly engaged and
committed to the success of our clients. Our people are executing exceptionally well across our business and
geographies. We continue to bring the best of Accenture to our clients every day.
Going forward, I feel good about our business and our opportunity to sustain strong performance. The world is
changing pace, and this is accelerating the change and performance improvement agenda for the industry leaders who
know they have to act now to seize opportunity. And we are operating at the heart of our clients' businesses from
tactical performance improvement to their business transformation agenda. Clients are increasingly turning to us for
their most mission-critical programs. It's very clear to me that Accenture is a go-to partner for the world's leading
companies.
We are executing our growth strategy in a way that differentiates Accenture from the competition. We are bringing
unique industry expertise. We are investing in differentiated offerings and assets. We are riding the new technology
waves. We are driving growth in both emerging and mature geographic markets. And we are recognized as the leading
system integrator for ERP implementation. We've never been better positioned for the future.
Now let me turn the call back to Pam, who will provide our business outlook.
Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Pierre. As a reminder, each quarter we provide an outlook for the next quarter's revenue and an update on
our annual outlook for the full fiscal year.
As we've stated throughout this call, we are pleased with the strong results we delivered this quarter and for the first
half of fiscal '11. In this ever-changing environment, we continue to be vigilant, on the look out for what may impact
our business. Although events around the world may create more uncertainty going forward, we remain focused on
helping our clients achieve higher performance and on delivering value for money, while managing our business
tightly.

That said, I would now like to share with you some thoughts on how we see the remainder of this fiscal year shaping
up. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion, which assumes a foreign
exchange uplift of approximately 4% for the quarter. This range reflects the rates we've experienced over the past
couple of weeks.
Turning to the full fiscal year, we are now assuming a foreign exchange impact of positive 2% for the full fiscal year,
which has trended up from the flat assumption we provided last quarter. Based on our year-to-date results of 16%
revenue growth in local currency, the Q3 outlook I just provided, and how we see the year as a whole, we expect
growth to continue in most areas of our business, although moderating, particularly in outsourcing, from the very strong
growth we experienced in the second quarter.
We now expect our fiscal year 2011 revenue to be in the range of 11% to 14% growth in local currency. Results were
stronger in Q1 and Q2 than we expected them to be, and we do see the latter part of the year more clearly at this point.
We continue to expect new bookings for the fiscal year to land in the range of $25 billion to $28 billion. This is a broad
range that continues to reflect our outlook for future business, even though we have updated both our outlook for
revenue growth and our foreign exchange assumption. The range also reflects, first, some scenario planning for how
new bookings for Japan will land and, second, some potential slight moderation in consulting bookings given that parts
of our consulting business have been running very hot. Taking all of this into account, we currently expect that it's
likely that our bookings this fiscal year will hit at least $26 billion.
We continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion over
last fiscal year. You should expect some fluctuations quarter to quarter as we've seen in the past. We continue to expect
our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 29%. We are updating our outlook for earnings per share to
reflect the increased revenue outlook and new foreign exchange assumption. We now, therefore, expect EPS for the full
fiscal year to be in a range of $3.22 to $3.30, an increase of $0.14. Finally, we now expect operating cash flow to be in
the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion, property and equipment additions to now be $420 million, and free cash flow to
continue to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion.
As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we are positioned well to continue to drive top line and market
share growth for our broad and durable base of services. We remain fully focused on profitability and the generation of
strong cash flow, and we continue to be committed to return a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders over time.
I will just take a moment now to thank all of the people of Accenture, and particularly our people in Japan at this
challenging time for them, for their outstanding performance on behalf of their clients and Accenture.
I look forward to seeing many of you in person at our upcoming investor and analyst conference on April 14th.
Let's open it up now, K.C., so that Pierre and I can take your questions.
K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations
Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you each keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up to allow as
many participants as possible to ask questions. Doug, would you provide instruction for those on the call?

<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Pam, I want to ask, though, the revenue upside in the quarter, I guess the timing of how that
developed in terms of the upside – I'm curious, did you see it pick up in the month-to-month run rate as we crossed the
calendar year? Because obviously you set the guidance in December, and the $200 million of upside was quite large.
So I wanted to ask about the timing of how that developed.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Well, of course, in December, we didn't have any results yet
for the quarter. So it may have picked up a little bit in February. But it wasn't, I don't think, real big across the quarter.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: All right. So relatively smooth. And then just my follow-up, on the share repurchases, it was
a little, I guess, light this quarter. It's the lightest, actually, we've seen in a while. So I know Q1 was pretty strong in
terms of share repurchases. But anything to read into the lighter activity on repurchases?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Not really. I mean, our share repurchases were very high in the first
quarter. As you know, the markets went way up in the second quarter. Our stock hit an all-time high a few times. And
we were intentionally a little less active. On a year-to-date basis, I think we're about where we want to be at this time,
maybe 40%. And we still are on track to repurchase in the third and fourth quarters and to return at least $2.6 billion,
even at current price levels.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Got it. Well, looks like it was a good buy now. Appreciate it. Thanks, Pam. Thanks, Pierre.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Yeah.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Darrin.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Thanks for taking the question. Hi. Just quickly on the gross margin, just the pressure from
contractor use – can you just describe a little more on how long you see that playing out?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I mean, for hot skills we always have contractor needs, and
those are higher now. And what we try to do over time is, if we can, replace them with our people. And it's just, again,
because things are running so hot, that's why we have this phenomenon right now. But we are focused on it, because it
is part of what we'll do in the latter half of the year to improve the gross margin.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay. Just one follow-up. On the local currency outlook, obviously we were happy to see that.
How much does that incorporate Japan and other geographic risks that we've been seeing, obviously, develop?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, Japan – if you look at our business, right, we're about 13% in
Asia-Pacific. And Japan's, I don't know, roughly a third of that.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: And so it's not a giant part of our business. And actually, a lot of our
work in Japan – Pierre and I were just talking with our leader there last night, and some projects stopped but have
restarted. And there've been a handful of cancellations just because a certain number of clients were very impacted by
the earthquake. And there may be some delays. So we've tried to factor in what we know at this point. Our Middle East
business is – we just have very little business there. So it's a negligible impact.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay. That's great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Adam Frisch>: Thanks. Good afternoon. So, Pierre, after the quarter you just put up, I think it's time to consider
retiring as CEO maybe and going out on top here?
But seriously, if we look back over the last 10 years and the prior two CEOs, Joe Forehand had the growth of the
outsourcing business under his reign, among other things. And with Bill we obviously had the growth of the GDN. Two
initiatives that really built on the core business of the company but also changed it dramatically. So I guess given that
the quarter was pretty – was obviously pretty good and the stock's reacting strong in the aftermarket, I thought I'd focus
on a big-picture question first. And, Pierre, what's the big initiative that you want your tenure to be marked by?
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Thanks, Adam, for the question. And I indeed I do not plan
to retire very soon. But I'm, of course, extremely pleased with our results in Q2. And it's definitely a strong start for me.
You mentioned the GDN. You mentioned the core. You mentioned the outsourcing. Probably I would mention the
geographic expansion. You know it was our plan to move from west to east and north to south. And this is definitely an
agenda where I'm putting a lot of attention. And to be honest, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we are making so
far with that agenda, which is very important for Accenture. So if I had to mention one, this is probably the one I would
mention.
<Q - Adam Frisch>: Okay. And then the second question I had, as my follow-up, we tracked and wrote about a spike
in your job postings during the quarter. What areas are you hiring most aggressively, whether it be skill set or
geography? Pam, you said you're running hot in a bunch of places. So what areas are there? And you mentioned a
bunch of things. But if you could focus in on the hiring areas, that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Maybe I can jump on this one as well.
<Q - Adam Frisch>: Sure.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Because we are probably hiring in the different dimension of our
business, to be honest. So that's probably the good news and why I'm so pleased with our results, because we see
growth from the multiple dimensions in our different businesses, operating group, as well as our geographic units, if
you will.
Now, we continue to be aggressive in hiring in our GDN, given the demand in system integration and our will to
continue moving our work offshore to make sure we are remaining extremely competitive in the marketplace. But we
continue as well to hire people in our more onshore business to make sure that we can put in front of our clients highly
differentiated skills and caliber and talent, if you will, probably with more focus on management consulting, deep
experts in technology consulting, as well as probably the best technology architects. So this is where we are making our
hiring. But, of course, we are staying extraordinarily robust in the GDN and the offshore from a number perspective, if
you will.
<Q - Adam Frisch>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: You bet, Adam. Thank you.

<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Hey, guys.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Hi there. Hey, is it safe to declare that we've now moved into a demand phase where more
transformational services are now in vogue? And if you believe that's the case, which would be a great thing since
Accenture is very differentiated in that part of the market, what's your sense for how long that transformational demand
phase will last?
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: My answer would be – first, good afternoon, Rod, and thanks for
participating and your question. Yes, I would say we see more transformational work. Now, let me define
[indiscernible] what we mean with transformation, because sometimes we mean transformation equal very large jobs.
What we mean by transformation is probably what I would qualify as mission critical, things our clients are doing to
change the trajectory of their business and be more competitive in the marketplace, and it might not be a question of
size. It's more a question of the quality of the work. And indeed if you accept that definition, if you will, yes, I
definitely see more of those with our clients. That would be my point number one.
Point number two, is it kind of durable? Is there a pattern there? Frankly, I've been meeting with many clients, from
Asia to Europe and Europe to North America, and as I mentioned previously, I was just amazed, to be honest, with the
consistency of the trends they've been reflecting to me. All these globalization, regulation, innovation, operational
excellence, and you can add a couple of other things around digitalization and the new technology wave – if you put all
of this together, yes, I believe those trends are probably durable and should drive the demand, because there is a need
for our clients to move now and I mentioned to act now, as they first see the opportunity to grow in the marketplace and
they need to seize those opportunities in order to drive their business. And at the same time they continue to rationalize
their operation and to be more effective. And I think those are big trends, to be honest. Now, we're going to watch that
carefully over time to see how it's going to evolve, but I think those are underlying big trends.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Great.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: I would just add – just one thing. We did have eight deals over $100
million this quarter. And again, we see a continuation of the pattern that there's more transformational work but being
arranged in more manageable chunks, so that trend also continues.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Great. Well, I think investors will give you credit for the nice growth that's coming through.
But in light of the growth, Pierre, are there a certain set of risks that you need to manage more closely, maybe more
closely monitoring for problem contracts and execution on deals? And also related to the question about what risks
you're going to be monitoring in the upcoming quarters, is the stronger growth making you more or less comfortable
with your ability to expand margin? Will you see some leverage in the business? Or will that all be offset with the need
to pay higher bonuses and wages? So how do you think about the risk in the margin equation here?
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, thanks, Rod. At the end of the day, growth is a good
problem to have and to deal with. So – but indeed, I mean, there are things you need to get right when growth is back.
And the first is indeed to get the right talent and the right people on board. I mean, this is what we've been doing these
last, frankly, six months, even more, and we need to make sure that we continue not only hiring people, but hiring
talented people. And so we're investing a lot in hiring, in training, in retaining. I'm very pleased to see that our retention
is better, and so attrition is a little bit lower, which is good for us, but it's probably, certainly, an element of attention for
us in the business we are.
I mean the second point is we will never trade execution risk against growth. So our job is to monitor the business
extraordinarily tightly and to make sure indeed we are capturing the best part of the growth and we are pulling the risk
a little bit outside. But from that risk perspective, it's probably more around the people and our ability to continue
hiring, training, and deploying the people. Now, over time we mentioned our guidance regarding the margin. I think we
are comfortable we will deliver against our guidance. [ph] Do you have any – ?

<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: I mean, I think the phenomenon of how fast it happened for us,
which was more than we expected, and this year's salary increases were significantly more than last year's, right? And
then we did have bonuses coming out of last year. So the compare there was tougher from the standpoint of managing
that turn. Now, in the second half of the year, that does – the heavy lifting on that is behind us, and so we feel good
about that, Rod, as we continue through the year here.

Our next question, from Tim Fox with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Tim.
<Q - Tim Fox>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was sort of a high-level question relative
to your comments earlier about taking market share. Could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing most of that
market share gain, whether it be in the consulting or outsourcing business, or any particular trends that we should look
for? And how is it that your ability to gain market share is improving here as the market improves overall?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean, just in – we do see really good market share growth
in both consulting and our outsourcing, in both management consulting, as well as what we do in technology. And so
really it's across that, just in terms of the numbers. But let me let Pierre give you some color.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, [indiscernible]. Market share – I mean, thanks, Tim, for the
question, and it is a very important element. I mean, market share is a sign of whether we are driving a healthy business
and we are doing better than the competition. And at the end of the day, indeed we are very pleased with where we are,
because we are gaining market share in most of the business we are operating in as we speak, which, I think, for me, is
a very important signal around our differentiation. Are we different from our competitors? Are we bringing something
unique, which is really resonating with our clients? Are we relevant in the business? And the answer seems to be yes.
So we are monitoring that very carefully.
I'm pleased with the fact that we are gaining market share in management consulting. That's as well in outsourcing and
system integration, which is an extremely competitive market, as you know. And again, I think this is an illustration
that in this highly competitive market, we are not moving ourself to the commodity world; that we're still bringing
some differentiation in what we do, and that differentiation is recognized with our clients. And we are gaining market
share, which is extremely important for us.
<Q - Tim Fox>: Great. And the follow-up would be, relative to the competition and pricing, you mentioned very
strong growth in bookings for BPO in particular. Could you just comment on how the pricing environment is shaping
up in the recovery here? And we've heard some significant pressure on some of the larger BPO competitive bids out
there. So any color you could provide on the pricing environment would be helpful.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean, I think you're exactly right, Tim. I mean, it is still
competitive out there. There are some place where we do have some pricing power, but I would still characterize it as
competitive and stable. But Pierre?
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. It is definitely stabilizing. I think we have evidence of this.
Now, if you are looking just in the recent past or as we speak, we're starting to see sign of pricing improvement. So we
need a little bit more time to figure out whether it's going to be a kind of durable pattern. But I would say stabilizing,
yes. Early sign of improvement in the marketplace in some of – in pockets of the market we are doing.

Our next question, from George Price, BB&T Capital Markets.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, George.
Operator
Mr. Price, your line is open. Is your mute button on?
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: George?
Operator
Very well. We'll go ahead on to the next questioner then. Please requeue. Our next question is from Julio Quinteros
with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Good evening.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Julio.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: So just a couple of quick things, I guess, as it relates to margins and thinking about this more
longer term. I think where you guys currently stand, your utilization is running really hot. I'm not sure that that's a big
benefit to margins going forward, but it feels like attrition's improving, wages seem like at least we're over that big
hump in terms of the spike up in wages, and potentially pricing could benefit the model. So as we're thinking about
margins longer term, Pam, any sense on what other puts and takes to think about for the margin profile as we move into
fiscal '12? And beyond?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean, I – the ones you mentioned are certainly on our
minds. And I think just picking up some of the other pieces of operating margin, we continue to look to hold the line as
much as we can on G&A costs as we grow. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in our selling, and we
have continuing programs being led by our COO on that. And I think in contract margins, right, we're going to be
forever focused on cost to serve, and how do we always look for productivity and efficiency in terms of how we do
that, as well as pricing power where we're really getting a differentiation. And this, as Pierre is certainly establishing
leadership for us, I mean, that's clearly going to be more and more our focus.
So I think those are the places where we continue to have opportunity, and, as you know, we also need to invest in the
business. And those investments primarily go through the P&L. So that's why I've been focused on modest margin
expansion, so that we can indeed continue to make those investments and yet, at the same time, post up modest margin
expansion over time.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Maybe just two quick – just one follow-up on two quick points. How are you guys thinking
about the offshore contribution, or global delivery? That's now 50%, 60%, 70%, of your head count. When does that
begin to sort of show up, I guess, in terms of margins? Or is it kind of helping but it could be more if you weren't
investing? Just trying to think – sort of that part specifically. And then longer term, what is the thinking about
leveraging more platforms, more IP, maybe thinking about that in the way of, I guess, a nonlinear context for margin
expansion as well?

<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, so I will pick up on that one, and thanks, Julio, for the
question. I mean, indeed, we want to continue investing in differentiation. I mean, that's something which is very
important for us. Differentiation and competitiveness, those are the kind of the two key pillars, if you will, in
everything we do.
In order to differentiate, indeed we need first to have the best-qualified people, and I mean onshore, as I mentioned
before, with extremely deep and unique skills as necessary to put in front of the client, but we need to continue
expanding the global development network in our offshore, and it's a kind of permanent dynamic we're trying to strike
right, growing on both sides. I think we will definitely continue to grow our offshore people.
Now, in order to drive more differentiation, indeed we need to bring in our solutions and offerings something different,
and you mentioned asset IP. I think that's something I referred to as well. I'm probably a big fan of this. This is
something I've been driving significantly when I was leading our Financial Services operating group. I think with a
really targeted view of what we could do, we can make that happen, and I can refer to the recent acquisition we've been
making in Germany of a software solution called CAS. I don't know whether you've seen that one. But I think it's an
extremely good illustration of what we want to do when we are talking about targeted tuck-in acquisition, in asset, in
order to drive differentiation. This acquisition is telling all.
I can elaborate on this, if you will. But it's about – I mean, this acquisition, it's all about customer relationship
management -
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Right.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: – with deep focus on trade promotion in consumer products. When
we mean focus, this is what we mean. Taking a high-growth industry, consumer goods, understanding where we can
make the difference, trade promotion, because it's going to create value and outcome for our clients.
How we can do that, we are targeting that company, which fits exactly the purpose, bringing asset and IP to
competition, comp match and comp copy. We're putting that in the context of our system integration solution, bundled
with management consulting, and then you're getting to the market with something which is unique. I think this is a
kind of recipe for success, if I'm taking kind of French language, if you will.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Yeah, that makes sense. And I guess just in terms of numbers, could you put any numbers
around how big that would be as a part of your business today? Or if not, maybe, we can – I guess we can wait till April
to get some sense on that. But that actually would be very helpful to get some sense on what percentage of your
business is actually leverageable that way today.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's a small but growing part.
<Q - Julio Quinteros>: Got it. Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.

lumpiness in some contracts this quarter? Did it come in faster than you were expecting? Maybe you could just help us
understand the momentum of the general business.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I think it's more just the moderation of the year-over-year
growth rate more than anything else, and just intended to say that we expected that. But nothing really lumpy. I think
it's more in the compare.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Got it. And then maybe you could just talk broadly about sort of – obviously this was a very
good quarter. As you head towards the back half of the year, I know we talked a little bit about Japan, and maybe you
could give a little bit more color on the U.S. government, but if you could talk about just what you have for – any
concerns that you have in the business right now as you look at sort of the second half of your fiscal year.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: I mean, I will let Pam comment on U.S. because she's definitely a
specialist on this. Yeah. But I mean, more broadly, you've seen our guidance. We're updating the guidance, which is
demonstrating that we believe in the growth, we believe in the momentum in the marketplace. We believe that our
clients are investing, and we have opportunities in front of us. We're as well looking at the global environment. We're
not blind. We understand what's going on in the world. We are all traveling, including myself, the world to understand
what's going on and for information firsthand, if you will. We are taking all that input, we're talking with our clients a
lot, we're talking with our client's team. We're understanding the world dynamic, and then we have put our best
estimate for what might be our second part of the year, and we feel good about the guidance we are giving to you
today.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, just on federal, that's roughly 5% or 6% of our business. And
I guess continuing resolutions have become a way of life for us here in the U.S. I mean, if it shuts down for a few days
or something, it would not have an impact on us. But I think in the unlikely event that there was an extended shutdown,
then it would. But we're not expecting that. And we've factored in to be able to handle a few days.

<Q - Edward Caso>: Afternoon. Thank you. I was curious if you could give us an update about the United Kingdom?
Obviously they did some changes in their approach last summer and brought all the larger providers in and packed
them down. How is business now? Is it starting to pick up again? And maybe some areas of focus that you could talk
about?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: And, Ed, you mean in the public service business, right? When you
ask that question?
<Q - Edward Caso>: Yeah. Yeah, right. UK government.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: We do see our business actually returning nicely in the UK. It had
good double-digit growth in the quarter. It was driven primarily by the commercial operating groups. And we are
repositioning, indeed, there in terms of our public service business. But we do have some good opportunities there and
are working it.
<Q - Edward Caso>: And I was curious, it looks like you're on track to distribute roughly the amount of cash that you
generate in a year. But you have almost $5 billion on the balance sheet. Has there ever been thought of maybe a special
dividend?

Very well. We'll go back then to George Price with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - George Price>: Hi, thanks very much. Apologies for the earlier technical difficulties.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: No problem, George. Welcome back.
<Q - George Price>: Thanks, Pam. It's nice to be back. Wanted to, first of all, congratulate you on great results. Really
fantastic. I did drop for a period, so a couple of things may have been asked; I apologize for that. But I wondered if you
would, just on the segment operating margin side, could you go into a little bit more detail about kind of what was
going on with the product margin down 9%, down from double-digit levels, for quite a period of time? I think you
mentioned a little bit in your commentary about some contract issues. But I wondered if maybe you could give some
more color to that, if you hadn't already.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I mean, part of the Products portfolio – and just part of it,
right – I would say was more challenged, just in terms of absorbing these salary increases and sort of getting the right
resource mix and pricing than the others. And so that did impact them this quarter. We also intentionally had planned
for some lower profitability in Products on certain contracts this year. And we do expect them to return to higher
profitability over time. It's always been an extremely high-performing part of Accenture.
<Q - George Price>: Okay. What about – I guess on the other hand, I'd say it was nice to see Health & Public Service,
the operating margin, continuing to move up, hitting 9% now. Do you think that business is on track to get back to
double-digit operating margin in the second half?
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: No. Health & Public Service, I mean, it was – we're still doing the
repositioning there. And we did say it would take this year. And do expect that it will. So we had a good margin result
this quarter. But I do expect it to continue to be single digits this year.
<Q - George Price>: Okay. Lastly, if I -
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Wait one second. Pierre is going to add something.
<Q - George Price>: Oh, okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, I mean, this is where we are from a profitability
perspective. I would like to [indiscernible] the work which is being done with our leadership in HPS with Steve
Rohleder. Because, I mean, the H part is doing extremely, extremely well. As you remember, we presented in the last
investor conference that we had a kind of plan around growing health. And we are executing against that plan. And we
are very pleased with the results so far. Regarding PS, in that we are repositioning that business, especially in EMEA.
We are making good progress. So, indeed, on HPS we have more work to be done. But we have a plan. We are
executing. We have the right leadership in place. And I'm sure we're going to drive the right outcome.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's going quite well.
<Q - George Price>: Okay. And if I could just add maybe one more. Any potential – I mean, obviously with all of the
cash flow that you have, any potential for stepped-up M&A to use any cash that way at all? I mean, I guess another

way to ask it is, do you feel that you have what you need right now to continue to grow as well as you're growing
organically? Or do you think that acquisitions over the next year or two might play more of a role in your use of cash?
Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I mean, on this one, and I think we are demonstrating that
for two quarters, our DNA has a lot to do with organic growth. I think we are doing organic growth better than anyone
else. I mean, for the simple reason that there are opportunities to grow organically in different parts of the world and
different parts of our business, and we will never trade organic against inorganic. Organic growth is good. It's driving
good business, it's driving good cash, and it's positioning us very well. And so we can return some cash to people like
you.
Now, indeed, we are looking at acquisition in a way that can differentiate. We're not going to spend our precious cash
just for the sake of making acquisition, but we're going to look at what's going to make us different. I mentioned look
this CAS acquisition. We're probably going to make others, but exactly with the same spirit to make us different from
the competition and bring something unique to our clients in a way that will complement – complement – our organic
growth. Cash is precious, and we're going to take a lot of care of it.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: I mean, what we're trying to do is sharpen the strategy where we can
do these focused tactical tuck-ins, right? I think we can do that a little better, but it's not going to change the rigor or the
evaluation, but just more – I think we'd like to see a little bit more focus in some certain areas. So we are doing that, but
in the end, these things are hard to do, and we only want to do the right one.
<Q - George Price>: Great. Congratulations. Again, thanks very much for taking my question.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: You bet, George.
<A - Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig, Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.
Pierre Nanterme, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and thank you very much for your questions. As you heard, we continue to
see solid momentum in our business, and we are well positioned as we enter the second half of our fiscal year.
Frankly, much of the credit for our strong results goes to the incredibly talented team of more than 250,000 Accenture
men and women around the world. Asnd I want to specifically acknowledge the dedication and commitment of our
people in Japan, who, despite the most difficult circumstances, have continued to serve our clients during a very
challenging period. I'm also very proud that in true Accenture fashion, Accenture people around the world have
mobilized to support our colleagues in Japan.
In closing, I feel very good about our business. I strongly believe that in this fast-changing environment we have the
right positioning, we have the right strategy, we are executing at scale and at speed, and with the right leaders in place
to drive our agenda forward.
We look forward to talking with many of you in person at our Investor & Analyst Conference next month in New York.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call K.C. to make arrangements for follow-up. All the best.
K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations
Thanks.
