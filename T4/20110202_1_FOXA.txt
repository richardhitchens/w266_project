release.
With that, I will turn it over to Dave.
David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Great, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, we are pleased with
our continued progress in fiscal 2011. We reported second quarter segment operating income of $1.29 billion, a 6%
increase over year ago's levels when excluding last year's $500 million litigation charge. This improvement was led by
the continued strong growth at our Cable Programming and Television segments that more than offset a difficult
comparison at Filmed Entertainment and higher losses at the Digital Media Group.
During this year's second quarter, the company recorded a $275 million pre-tax charge related to the impairment of
assets in an organizational restructuring at Myspace. Also in the most recent quarter, the company recorded pre-tax
losses from the disposition of certain businesses, including Jamba, and the FOX Audience Network, the internet ad
sales group. Excluding the net income effect in both years of one-time items, principally consisting of the items just
mentioned, as well as the litigation settlement charge last year, the second quarter adjusted earnings per share this year
are $0.29, compared with last year's result of $0.25.
The press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. This 16% adjusted earnings per share
growth reflects the higher segment operating income, lower net interest expense from 1.9 billion less debt outstanding,
and modestly improved equity earnings from higher BSkyB contributions.
Now I would like to provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses. Let's first start
with cable, the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results. Generating nearly – this
segment generates nearly 60% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Our second quarter cable
segment operating income increased 22% over last year, to $735 million this growth continues to be top line driven,
with segment revenues up 12%. Advertising revenues at the cable networks increased 17% over year ago levels and
affiliate fees grew 11% reflecting particular strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international
channels, including STAR.
Keep in mind that our strong revenue and earnings growth was generated despite the adverse impact from a one-month
blackout on the DISH Network of our Regional Sports Networks, FX and National Geographic Channels due to a
distribution contract renewal dispute with EchoStar. While a new deal was successfully executed, the blackout reduced
cable segment operating income growth by about $30 million in the current quarter.
At our Film segment, second quarter operating income was $189 million, as compared to 324 million we reported a
year ago. This anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide home entertainment release of Ice Age: Dawn
of the Dinosaurs, which is in last year's results. As we look forward, keep in mind that close to 75% of Avatar's
record-breaking worldwide box office receipts were generated in last year's March quarter. As a result, we will have a
difficult comparison to the prior year in the current March quarter.
At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $151 million increased by 122 million, driven by top line
growth at our television stations and our broadcast network. Our station revenues were up 20% in the quarter,
compared to a year ago, reflecting significantly higher political spending, and overall improved local advertising levels.
Political spending was approximately $45 million higher this quarter than a year ago. After politicals, automotive
advertising increases represented the next largest portion of our revenue growth.

At FOX Broadcasting, we also showed improved results, driven by advertising increases in both general entertainment
and sports. Higher NFL ratings and stronger pricing more than offset weaker ratings and one fewer game from this
year's less favorable World Series match-up. These improvements at both the station and the network were despite lost
ad sales and expenses related to the Cablevision blackout that reduced segment operating income by nearly $17 million.
Turning to SKY Italia, recent financial and operational trends indicate that we are making good progress in restoring
our growth trajectory and towards our next milestone of 5 million subscribers. In the quarter, segment operating losses
improved 60% to $12 million from last year's loss of $30 million, resulting from higher revenue in local currency terms
and lower basic programming and movie costs.
Revenues increased about 2% in local currency, as compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily due to a higher
average subscriber base, which increased total subscription revenue, despite a slight decrease in our monthly ARPU.
Our monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged approximately €42, as compared to €43 in the year ago. This decrease
reflects the migration of some existing subscribers among the new package choices that we announced over the
summer.
This slightly lower ARPU, which was anticipated, and we are very pleased with the overall result to-date of the
reorganized programming packages. In fact, this quarter's gross additions total approximately 214,000, or 43% higher
than gross additions a year ago. This improvement combined with a 33% reduction in churn subscribers netted SKY
Italia 71,000 additional subscribers. This sub growth represents the highest quarterly net additions in the last two years,
and Sky ended the quarter with approximately 4.87 million subs.
At our Publishing segment, segment operating income of $380 million decreased $30 million from last year's second
quarter, when excluding last year's litigation settlement. Increased advertising revenues in all three of our major
newspaper markets were more than offset by lower contributions at HarperCollins, costs associated with the investment
in The Daily, and the absence of the Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. The year-ago results
included about $17 million in segment operating profit in the quarter from the index business.
And at our Other segment, we reported a second-quarter segment operating loss of $156 million, $31 million higher
than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects lower search and advertising revenues at Myspace, partially
offsetting this decline were improved operating results at FOX Mobile, which we sold in December, and higher
contributions from our international outdoor business.
And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011, and as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from
fiscal 2010 the $500 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.46 billion in segment operating income for
comparative purposes.
In early November, we reiterated guidance anticipating our segment operating income growth for fiscal 2011 to be in
the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Since that time, results at Myspace have
been below our expectations and our new film releases were somewhat below our original expectations. On the other
hand, our television cable segments continue to outperform our expectations, due to the buoyant advertising markets
and recent retrans and cable affiliation agreements. As a result, after taking all of these items into account, and based on
all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal
2011 to a growth rate range in the low double-digits above the fiscal 2010 adjusted result.
And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to Chase.
Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Dave. I'd like to spend a few minutes adding some operational context to the financial results Dave just
discussed. Clearly, we feel good about the quarter's overall financial performance, but we feel even better about the
progress we're making in positioning our business for long-term growth.

The largest drivers in the most recent quarter, namely the Cable and Broadcast channels' earnings, and the business
momentum at SKY Italia, will not only help us deliver our segment operating profit growth target for the year, but
should also continue to be drivers of our earnings trajectory for several years to come. As Dave pointed out, our
channels business, consisting of both Cable and Broadcast, is the lead engine powering current earnings. The operating
momentum of our Cable segment is underpinned by the multiyear distribution contracts already in place, as well as a
highly developed international expansion plan.
Assuming a relatively stable advertising environment, this segment should continue delivering at least solid
double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. Currently all of our local, national, and international TV
businesses are benefiting from very strong advertising markets, however, our longer term cable network growth is not
reliant on advertising increases, but rather is supported by unique competitive programming strength at virtually all of
our networks.
The power of local sports continues to drive momentum at our Regional Sports Networks where this year's MLB
baseball ratings finished up 9%, compared to the previous season, and the Big 12 national football package scored a
13% increase in ratings. While the season is still early, basketball ratings are up 13%, compared to this point a year
ago.
At FX, this season's Sons of Anarchy achieved the channel's highest 18 to 49 ratings for any show in the channel's 16
year history and we just renewed for a fourth season. FX's ratings going forward, will also benefit from a considerably
stronger movie lineup. Additionally, with the new DISH and Cablevision agreements, FX is now a fully distributed
network reaching almost 100 million homes.
FOX News in the most recent quarter beat CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and Headline News combined in prime time total
viewers making it the number four channel across all of basic cable. And given the strength of the channel and its
passionate viewership, we expect to get appropriate increases on the renewals we have coming up with all the major
MSOs over the next few years.
At FOX International Channels, where the majority of our 200+ channels are in high growth, under-penetrated markets,
we have the scale, and the expertise to more than double profits over the next few years, generating $1 billion in
operating profit income by fiscal 2015 and that $1 billion target does not include the rapidly escalating profits being
generated at STAR India. Following a reorganization and re-branding a year ago, STAR is now on pace to deliver its
highest annual profit ever.
The growth of our business is not solely being driven by cable properties. It is also the result of a rapidly improving
broadcast business here in the U.S – While we were pleased with the high single-digit ad pricing increases we achieved
in the current season's upfront, we are delighted with the current strength of the national scatter market. This
advertising strength clearly reflects the potency of a broad audience delivered by high profile entertainment.
And no programming is more high profile than American Idol. We are absolutely thrilled with its return, which has
been received well, is performing well and continues to be the most dominant show on television. American Idol along
with Glee and The X Factor, which premiers this fall, provide a really powerful foundation for FBC's future success.
Equally as significant for our broadcast business is the strength of FOX Sports. In fact, FOX Sports finished 2010 as
the number one sports network for the 14th straight year, and the 2010 NFL on FOX regular season was the most
watched in FOX history. We have a great match for this weekend's Super Bowl XLV! That said our expectations for
this year's NASCAR performance are more tempered given last year's ratings decline. We will have a better feel for
that following the Daytona 500 race in two and a half weeks.
On a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job increasing their market share and driving cost-efficiencies.
Local advertising trends point to a growing and stable market ahead, supported by sturdy auto, telecom and financial
advertising demand. And as I mentioned on the last quarter's earnings call, potential for the broadcast business, and the
fees we are starting to collect from cable and satellite distributors that reflect the importance of our network to
consumers. We have a retrans agreement in place with four of the larger distributors and have now set the market for
our broadcast business.

As we continue to secure new agreements over the next couple of years, we will be taking this business to a whole new
level of profitability. In fact, with these distribution fees, we expect our U.S. broadcasting business, including the
stations and FBC to generate at least $1 billion in annual operating income within the next couple of years, assuming
relatively stable ad markets.
While the channel business is our biggest growth driver today, we are equally bullish about our international pay TV
platforms. In Italy, through technology leadership, effective marketing and new pricing and programming offers in the
last summer we have rejuvenated this business. As Dave mentioned, SKY Italia just achieved its highest level of
quarterly subscriber net additions in the last eight quarters through a combination of higher gross adds and lower churn.
In Germany, the most recent operational trends suggest the management team there has taken the right actions by
leveraging the powerful combination of content and technology leadership to capitalize on this significant market
opportunity. In mid-January, Sky Deutschland pre-announced a number of December quarter operating metrics
showing considerable improvement. They added 131,000 net additional subscribers in the quarter with gross additions
up 24% from the same quarter ago, and their lowest annualized churn rate in 21 quarters.
We also continue to be excited about our 30% interest in TATA SKY in India, a market offering significant potential,
given its size and anticipated economic growth. Similar to our platforms in other markets, TATA SKY, boasts
superiority in technology, customer services and innovation, and currently has more than 6 million connections.
Before I move off beyond our platform business, I should also mention that we are currently working through the
regulatory process towards a full acquisition of BSkyB, but at this time, there's nothing more I can add to what's
already been reported in the press.
On our content side, our TV studio is doing great. As I said, last quarter, Modern Family is on course to generate the
largest first cycle sales in history, Glee ranks as the number one scripted series on TV and continues to grow. We have
a great set of pilots we are looking forward to across the four networks for the coming season.
Our film studio has not had a year to remember, but that's the nature of the business. We have a great management
team with a great set of upcoming films, headlined by our animated Rio, and the X-Men sequel. We also recently
announced three strategic actions, which will enhance our release slate and risk management for years to come.
Specifically we extended our long-standing co-financing deal with Dune Capital, second we renewed our partnership
with New Regency providing co-financing opportunities, as well as distribution fees for FOX Film through 2022 and
we agreed with Jim Cameron that Avatar 2 and 3 will be his next films.
Also on the content side, I would like to take a minute to touch on our new digital news product The Daily, which we
formally announced earlier today and for which Rupert is still providing some briefings as we speak. I think this is
exactly the type of initiative we should be pursuing to take advantage of the digital revolution. We should be leaders in
using our content strengths and brands to build extensions of these for the new wave of digital platforms and
technologies. The digital revolution craves our content and brands and we need to focus our efforts on being leaders in
developing digital businesses for our news, sports and entertainment franchises around the world.
That leads me to the final topic, Myspace. We recently completed a rebuild of the business with a focus on
entertainment and restructured the organization to right-size the company. With the new content, focus and structure in
place, we believe now is the right time for News Corp. to consider strategic options for this business. The new Myspace
experience has been very well-received by the market and we have some encouraging traffic metrics in the last several
weeks, however, we recognize that the plan to allow Myspace to reach its full potential may be best developed under a
new ownership structure and we are evaluating those strategic alternatives
In summary, I feel we are on the right track with virtually all of our businesses and have the critical building blocks in
place to generate long-term earnings growth and value in this fast-moving digital world. Thanks, and now we are happy
to take your questions.

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: I have one for Chase and a quick one for Dave. Chase, you mentioned a target of $1
billion in OI in TV a couple of years from now. I wonder if you could give us a sense of how big retrans will play in
that role in terms of the size of retrans for you and reverse retrans given you have done some deals already. Can you
take us from what it looks like now to two, three years from now on retrans and reverse retrans?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: When you say reverse retrans, you
mean, the affiliates?
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Yeah, exactly. How much of that 1 billion, or so is coming from those two new revenue
lines?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: It's a revenue. Look, the 1 billion
is a profit number. Obviously, the retrans is revenue. But, I mean, I'm not going to put a specific dollar on it. There's a
fair amount out there about what we're looking to get for it, and so I will let the, you know, speculation speak for itself.
I think we are pretty – you know, pretty well sort of define the market for us in terms of the O&Os, and the affiliate
side is probably more actively engaged in right now. This is a big number. It's certainly hundreds of millions of dollars.
It changes the nature of this business, and, you know, in many ways I think the broadcast network should look like a
cable network and should – and should have two real meaningful streams of revenue, subscription and advertising and
we look for this to, you know, be a significant part of the revenue for that – for that broadcast business.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: And what type of – a follow-up, and then I'll move on. What type of ad growth is assumed
to get to 1 billion in OI? When you said modest ad growth, are you talking low single-digit growth all in?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah. We're not assuming – we
are assuming – essentially our view of the economy right now would be probably you've got a pretty low growth
economy and, obviously we look at the short term, the ad market is great. We're sitting here with scatter pricing that's
more than a third above the upfront. We're not assuming that. We're assuming you're going to have an ad market that's,
you know – you know, is pretty modest growth that sort of reflects an economy that, I think – you know, we think we
would assume right now, you know, is pretty modest growth.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Hi. I have two questions. One was just sort of a follow-on to Michael's question. Could you
give us color, Chase, on advertising completely across the platforms? It sounds like there is strength pretty much on
every platform in every market and I was just wondering if you could give us some color going into the March quarter?
And then secondly, can you talk to us about – you know, just give us your views on TV Everywhere. Do you think it's
important for your channels to participate, and where are you in deals?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: On the advertising markets, it is
really strong. I mean, TV is leading, I guess I'd say national TV in particular. So, when you look at the broadcast
network, I mean, I touched on the scatter, the cable networks. Right now the cable second half growth looks stronger
than the first half growth. And so, you know, it's – you know, it is certainly very good. You know, it's good on the
station side, I mean, the comps get tougher on the station side, so year-on-year, we are not going to have the type of
year-on-year growth in the second and third quarter that we did in the first two. But, it's really, you know, good, solid
growth, and, you know, really across the – you know, across the broadcast platforms, ad revenues – I mean, across the
newspaper, you know, both Dow Jones, U.K., Australia, are all up. They are not up like the TV business but -

<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's double-digit.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: They are up and continue to look
pretty good. And obviously, we have the Super Bowl on top of it, you know, falling on Sunday.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: And the international cable networks?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: And the what?
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: The international cable networks.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: The international – you know,
international, it's somewhat higher than the domestic, you know, so – international networks, on pretty almost any front
you want to look at are doing great. The fact that we have this quarter observed the fight with EchoStar and fight with
Cablevision, which were both whacks in the quarter and come out with those results it affected both profits, ad dollars,
and the like, I think it speaks to the strength of those businesses, but the international cable networks, you know, would
be – you know, would be leading it and certainly, there doesn't seem to be anything slowing it down as we look at the
second – you know, the second half of the year.
What was your second question?
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: It was on TV Everywhere, just your views on where you are.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I prefer to call it authentication
because I think it's a better phrase as you move forward into an array of digital platforms, how you package it and try to
create value out of it. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a bit of – you know, it's a struggle to get going. I think to some
degree, it's been encumbered by a cable industry that tries to – you know, tries to create too many walls around it. I
think it would be enhanced if it was approached in a more open way, you know, where – you know, where it had a
more open opportunity for an array of digital platforms to consist in an authenticated world. And, I think it would be – I
think it would be a good thing if it gets some traction. I do think it's – but I think it's got to – look, at the end of the day,
its success is going to be built on making it a good experience for consumers and if you don't, they will, you know, find
other options, which is why I think the cable industry ought to – cable/satellite – the distribution industry ought to find
a way to make it more open and, you know, enticing and appealing and, you know, an opportunity for consumers and,
you know, let those who do a good job succeed because then the consumers are going to migrate to where – to the
experiences, you know, they value and value and like. But I think authentication, you know, is an important initiative
and something we would like to see succeed. It's been frustrating, it's been talked about for two years and still hasn't
gotten very far.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Next question, please.
Operator
That comes from Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Thanks so much, you know, I think I'm just going to follow up on Jessica's questions if
that's okay. You just said, Chase, an array of digital platforms. Are you referencing the potential to license your cable
networks to online aggregators or are you just really talking about shows and movies, and the opportunity to monetize
them in different windows?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: No, I – just – I mean,
authentication, I'm really talking about sort of the ability – you know, to have that sort of add on to the core
programming package of whatever we talked about, what you want to see when you want to see it, you know, where
you want to see it and provide that experience and provide it in a rewarding way. And I think that rewarding way isn't

it's about adding the enhanced experience of getting what you want, where you want, when you want it, on top of the
core programming package.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Do you envision sort of the next few years that the current cable, satellite distribution
ecosystem stays in place when it comes to your live channels?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah, look, I – I truly believe the
value of that – you know, look, I understand we would all like to pay less. I think they value of what they get in that
package is fabulous. I think the breadth of what you've got there is unique when it covers sort of sports to news to
entertainment, and the like. And I think, you know, American households today live on it.
Maybe not every 23-year-old understands, but I think it is everything we see about it, you know, any of the noise about,
you know, pressures today, I think are really, you know – you know, economically driven at a tough time when you
have people, you know, struggling, you know, with the unemployment rate where it is, that have to, you know, make –
you know, very difficult, you know, tradeoffs, you know, in their day-to-day life. But I think that's – I think the value,
you know, of this package, you know, and the importance of it, you know, has real legs to it.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: And I'm just intrigued by your comment that the second half cable network growth looks
stronger than the first half. Is it fair to say then that March quarter domestic ad pacings for cable networks could be
accelerated from what we just saw in the December quarter?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: It's not doubling. It's stronger, it's
not just – right now it feels it's a notch stronger, so it's not like it exploded in the second half, but you know, but it's a
notch stronger than it was in the first half.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Stronger is good news. All right, thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good afternoon. Chase, I just want to pick up a little bit more on how you
are thinking about monetizing the content at FOX, in particular. Disney did a deal with Netflix and I think the press
reports were sort of $150 to $200 million for a year's worth of programming and I would argue most of that value, if
that number is close to right, it accrues to ABC. So, how do you feel about that kind of a deal with FOX, just in terms
of making prior season's shows available online, and whether it's Netflix or Fox.com, or Hulu, you know, there's been
that argument from the Turner folks that Modern Family being available on Hulu made it less attractive for them, I just
wanted to get your thought process and strategy on using these platforms to build value at FOX's TV studio and at the
network.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I think for content owners, having
players like, you know, Netflix emerge, and, you know, certainly – has real pop to it in the sense they are another buyer
of our product. I think that's, you know, largely what somebody like – you know, I distinguished Fox.com, which is
really – I think there's a line between sort of current season product, which is really more where the Fox.com's, you
know, reside, and sort of a delayed access to you know, current product, which is different than sort of the – you know
where the Netflix type reside, which is really more what I would consider library product. You know, product that may
– obviously those things can change, but I do think they are – you know, they are different and to the degree, you
know, Netflix is, you know, which is I think this type of deal, I read the Disney deal. I don't remember the specific
product, but to the degree it's – where you talked Modern Family to the degree they are looking to compete for sort of
library rights. I think largely they are competing with other sort of, you know, network-type buyers and I think

increasingly you're going to have – you know, them be competitors – not co-sharing, they will be competitors and I
think probably, a channel is right to say if I'm going to pay a lot of money for Modern Family, I want to buy enough
rights that it's not showing up on a competing platform. At least I know what it is for adjusting my value. I think for us
as a buyer, because we are a buyer as well on FX, I would not be buying reruns syndication rights to an expensive piece
of programming and letting it go reside on Netflix for 20 million homes.
I think that's – the place they reside is – you know, I think how I look at it, what we have to make sure is that we are
getting fair value for our product. We shouldn't be selling it cheap. But I think at times people have sold their product
cheap. I think the STARZ deal with Netflix is probably the ultimate example of product being sold beyond cheap. I
think if we can get fair value, you know, for our product, they are another buyer for our product, another medium for
our product and you may have sort of you merge for library values or you have cable channels, syndication and digital
networks that are competing for these rights. And I think the buyers of those rights have to shake out.
I know where we are a buyer on the FX side, I know how we'll approach it, and I think we will certainly look at all of
those distribution platforms and adjust what we're willing to bid or what we're willing to bid on, and what we're willing
to pay, based on where it's being distributed. So I'm – I mean, I think that's how I look at it. I think obviously we need
to – but I think the core is we need to make sure that we are getting fair value for our product in whatever one of these
distribution channels we are dealing with.

Our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield, BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hi, just a couple of questions following on the technology side. When you look at doing
things on the movie side with your content, in terms of early release, video on demand, or selling your content earlier in
a digital window, wondering how your plans are evolving on that front.
And then, two, when you talked about the strength of the RSNs, with the prospect of an NBA strike next year, how do
you look at – a) how big of an impact is basketball to the RSNs overall? And is there any plans in terms of other
programming that could be shifted around? And just how are you thinking about that overall would be great. Thanks.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah, on the movie side, I guess
early windows specifically – you know, electronic distribution, I guess, more broadly, I think it's very important for us.
I think the early window, it's not 30 days. Some are 60 days, I think is – you know, is an important opportunity for us to
create something that is different experience. I think it's different than the theater, theatrical is tremendously important
to us, and we need to make sure that we protect the strengths of that, but I think that window to get it properly priced,
and I think it's something you will see in the short term. And certainly I think in the first half of this year, you will see
people moving forward with that.
I think the broader electronic distribution is equally important. I think we need to make sure – the most attractive part
of it is we can price our product and – the price experience in a way that gets us fair value and, I mean, obviously I
don't think sort of whatever short-term windows that get us a dollar rental is fair value for our product, and these
electronic distribution platforms enable us to get fair -to put, appropriate pricing, fair pricing on our product and in
various windows. So, I think we should be aggressively, developing these distribution platforms.
RSNs, it's really tough to sort of – you don't know if it's going to last – a) is it going to happen, is it going to last a day?
Is it going to last a month? Is it going to last what-have-you? I don't think it will last forever so you're not making –
there are limits to how much you could really make plans for something that – probably has a realistic outside to it that
isn't that long. Look, basketball is important to us, I think we try to do what we could, whether it means extra college
games or things we could go after. We try to mitigate it, but we're not in these – we hope these strikes don't happen. We
hope parties reach settlements, but I think because we have so little visibility and predictability to the time, you sort of
probably do what you can in the very short term to mitigate but it's tough to really make significant plans given just the

nature of the uncertainty around it.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: And Chase, when you talk about digital rights or the value of digital rights, how do you think
about your current relationship with the content you sold, both TV and movies to Netflix for the streaming platform?
We've heard a lot from other executives talking about the fact that old deals maybe were not done at the proper values?
Is that kind of your thinking, or how do you think about how you're going to deal with Netflix, and how soon can you
renegotiate with them?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, we've been pretty judicious
on what we have done with them. First, our movie product is really old. So, we are not one of the studios that has more
aggressive – I think even our TV products were pretty limited. So, yeah, I think they have grown enough, probably
anybody who deals with them, probably to their credit – to their credit, they did a deal and probably exceeded
everybody's expectations on growth. So, probably very few deals you would end up saying, predicted the type of the
growth they've had. So, they probably made them, good for them.
But in all honesty, our deals – we've been pretty judicious and I think we value our product highly.

And that question comes from the line of James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Great, thank you for taking my question. SKY Italia had a very strong gross and net add trends
in the quarter. Were there any unusual factors helping growth in the quarter other than the prior re-tiering, and how do
you feel about subscriber growth at SKY Italia in calendar '11 without the World Cup?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: First, it wasn't – there was nothing
unusual in the quarter. I think we sort of talked about it in the middle of the calendar year that we had digested in the
prior time a number of events, and I think we got our footing and came out with some packages and made some
adjustments to the fact that we can't buy ad time and media wholesales ad time, and the like, and got our mojo back.
And I think they did a good job. We got the better package. we've got the offering that should be the dominant one
there.
And I think they are doing good things. I expect that momentum to continue. I think the focus right now is really on
growing the business. This is a country still that is not – is still sort of a third penetrated in terms of pay. It has got a lot
of growth left in the market, and we think it's important at this point in time, that sort of says where is the focus, we
have to take share, and we have got to manage all the lines, but I think there's real opportunity, yeah, for us to do that.

stations there's some ups and downs. You look at this quarter in pacings, we didn't have the BCS. We do have the Super
Bowl in the third quarter. I think third quarter we are looking at pacings that are probably low double-digits as pacing.

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thank you. Just listening to the conversation about monetizing content, I'm wondering,
Chase, how does Hulu fit into your vision of monetizing FOX content? You hadn't mentioned them. Just wondering if
you still view Hulu as a mechanism to get fair value?
And then as a second question, we keep hearing from other studios like Warner Brothers and CBS, that the TV
syndication market continues to be a robust market in terms of value. Just wondering if you are seeing that, and then in
your mind what – what are really the true drivers of that improvement in the TV syndication market? Thank you.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: In terms of Hulu. No, for sure,
look Hulu, they have done a great job, and they continue to grow. I think they've launched a subscription dimension to
it. We think that's an important dimension. I think we are believers in dual revenue streams, so it adds a – I think it adds
a dynamic.
It provides opportunities, and I think the digital marketplace is going to continue to evolve, and I think, look, Hulu has
created a fabulous brand. I think they have done a great job creating a great experience. They can obviously speak for
themselves. I'm not going to speak too much about their strategy. I think they have developed an enormous following
and set of fans, and I think they are well-positioned to continue to try to figure out how you take advantage of these
emerging digital marketplaces. But, we like the dual revenue, I think it's important for them and it's built on content so
it's important for us. I think what we're going to try to continue to make sure is we feel our content is being – I will use
the same phrase, properly monetized in all of those digital models, including Hulu.
On the -
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay. Fair enough.

content owners selling in the syndication market? You were talking about strength in that regard?
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Yes, just talking about -
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I guess I talked about Modern
Family. I guess we'd second that, given Modern Family I think, will be the highest first cycle show ever sold into the
marketplace. And I think what's driving it is we have good shows. I think in this – as people get more and more
choices, I think where you get hurt is if you are sort of chopped liver in the middle. And if you've got hits, I think the

value of hits is bigger than ever. If you got the NFL or American Idol or Glee, the ability – an owner of Modern Family
it's not the only show on our network, but when you have those types of shows, they have extraordinary value,
importance, and power, and I think TV continues to prove itself as a sort of – something of importance to consumers
and a value to advertisers second to none. I mean, you look at the ad market today. As I said, on these national – the
broadcast or cable networks, demand from an advertising perspective is incredible.
And I think it shows the power of television and importance to consumers or the power to advertisers, and if you've got
hit shows that stand out in a world of 200 channels – it's value – sort of -
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Let me ask it this way, is that value increasing because of the emergence of new digital
networks and services like over-the-top networks, or in spite of them?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Oh, I mean – look, I think – I
guess you could say, I'm not sure. You could argue both sides of it. I think TV – I sort of go back to the value of a
bundle. I would argue today the TV experience is a much richer one and a much more rewarding one for consumers.
You get choice all the time and an array of things. More ways to access the products, more technologies get put out
there, so I think it's sort of – it is a richer experience, but I think equally, you could end up saying it's, as you get more
choices, the hits just become more unique and more important, but I don't know. You can probably – could argue it
from the left or the right, it's sort of a glass half full, or glass half empty kind of thing.

<Q - Jolanta Masojada>: Thanks very much. Chase, I wondered if you could talk through the economics of The
Daily? What's the total investment? When are you looking for it to achieve breakeven, and what are the implications
for your newspaper strategy more broadly?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Jolanta, I'm sorry. I missed the
last one. What was the last question?
<Q - Jolanta Masojada>: The last part is what are the implications of The Daily launch for your newspaper strategy in
other markets?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Okay. I mean, I guess the last part
first. It's not – I mean, The Daily is not a newspaper product. It's a news product. We're in the news business, just as
FOX News is news and I think – we said it today at the launch of this. You know – it's a news product that's taking
advantage of a new technological platform, the tablet or the iPad, and I don't think you should think about it as sort of a
part of our newspaper business, or as part of our television business.
It's – I think we have great expertise in news across an array of existing platforms, and this is taking advantage of that
expertise in news to create a product for this new digital world. I think we should be doing with that with all of our
brands and our content. I think to me that's the sweet spot for us in digital. It's not sort of – you know – I think there
may be – I'm not going to rule out finding things in the dot-com world. I think for us the digital play is we bring unique
strengths or when we can take our brands and our expertise and our content and figure out how do you develop digital
extensions or digital experiences based on the content brands that we have. And we've got fabulous ones around the
world.
And I think one of the great things about these digital platforms, which will get to the bat, is realistically you can create
them in a whole different – at a pretty modest level of investment and a whole different scale, because you don't have
all the other things that go with it. You don't have – compared to newspapers, you don't have paper and distribution and
returns and all the rest and a lot of the infrastructure that goes with all of these – with all of these businesses.

And that comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Bazinet>: I have a question for Mr. Carey. You talked about retooling your businesses for a digital world.
And it seems like there's a – maybe it's not a new business, but a tweak to the existing industry practice that makes a lot
of sense to me and I would just love to get your reaction. Your affiliate fees are all charged on a per household basis,
which makes it expensive for people that live alone to watch television relative to families. It also sort of exposes you
to piracy if you go down this authentication model where people could sort of share passwords with one another. Why
– why won't – why wouldn't the industry sort of move to an affiliate fee per connected device and sort of make TV
more affordable for singles and extract more money from families with five TVs and three iPads and also, sort of limit
the piracy risk from this authentication model that's emerging?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, I guess two different
questions. I mean, I think on the per device, I mean, I think actually in some degree – I mean, if you go back to my
DIRECTV days. We don't as a channel provider, but you take DIRECTV, I they do have a per device because you need
a set-top box. They charge you $5 or $6 for – and I think the cable guys now that they've moved to digital, it wasn't true
in analog because you just plug it in, and they can call it a box fee or something, but there is an incremental – there is
an increment at the consumer level for whether you have one, two, three or four TVs hooked up.
<Q - Jason Bazinet>: I'm talking more on your Cable Networks business.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I'm not sure there's a lot of upside
in that. I guess I would say for all of us, we have a pretty good business model today, and I'm not – and I'm not sure
sort of trying to figure out how do you move the deck – the chairs around on the deck to get to a better place. you're not
going through a lot of dynamics to – you know to get to – roughly the same place on a different set of business models.
So, I'm not sure what you – I know what you achieve. I don't know that it makes a difference to the consumers since
they're paying, so it's really just between us and distributors. You just sort of can say, I will charge you less this way,
but more this way and if you get to the same place, I guess you went through a lot to get – I'm not sure where since
their business model already contains it.
I think piracy is probably a different – piracy is tremendously important for us. You talk about something like
authentication, and there's no question, I think your early – I think your early generations of – whatever can get some
traction, proper traction, will probably be imperfect at best but I think it's important to start to move and get the habit
and have it – you've got to make it user friendly and easy to sign in and use, and then figure out over time – you close
the holes and you get to better and more honest. I think people honestly – you've got to deal with piracy and likely to
create a good experience and have a fair price and people will pay a fair price.
but – you know – I'm not sure the piracy issue – I don't see that as part of the per – per device because that really is
dependent on the infrastructure to – you know to deliver things and the like. I'm not sure how are you charging would
address the piracy issues, but I think the piracy issue as you move to these multiple platforms, and the like is going to

<Q - James Dix>: Good afternoon, gentlemen, two quick ones. Give that your international cable growth was so
strong, add growth of 27% in the quarter, operating growth, profit growth of 37%, is your expectation that that too can
accelerate in the second half of the year? Is there something that's going to cause that to moderate?
And then just secondly, now that you sit here at the midpoint of the fiscal year, is your expectation for the mix of
operating income for the full year now more weighted to Cable and TV or is there something in the seasonality for the
second half that – that's left kind of your expectation for that mix relatively unchanged versus when you originally gave
your guidance? Thanks.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I think on the international
channels, it was strong in the first half and I'd probably say we expect it to sort of sustain largely similar strength
through the through the second half. It's been strong enough. I think at this point, we are pretty happy to just keep
rolling along like it's rolling.

<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We're building a product, but
after it's up and running it's 500,000 a week, as Mr. Murdoch pointed out today.

<Q - Staci Kramer>: So then you expect it to run 30 million for the first year or 30 million-plus -
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: 30 million for the first fiscal
year.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Fiscal.
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Fiscal year.
<Q - Staci Kramer>: Okay.
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And that obviously doesn't –
that's cost. It's not revenues. Obviously, to the extent we have revenue -
<Q - Staci Kramer>: Right. But when you come back at it and look at whether you can make a profit on it, that 30
million will factor in, right?
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, the 500,000 a week is the
total cost of -
<Q - Staci Kramer>: Okay. I don't mean to sound dense about it. There's been a lot of numbers going around today
and a lot of people interpreting them in different ways so I appreciate your clearing that up.
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Does that make sense now?
<Q - Staci Kramer>: I think it does. Also there was some suggestion today by Mr. Murdoch on FOX Business News
Network that Apple might be willing to renegotiate the 30% split after the first year. Is that something you can address
further?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I can't comment on private
conversations.
<Q - Staci Kramer>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Stelter with The New York Times.
<Q - Brian Stelter>: Thank you, all. Is FOX considering withdrawing or reducing its amount of content on Hulu and
can you reiterate your point of view towards Hulu? Is it evolving?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah, I think I said before, I think
Hulu is continuing to evolve obviously in some ways the launch of Hulu Plus is an evolution to add a new dimension to
Hulu. And right now we are pretty much dealing with Hulu the same way we historically have.
<Q - Brian Stelter>: But are you considering reducing the amount of content?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: But with a digital platform you
have to continue to evolve.
<Q - Brian Stelter>: So you may reduce the amount of content on it?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: No, I said we will continue to do
what we – we are going to continue to deal with Hulu from a content perspective, consistent with the way we have.
<Q - Brian Stelter>: Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Robert Andrews, paidContent. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Andrews>: Hi, thanks. So, back to Myspace, you mentioned that that company's interest may be best
served with another owner. Since the company is currently under your stewardship, I wondered if you might care to
comment on what kind of company might best serve Myspace's interests and visa-versa, what value Myspace could
provide to a potential bidder?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I'm not sure I got all of that, but –
but let me try to answer it by telling you – yeah, I'm not – look, there's been a lot of interest because there's been some
indication we are – we are pursuing this path and we are going to consider all options that can range – it's not just a
sale, but it could be – a sale, it could be an investor coming into it, it could be us staying in with a restructured
ownership with management. We're just thinking fresh – we think a fresh perspective would give them flexibility and
opportunity to really – get a – a new – new life consistent with the re-launch of the product and the – and the
right-sizing of the costs. the interest to-date has ranged from A to Z from industry players, financial players to you
know – foreign to domestic and that's without really being out there. It's sort of incoming. We're not soliciting anything
at this point, but we think we'll look at all of those. I'm not going to speculate on value. We think it is – we think it's a
business that is – has got a unique level of reach, and – and while it's in a restructuring place has proven has put forth a
path that we think has a real future to it, and that we think has an opportunity to really be something special, but we
think we ought to put it in the right place to really maximize that opportunity. I think management – the senior
management there is excited I mean, obviously it's been a lot of challenges for them, but I think really believe that they
can do something special.
But I think there's the interest sort of ranges from A to Z.
<Q - Robert Andrews>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Edgecliffe, Financial Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson>: Thank you. Chase, on SKY, can you tell us, are you still submitted to that SKY
deal after the political to-ing and fro-ing in London? And has SKY's recent strong performance changed your view on
your initial 700 pence a share valuation at all?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: We believe and we continue to
believe we made a full and fair offer and we are going to approach this in a disciplined manner. Our focus is on the
regulatory process and we are trying to move forward with that. That's probably really all I've got on it at this point.
<Q - Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson>: Thank you.
Operator
And the final question we have in queue comes from the line of Georg Szalai with Hollywood Reporter. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Georg Szalai>: Thank you. Chase, I was just wondering if you could give us some color on the expected timing
on the Myspace decision and on the premium VOD movie launch? Is that both something that we should expect by
mid-year or can you give us some color there?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President, and Chief Operating Officer>: I think on Myspace we are
actively engaged in pursuing those strategic options now. And, I think as I said, I think the – the early window I think is
something you will see in the first half of the year.
