Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, John. Today we're pleased to report strong first quarter results as we delivered higher than expected sales
growth of 17.4% and higher than expected ongoing earnings per share of $0.91. This was above our previous guidance
range of $0.88 to $0.90 and reflects growth of 12.3%.
As you may have noticed in our earnings release this morning, in addition to providing the same division and product
level disclosure as in the past, you'll also see that we're presenting our businesses in three categories based on their
underlying attributes. Durable Growth Businesses include our branded generics business called Established
Pharmaceuticals, as well as Nutritionals, Core Diagnostics, and Diabetes Care. These businesses are less dependent on
significant R&D investment, have minimal patent risk, and operate in generally stable markets. In the quarter, Durable
Growth sales were up more than 24% globally including the contributions from the Solvay Pharmaceuticals and
Piramal Healthcare acquisitions.
Our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business primarily includes patented pharmaceuticals around the world, as well as an
evolving pipeline to drive growth longer term. Global Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased nearly 12% in the
quarter.
And our Innovation-Driven Device Businesses include Vascular, Molecular Diagnostics, and Vision Care. These
businesses require a moderate level of R&D investment with resulting pipeline products generating significant revenue
and profit contribution. Global sales of Innovation-Driven Devices increased more than 10%.
John and Larry will walk through the businesses underlying these categories in more detail, but I wanted to touch on
our presentation of the businesses since it's new this quarter. Also new in our release is the disclosure of our
Established Pharmaceuticals division, as well as emerging market sales by business which is in the Q&A section of the
news release. Given our strategic efforts to build these areas of our company, we're providing this additional
information to give investors a greater appreciation of the opportunities that exist in branded generics and in emerging
markets across our businesses.
Our emerging market sales in the quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 38% including the impact of acquisitions.
Adjusted for acquisitions, emerging market sales growth still exceeded 20%, underscoring the importance of these
markets to Abbott's overall growth profile.
Turning back to our performance in the quarter, sales growth was 17.4% including a favorable 1.3% impact from
exchange rates as the U.S. dollar weakened as the quarter progressed. Sales growth in the quarter included the
contribution from the Solvay acquisition which closed in the first quarter of 2010 and the Piramal acquisition which
closed in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and exchange, organic sales growth in the
quarter exceeded 6%, in line with our guidance for the full year. I'd note that we have now lapped the impact of the
Solvay acquisition.
The adjusted gross margin ratio of 58.5% increased 110 basis points from the prior year, up 57.4% due to improved
product mix. The favorable comparison to prior year was partially offset by additional rebates under U.S. healthcare
reform, a carryover effect of 2010 pharmaceutical pricing actions by European governments, and an unfavorable
impact from foreign exchange rates on the ratio. The movement in foreign exchange rates in the quarter benefited our
top line but actually negatively impacted the gross margin ratio by approximately 120 basis points compared to our
forecast in January. Excluding this impact, the gross margin ratio was in line with our previous forecast of a ratio
approaching 60%.

Those of you who followed our results in recent years are aware that as exchange rates have fluctuated significantly, a
rapid weakening of the dollar contributes to our top line immediately but puts some pressure on the gross margin ratio
in the quarter the rates move.
The ongoing tax rate was 15.7%, in line with our previous forecast for the quarter.
Now let's turn to our outlook for 2011. Today we're confirming our full-year 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance
of $4.54 to $4.64. We're also issuing second quarter ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.10 to $1.12. The
midpoint of this EPS range represents approximately 10% growth over the prior year, in line with the guidance we
provided in January. We forecast specified items of $0.13 in the second quarter reflecting integration costs from past
acquisitions and costs of previous restructuring actions. We're forecasting high single-digit sales growth in the second
quarter and a favorable impact from exchange on sales of approximately 2.5%.
We're forecasting R&D of around 9.5 % of sales and SG&A at approximately 28% of sales. This reflects SG&A
leverage compared to 2010 despite our continued investment in emerging markets infrastructure across the businesses
and the negative impact of the pharma tax associated with U.S. healthcare reform which as you'll recall is charged to
SG&A expense.
Regarding our tax rate for the remainder of the year, companies with operations in Puerto Rico now have clarity around
the required treatment for the excise tax that the Puerto Rican government established effective January 1 of this year.
While there is no significant bottom line impact from this tax on Abbott, payment of the tax will impact certain P&L
ratios, namely our gross margin ratio and tax rate starting in the second quarter. Because the tax is an excise tax, the
gross amount payable will be recorded as an increase in product cost, reducing our full-year gross margin ratio by
approximately 30 basis points. The U.S. tax credit, however, will be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense
effectively reducing our income tax rate. We now project a tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2011. We expect the
rate to vary somewhat across the remaining quarters of 2011, with the second quarter at approximately 15% to 15.5%.
Again, the net bottom line impact of the excise tax is not significant for us due to the fact that it's creditable for U.S.
income tax purposes.
Regarding gross margin for the second quarter, we're forecasting adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5%
reflecting underlying favorable product mix and efficiency initiatives offset by the impact of U.S. healthcare reform,
the carryover effects of 2010 European pricing measures, the Puerto Rican excise tax, as well as the impact of
exchange on the ratio.
So in summary we're off to a great start in 2011 with strong performance across our businesses and delivering more
than 12% ongoing EPS growth. This type of performance is a result of our broad-based strategy and competitive
strengths. We're in many different, innovative healthcare fields and we're constantly evolving and shaping our product
portfolio with a mix of durable growth prospects and strong cash generating businesses that will continue to sustain us
longer-term. We've built Abbott to continue to deliver sustainable top-tier financial performance and our outlook for
double-digit ongoing EPS growth in 2011 continues Abbott's track record as a leader among our healthcare peers.
With that, I'll turn it over to John for the business operating highlights.
John B. Thomas
Thanks, Tom. As Tom mentioned, we made some additions to our earnings news release and are presenting sales from
our three key business categories in a new way. These changes are supplemental to the information we have always
provided and are intended to help shareholders understand the strategic mix of our diversified model as well as the
significant growth opportunity in emerging markets, so today Larry and I will walk you through these three new
categories. I'll start with our Durable Growth and Innovation-Driven Device businesses, and then Larry will give you
an overview of our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business as well as our pharmaceutical pipeline. So let me start with
our Durable Growth businesses.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio, we reported global
sales of approximately $1.3 billion, including the contribution from Solvay and Piramal Healthcare Solutions. The
Solvay integration and Piramal transition activities are continuing along and we're pleased with their progress and
performance. Our large portfolio of established pharmaceuticals consists of hundreds of branded generic products
spanning primary care therapeutic categories. The depth of our portfolio and the diversity of our geographic footprint
helped us drive durable sustainable performance. We continue to expect approximately $5 billion in Established
Pharmaceutical sales this year in 2011.
In our worldwide Nutritionals business, global sales increased 7.8% driven by strong double-digit growth
internationally. In the United States, sales were down 1% in the quarter, and as we mentioned on the fourth quarter call,
we expected a difficult comparison in our U.S. Nutritionals business during the first half of this year as we worked to
recapture share in our infant formula business. Our plan to recover our Similac business is on track. We have
successfully maintained our No. 1 hospital share position, and this continues to help us drive consumption at the retail
level. We have increased our share since the fourth quarter and anticipate better sales growth in particular as we head
into the second half of this year. We also saw strong growth this quarter in our PediaSure business driven by strong
execution, share gains and the launch of our new PediaSure SideKicks product line.
Similarly, in our U.S. adult nutritional business, as the market leader we continued to pioneer nutritional advancements
with our Ensure brand. Our new Ensure Muscle Health product line features a proprietary ingredient, Revigor and
protein to help rebuild muscle and strength naturally lost with age. There are approximately 140 million Americans
currently over the age of 40, and I will be one of them, which represents a significant opportunity for our Ensure
product line. Outside of the U.S., sales increased nearly 16%. This was driven by continued strong growth in emerging
markets, which comprises the majority of our international nutritional sales.
This quarter our emerging market sales for the nutritional business were nearly $600 million, and that's up more than
18%. This was driven by impressive performance in Asian and Latin-American markets where we continue to see
strong underlying market growth and increased penetration as we launch a cadence of new products.
For the full year 2011, we're forecasting more than $2 billion in emerging market nutritional sales, which we expect to
double over the next five years. So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our global Nutritions business, we expect
worldwide sales growth in the high single digits.
In the U.S., as we stated previously, we continue to expect U.S. sales to be down mid-single digits due to the difficult
comparisons in our infant nutritionals business from last year. Conversely, in our international nutritionals business, we
expect continued double-digit growth in the second quarter.
In our global diabetes business, worldwide sales increased 10% this quarter, with U.S. sales up approximately 5%.
International sales increased 14% driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. We continue to grow our retail
prescription share through expanded consumer outreach and patient education. We also continue to improve our
operating margin in this business through cost reductions and a focus on more favorable customer mix. So looking
ahead to the second quarter in our global diabetes business, we expect low to mid-single digit sales growth.
In our core laboratory diagnostics business which includes immunoassay and hematology, global sales in the first
quarter were up nearly 7%. Instrument placements in emerging markets such as China continue to help drive
international sales growth.
In our U.S. business, we continue to expand our menu of assays and recently submitted to the agency a new
ARCHITECT assay to measure Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency impacts as many as one-third of Americans and can
impair calcium absorption, risking the health of bones and muscles. In the second quarter in our core laboratory
diagnostics business, we expect low to mid-single digit sales growth.
In our point of care diagnostics in the first quarter, sales increased 8%. We recently received FDA clearance for a new
wireless version of the i-STAT Point of Care testing system. This new system allows caregivers to wirelessly download
i-STAT diagnostic test results directly to a patient's electronic medical record without leaving the bedside. Faster access
to test results may lead to better care overall. And so for the second quarter in point of care diagnostics, we expect

double-digit growth.
So let me turn now to our Innovation-Driven Device businesses. Let me start with Molecular Diagnostics where global
sales in the first quarter were up 13% driven by international sales growth of more than 25%.
We continue to gain share worldwide as we expand the m2000 menu. In Europe, we launched three new infectious
disease assays for the platform. Our new qualitative HIV-1 assay expands the way caregivers can collect and test
patient samples. Our new CMV assay will help physicians monitor for a virus common in transplant recipients. And
our new HBV sequencing test identifies genomic sequences of the Hepatitis B virus to help better monitor and treat
HBV.
Also in the quarter in our Ibis business, we introduced a non-clinical assay on the PLEX-ID system that's designed to
detect numerous pathogens that can pose serious health threats to humans – human health, food, water and other
resources. Our PLEX-ID system is changing the way viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms are identified in
research laboratories by not requiring technicians to predict the testing outcome. PLEX-ID technology has been
deployed in 20 sites around the U.S., including the CDC and the FDA. So in the second quarter in molecular
diagnostics, we're expecting again double-digit growth.
In our Vision Care business, worldwide sales were approximately $270 million in the first quarter. Globally we
continued to gain share in our cataract business with our Tecnis Multifocal and Monofocal IOLs. We also continue to
grow share in our corneal business with our new RevitaLens contact lens solution. As we look ahead to the second
quarter in Vision Care, we expect mid to high single-digit sales growth.
Let me turn now to our vascular business where sales in the first quarter increased 13%. International vascular sales,
which is more than half of our total vascular business, increased nearly 37% in the quarter and our sales in emerging
markets increased 45%. International markets comprised two-thirds of the global drug eluting stent market. And in
emerging markets procedure volume is growing at a mid-teens rate. Abbott is particularly well positioned
internationally and has seen impressive performance with both XIENCE and our next generation XIENCE PRIME
drug eluting stent. We have 35% share of the international DES market currently based on our strong positions in
Japan, Southeast Asia, as well as Europe with nearly 20% of our total sales represented by emerging markets. Our
global DES franchise sales in the first quarter were approximately $480 million.
In the U.S., we look forward to launching our XIENCE 2.25 small vessel stent mid-year this year. We're currently not
participating in the small vessel market segment of the DES market, and the launch of XIENCE 2.25 will allow us to
drive additional XIENCE share. And in addition in the U.S., I'm also pleased to report today that we have submitted
our next generation XIENCE PRIME DES for U.S. FDA approval.
Also in the first quarter, we launched our new TREK and MINI-TREK balloon catheters in both the U.S. and Japan.
We expect these new products to drive share growth for Abbott in the balloon segment of the market.
In our vascular pipeline, we have a number of new technologies in development. Most recently at the American
College of Cardiology, or ACC, Conference in New Orleans, we presented data on both our MitraClip and ABSORB
devices.
MitraClip is under U.S. FDA review for the treatment of significant mitral regurgitation which is a common and
debilitating structural heart defect. Today patients with significant MR are either treated with medication, relieving
symptoms but not stopping disease progression, or undergo arrested open heart surgery. While surgery is a good option
for many patients, there is still a significant patient population considered at high risk for surgery. Abbott's MitraClip is
in development as another option to reduce mitral regurgitation.
At ACC, we present two-year data from our MitraClip pivotal trial EVEREST II. MitraClip demonstrated superior
safety to surgery and durable clinical benefits that are similar to surgery at two years. We also continued to prepare for
a FDA panel review for MitraClip mid-year this year.
Also at ACC, Abbott presented one-year clinical data for our ABSORB biorebsorbable vascular scaffold, or BVS.
These data demonstrated low major adverse cardiac events [MACE], no blood clots, and low late loss. ABSORB is the

first BVS to treat coronary artery disease and is designed to slowly metabolize and eventually be absorbed by the body
after providing support to the vessel during the healing process.
Data on our market leading XIENCE V drug eluding stent were also presented at ACC which demonstrated predictably
low stent thrombosis rates and consistently impressive efficacy in a pooled analysis of 7,000 patients, many of whom
had complex disease. In fact, XIENCE has now been studied in 30,000 patients in nearly 100 trials against six different
stents and continues to perform exceptionally well
So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our global vascular business, we expect sales of approximately $830
million. We're on track with our previous full-year expectations, and growth in the second half of the year is driven by
continued international growth, particularly in emerging markets, as well as our XIENCE 2.25 launch in the U.S.
So with that, I will turn the call over now to Larry and he'll give you a review of our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals
business. Larry?
Larry Peepo
Thanks, John. As a reminder, we recently globalized our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business creating one division to
allow for streamlined commercial efforts and coordination between functions. Worldwide sales in this division
increased more than 11%, driven by strong growth of nearly 13% in the U.S. and more than 10% internationally. Sales
included the contribution from the Solvay acquisition which closed last February.
In Immunology, global HUMIRA sales increased nearly 18%. Performance was driven by international sales growth of
nearly 19% and U.S. sales growth of more than 16%, consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the
quarter.
Demand for HUMIRA continues to outpace the global market, and new competitive entrants are tracking in line with
our expectations for these products. Internationally, double-digit market growth continues in the major European
countries where HUMIRA holds the number one share position and HUMIRA growth in the U.S. continues to outpace
the market.
We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA, including the study of new indications and other product
enhancements. Our regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis are currently under review, and we're evaluating other
incremental indications currently in mid- to late-stage development. Additionally, in the coming weeks, we plan to
submit regulatory applications for a new 29-gauge needle for the HUMIRA pen and syringe. When approved, the
HUMIRA needle will be the thinnest in the category.
HUMIRA clinical data continue to compare favorably versus existing agents or potential new competitors. Our
growing body of indications and comprehensive label is among the most extensive in the class. Recently we received
approval in Europe to expand our product information for psoriasis making HUMIRA the only biologic in the E.U.
with long-term plaque psoriasis data out to three years included in its label. Based on an outstanding clinical profile
across our full range of indications and more than 13 years of clinical experience, we are well positioned for continued
success in this market. HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our reported sales growth
outlook for the product in 2011.
Moving on to our Lipid franchise, where sales of Niaspan were $226 million, up more than 10% in the quarter,
prescription growth significantly outpaced the growth of the overall Lipid market. Our focus on high risk patients and
the positive data showing Niaspan's benefit in this population continues to drive growth. U.S. sales of
TriCor/TRILIPIX increased nearly 4%. Global sales of AndroGel and CREON were $195 million and $133 million
respectively in the quarter.
AndroGel holds the number one share position in the U.S. testosterone replacement market, an attractive category
where growth is being driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone. A new lower-volume
formulation of AndroGel is currently under U.S. regulatory review and we expect approval during the second quarter.

When approved, the new formulation will provide patients a more convenient application option, delivering rapid and
sustained improvements in testosterone levels with less gel than the existing formulation.
CREON also maintains a leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market, and over the past year we have captured
significant market share in the U.S. We continue to garner the vast majority of new prescription starts in this category.
Moving on to Lupron and Synthroid, U.S. sales of Lupron in the quarter were up more than 10%. We expect
approximately $750 million in global Lupron sales in 2011. And U.S. sales of Synthroid remained strong at more than
$115 million in the quarter. We expect more than $450 million in U.S. Synthroid sales in 2011.
So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our global proprietary pharmaceuticals business, we expect high
single-digit reported sales growth, including high single-digit growth in the U.S. and high single to low double-digit
growth internationally.
Moving on to our proprietary pharmaceuticals pipeline where we have a number of unique compounds in development
in areas of significant medical opportunity. Chronic kidney disease [CKD], or the loss of kidney function, is on the rise,
driven by higher rates of diabetes, obesity and an aging population. We're leveraging our decades of experience in renal
disease to address this highly prevalent condition. Current treatments only modestly slow the progression of CKD, and
many patients ultimately progress to dialysis and end-stage disease. Bardoxalone data strongly suggests it may slow
disease progression and may actually help reverse the progression of the disease, which no other treatment has
demonstrated. We expect to present additional data from the Phase IIb study, including 52-week results, at a medical
meeting in the second quarter and we're on track to initiate the global Phase III clinical program with our partner
company in the coming weeks.
Also in development for the treatment of kidney disease is atrasentan. Phase II data were recently published in the
Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, and we plan to initiate a Phase IIb study in patients with diabetic
kidney disease in the second half of this year.
We've also made significant progress with our internal Hepatitis C program. The HCV treatment landscape is expected
to change rapidly over the next several years and will evolve considerably even after the newest therapies come to
market. Over the past year our program has moved quickly, and we believe we're in a position to become a significant
player. We recently presented Phase II results for our protease inhibitor, which demonstrated that 92% of patients
taking ABT-450 in combination with standard of care achieved complete early response after 12 weeks of treatment.
ABT-450 has a number of strong attributes including potentially best in class antiviral activity, good tolerability and
once daily dosing.
We also recently presented Phase II data on our two polymerase inhibitors showing both compounds were well
tolerated and had antiviral activity significantly greater than standard of care alone. We believe both compounds have
the potential to be complementary assets in an HCV combination treatment regimen. And we recently began a Phase II
study of our NS5A inhibitor. Our HCV program will continue to progress throughout the year as we have a number of
combination trials underway including studies with and without Interferon.
In neuroscience, we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's,
schizophrenia, pain and MS. A Phase III study of daclizumab, a next generation biologic being evaluated in MS is
currently underway. Abbott and our partner company expect to present data from the Phase II SELECT study during
the second half of this year.
We're also continuing Phase III development of Duodopa for advanced Parkinson's disease. Duodopa is already on the
market in most European countries where adoption is continuing to grow.
In immunology we're leveraging our experience with HUMIRA to identify novel approaches to improved therapeutic
outcomes for patients with autoimmune diseases. We continue our work on new HUMIRA indications. In addition to
ulcerative colitis, we have additional indications in Phase II or Phase III studies including uveitis.
Our pipeline also includes early development work in oral DMARD therapies and biologics and our proprietary
technology brings the capability of uniting two antibodies in a single target. We expect our first combination biologic

to move into Phase I clinical trials by year end.
Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a multitude of symptoms including pain and infertility. Our
partnered compound elagolix has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding the adverse effects
sometimes associated with current treatments. Planning for the Phase III clinical program for endometriosis is ongoing.
We also continue to make good progress in Oncology. Our pipeline includes a number of new molecular entities for
more than a dozen different cancer types.
Elotuzumab has demonstrated very good response rates in multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer in
the U.S. We recently initiated the Phase III program with our partner company.
Our multi-targeted kinase inhibitor seeks to cut-off the blood supply to a tumor to stop the progression of cancer. A
Phase III study of the compound in liver cancer is underway, and it's also being evaluated in Phase II studies for
additional cancer types.
And our PARP-inhibitor which may enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies is being studied in mid-stage trials
for a variety of cancer types.
We have also continued to make progress in our early-stage pipeline, advancing a number of compounds into human
studies including an S1P1 oral compound with potential in RA and MS, a novel EGFR compound for cancer, and we
expect to begin a Phase I study this month for a next generation, highly selective Bcl-2 compound.
So in summary, this quarter Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of more than
12%, exceeding our previous outlook. This was driven by double-digit sales growth in each of our three major business
categories as well as 38% growth in emerging markets. And we confirmed our ongoing EPS outlook for the full year,
reflecting double-digit growth over 2010 at the midpoint of the range.
And with that, Tom, John and I will be glad to take your questions. Operator?
Q&A

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Tom, I was hoping we could start with a strategic question. I think on the fourth quarter
call, post fourth quarter call, there was probably some discussion about Miles' answer to a question about strategic
options for different assets within the business, and I was wondering if we can get your perspective on the current
portfolio at Abbott. There's obviously been a lot of evolution of Abbott's portfolio over the last ten-plus years and we
wanted to get your view of the current mix of assets and the management's and board's willingness to rethink some of
those assets in order to create shareholder value.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Mike, this is Tom. I think this quarter is a good demonstration of really the quality of all
our businesses. Really, as you go down every one, and you look at the revenue performance and what it translated to in
overall EPS growth of over 12%, I think you can see that the portfolio is a good one. It's performing well, and it's very
complementary to our overall financial objectives.
We did talk a little bit about this on the fourth quarter, and as we look at these businesses and again looking at the
performance you see, you know, we're very happy with the outlook and potential for these businesses to contribute to
our objectives longer term, that said, we have high expectations. We have high standards for all the businesses where
they're performing against now we believe, but as our history as shown, we are willing to take actions as appropriate to

enhance shareholder value to put these businesses in the place where they're going to operate and flourish. But right
now I'd say that the portfolio is very strong.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. That's helpful. You guys guide to math I think that suggested organic growth was
just over 6% this quarter. I think our numbers were close to that, maybe a tad lower. Your guidance for the year, Tom,
what does that imply for organic growth over the balance of 2011?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, it's similar to what we said on the fourth quarter call. We had high single-digit
overall sales growth forecasted at that point in time. We had around 3% impact of acquisitions. So north of 6% organic
growth, and we delivered that. We did deliver over that this quarter, and we would expect a pretty consistent
performance against that throughout the year.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Okay. And then last question and then I'll let some others jump in here. But you gave a
good overview – Larry did there – on some of the pharmaceutical pipeline products. Can you just give us your
estimation of where you are in competitiveness with your Hep C platform? You moved I know the combination
products into a clinical trial recently, and obviously that space has gotten more crowded. There's been significant
advancements in just the last few months. Can you just spend another minute on your program?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Yeah, yeah. This is Larry. We certainly do believe that we have made some very nice progress
here very quickly, and believe that we have a strong combination program under development here with multiple
mechanisms of action. And as I said in my remarks, we're certainly looking at those in interferon-free ways as well, you
know, with a combination of polymerase, protease, and S5A. You know, we'll see where we go. We're also trying to
take a look at shortening up duration of therapy, course of therapy, etcetera. And, again, feel like we have made some
great steps here recently.
Certainly there's going to be some products launched here near-term, but as we look at what they represent to the
treatment community, we certainly don't believe that the uptake of those is going to rapidly de-warehouse the HCV
space, and I think the treating clinicians have a very good understanding of what's in the pipelines including ours that
could provide some significant benefits to patients down the road.
So as we look at it, I think these new agents are going to get some of the HCV patients who are pretty far along in the
course of their disease, but I do believe that the physicians will be waiting for these other follow-on therapies including
the combination treatments. So we feel great about where we're at right now.
<Q - Michael N. Weinstein>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Thanks, Mike.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Larry, HUMIRA is off to a better start this year than obviously we expected, and it sounds like
a lot of that strength is coming from emerging markets. But there was some competitor disruption, and I think it's
probably too early in the year to change your outlook for HUMIRA, but can you just sort of talk about the underlying
factors and how sustainable you think those are throughout the balance of the year?
<A - Larry Peepo>: You mentioned the ex-U.S. piece, and certainly the markets, as I said in my remarks, continue to
grow strong double digits, so the international business is off to a great start.
I think what probably is working even better than we thought initially this year is the U.S. market. We have seen scripts
now growing in kind of the high single digits, approaching 10% for us. Our team has done some very nice things early

in the year from a competitive positioning and some real proactive work that they did to mitigate a little bit of that
January effect that we have seen in the past. So they have done a great job there, and we have seen great growth in the
U.S. And as we look at the rest of the year, maybe we have seen even a little bit of economic benefit there too as the
economy has stabilized and maybe moved forward a little bit for us. But we would expect those trends to continue and
like I said, we're well on track with HUMIRA to achieve our outlook for 2012 – or '11, sorry.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Just maybe two more quick questions. I guess, Larry, just thinking about competitor data that
has sort of come out and kind of pre-EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] here, looking at different dosing
for the JAK-inhibitor class, we obviously saw in the lower dose one of your competitors not showing significant
radiographic change. I guess as you think about the outlook and sustainability of HUMIRA, how should we kind of
think about that data in terms of resilience of the franchise?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Well, clearly radiographic progression is very important. It's important not only to the patient but
also to the treating physician. And you mention the 5-milligram dose failing that primary endpoint. That's very
important. If you look at the HUMIRA data, that was a six-month readout. If you look at HUMIRA at six months or 24
weeks, we did show statistically significant radiographic inhibition at 52 weeks, and we have maintained that kind of
benefit out to eight years now in our data sets. So I think at the end of the day for the rheumatologist, that is paramount
to their view of products. And we'll have to see where they go from here. But for us, that data is very strong in our label
and something that we discuss with physicians all the time.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Just maybe one last question, and I'll jump back in queue. I think post the American College
meeting, a lot of investors are trying to figure out what are the implications for competitive stent launches in the U.S.
marketplace. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of European trends with Element – sorry,
with XIENCE and PRIME versus Element in the European market and what we should expect as you see those
products come to the U.S. market.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Yeah, so, David this is John. We – as I mentioned in my remarks, our data at ACC was
supplemental to the data we have shown on XIENCE in the past, good strong data on both the base platform and also
ABSORB. But when we look at the rest of the world, you know, we probably – there's probably a lack of attention paid
to the ex-U.S. markets versus the U.S., and the visibility there for us is good where about two-thirds of that overall
worldwide market is outside the U.S., and we have done quite well there.
XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME account for more than 30% of share in Europe, and that's the leadership position. And
at the same time, we have seen that the competitor product you mention has actually lost considerable amount of share
while we have gained share in Europe on that. And of course we have done extremely well in Japan where we have
approximately 50% share and the market has been quite receptive. And then of course there's emerging markets like
China that we mentioned in our remarks as well. So it's a strong market. We're very pleased with the performance there.
As I mentioned in the comments as well, we have now announced that we have filed PRIME in the U.S., so we're very
comfortable with our timeline there of getting into the U.S. market by mid-2012 or sooner. And then we have the other
products that we mentioned too that will help us in those areas where we don't have a position to date, like the small
vessels and of course PRIME with the long lesions. So that's the stent piece of it, and of course there's other
components of it like TREK and then down the road MitraClip. So we feel pretty good about where we're at.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Thank you very much.
<A - John B. Thomas>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.

was for $830 million, which is below 1Q levels. I'm wondering is that conservative? Is that trying to factor in Japan?
And then my second question has to do with Japan. Just overall for the organization, is there much of an impact? And
then I'll follow-up with one other question. Thanks.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Yeah, well, there's a couple dynamics in play there. Probably in the mix is lower PROMUS
sales, some overall lower U.S. DES sales as we're holding share. But as you know, the market has taken some price,
and we're seeing that as well. When we do launch the 2.25 NANO in the second half of the year, we think that will help
offset. And of course in that business, and Tom can talk to this more than I can, is the bottom line impact of
improvements in margin profile for that business, which is key to the overall profitability story.
So net-net for the full year, we feel pretty good overall, and it gets back to what I just mentioned in terms of two-thirds
of the market being outside the U.S. where we are seeing strong performance of XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Glenn, I'll take the question on Japan. You know, first of all clearly our thoughts are with
the people there as they recover from this tragedy. Our situation is all of our employees are safe. We have been aiding
as much as we can to help there. The Abbott Fund contributed $3 million right upfront to the relief effort. So, you
know, we're doing everything we can to help. We have looked at the business impact of this, and there will be some
economic disruption across the businesses, but we've factored that into our forecast, and it's not material really to our
outlook.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. Let me have just one quick follow-up. At the end of this month, you're going to stop
supplying J&J with RapidExchange catheters for the Cypher system. Do you know how much supply they have of your
RapidExchange catheters? I'm just trying to figure out how the market changes over the next couple of quarters if
Cypher is no longer available on a RapidExchange catheter. Thanks.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Yeah, I wouldn't be able to comment on J&J's position. You might be better served asking
them. You're correct that that agreement has come to a conclusion. And that's about all we can really say, and I can't
comment on their business.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Good morning, Tom. Good morning, everybody.
<A>: Hi, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Let me turn to the pharma pipeline. Larry, very carefully in your press release highlights
the many projects underway. You have a couple in Phase III the daclizumab and elotuzumab in neurooncology. It
would be really helpful if from your perspective, Tom, you could tell us whether it's these two Phase IIIs or some of the
Phase IIs, which should we be focused on as important – the most important perhaps one or two incremental growth
drivers over the next one, two, three, four years, whatever the right timeframe should be? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, Rick, we have a number. Pretty much the products Larry went through are our later
phase programs. You know, the HCV space is moving rapidly. That is certainly one that you should watch. You know,
developments happen there with quite rapid change. Daclizumab is a program in Phase III. That's one that we're very,
very excited about given the hopefully very positive safety and efficacy profile of the product. Elotuzumab again in
Phase III and our partner company is also extremely excited about the prospects for those – for that product. So I think
those are – and I guess the other big one is bardoxolone.

Those are the four that are in the later stages that in the timeframe you mentioned are going to start, you know,
contributing nicely to our growth. And really everything we have seen from a clinical perspective and while those are
progressing according to plan, I'd have to throw one more in there. Elagolix is a program that will be moving into Phase
III we believe in the not-too-distant future, and it's another later stage program. It's hard to discern because they're all in
similar phase of development and will be hitting in similar time frames, so all five of those are products to watch.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Okay. So there's no one that stands out?
<A - John B. Thomas>: I mean, they're all – every one of these licensing opportunities we've looked at, you know, are
significant potential contributors if the clinical profile turns out to be what we suspect and hope when we entered the
deals, and they're all on track with our expectations and often – in many cases a year into our working with the
companies and our experience with the programs.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Great. Turning back to gross margin, Tom, you highlighted some of the pressures that
dragged your gross margin about healthcare reform rebates and the E.U. pricing and FX. And that it seems like you
think we're going to see a hundred basis point or so improvement sequentially in the second quarter. Can you just help
me understand so all the drags basically go away, and so the natural benefits of mix and – kick in?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Sure. First of all, things like U.S. healthcare reform, European pricing, those types of
things that are truly significant headwinds this year, we laid that all out on our fourth quarter call and that was all in our
planning and expectations. And despite some very good underlying trends in product mix and cost reduction efforts in
the businesses, you know, even in the fourth quarter as we were forecasting 2011, we believed we would see modest
gross margin improvement but kind of a transitional year while we got those kind of one-time pricing impacts behind
us.
Our first quarter typically just from a product mix point of view is a little softer than other quarters. That's part of as the
mix improves going into the second quarter and the rest of the year, that's going to be the big driver. The one thing that
has changed since we talked last January is just a very rapid weakening of the dollar. And again in our company, there's
a lag between the sales benefit of a weaker dollar and the margin benefits, which are going to come later in the year. So
that is really the one thing that has changed. And you're right: Going forward, it's better product mix, growth of the
higher margin products, that is going to continue to boost that gross margin as we move into the second quarter.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: And you're still on track for the $0.10 of accretion from Solvay this year and $0.12 next
year? That's still the right numbers?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, we're very much on track, and we're probably doing somewhat better than that.
<Q - Rick A. Wise CFA>: Thank you very much.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Rick.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Thanks, Rick.

trying to understand – can you hear me okay?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, I can. I said hi, Jami. You didn't say hello.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: I can't help myself. I'm just trying to understand why you have gone to the great lengths to
re-characterize your major businesses, apart from providing greater transparency into established pharmaceuticals, i.e.,
emerging markets. I'm just wondering what it says about the strategic importance of these three business units. And I
do think it's interesting...

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I think it's a good question.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: I think it's interesting that you're reporting prescription – rather emerging or what do you call it?
Emerging pharmaceuticals as part of Durable Businesses, not Prescription Pharmaceuticals and I'm just going to throw
this out there, but I'm just wondering if you're preparing investors for an eventual sort of spin or shakeup or whatever
you might call it of one of those three businesses? And it's the business that is now smaller that I would think would be
a major candidate. But maybe if you could talk to that, that would be great.
And then just a follow-up, a nitty-gritty one, on SG&A your guidance going into the year was a little above 27% of
sales for SG&A. Now assume that's more like 28% just because of where currencies are falling? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: No, let's take the SG&A comment first. Our forecast for full-year SG&A is exactly on
what we said in the fourth quarter. It's around 27% or maybe a little bit more than 27% of sales, so no change on that.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: The reason we have started to categorize our businesses in this way is really to help
investors better understand the product mix in the business. We truly believe that the established pharmaceuticals
business, which is primarily branded generics in emerging markets, has a different set of attributes than traditional
patented pharmaceutical products. We think that investors, particularly those who are new to the story, that haven't
been following us as long as people like yourself, Jami, don't have quite the appreciation of the mix of the business.
There's a perception that we are primarily a patented pharmaceutical company, and when you look at these sales
breakdowns we presented, we are 40% Durable Growth, which includes that established pharma but it also includes
nutritionals, diagnostics, other very durable businesses with good growth opportunities. We're about 40% patented
pharma, which I think is a number that surprises some people that have really not studied the company as carefully as
others. And then we're about 15% innovation-driven devices.
And we just want to be sure that the underlying attributes and nature of these businesses and particularly the durability
of this Durable Growth segment from a cash generation point of view, the lack of exposure to the riskier patent cycles
and R&D cycles that you see, for example, in the patented pharma business, but that that really is understood and that
this is a more predictable type of grouping of businesses that I think speaks to the investment character of the company.
So that's really what we're trying to do, and we're going to continue to try to demonstrate, you know, the business this
way and hopefully that will have some ultimate improved appreciation and perhaps valuation of the underlying
businesses.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Just, Tom, if I could follow up, what will this mean with respect to your future capital allocation
strategies? In other words, are there – you know, it seems that if I were to ask you what is your core competency, your
core competency is it prescription drugs, or is it durable businesses? And just in terms of how you think about
allocating capital, i.e., M&A, going forward, how would you prioritize your three businesses?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, we have to be outstanding, tough competitors in every single one of these
businesses. And we can't be – we can't lack core competency in any one. The only way a portfolio like this makes
sense, which we believe ultimately drives a very good investment profile for investors, is to be excellent in every single
business. And so I really can't answer that question. You know, every single one of these businesses has to be
competitive in terms of R&D investment, talent, processes, and all the other things that make a business successful.
So there's – it doesn't say – our capital is going to go to those opportunities that have the highest risk adjusted
opportunity, and if all businesses have equal opportunity, they're all going to get their fair share of capital. If programs
and investments come forward that have better risk-adjusted returns, they're probably going to get a little more of the
capital piece.

Thank you. Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler PhD>: Thank you and good morning. One question around the nutritionals business. Given the
disruption that occurred in manufacturing for powdered formula over a year ago, the question becomes have margins in
that business returned to normal, and are they potentially capable of improving? And then I have one follow-up. Thank
you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, thanks, Tony. It is true that in 2010, the overall margins in our nutritional business
went down a couple, three points from what they had been running at. And that was largely due to the recall last fall.
You know, the product that was recalled was a very important one for us. I think the really good news is that that team
is doing an outstanding job regaining share. The numbers you see in terms of reported sales being only slightly down in
the U.S. nutrition business I think reflect that execution. And frankly, they reflect above-expectations performance in
the other businesses beyond infant nutrition which is where the recall occurred.
So this year we expect some modest progress in – at least as we look at the original plan – some modest improvement
back in the nutrition business margins as we went through the recovery process. But if we do better, as it looks like we
may do in the U.S. business, which is an important piece of the product mix story there, we could do better than our
planning assumption. And I know that that's what the team and our businesses is aiming to do.
But, Tony, even if we get back to where we were, say, in '09 in terms of margin in this business, we're really not
satisfied with that. As we have looked at some competitor margins, we definitely could do better, and we've got a
number of activities going on within that business really focused on margin improvement, and we believe that in years
after 2011, that team will deliver a steadily improving and hopefully significantly improving margin in that global
nutrition business. So we've got some pretty big aspirations there, and hopefully as we move forward, we'll be able to
show some even better results on margins in the nutrition business.
<Q - Tony Butler PhD>: Thank you, Tom. And one final question: Larry, you laid out very nicely again some R&D
activities, one around bardoxolone, as that Phase III begins to ramp. Is Abbott responsible for the entire cost of
development for that Phase III program for its ex-U.S. submission? Thanks.

there a chance we could see generic before July 2012, given some of the movement on the generics side?

in mid '012.

Have you made a pricing decision? Obviously that's something that could turn around the price erosion we have seen
there. And just lastly, on MitraClip, I don't know if you want to comment on the proposed reimbursement we saw last
night. If I was reading the document correctly, it looked like it was being mapped to a relatively low paying DRG.

<A - John B. Thomas>: Yeah, hi, Larry, this is John. Let me take your last question first. The DRG I think has been
out there for some time. It's obviously not final and open for public commentary at this point. You know, as you know,
it's all part of a process. We believe at Abbott that the appropriate DRG payment should be more in line with DRG rate
for patients who are undergoing open heart surgery. But this is something that will be discussed and is just one step in
the overall reimbursement process for a new product like MitraClip. So we'll see how it goes, and we're hopeful that it
will be eventually coded that way.
As for ABSORB, I think as we said in the past that we're not specifically discussing pricing for a product that's a couple
of years away in the U.S., but clearly with the benefits that we have shown with the product and if the clinical data
continues to demonstrate the type of response that we see and then also giving patients the, you know, benefit of not
having any material left in the vessel and the flexibility and natural healing elements and all the attributes, this could be
a game-changing technology and will likely warrant a premium price in the marketplace. But that's a lot yet to be
determined there.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Thanks, guys.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hi, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Good morning, Rajeev.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks. Larry, you touched on IMS growth for HUMIRA, and I think over the last two
quarters, we have seen TRx growth in the 8% to 9% range with reported rev growth of 13% last quarter, 16% this
quarter. I was just wondering if you could comment on what kind of pricing you're seeing for HUMIRA right now and
if that's improving and, if so, how sustainable that might be?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Well, you know, we do have the different generally speaking between TRx and obviously TRx
growth is somewhat of a blunt instrument, but use it as an approximation I guess for script trends overall. The
difference between script trends and the ultimate reported percentage growth is likely price. You know, you're well
aware of the history of the price increases here on HUMIRA over the last year. There weren't any new HUMIRA
increases in 2011, but I would ascribe that differential between script trends and the reported growth in the U.S. to
realized price. I think that's fair.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Do you see that level of pricing that we have seen over the last two quarters as sustainable?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Well, it's been fairly consistent. You know, year-over-year, we've been on kind of a 10- to
12-month clock. I mean, it's been in that 4 to 5% range and we don't predict future price increases, but you can see that
has kind of been our history.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Thanks, Rajiv.
<A - John B. Thomas>: Operator, I think we have time for one final question.

Thank you. Our final question is from Robert Hopkins from Bank of America.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Hi, thanks very much. Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, hi, Bob.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Hey. Just to finish up here with a couple of in the weeds questions on Vascular. Now that
we're getting closer to the end of the agreement with Boston Scientific, I was just curious if you guys could give any
clarity on the contribution that you have been realizing from that royalty payment for those guys. Is that something that
you're going to disclose?
<A - John B. Thomas>: No, we haven't specifically broken out that particular payment, but we're obviously eager to
have XIENCE PRIME on the market, and more than willing to compete head to head for that share where a lot of docs,
as you know, are very comfortable with the platform as it exists today and would appreciate an improvement on that
product. So that's the way we're looking at it, a chance to get 100%.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. And then with ABSORB, I know it's very early and it's a very limited situation in
Europe, but in the centers where it has been launched and in the addressable market, is there any qualitative or
quantitative commentary that you can give on the reception of that product in its limited form right now?
<A - John B. Thomas>: Yeah. I think the reception has been very good. We've been pleased with the rate of uptake of
centers across Europe; doctors seem to be pleased with the performance of the product as you know as we showed at
ACC. The one-year cohort B data looked very good and confirmed the six- and nine-month results that we have
previously seen with no thrombosis and low MACE rates, low late loss, etcetera, returning the vessel to a more normal
functioning.
So I think they're excited about it. They're excited about the fact of leaving patients with a healed vessel and no metal
implant. So, you know, we still have a ways to go, but so far so good. And I think what we're seeing in Europe is
reflective of the potential and future for the product worldwide and in the U.S. So we're pleased.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: I mean, you're taking a lot of share in a couple of individual accounts in this addressable
market, or is it mostly being trialed at this point?
<A - John B. Thomas>: It's being trialed right now. We do expect to be in about 80 centers worldwide by the end of
this year. And so it's nothing that we're specifically breaking out at this time. Remember, we don't have any revenues in
our plan this year for the product.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: And then 2.25 in the U.S., would you say that – what percentage of the market is 2.25 in the
U.S.? Is that 10% to 15%, or is it less?
<A - John B. Thomas>: I think it's a little less than that. Maybe 5% to 10%, in that range.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. And then finally for me just on the same topic or similar topic, stent pricing in the U.S.
before ABSORB comes, is there any reason to believe that it would be anything different than the sort of negative 7%
to 10% that we've been seeing? Any reason to think that we might see an improvement in stent pricing going forward,
or not really?
<A - John B. Thomas>: Well, as you know, there has been a sequential decline in pricing in the marketplace. You
know, we still believe that XIENCE is a premium product overall, and with XIENCE PRIME coming and some of the
other products that we mentioned, you know, we'll see how pricing goes. We're not counting on a robust pricing
environment in our outlook. We'll model more conservatively, but there are some new technologies in the pipeline for
us and some others. And those should command a premium price in the market.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Thanks for your time.
