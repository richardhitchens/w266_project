MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2010 General Dynamics earnings conference call.
My name is Katie, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We
will be conducting a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would
like to now hand the call over to your host for today, Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations please

Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President for Investor Relations
Thank you Katie and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As
always, any forward looking statements made today represent our best estimates regarding the company's outlook.
These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained
in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Jay Johnson.
Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you Amy and good morning everyone. General Dynamics's fourth quarter was marked by strong operating
earnings and the efficient conversion of those earnings into cash. Sales and operating earnings in the quarter increased
in each of our four segments from the fourth quarter of 2009.

Sales were $8.6 billion, up nearly 9% driven by 9.2% growth in our Defense businesses and 7.4% growth at Aerospace.
Operating earnings totaled nearly $1.1 billion, the first billion dollar quarter in the company's history.
Yet earnings from continuing operations were $729 million, or $1.91 per fully diluted share, a year-over-year
improvement of 18% and 21% respectively.
Disciplined execution across the company led to a 12.5% operating margin, the best quarterly performance in 2010. For
the year, sales were $32.5 billion, a modest increase over 2009 with three of our four businesses – business groups
enjoying growth. Operating earnings totaled $3.95 billion in 2010, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1
billion of EBIT.
Aerospace led earnings growth, delivering a nearly 22% improvement. 2010 net earnings from continuing operations
were $2.6 billion, or $6.82 per fully diluted share. Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in the
quarter, a healthy 174% of earnings from continuing operations.
For the year, free cash totaled $2.6 billion or 100% of earnings from continuing operations. We deployed $1.2 billion
of that cash to repurchase 18.9 million of our shares, including 7.8 million shares in the fourth quarter. Through both
share repurchases and dividends, we returned 69% of free cash to shareholders in 2010.
Total company orders in the fourth quarter were $6.6 billion. Our order book included somewhat lighter defense
bookings in line with our expectations, and the Aerospace segment's best quarterly intake since the third quarter of
2008.
For the full year, defense orders were 9% better than 2009 and our aggregate defense book-to-bill improved. General
Dynamics finished 2010 with a total backlog of $59.6 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog,
unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts totaled $81.3 billion.
I'd now like to focus on the performance and outlook for each of our businesses starting with our three defense groups.
First let's talk about Combat. Combat Systems enjoyed a robust fourth quarter as each of the group's four businesses
delivered their largest sales and earnings results of the year.
Sales were nearly $2.7 billion, 8.4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, and 30% higher than the prior quarter.
Earnings were $400 million in the fourth quarter. This represents 9% growth from last year's fourth quarter and nearly
29% growth from the third quarter. Margins were 14.8%, reflecting excellent manufacturing performance and program
management. For the year, the group sales were $8.9 billion. This represents a decline in sales from last year, the result
of lower volume at our U.S. and European vehicle businesses. More than two-thirds of this contraction resulted from
less MRAP vehicle volume and lower U.S. engineering and development work due primarily to the cancellation of the
Army's future Combat Systems program and less activity on the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle.
Cost reduction and productivity improvements enable Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at nearly $1.3
billion, despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.4%; 130 basis points higher than 2009, due to excellent
execution and a higher percentage of mature program volume relative to engineering and development work.
Year-end total potential contract value for Combat Systems was $16.5 billion, including $11.8 billion in backlog and
$4.6 billion of unexercised options and IDIQ contracts. Those IDIQ contracts include two notable additions in 2010: a
Hydra Rocket award and the United Kingdom's Scout Specialist Vehicle Program which has already entered
development.
Notable U.S. orders in the fourth quarter included approximately $600 million for Stryker and Abrams production,
modernization and logistics support, and $350 million for RG-31 MRAP upgrades.
Fourth quarter international awards were also healthy and included EAGLE wheeled vehicles, FMS LAVs and tanks
upgrades. Subsequent to the quarter, we received funding to produce Namer tank hulls for the Israeli Ministry of
Defense. We anticipate receiving several additional international vehicle awards in the first half of 2011, including
production funding for FMS tanks and the Canadian LAV upgrade program.

For 2011, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $9 billion in sales, reflecting stability in our European Vehicle,
Weapons Ammunitions businesses and modest growth in our Land Systems business. This growth will be driven by
several international programs, including two FMS LAV programs now in production, initial production on an FMS
tank program, and the Canadian LAV upgrade program. Expect operating margins around 14%, consistent with 2010.
Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems Group finished another productive year with a superb quarter. Quarterly
sales totaled $1.7 billion, a near 10% increase over 2009 while operating earnings increased 13.5% to $177 million.
This quarter's double digit sales and earnings growth was particularly impressive since the same quarter a year ago saw
sales and earnings grow 12.4% and 18.2% respectively when compared with 2008.
Incremental Virginia-class submarine volume and SSBN replacement design work drove the top line growth while
increased submarine volume and higher booking rates on our auxiliary and commercial ship programs drove the
earnings improvement. The group's 10.4% margins were up 30 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the full year, sales and earnings each grew 5% and the group had a 10.1 % operating margin. This industry-leading
double digit margin demonstrates the group's continued commitment to manufacturing excellence and to managing for
profitability, particularly important as we begin to encounter mix shift in our program workload.
Marine's year-end backlog totaled $20.1 billion. We anticipate adding several additional Navy ships to backlog in 2011
including two additional Zumwalt-class destroyers, DDGs 1001 and 1002, another DDG 51 destroyer, part of the
Arleigh Burke restart program, and the first MLP, Mobile Landing Platform. In addition to our Navy work, we continue
to see interest across the range of commercial shippers and believe that we will leverage our product carrier success to
win new commercial work this year.
For the year ahead, Marine Systems will be challenged to maintain sales due to delays in receiving several contracts.
Over the long term however, the group's outlook remains very robust and includes commercial opportunities, the next
block, Block IV of Virginia-class submarines, the SSBN replacement program, additional DDG 51s and a new program
to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers.
Our Navy customer's commitment to these programs was evident in the fourth quarter as Electric Boat received an
award for an additional SSBN Missile Compartment design work and the Department of Defense approved Milestone
B for the DDG-1000 program enabling Bath Iron Works to continue production of DDG-1000 and 1001 and to begin
work on 1002. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense announced the Navy's decision to reinvest efficiency savings into
increasing the planned procurement of DDG 51s over the next five years and accelerating the fleet oiler replacement
program. In 2011 margins should be in the low 9% range as the group experiences more significant mix shift in its
surface combatant workload.
Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion. This 9.6% increase over the same
quarter last year was driven primarily by increased volume on IT modernization programs for a variety of government
customers. IS&T's fourth quarter earnings were $311 million. Each of the group's four businesses contributed to this
10.3% earnings improvement over last year's fourth quarter.
The group's margins increased 10 basis points to 10.6%. IS&T sales grew 7.5% in 2010, while operating earnings grew
5.9%. Organic sales gross – growth was nearly 6%. The group's full year margin rate was 10.5% in line with my
expectations. I am extremely pleased with the ability of our IS&T segment to deliver this healthy double-digit margin,
given their growing IT service workload and highly competitive fast-moving markets.
Demand for products across the group's portfolio continued. Given IS&T's particularly strong order activity in the first
three quarters, orders were comparatively lighter in the fourth quarter. I should note that IS&T's fourth quarter order
activity is historically somewhat lighter than other quarters in the year.
For the full year, book-to-bill was approximately one times again. Year-end backlog totaled $9.8 billion. The group's
estimated potential contract value, which consists of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options, grew approximately 19%
from the fourth quarter of 2009 and 9% from last quarter.

Growth in IS&T's estimated potential contract value is a particularly important metric as it provides around 35% to
40% of the group's orders each year. Notable contracts in this category in the fourth quarter included a contract to
provide the combat and C frame control systems for literal combat ships and a contract covering low rate initial
production activities for the Army's WIN-T tactical communications network. The group's year-end total potential
contract value which includes backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $25 billion, an increase from both
the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010.
This robust opportunity set positions IS&T for another successful year in 2011. Sales growth in 2011 should be
between 3% and 5% while margins will be in the low to mid 10% range.
Before discussing our Aerospace group, let me comment briefly on our defense outlook. Fourth quarter and full-year
results for our three Defense groups demonstrate the stability and earnings power of our defense portfolio. Execution is
paramount and we remain committed to maximizing profitability.
In a challenging defense environment, that means cutting unnecessary costs to ensure the affordability of our products,
continuously improving our operations to drive earnings growth; and if warranted, reshaping our businesses to better
align with today's market environment. We are certainly aware of the current Washington focus on debt and budget
reduction. Defense is a major element of discretionary funding and will be on the table during the FY 2012
Congressional Budget process.
Secretary Gates has done a good job of framing the spending needs of the Department of Defense and initiating an
efficiency agenda to get more procurement out of the Pentagon's top line. In a tight budgetary environment, Secretary
Gates has reiterated the importance of increased investments in proven capabilities relevant to current and future
threats.
In so doing, he recently announced the cancellation of several developmental programs, including our Expeditionary
Fighting Vehicle. This cancellation which was well telegraphed over the last six months, is not a reflection of the
quality or performance of our prototype vehicles which are doing extremely well in ongoing testing. This cancellation,
while disappointing, will not have a material impact this year. And given our experience in developing EFV, we remain
well positioned to participate in whatever comes next to fulfill this mission requirement for the United States Marine
Corps.
The real world defense mission's view as it's carrying out right now – foreign wars on terror, pacing peer competitors,
confronting regional nuclear proliferation and ensuring global economic access – are all limits on how much the
defense budget can be reduced.
The Defense Industrial Base is also a key part of the U.S. economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs
nationally. Even so, we assume defense spending will be essentially flat over the next five years. That will still be more
than $100 billion in annual procurement in constant dollars. We feel confident about our Defense portfolio in this
environment. Our facilities are key parts of the Defense Industrial Base which must be maintained. We have solid
incumbency in the Army and Navy force structures, with Stryker combat vehicles, Abrams tanks, the Army Tactical
Communications Network, Virginia-class submarines and DDG 51 and DDG-1000 destroyers; with fewer new
programs incumbent platforms and programs will require continued production and modernization.
General Dynamics is also a major provider of cyber warfare-related products and services, an area where we believe
spending will increase. So even as we operate under a continuing resolution at 2010 defense funding levels, and await
the final congressional disposition of FY 11, we look to the FY 2012 budget process with realism and a prudent
operating plan.
Now let's move to our primary growth segment, Aerospace. The Aerospace group finished the year in the excellent
manner we have come to expect. Quarter highlights included further earnings and margin growth, strong order activity,
minimal customer defaults, and backlog growth. Fourth quarter sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 7.4% when compared to
fourth quarter 2009 due to several additional Gulfstream completions and improved service workload.

Sequentially, sales were down modestly due to fewer mid-cap and green deliveries and less pre-owned activity. The
Aerospace segment's operating earnings were $210 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 16.6% operating margin.
The group's operating earnings and margin improved from both fourth quarter 2009 and third quarter 2010. Improved
large-cabin pricing drove margin improvement in both periods while the sequential comparison was also helped by the
delivery of fewer mid-cabin aircraft.
For the year, sales were $5.3 billion, up 2.5%. The group's top line growth was primarily driven by improved service
activity at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Double-digit operating earnings growth in 2010 resulted in $860 million
of earnings as Aerospace margins expanded 250 basis points to the end the year at 16.2%. Excellent execution,
improved new aircraft and service pricing and the absence of pre-owned aircraft losses were the primary drivers behind
the group's increased profitability last year.
The key metrics that provide insight into the health of the business jet market reflected continued improvement in the
fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust and our service centers in North America and around the world
enjoyed another very good quarter. For the year, our service business was up nearly 14%. We are committed to
ensuring that our service business remains best-in-class and that it grows in lock step with our international customer
base.
Preened inventory levels for both large- and mid-cabin aircraft continued to show some improvement over the last
several months of 2010. We had no pre-owned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a
modest profit on just over $100 million in sales on seven pre-owned aircraft. That compares favorably to the losses we
realized on the sale of six pre-owned aircraft in 2009. Fourth quarter orders outpaced deliveries as net orders reached
their highest level since the downturn began and defaults remained at low levels. Gulfstream new aircraft book-to-bill
was 1.5 times on a dollar-denominated basis causing backlog to increase $244 million to $17.8 billion.
2010 orders were over 60% international, reflecting a diversified regional customer base. These orders continued to
come primarily from privately held companies and individuals, although we were pleased to see Fortune 500
companies return to the market this year and gain share in our order book.
Fourth quarter orders included each of our business jet models as both large- and mid-cabin orders were their strongest
of the year. Given the strength of order activity in the fourth quarter and new customer interest, we plan to deliver
approximately 90 large-cabin green aircraft in 2011, including 78 G550s and 450s, slightly above our 2010 production
levels, and about a dozen G650s.
Mid-sized green deliveries will be around 15 to 20 aircraft and will include several G250s. Given the steady
improvement that we've witnessed in the mid-cabin market in recent months, we remain flexible and have the ability to
increase deliveries if and when customer demands – demand warrants us doing so.
We continue to be extremely pleased with our product development efforts. Both the G250 and G650 remain on track
to achieve FAA/EASA certification this year. In the fourth quarter the G250 made its first transatlantic voyage,
surpassed 600 hours of flight testing and completed a series of important milestone tests in the U.S. before returning to
Israel. The G650 has also surpassed several key milestones in recent months, including flying 5,000 miles at 0.9 Mach,
surpassing 1,100 hours of flight testing and adding a fifth test article to the flight program. 2011 promises to be another
busy and successful year for both programs as we prepare to add these aircraft to our Gulfstream fleet.
Our commitment to innovation and product development remains steadfast. In anticipation of continued growth in the
global business aviation market, we recently announced the expansion of our Savannah campus through a $500 million
seven-year plan. This investment is critical as it will ensure that Gulfstream is well-positioned to remain the market
leader. In 2011, the Aerospace group will enjoy double-digit growth, likely 15% to 16%, with margins in the mid to
high 15% range.
In conclusion, General Dynamics delivered another solid performance in 2010. The company is well-positioned for
continued success in 2011 driven by the stability and diversity of our Defense portfolio and double-digit growth in our
Aerospace segment, fueled by new product introduction and further recovery of the business aviation market.

The segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of
between $7.00 and $7.10. As is our normal pattern, we expect EPS to grow progressively throughout the year. Growth
when compared with 2010 quarterly EPS results will come primarily in the second half.
I should highlight that my guidance is operational and does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment.
Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook however, afford us significant flexibility in this area.
As we hit the deck running in 2011, we remain focused on executing on our backlog and continuing to identify
opportunities that will create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you Jay and good morning everyone. You can see in Exhibit E to our press release that we finished 2010 with
just over $2.6 billion in cash, which when added to our marketable securities, resulted in a net debt balance at the end
of the year of just under $400 million.
This is down almost $800 million from last quarter and $850 million from 2009. As a result, interest expense in the
fourth quarter was down 23% from a year ago. We expect interest expense for the full year 2011 to decline to around
$135 million. That's due largely to the $700 million debt repayment we made in the third quarter, and is also based on
the assumption that we will not roll the $750 million of fixed-rate notes which become due next July. Obviously we
will make the decision to refinance those notes or retire them with cash on hand when we get closer to the due date.
Moving on to income taxes. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 30.1%, obviously below our previous expectation
of 31.2%. The reduction was due largely to the late year – in fact, entirely to late-year extension of the R&D tax credit.
This lowered our full-year tax rate by 26 basis points, but reduced the fourth quarter rate by just over one full
percentage point. We expect the 2011 full-year tax rate to be 31% at the high end and probably some opportunity to
outperform that mark.
With respect to corporate operating expense, which is primarily stock option expense, we're projecting a 2011 number
between $90 million and $95 million.
Finally a quick note on pension contributions. We're planning to make a voluntary contribution of approximately $350
million to our pension plans in 2011. Now that's slightly larger than our 2010 contribution.
That completes my remarks and Amy I'll turn the time back to you for the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President for Investor Relations
Thank you. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to
participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Katie, could you please remind participants
how to enter the queue?

<Q - David Strauss>: Jay could you address specifically, does your guidance incorporate the potential for a full-year
continuing resolution, or even maybe something worse than that in fiscal '11? And how do you see that, if that's the
scenario we get how would that potentially impact the business?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The direct answer to your question, David, is no, it
does not anticipate the full-year CR or really even a modified CR of any kind. But I would tell you – and I would opine
that if you did have a full year CR indeed there would be impact, which I'm not going to try to quantify right now. The
important note I would put forward though is that in the CR environment we are dealing with right now there are
programs that would be affected should the CR continue, significant programs, Virginia-class, two a year, for example,
is one. But in every instance I would tell you that the customer and our folks are front and center working these with all
invested stakeholders so that it's not passing by anyone's scan that we've got to deal with these kind of as they are
presented one at a time. So it's getting the attention it deserves. It's a different way of doing it. But we're working hand
and glove with the customer to make sure that we come to a satisfactory outcome.
<Q - David Strauss>: Okay, I'll hold to the rule. Thanks.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Sort of on the heels of that last question, Jay, you did talk about pressure on defense budgets
before. How would you classify the risk of DDG by segment and directionally how should backlog move over the
course of the next year or so in each segment and I'm focusing on the defense side here.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, Rob, I mean – let me put it this
way. You know that the Marine group, and I talked about this, the Marine group is very lumpy in terms of its backlog.
It comes in big slugs. We work off the slug for a number of years. It comes in other big slugs. I mean, that's the most
lumpy of any of our Defense groups. And you heard me mention also that we've had contract delays in significant
programs which are reflecting in the backlog that we see right now, the DDG-1000, the DDG-115, 51, 115 by hull
number and the MLP, et cetera. So that lumpiness is just a reality and we're working off the last big inject right now so
you'll see that come back to us I would expect starting in this year.
The Combat Systems group is kind of less lumpy but it depends. The vehicle, the platform business tends to be a little
bit lumpy and that runs year plus backlog injects that the Weapons Systems and Ammunition and Guns business tends
to be kind of year by year. And then of course in IS&T space, it's all very active inside the year loop as I think I
mentioned in my remarks. And they did a very good job this year of getting themselves essentially one times in their
backlog for 2010.
So I don't know if that's totally responsive to your question. But the backlog -- I would tell you the way I described my
feeling about our defense backlog is I'm very watchful, okay; and very attentive to it.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Well this is -
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Am I concerned about it? Not right now. It -
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Jay, this is why I asked about it in sort of a couple-year framework, knowing that it's volatile
-
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.

<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Looking at Marine going from $9 billion and change at the beginning of '10 after the first
quarter down to $7 billion now we know you've been eroding having not gotten the new orders in. But even if you have
a CR for the rest of this year assuming that everything comes back in the fiscal '12 budget; at two years from today,
would you say Marine's got higher or lower backlog and the same question to the other two segments.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, man I – two years from today, I'm not prepared
to answer the question, but I would tell you, I mean if you look at Marine by itself here, I've already mentioned the
major platforms that are being dealt with as we speak. Those will come into backlog I believe this year. They're being
worked as one-offs as I mentioned before even with the CR, okay? So they were delayed largely because of, in my –
our view, I believe, the incredible workload at the program office inside the Pentagon as they redid the LCS strategy
and now that that has been delivered we're working very diligently with our customer on both the DDG-1001 and 1002
and the 115 and the MLP contract. So we're getting inject back into that backlog this year.
In two more years, what will it look like? Well, I'm not going to get speculative but I mentioned in my remarks that
we've got another block of Virginia-class submarines coming which will certainly be nontrivial in terms of backlog;
that was a huge inject the last time we had a backlog. So we've got that. We've got SSBN development work, et cetera.
So you're going to see increase in the Marine backlog as we go forward.
Combat? Combat is probably, honestly, going to be down a bit, flat to down; not unexpected on the U.S. domestic side.
On the international side I think we're going to see growth there. I don't think. We are seeing growth there, and I
believe that that will continue. IS&T should be good on their backlog. Flat to a little nose up perhaps but as I said that's
usually inside the year and it refreshes itself annually. So that's probably more than you wanted but that's where we...
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: No, that was great. Thank you very much.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi good morning, Jay and Amy.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And Hugh. Just a – amazingly a third question, the first Gulfstream question, I wonder if you
might talk a bit to the backlog growth and how it may break out between the 650 and the 450, 550 and mid-size, how
that's driving production decisions when you look beyond '11 and within that can you address in more descript terms
what you're thinking about the 650 production plan beyond 33 a year as we look well out on the horizon.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The backlog is really being enhanced by all – by the
large-cabin, obviously, all three of the large-cabin aircraft, and the mid-cabin. So a pretty good spread there, Carter.
We're still taking orders for 650s, okay. The 550, 450 book, you've heard me talk about the 18 to 24-month backlog
sweet spot, okay; we're in the sweet spot, looking good. I feel very confident about that. And we're taking mid-cabin
orders; that activity continues to grow, I think is probably an accurate term, it's not what I'd call robust but it's clearly
coming back, and we're getting more activity as we go month by month, and we're taking orders for 250s. We're taking
orders still for 200s. And so I see that in very optimistic terms.
The numbers I gave you, the production numbers I gave you for green deliveries are consistent on the large-cabin
in-production 450, 550, with I think what I've been signaling pretty much throughout the year based on looking at that
18 to 24-month backlog. I feel pretty, really good about that. And the-mid cabin, 15 to 20. Give me a little upside there.
I anticipate, we anticipate, I think, that probably that market may return, but I'm giving you kind of a conservative
number there and we'll see how it goes. But every indication we have on the mid cabin is that, and I think you may hear
this from some of the other OEMs, that the mid-cabin market is coming back. So as it applies to the 650 and I know
you know very well my numbers on '12, '13 and '14 in terms of completions – at 17, 33 and 33, I'm going to stick with

those numbers right now but we're going to turn out about a dozen 650 greens as I mentioned in 2011, and you can
probably add 10 or so a year to that to deliver those completions that I just described. And then as we get closer to full
production here, we'll wick it up and anticipate being able to do so, but I'm just not ready to write that check yet.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: That's fair.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Stanford (sic) [Sanford] Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Staying on Gulfstream. Could you comment on the G650 in terms of margin? And what I'm
getting at is should we expect in the early stages of production that this would be somewhat dilutive to margin? And if
so, when would you expect that to turn the corner and be helpful to margin?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I would characterize it this way, Doug. On the
initial blush, I would characterize it as dilutive to new – to large-cabin new aircraft margin okay because it's brand
spanking new and we're going to – anyway you understand that. But as I've said repeatedly, as we hit stride with that
airplane and look at the purpose-built facility, we've got the design for manufacturing that's existent within that
platform, those margins will grow handsomely and I expect them to be the margin setters for Gulfstream, pace setters
for Gulfstream. When that will occur, I can't tell you, but I would expect continuous improvement as we go. We're very
bullish on the 650 as you probably can tell, and are very excited about getting it operational.
<Q - Doug Harned>: But you can't give a sense of when you may be able to at least hit the margins that you're getting
on the 450 and 550, sort of what timeframe...
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, it will be several years. But I just – I'm not
going to try to pin it down.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Okay that helps, thank you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Joe Lombardo would be mad at me if I tried.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. Couple of questions. First of all, one question, but a clarification first. What is exactly
the Marine sales guidance? I think I might have missed it.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Essentially it's flat. The way I characterized it, I said
they're going to be challenged to maintain their sales this year, and Myles it's strictly a function of timing on those
contract delays.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay. And then given the comments on the flat outlook for defense spending what you're seeing
in the backdrop, is this the environment where, Jay, you think it's more important to be opportunistic in buying defense
properties that might otherwise be under distressed or certainly a negative sentiment overhang, or are you more inclined

to say you know what I have a commercial entity I'd like to increase the scale and/or buy my own shares.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, as I think you know Myles, we look at
all of that. And I haven't changed my direction to any of the business unit presidents out there, the 13 of them, that
within your sphere of business look for opportunities to grow that business with acquisitions. Be it core, additive core,
which I believe in this defense environment there will be opportunities that come available and adjacency, or, and/or
dual use or commercial. You bet. We're looking at all of those things. And then in addition to that, of course, we have
the Aerospace growth engine that we intend to take advantage of.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Just to squeeze it in, just to clarify, is there anything in the environment that could change to
make you change that thinking?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I can't think of anything off the top of my head. But
I mean our Defense portfolio, you hear me say it repeatedly, one of the great strengths of our Defense portfolio is that
it's very diverse. And so it gives us lots of opportunities, and we've got ups in some places and downs in other places,
and we constantly assess what we – how each of those, each portion of our portfolio is performing. And we'll grow
some of them. And dare say we'll probably divest some pieces of it as we did, for example, with Spectrum Astro last
year. If it's better for somebody else than it is for us we're not afraid to divest, but – so we shape the portfolio as we go.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Gleacher & Company.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Question on the, on your European, back to Combat Systems, on European Land Systems. We
came into 2010 I think with a number of different contracts, and I think particularly the Spanish 8x8 that kind of – you
had to move to the right. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of some color on – you mentioned that you are
expecting to see some stability here. How are these contracts looking right now and is there anything that still needs to
be signed up going for this year?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's – I think the way I'd characterize it, Peter is it's
still very active. There are still some soft spots in all of this, and I have no false expectations that some of the things
won't continue to move to the right. But by and large the European order book, both indigenous order book and the
FMS export order book are quite handsome, I believe. We've got the Canadian LAV which I mentioned in my remarks,
which is very active. We expect a production contract anytime here in 2011. You've got the TAPV. You've got the
CCV programs after that, okay, that we're very competitive for, you've got the Scout SV, Specialist Vehicle in the UK.
We're in development right now on a what, $750 million contract so that is proceeding on pace. And it will be years in
stride with every indication that it's going to proceed for – per original intent.
The Spanish 8x8 that you mentioned, the VBR, the Spanish Government Ministry is still working very diligently given
their circumstance, still working very diligently to bring that thing to contract this year. That's about the best I can say.
They've been very consistent in that. Will it happen? We'll see. But they're certainly committed to making it happen as
best they can.
So we've got orders in Switzerland for platforms, DURA platforms. We've got orders in Germany for EAGLEs, and the
EAGLE just keeps getting better and better as it goes and more order activity around that.
And then you move into the – you move into the FMS work with our FMS customers and you've got two huge LAV
orders that are already in play. You've got an FMS tank order in excess of $1 billion that's in play and it will go into
production this year, I believe. You've got the Iraqi tank order that we're already delivering to the Iraqis, and so it goes.
So it's very active and I mentioned in my remarks the Namer for the Israeli Ministry of Defense that we're working with
them on right now at about I think a $300 million contract.

So the international book will continue to be very active. There'll be puts and takes, I think, as we – as I mentioned
earlier because of budget realities in other countries. But the long-term and the integrity of that book I think is very
solid.
<Q - Peter Arment>: So what you're saying, I mean the $9 billion, I think your guidance $9 billion for this year, it
sounds actually and it kind of relates to I think Rob's question looking out over the next year or two, this is quite a
sustainable business just given all that activity you ticked off.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I think you've heard me say it before, Peter, but
I got my head around right now this being a $9 billion business plus or minus a little. And that's kind of what – the way
we're seeing it right now. That's the way 2011 looks to us. 2012 is not quite as clear, just because of where we are in the
budget process but the going-in position looks pretty good. So we'll see how it plays out. But I don't see any drastic
motion frankly down or up in Combat Systems right now, okay?
<Q - Peter Arment>: That's great. Thanks very much Jay.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi Jay.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Just a quick question on the EFV. Given what you know about the mission and combine that
perhaps with what the Secretary has said publicly about the program and maybe what the program office has told you
about our amphibious capabilities going forward, what do you envision the next potential program looking like? And
how is it that General Dynamics may be able to step in and fill that need?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's probably a question to ask the Marine Corps.
But honestly I mean – we believe the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle satisfies the requirement nicely. Decisions have
been taken that said it's unaffordable. It's not a quality thing. It's unaffordable. We're working to make that program
either wind down or reshape where we're being very responsive to lots of people's questions as you might answer. But I
would just say this – how it ends up, I don't know; but whatever happens, and I alluded to this in my remarks, we're
well positioned to compete or provide whatever the Marine Corps needs to satisfy that amphibious requirement in
whatever dimension it's presented in final form.
I think that's the fairest way to say it. It's always been and remains a strategic mission decision on the basis of the
United States Marine Corps in the 21st century, and if they need an amphibious capability of whatever proportion, we
believe by, based on our experience in EFV and building lots of things that go on and under the water that we can
compete quite handsomely for that and intend to do so.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Good morning. Jay I wanted to ask a question on the Marine segment, and just as things have
been pushed out on some of these orders whether it's DDG-1001 or 1002 or even the DDG 51s, just thinking about
Bath in particular, how far out do these get pushed 'til it somehow causes you to make some changes to your cost
structure and in terms of just what your long-term profitability of those contracts are – does that get shifted out as well

with that timing?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, to a point, Sam, I mean, but as you know,
we're very disciplined in our ability to maintain profitability at our shipyard. So if the contract's delayed much longer,
there's no doubt about the fact that we'll be, we'll have to reshape our business up there to deal with that. We did it at
NASSCO because we got a valley if you will in the order book coming out there. We'll do the same thing at Bath if we
have to, without question.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, thank you. Jay, just an observation generally in the January call you give us the EPS
breakdown for the year. Are you not doing that now because of the continuing resolution?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You mean the $7.00 to 7.10?
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes across the – you usually give us a sense of what the spread is across the four quarters.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, no, well I don't remember doing that.
<A - Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President for Investor Relations>: Heidi I think we just generally usually try to give
you a sense of how it's going to play out in the year and you might have missed his remarks, but right at the end Jay did
comment that in the second half of the year that's where most of the EPS growth over 2010 will be. So it will get bigger
each quarter with the second half being the largest.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: I did miss that. Thank you and then Jay, you've got the sense, very strong balance sheet and in
light of the value of the company, what's preventing you from being bolder on share repurchase?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't consider 18.9 million shares to be
trivial. But we're opportunistic, not programmatic in our share repurchase activity and when the market suggests we're
undervalued and ought to buy it back, if that's the best use of the cash, we'll do it. But as you know and I think we've
talked before, Heidi, we – in terms of capital deployment, we're very, we've held back just because of the environment
in which we've been operating to make sure we had plenty of cash, we have plenty of cash. I think you could expect
now that the environment is improving to see us execute our balanced preference in terms of how we deploy our capital
to include more acquisitions and continued share repurchase as the market talks to us.
So we'll deal with the dividend in March as we always do. We'll deal with share repurchases as it becomes
opportunistic for us. And we're looking and working the M&A side very actively right now.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: You're right 18.9 is a lot but for – from '09 to '10 the net decline was only 7 million so that's why
I'm wondering whether you've got a determination kind of – keep chewing that down. That's what I was trying to say.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we'll keep chewing it down as long as it
makes sense to do so. But we're going to – we're also about growing earnings around here and so that's – the capital
deployment is going to be helping us tie to that very nicely.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: And then lastly, can you talk about slot availability in, in 2011 and there's a considerable debate,
as you're well aware, about whether the G550 gets cannibalized by the 650. Can you give us any color advancing that
debate one way or the other as you look out what the demand over the second half of 2010, and early inquiries into '11?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. We have 18 to 24 months backlog in both the
in-production large-cabin aircraft. There is not cannibalization occurring. We're still taking orders for 650s. We're well
out on 550s and 450s. We're very pleased with all of that. I do not see cannibalization as an issue. We're holding price

very handsomely on the large cabin. So it's – the 650 is not a replacement -- as you know Heidi -- but for everyone, is
not a replacement for any aircraft. It defines its own part at the top of the market and that's exactly the way it's being
presented and that's exactly the way it's being received. So it's not threatening at all to our 550 and in terms of backlog
or activity at all.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Okay and then just to reiterate, the 550 slots are full in '11?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm sorry?

Okay, great. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good afternoon.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jay I thought we'd just round it out maybe looking at the OCO leaks of the FY '12 number
suggests the administration is going to bring the OCO down quite considerably. I was wondering if you could you
clarify what your exposure still is there and whether you would see any negative impact from that.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the general answer there would be not much.
I mean in years past, I think as you know the OCO, the Supplementals, et cetera, included procurement, included
MRAP, included things that were very elemental to us. But in the past few years what we're seeing is really the best
way to say it I think is our core programs have moved into the base budget by and large, okay. So it's not something
that is going to change our life much, if the OCO comes down. That's probably the best way to say it.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: If you could give an estimate of the percentage of sales maybe in 2011?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, very small. I don't have a number in my head;
but it's not... Let's put it this way, Robert, it's not something I worry about.
