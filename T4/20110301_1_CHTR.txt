MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Charter Communications Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines
have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Jo Moehle, Vice President of Investor Relations and
Communications.
Mary Jo Moehle, Senior Director-Investor Relations
Good morning. And thank you for joining our conference call as we report Charter's earnings for the fourth quarter and
full year of 2010. The results we're reporting this morning are included in the news release we issued over PR
Newswire at 8 AM Eastern Time and posted on our website, charter.com. The website also contains the presentation
that accompanies today's comments.
Before we proceed, I'd like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. We will not review those risk factors and other
cautionary statements on this call; however, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2009 and
2010. The pro forma results reflect the divestitures of cable systems in 2009 and 2010 as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2009, unless otherwise noted. Also on this morning's call, we'll be referring to pro forma year-over-year
growth rates.
Joining me on today's call are Mike Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Winfrey, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, who will be providing an overview of our business, discussing the company's
quarterly and yearly performance and reviewing our capital structure. I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with our fourth-quarter and 2010 operating and financial
performance, and believe we are well-positioned for continued success. There are strengths in our business and we
continue to deliver consistent growth. In the fourth quarter, we generated 5.2% revenue growth and 8.6% adjusted
EBITDA growth. Throughout the quarter, we maintained operating discipline and aggressively moved forward on
investments we are making for the future.
Our 2010 revenues totaled $7 billion, an increase of 4.8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew to nearly $2.6
billion, an increase of 4.5% for the year. Perhaps even more importantly, we generated free cash flow of $704 million
for the year, a dramatic change from the past, resulting from top line growth, operating discipline, and improved
balance sheet and lower interest costs.
Taking a look at our revenue growth drivers, we are seeing continued increases in customers across digital video,
Internet, and phone, as well as a lift in ARPU driven by the benefits of the bundle, advanced services, and moderate
price adjustments. Our market leadership in Internet speed, the savings available through bundled offerings, and
continued investments in our video and Internet capabilities are bringing an enhanced entertainment experience to our
customers. 2010 really was a year of transformation for Charter. With a much-improved balance sheet, we made
strategic investments in our infrastructure, building a strong foundation on which to deliver enhanced overall
experience to our customers in 2011 and beyond.
Before Chris and I go into detail about last year's results, I would like to take a step back and highlight our key
strategies outlined on Slide 6, and spend a bit more time than usual to explain them. First, enhancing the customer
experience is more than just words for us. It is the cornerstone of our future success. In 2010, we laid the foundation for
improving the customer experience. We've added new metrics to define progress in this area and we're pleased with our
early successes. We're also seeing evidence in third-party research, as our customer satisfaction ratings in the
University of Michigan and Forrester studies increased significantly last year.
We recently hired telecom veteran John Birrer as Senior Vice President of Customer Experience. John brings to Charter
more than 20 years of experience in customer service and loyalty positions, where he has worked to transform
businesses into customer-centric organizations. He is widely recognized for the dramatic improvements in customer
satisfaction at T-Mobile during his tenure. We look forward to what his leadership can bring to the customer experience
here at Charter.
We'll continue to leverage our Internet speed advantage to grow customer relationships and increase the value of our
bundled services. With the significant increase in the number of devices, applications, and cloud-based services that
rely on robust Internet connectivity, higher speeds and reliability are important to every customer. Our speed advantage
gives us a competitive edge and we're playing to win.

In the video space, we recognize the dynamic is changing and we're embracing that change. We set our next generation
TV strategy into motion through our strategic relationship with TiVo. The user experience will be dramatically
improved through the TiVo launch later this year. I'll get into this in more detail in a moment.
Beyond this initial phase, our strategy will encompass next generation platforms that will expand Charter's video
service with new devices, features, and third-party applications.
Finally, our aggressive commitment to expand Charter's capabilities in the commercial market and drive additional
growth will be on the forefront throughout 2011. Ultimately, our stronger financial profile further enables us to execute
our market strategy, make the investments necessary to grow the business. While our capital structure has presented a
number of distinct challenges in the past, we now have the opportunity to further concentrate on the fundamentals of
the business and create momentum to deliver shareholder value.
As you can see in the chart on Slide 7, the bundle continues to be a key driver of residential growth by providing
convenience and savings to our customers, which is essential to our vision. Bundle penetration is now at 61%, and 28%
of customers are in a triple-play package. Bundling leads to increases in ARPU through RGU growth and significantly
improves retention. We also see the benefits to gross margin by leveraging the same building relationships and
connections to the home to deliver multiple products, all of which contribute to profitable revenue growth.
As you can see on the left side of Slide 8, there is a significant opportunity for penetration in both our double-play and
triple-play packages. We've recently increased the speeds of two our Internet tiers, the second free speed increase in
less than a year. The speed of our flagship Internet Express service is now more than double what it was a year ago.
Ultra60 is available in the majority of our markets and we have the ability to offer speeds in excess of 100 megabytes
per second should we see consumer appetite for even more robust speeds. 20% of our Internet customers now rely on
our home networking service, reinforcing our strategy to become the home entertainment and communication solutions
provider for our customers.
But there is an opportunity [inaudible] we haven't yet fully capitalized on. We passed about 7 million homes with
Internet capability with which we have no current relationship. While we increased our non-video customer
relationships 20% last year, we've still only captured 8% of that market. We see a significant opportunity to grow
customer relationships and are targeting these un-served homes with attractive promotional Internet offerings,
leveraging our market leadership position in broadband as well as providing real savings to the consumer by adding
phone. While, we are taking steps to create relationships that don't rely on our video service, we are also making great
strides in improving our video product. There is consumer demand for premium and advanced video services on a
variety of devices and we are taking steps to meet and exceed those expectations.
Video revenue continued to grow in 2010, despite basic-only losses. The percentage of video customers in a bundle
continues to increase, and we are seeing the benefits of our investment in Charter's video product as we continue to
increase digital penetration. Switched digital video will be deployed in most of our markets by year-end, enabling us to
increase HD and Video-on-Demand content and launch guide improvements. This will help set the stage for our next
generation TV strategy.
Our recent announcement with TiVo is our first step in a strategy we believe will change the dynamic of the video
business and further support our commitment to provide innovative solutions to our customers. We are integrating
traditional television and online content using a hybrid platform that leverages traditional cable and next generation IP.
This enhanced user interface is complemented by an iPad app that essentially serves as command central with an ability
to browse and schedule recordings from anywhere and access certain recorded content and much more.
Turning to Slide 10, this exciting venture will enhance our video service by providing a premium user interface making
it simple for customers to quickly find the content they are looking for, whether it's on traditional linear TV,
Video-on-Demand, or online content. We are targeting to begin launches mid-year, wrapping up late in the year.
Our strategic relationship with TiVo is a significant step in Charter's multi-year effort to become the solutions provider
for home entertainment and consumer information technology. Consumers want to watch what they want, when they
want on a variety of devices, and we look forward to providing that flexibility in the home. With our robust IP

infrastructure, we believe we can be a leader in creating a user-friendly customer experience.
And finally, before going into detailed financial results, the commercial side of the business has shown consistent
revenue growth in 2010, reflecting customer increases in SMB and Fiber segments, as well as rising level of bundled
customers. We are also seeing an increasing opportunity in the carrier space, including cell backhaul, where revenue
more than doubled year-over-year.
As of year-end, we had roughly 700 cell tower sites in service and a very robust pipeline. There is a significant amount
of untapped commercial business, as we currently serve only 6% of the total addressable commercial market. We're
building momentum and continue to make investments in our people, processes, and systems to serve these segments
and extend our reach. I'm excited about the opportunities here and we are well-positioned to capture incremental
revenue in the commercial arena by choosing our investments wisely and maximizing our existing assets.
In our advertising sales business, which is by nature cyclical, we benefited in 2010 from both heated general elections
and some recovery of the automotive and retail segments relative to the 2009 declines.
2010 was a year of growth, strategic investments, and focus on enhancing the customer experience. As we align our
philosophy and platform capabilities, we're positioning ourselves to not only meet, but exceed the needs of our
customers now and in the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Chris, who will cover the operating results in more detail.
Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. If you look to Slide 12, our financial strategy really dovetails the growth opportunities at Charter. Our
residential business is characterized by subscription-based revenues, which exhibit both stable underlying cash flows
and growth from new relationships as well as up-selling existing relationships to our other products with a higher value
bundle.
And our investment strategy and the customer experience marketing in the network reflects our belief in the
opportunity set for future growth. As Mike mentioned, commercial is still a relatively nascent opportunity for us, which
we see as a mid-to-long term growth engine, really making use of our existing fiber-rich architecture. We've already
enhanced the existing residential product to meet the business needs and are investing in our commercial sales and
service capabilities to serve larger, multi-site customers and provide cellular backhaul. We generated revenue growth in
all categories in 2010, and the benefit we get from our operating leverage and strong cost discipline allow us to invest
both from an OpEx and CapEx perspective in enhancing the customer experience and in establishing foundations for
future growth.
The vast majority of our capital expenditure in 2010 remained success-based and we de-levered the business in 2010
through both adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayments from over $700 million of free cash flow.
Looking at revenue on Slide 13, 2010 in the fourth quarter saw continued growth across all revenue lines, growing to
$7 billion for 2010 and just shy of $1.8 billion for the quarter. And in spite of the continued growth of video revenue,
Charter has managed to diversify the revenue base to include 42% from Internet, phone and commercial with video
only comprising 51% in Q4.
Before moving to cost and adjusted EBITDA, a few comments on residential customer growth and ARPU. We are now
at roughly 13 million RGUs or 2.5 RGUs per customer relationship. And residential ARPU was up about 6%
year-on-year, supported by that bundling as well as advanced services growth. We are very pleased with the results for
the year but during the fourth quarter we did see a number of competitive offers in our footprint, including a $14.95
DSL offer from AT&T and sub $30 satellite offers.
As Mike mentioned on our last earnings call, we made a conscious decision to not chase net adds for the sake of
volume, in line with our stated goal of achieving profitable revenue growth. If viewed in isolation or outside the
strategic approach we've taken, Q4 volume would be disappointing but we are seeing a significant reduction in

customer churn given the focus on customer lifetime value coming from quality acquisitions, two-year price
guarantees, and an improving customer experience.
We also need to generate additional volume, though. So relative to Q4 [inaudible] results, we are still seeing the
benefits from the strategy and customer retention, although connect volume is still lower than last year. We're
launching some targeted promotional offers in our markets today, in fact, a strategy which is designed to attract
high-quality customers and up-sell to a higher ARPU bundled offering. Product ARPUs were relatively stable in the
quarter and overall ARPU continued to grow.
Adjusted EBITDA, shown on Slide 15, increased 4.5% to $2.6 billion for the year, and 8.6% to $683 million in the
fourth quarter. Excluding political advertising benefits in the quarter, fourth-quarter EBITDA growth was 6.8%. The
full-year 4.5% EBITDA growth is a bit shy of the 4.8% revenue growth. And, really, the way to think about that gap is
we have higher margin Internet phone and commercial products coming on board, offsetting much of the decline in
video margin.
As we mentioned in previous quarters, the remaining gap is really the conscious investment that we're making in the
customer experience and our strategic bandwidth investments, not only in capital expenditure, but each time you touch
a customer, even if it's for improvements, you get a fair amount of upfront touch points and costs to serve. Investments
to scale the commercial business have similar margin effect, whilst we scale that platform for growth.
Our margin seasonality – beyond these trends in connection volume, it's worth highlighting that a disproportionate
share of our programming price increases do take effect in January of each year.
Capital expenditure on Slide 16 was $1.2 billion, consistent with previous guidance, and remains roughly 75% success
based, really highlighted when you look at the fourth quarter with 15% of revenue and the resulting cash conversion.
As we look to 2011, we expect to substantially complete our DOCSIS 3.0 and SDV upgrades this year and accelerate
commercial CapEx given the size of that opportunity. Our guidance for 2011 CapEx is $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, but
clearly with 75% success-based CapEx that will vary with customer acquisition success. We acknowledge we are
above our peers here as a percent of revenue. But as Mike said, we are some 12 to 18 months behind and, frankly, we
see a unique window of growth opportunity.
I would like to spend a minute on what's a significant asset for Charter. We have an asset tax basis of approximately
$10 billion and $6.9 billion of loss carryforwards, which survived the 2009 restructuring and grew in 2010. The graphs
on Slide 17 break down our tax basis and loss carryforwards in a simple way, which shows how the loss carryforwards
in particular can be used over time.
While there is substantial movement on the P&L from non-cash, deferred taxes, and valuation allowances, ultimately
we do not expect to be a significant cash income taxpayer until after 2017, with the remaining Section 382, Limitation
Tax Assets available through 2028. The background to these tax assets more fully covered in our 10-K, but we did
think this would be a helpful slide.
On cash flow, the key items to highlight are $704 million of free cash flow from adjusted EBITDA growth, lower cash
interest, and improved working capital coming out of the restructuring. We extended $6 billion of debt in 2010 and
repaid $1.2 billion of debt and $138 million of preferred stock.
And as a result, we de-levered to 4.8 times to put debt repayment and adjusted EBITDA growth. Obviously, we expect
our cash interest to be a bit higher in 2011 due to the $6 billion of 2010 extensions and $1.4 billion earlier this year.
And we also expect roughly $70 million in higher interest payments from 2011 from the CCH II bond payment timing.
So from a balance sheet standpoint, we are very comfortable with the ability to support the triple play in commercial
growth. We are targeting 4 to 4.5 times leverage and we are comfortable plus or minus a half-turn either way to enable
strategic activity. We have $1.1 billion of liquidity and 70% of our debt now matures beyond five years.
In the meantime, we are prepared to invest in ROI positive projects, paid organic or inorganic, and absent these
opportunities, we will evaluate the best return of capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends or a
combination. As a final point before handing it back over to Mike, I'd just like to highlight that we have included in the

annex to this slide presentation a summary of our equity and debt capital structure for your reference.
With that, I will turn it back over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris. As I've said before, we have the people, products, and platform for success. We see significant
opportunity to increase penetration and drive additional growth. I'm confident we are making the right investments to
enhance our products and services, expand our revenue opportunity, and maximize customer lifetime value. We are in a
strong competitive position. We are generating free cash flow and our employees are energized around this new face
for Charter.
With that, I will turn it back to the operator and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Mary Jo Moehle, Senior Director-Investor Relations
April, we'll take our first questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I have a couple, well Chris can you
talk a little bit about the programming cost adjustments in the quarter that were called out, I think in the release. Just
help us think about what might the normal rate of programming cost growth has been or any comment on 2011? And
then, Mike, you talked about switched digital video. I think you said by the end of 2011, you'll have that fully
deployed. I know that helps you on the high definition front, but you also called out rolling out an improved guide. Can
you sort of walk us through how SDV helps you on the guide front and what that guide might look like relative to what
you have today?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Chris?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Look, on the
programming, I think the best way to think about it, this was an in-year contract negotiation adjustment. So I think the
better way to think about it is, one, there is no impact for the full-year, it's simply a quarter impact. And the EBITDA
growth, as I mentioned, for the quarter would have been 6.8%, were it not for that adjustment. So I think that's the best
way to think about it and you can play around with how you get there, about 6.8% adjusted. In terms of 2011
programming cost, frankly, we don't see this dynamic going away anytime soon and we continue to expect some
increased pressure on the programming side.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Ben, on the switched digital video, you're right, it
allows us to do a number of things, not the least of which is expanding our HD content, but it also allows us to add
additional video-on-demand and VOD HD content. And then the guide that I referenced is the switch to Passport. It's
an improvement on the existing guide structure that we have across our footprint today. The feedback that we've gotten
throughout 2010 from our customers has been extremely positive with the rollout of this new guide. And then the next
phase of that, obviously, will be through our relationship with TiVo. So we see a continued path on a product roadmap
of improving the interface, not only in '11 but beyond.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And last, if I could squeeze one more in, was there anything – you guys called out
competitive offers on the video side, but anything on the broadband front you'd highlight in terms of what you might

call irrational price offers on the high-speed data front for either DSL or – I know you have a small fiber overlap, but
[inaudible].
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Chris had mentioned in his opening
comments that we saw a pricing from AT&T on their DSL product at $14.95, started at the end of Q3 and ran
throughout Q4. And we simply didn't – we didn't go into the marketplace and planned price, and I'm pleased to say
while we're disappointed with volume, maintaining that discipline, we continue to see the benefit on rate, we continue
to tie at the customer lifetime value, and the losses in volume were from lower-end housing segments.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot, everyone.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak of Pivotal Research.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Hi guys, good morning. This is Jeff Wlodarczak. Can you provide any additional guidance as
it relates to '11 EBITDA, or RGU – excuse me RGUs. And then second question, you seem to be taking a less
aggressive approach in your tiers around taking pricing in data. You have increased your speeds twice, it doesn't seem
you take prices. Is there some room to take price going forward? And then, if I could add actually one more about your
thoughts around usage-based pricing, given the FCC seems to have signed off on the idea? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, relative to guidance, Jeff, the only guidance
we're providing for 2011 is the capital guidance that Chris had mentioned. Going into the pricing in data, we see the
[inaudible]. There is a bit of a halo effect that we are getting not only on the data product but across our brand, and
when you link it to the customer-experience work that we're doing, there is a very positive impact relative to bringing
consumers something that they have strong desire for but we're not looking for them to pay up for at this stage.
I do think there is pricing strength in the data product and there will continue to be opportunity there, but where we're
getting the ARPU lift is really coming through up-sell into different speed tiers as well as our home networking
product, and I think that's a better path for us relative to driving ARPU growth on the data side.
Regarding the usage-based billing, it's interesting. I think there is an opportunity – I believe there is roughly 5% of
households that have Internet access today in North America or at least in the states still have dial-up. I think there is an
opportunity to look at usage-based pricing, not necessarily at the high-end but at the low end to create some attractive
price points that are tied to usage, to bring folks out of the dial-up experience and there is probably some share shift
opportunity with DSL as well. And that's – strategically that's how we're looking at usage based pricing today.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Mary Jo Moehle, Senior Director-Investor Relations>: Take the next question, please, April.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Jason Kim from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. With respect to your balance sheet and your
fourth-quarter 4.5 times leverage target, it's actually towards the lower-end of some of your smaller high-yield peers.
And obviously from a bond guy, we don't mind that you come at a reasonable leverage target. But can you just walk us
through how you got to that target from your discussions with your board and why you thought that a higher leverage
was not really necessary given where some of the other cable operators are currently levered at?

<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: [inaudible] I don't mind
taking that. The – I'd just be clear, I think you may be referencing an LQA adjusted EBITDA. We've been taking a look
at this for the purpose of today's discussion on an LTM basis. So it's 4.8 times. The target leverage is 4 to 4.5 times,
plus or minus a half-turn, depending on strategic activities which we feel comfortable with. The way that we really
came to that really was taking a look at optimizing where you are on the weighted average cost of capital curve. And so
we took a look at where Charter stands today and where the market's at and trying to optimize where we are on the
WACC curve, and we felt that was the most appropriate place to be. Of course, over time, market conditions change,
risk premiums were not, we will continue to re-evaluate that, but currently we feel very comfortable with that being the
appropriate leverage target for us.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay, great. And I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into your margin trends and if I go back and
look at your historical margins, in 2009, you had a very good year in terms of margin expansion and then in 2010 there
were some increases in investments in your businesses that put some pressure on the expense line, specifically all in the
– all other OpEx excluding programming cost. So as you go through 2011, should we be thinking that your
all-other-expenses line came relatively stable on an absolute basis compared to 2010 or are there any incremental
investments that you're planning on in 2011 of up and beyond the increases you've had in 2010?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, now look, we are
obviously not providing margin guidance on today's call, but what I can do is describe some of the dynamics that we've
talked about before as it relates to margin benefits as well as pressure. Obviously, I think we've highlighted that
programming costs are not going away this year and perhaps could increase a bit, and so that will apply additional
pressure to video margin. At the same time, the expanding portions of our business being Internet, phone, and
commercial coming on board with higher margins offsetting a larger portion of that.
And the one thing that I would highlight is that in addition to the operating leverage that we have as we expand, we are
continuing to make these SDV and DOCSIS 3.0 investments inside 2011 as well. So we expect to be largely complete
with those by the end of this year. But every time you're touching a customer, you are driving additional touch points
whether it's through customer care or through trouble-call related activity. So those really are the dynamics that are
driving here and we continue to see the business scaling as it relates to the fixed and overhead cost, but those other
variable dynamics will come into play.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think, Jason, one way to look at it – and we
talked about this, as Chris mentioned, over the last several quarters – the effort on the labor side around our strategic
bandwidth initiatives, both DOCSIS as well as SDV, had an impact in Q2 of about 120 basis points on margin. Cut that
in half in Q3 to about 60 basis points and I think you could look at Q4 and say we cut that in half again. But to Chris's
point, we also have the same amount of work to do in 2011 relative to those initiatives. I would like to say we are very
pleased with the fact that we are getting better at the process of deploying across our markets, those upgrades to the
network, but they will continue to have some negative drag in the near-term. But there are downstream benefits that are
long-term.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Thank you. If I could just fit in just one more, any initial responses from customers about the
re-trends, the partial pass-throughs that you start in the fourth quarter?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We had virtually no response relative to the
pass-throughs that – basically it's under a broadcast pass-through fee on the bill and it's been smooth sailing.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay, great. Thank you.

the commercial customers are taking now, like how many average lines and that sort of thing?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I have actually got Don Detampel, who runs our
commercial business, on the line. Maybe, Don, you could weigh in here?
<A - Don Detampel>: Thanks, Mike. So, generally speaking, we are seeing very positive trends in the commercial
business. We recently introduced our Phone Plus product. We will have that fully deployed by mid-year. But in the
Phone Plus markets, which essentially adds additional features and capabilities, we are seeing the line counts go up to
about 2.5 to 3 lines per customer and are seeing a really nice ARPU lift. As well, our Metro Ethernet product continues
to expand, and we are seeing a nice uptake there as well.
<Q - David Joyce>: Thanks. And separately on the advertising line, there is an increasing amount of focus on
interactive advertising. Can you attribute any of your growth to interactive applications you have at this point?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We are active and we are one of the early entrants
into interactive advertising. But it is not a meaningful contributor at this stage of the game. But we are looking forward
to contribution in, not only 2011, but well beyond that, and obviously with the EBIT deployments, provides a fair
amount of opportunity for us once we get that completely deployed.

The next question comes from the line of Ryan Vineyard from RBC Capital.
<Q - Ryan Vineyard>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple, do you have any plans to offer your own Charter
IP video app on your TiVo boxes? And then the second is: what are your expectations for HD channel count
availability by year-end 2011? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm sorry, can you repeat the second question?
<Q - Ryan Vineyard>: What are your expectations for HD channel count availability, just sort of across your
footprint, maybe on average by year-end 2011?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: On the HD side, we are looking at north of 75
channels across – on average – across the enterprise. On the IP side, we are actually not at a point where we are going
to disclose a lot of what we are planning on doing relative to our TiVo relationship. From a competitive standpoint, I
don't think that would be wise to tip our hat.

The next question comes from James Ratcliffe from Barclays Capital.
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk a little about the impact in the
broadband segment regarding the $14.95 plans and the like, did you see that have more of an impact on the churn side
or on the gross ad side? And secondly, on housekeeping, you said you are at about 6% of the commercial base at this
point. Is that on a revenue basis or customer allocation basis? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. On the commercial side, that's on a revenue
basis. It's tied to the addressable spend within all the segments that we serve. And then on the $14.95, we saw – we
didn't see an impact on the churn much at all. What we saw was an impact in connect volume. And again, as I
mentioned earlier, I believe when Ben was asking about the pricing, we saw the impact on the lower end [inaudible]

Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from Citadel.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi. Just a clarification, I think you said, excluding the programming benefit, EBITDA increased
6.8%. Is that the same because you said earlier that that was excluding political advertising that was 6.2%. I'm a little
confused with that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. They are very similar
in terms of the relative effect between the two.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Okay.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So I think the key point
there on programming is that the programming cost increase for the year was roughly 4.8% and, just by coincidence,
they happened to be pretty similar amounts. So that's where that was coming from.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Great. Second, you are pretty close to your target leverage ratios given our expectation of
increasing EBITDA growth and free cash flow. So, do you think 2011 would be the year you potentially announce the
return of capital strategy to equity owners?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Look, at this stage, where
we're at today, we're sitting at 4.8 times, and if you take a look at the cash that we have on the balance sheet, we had
$32 million at the end of the year, of which $28 million was restricted. So I think the simple answer is: we're not there
at a stage where we've got cash burning a hole in our pocket. So that's not really something that we're prepared to talk
about today. Obviously, as we continue to de-lever through EBITDA growth, that probably becomes more relevant
during the course of the year, but right now, we're above that leverage target.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: [inaudible] We're at a stage today, to Chris's point,
where we still have the opportunity to consider all of our options. Reducing leverage is obviously the focus. Investing
in organic growth or other strategic opportunities could be something that would present itself and we'll be
opportunistic relative to that, and there's some additional options, as you touched on. We'll have more to share as we
talk to you throughout the year.

Your next question comes from Bryan Kraft from Oncore (sic) [Evercore Partners] .
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Thank you. That's Evercore Partners. Just quickly I wanted to follow up on broadband. Are you
saying that the AT&T promotional offer, then, has run its course and that pressure shouldn't be seen again in net adds in
the first quarter. And then also on CapEx, you mentioned that it will depend on customer growth. Is the growth implied
in the guidance more or less in line with 2011, or are you expecting some acceleration in unit growth? And, also on
CapEx, can you be more specific as to how much of your footprint you'll upgrade to switched digital and DOCSIS?
And is all of the incremental CapEx this year versus last year for those upgrades, or is there something else, and then
what does that portend in terms of the directional trend for CapEx in 2012? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So I'll take the first question relative to the pricing
we saw from AT&T and then maybe, Chris, you can handle some of the CapEx questions. What we saw was the – the
$14.95, we saw it start to be removed from specific markets as we enter Q1, but it did play out in a number of our
markets throughout January. As we entered February, we saw a complete shutdown of that program. So, obviously
there is an opportunity for us to go back into market again and having not played on price, continue to have the success

that we've had.
But we did see some early impact in Q1 similar to what we saw in Q4. But I am pleased to say that some logic has
prevailed at AT&T, and we've seen some pricing shifts. Regarding DOCSIS and SDV, before I hand it over for the rest
of questions on CapEx, we'll have the majority of our markets complete with both DOCSIS and SDV by the end of this
year.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And we included within the
CapEx guidance for this year, you're right, so 75% being success-based. We always want to put a caveat around that
because plus or minus based on where we're ending up for the year. You can see that come through in the Q4 CapEx, as
I mentioned as well; we were down at below 15% as a percentage of revenue, which really reflects that – when you're
not getting that connect volume through, it does scale down even when we are doing some of these DOCSIS and SDV
upgrades.
When you look at the 2011 number, you've been hearing it from Mike consistently for the many quarters now that we
continue to see the opportunity in commercial, and if anything, we anticipate accelerating the investments to drive
growth in that both from customer acquisition as well as preparing the platform for future growth. So I think you can
expect more of the same there.
As it relates to SDV and DOCSIS, we are continuing with similar amount of upgrade activity in the year for 2011. We
are making investments in the customer experience, which we've talked pretty significantly about, and that's something
where we see real paybacks. It doesn't come immediately, but it is very concrete paybacks for that. So we will be
accelerating some investment in customer experience. And then the rest of that really is related to growth. So I hope
that provides as much color as we can on the guidance for the CapEx.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: And just looking at it, though, from a composition standpoint as – and I'm not asking for guidance
for 2012, but just thinking about the pieces and how they move, a number of these investments that you're making this
year, are they multi-year investments at this – kind of the same level or should we expect some of those to subside as
we move into next year, I guess, is the question?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Obviously, the strategic bandwidth
initiatives are one-time events; you won't see those continue. So the investment that we've made in 2010 and then the
investment we will make in '11 around SDV and DOCSIS 3.0 deployments will be complete as we exit 2011. On the
commercial side, I think, Chris's point is a good one that we see opportunity there and the return on investment there is
very attractive.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Okay.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So where we see opportunity to continue to
accelerate, we will certainly take advantage of that.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Okay. Thank you.

Question comes from Lance Vitanza, CRT Capital.
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: Hi guys, congratulations on the quarter. Just two questions. The first is, with respect to the
target leverage level, I'm trying to flip back through the slides, but I remember a reference there to the plus or minus
being related to strategic activity. And I'm just wondering would that include M&A and could you speak about the
M&A opportunity more generally? And then lastly, on the CapEx, could you provide any kind of detail in terms of
your guidance, what that's going to be spent on? I know you mentioned that it's largely success-based. I'm wondering,
in particular, how much of that is related to fibering up more towers on the wireless backhaul side?

<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll take the first two and then Chris could take the
third question, Lance. Target leverage, obviously, and again I'll go back to – we've always been opportunistic. There
are opportunities in the marketplace from an M&A standpoint today. We're certainly in a position – much better
position than we have been historically here at Charter to look at those opportunities a little more seriously.
We look at scale counts in this business. I think all of us understand that. But we also look at scale relative to our
regional operation. So any opportunity that would allow us to add a reasonable price, tack on additional properties into
the strategic footprints that we have from a cluster standpoint, we'll take serious view and a serious look at those type
of opportunities. And it seems to me that those type of opportunities are starting to heat up a little bit within the space
and I think that's a good thing for the industry in general.
From an overall standpoint on the CapEx, we talk about M&A and we also talk about organic growth, investments in
systems, opportunities to enhance, commercial is probably one of the better examples. But improving the overall
commercial business or looking at extending our network to serve different portions of our footprint that are
commercial in nature, those are the type of things that Chris was talking about when we talked about commercial
investments. Chris?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: On the – obviously, we are
not here to give detailed line item guidance on CapEx, but I do want to try to be helpful. So I think the way to think
about CapEx for 2011 is really to take a look back with the numbers that you have for 2010 because that will give you a
little bit of insight what to expect.
So for 2010, if you take a look at the CPE line, there was a drop there, really, as a result of a lower amount of standard
digital boxes as well as lower pricing, and that was being offset entirely by the amount of investment that was going
into commercial. And then the remaining amount was the DOCSIS and SDV. So those were kind of the key
year-over-year drivers, net of those other effects.
We don't expect any of those trends to really subside inside of 2011. So when you take a look at 2011 and how that
rolls forward, we are continuing the DOCSIS 3.0 and the SDV investments. We are continuing to see more opportunity
in commercial, and we are making investments in the customer experience generally. So I think that should provide a
little bit of framework in terms of how to think of 2011 guidance that we'd given.
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: That's helpful. If I could, just one follow-up on the wireless backhaul. I think you mentioned,
that's a $3 billion end-market opportunity, is that right?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That said, the entire carrier space, which includes
cell backhaul, it's $3.5 billion.
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: I see, but that's just in your actual markets?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, within our markets.
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: Do you know how many cell sites we're talking about in your markets?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we haven't disclosed that.

customers or is it something having to do with a mix shift going on there that's driving the lack of growth in that?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, what happened in 2010, it's a really key
point. We added our light package and it really was to entice folks out of dial-up and also to price-sensitive DSL
customers. We've had a fair amount of success with that. It's obviously not the flagship that we're running. Our Internet
Express is our flagship product. But also, the fact that we have had two speed increases in less than a year without
raising rates, we really see the stickiness associated with this. But again to the earlier question, I think there is pricing
strength in the broadband product. So you may see us make some moves in the coming year relative to pricing. But it
won't be the classical, cable rate increase where you go across the entire rate card. It will more be
household-by-household, particularly tied to price guarantees and bundling up.
