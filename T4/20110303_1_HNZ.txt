understanding the company and its results. We ask you to refer to our April 28, 2010, Form 10-K as well as today's
press release, which lists some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these
statements. Heinz undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of
new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by securities laws.
We may also use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation as the company believes such measures allow for
the essential period-to-period comparison of the business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and
reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in the company's earnings release and on our website at
heinz.com.
Please note we plan to file our third quarter 10-Q this afternoon. Our related financial highlights pages or stat pages
including P&L will become available with the filing of the 10-Q this afternoon. These will be posted on the Investor
Relations section of heinz.com towards the bottom of the page.
Now on to today's call; Bill will discuss our exciting Brazilian acquisition and Art will review our category, regional,
segment performances and Ed will review our third quarter and year-to-date financial scorecards. We've got about 30
minutes of prepared remarks and then we'll use the remainder of the hour to take your questions. We'd like to request
that you limit your question during Q&A just to one, in order to ensure adequate time for all who wish to participate
and to ensure we end the call timely today.
Now with the formalities out of the way, let me turn the call over to Bill Johnson. Bill?
William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Meg, and good morning everyone. Art and Ed, per our usual Q3 process, are going to discuss the company's
strong third quarter results and then take your questions. But first, I'm pleased to announce a significant transaction that
will greatly accelerate our growth in emerging markets and in Latin America in particular.
Heinz, as you will have noted in our press release this morning, has agreed to acquire an 80% stake in Brazilian food
processor Coniexpress S.A. Industrias Alimenticias and its Quero brand. Quero is a strong, rapidly growing brand with
number one and number two positions in numerous tomato based categories in Brazil and the leading position in
vegetables. The brand aligns perfectly with our global portfolio and our core categories and is already a leader in small
independent stores and shops throughout Brazil.
With annual sales of approximately $325 million, Quero will provide Heinz with a tremendous growth platform in
Brazil, the world's fifth most populous country with 200 million consumers. We have established a short-term goal of
around $500 million in sales through organic growth in the complementary launch of Heinz branded products which
we'll be speaking more about in May. Heinz has been assessing potential opportunities in Brazil for sometime, and we
are very pleased with the process that resulted in our tie up with Quero. We expect to build on Quero's already
impressive results by leveraging our experience with the modern trade while also accelerating innovation and
marketing to improve the brand's sales and distribution.
We also plan to leverage our technical expertise in tomato processing and our global supply chain to achieve synergies.
The business will provide an excellent platform to expand sales and distribution of Heinz branded products across
Brazil, some of which will be produced locally for the South American market. Importantly, this pending acquisition
gives us instant infrastructure in central Brazil with a modern factory, a fully automated distribution center, and nearly
1,800 employees. Brazil, as I said, has been on our priority list for some time because of its size, attractive economic
growth, large number of middle class consumers and strong growth prospects. As a reminder, Brazil generates almost
45% of Latin America's GDP.
The transaction makes Heinz one of a select few CPG companies with meaningful businesses in the BRIC markets of
Brazil, Russia, India, China, as well as Indonesia, and probably the only one of our size. The addition of Quero puts our
emerging markets on track to generate more than 20% of total company sales in fiscal 2012, up from under 10% just a
few years ago and well ahead of schedule I outlined at CAGNY last year. We expect to close this acquisition within the

next few months. We also expect it to be modestly dilutive in fiscal 2012 from an earnings standpoint, reflecting our
plan to invest in marketing and improve capability. But I also expect it to be accretive to earnings starting in fiscal
2013.
The acquisition will be essentially funded with cash on hand. I also want to point out that consistent with our strategy,
this transaction resulted from a relationship endeavor and was not part of an auction process. Overall, this transaction is
a major growth step under our emerging market strategy. It is also another great example of our successful
buy-and-build approach, which has delivered great results and dynamic growth in India, Indonesia and Russia.
So with that brief overview of Quero until Q&A, I'll turn the call over to Art.
Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Great, thanks, Bill. Good morning everyone. Before getting started, I would just like to add how excited we all are to be
establishing a strong beachhead in a strategically important country like Brazil. We're very pleased to have the deal
signed.
Now, let's turn to our third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered continued strong organic sales from our trio of
key growth vehicles: the emerging markets, our top 15 brands, and global ketchup. Expanded gross margins off a very
strong base last year, delivered solid profit growth with EPS of $0.84 and continued our great momentum in driving
cash flow.
Now, many of you will recall that last year's third quarter was a high water mark in several respects and included
terrific results from the launch of It Has To Be Heinz campaign in the UK and the return of ketchup promotions in the
US. Despite this tough comparison, we performed very well with constant currencies sales up nearly 3%, operating
income up 2% and EPS up almost 4%.
Our organic sales increase of 1.7% was again, powered by emerging markets which posted 14% organic growth in Q3.
And if you tack on the impact of our recent Foodstar acquisition in China, constant currencies sales in emerging
markets were up 22% for the quarter. Organic sales in developed markets were relatively flat with solid increases in
North American consumer products and global ketchup being offset by decreased soup sales in Europe, trade issues in
Australia, and a modest decrease in US food service. Looking at the trend line, I am pleased to report that we have now
posted 23 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, a testament to our strong sales brands and emerging market
strategy.
Speaking of strong brands, our top 15 brands represent about 70% of sales in the third quarter and again led our organic
growth, up nearly 4%. Importantly, as we look forward, we fully expect the Master Brand from Foodstar in China and
Quero brand in Brazil to join this top 15 list in the near term.
Turning to our core categories, on a constant currency basis, infant nutrition set the standard for growth in the quarter,
up nearly 9% driven by strong performances in India, Latin America and China.
Ketchup and sauces sales grew more than 6% driven by solid ketchup growth in many parts of the globe. Growth in this
category was also driven by Classico pasta sauce in North America and several new Asian sauces in Indonesia.
Additionally, the Foodstar acquisition contributed 2.7 points to this growth. Meals and snacks posted growth in frozen
entrees and potatoes, as well as in beans, but was offset by lower European soup sales. But keep in mind that UK soup
sales grew organically almost 8% last year powered by cold weather and the launch of It Has to Be Heinz campaign.
As expected, and in line with our corporate strategy, emerging markets have been the single biggest driver of sales
growth this year as they have over our recent history. With this growth, emerging markets represent about 16% of our
year-to-date sales despite the devaluation in Venezuela near the end of last fiscal year. And again, we expect this mix to
increase significantly as a result of our recent acquisitions. With Quero and Foodstar next year, emerging markets
should push past 20% of total sales.

Obviously our focus today is on Quero, but let's not forget our other recent acquisition, Foodstar in China. Foodstar is a
leading manufacturer of premium soy sauce and bean curd in Southern China. Now, just in case, coverage in the South
doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that Guangdong and Fujian have more than 125 million people. For perspective,
that's nearly twice the number of people in the UK. And we as a push into Zhejiang, we will be making our great
products available to another 50 million people. We closed the Foodstar deal on November 2 and have begun investing
in marketing, manufacturing and new capabilities to drive growth. And the great news is that Foodstar is off to a strong
start.
In fact, we are off to such a strong start that capacity is an issue. And as a result, we have accelerated the completion of
Foodstar's Shanghai factory to catch up with demand, and as I mentioned, extend our reach into the neighboring
Zhejiang province. Importantly Foodstar joins a very fast growth cadre of businesses that we already have in China.
The combination of all our existing Chinese businesses posted nearly 30% organic growth in Q3.
And moving south from China, our business in India posted great growth for the quarter as well, also up nearly 30% on
an organic basis. This performance was driven by our rapidly growing nutritional beverages, including the extension of
our Complan brand into milks for very young children. Now going back north, Russia posted 16% organic sales growth
as our ketchup and baby food businesses continue to outpace their categories and expand their already market leading
shares. Finally, Indonesia generated another strong quarter in Q3 with organic growth of 13%. ABC has delivered a
good year of new product development and sound performance of the base sauce and beverage businesses.
Now let's shift gears to our flagship, the global ketchup business. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 3% and is
nearly 5% on a year to date basis. Remember that in the third quarter we lapped the return of ketchup promotions in the
US last year, so it's a bit of a tougher comp this quarter. As we look forward, we will continue working to increase
penetration and buy rate to further expand sales of the world's favorite ketchup.
And for those of you who missed Bill Johnson and Muhtar Kent's announcement last week, we are launching a new,
more sustainable Heinz ketchup bottle using proprietary plant bottle packaging developed by Coca-Cola. It's a great
innovation that will both appeal to consumers and help improve the environment. The plant bottle is made from 30%
plant-based materials, it's fully recyclable and will enable us to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Starting
this spring, we plan to ship 120 million ketchup bottles annually using this technology. And we look forward to
exploring other areas of potential collaboration with Coca-Cola.
Now last week, we also announced that Chick-fil-A is the first national chain to offer Dip & Squeeze at its more than
1,500 locations. We are very excited about partnering with this leader in quality and customer service, and early
consumer feedback has been terrific. Tomorrow is Free Fry-Day, that is spelled F-R-Y- Day, at Chick-fil-A restaurants
for those of you who ask for Dip & Squeeze from 2 to 4 p.m. We encourage you to check it out. And stay tuned for
more news on Dip & Squeeze, including a retail launch coming this summer.
Now let's take a quick spin around our geographic segments. We will start with North American consumer products.
Constant currency sales growth at 2% was driven by nearly 4% volume increase, reflecting strong growth across our
five core U.S. brands, which was only partially offset by lower sales of Boston Market. Importantly, the sales growth
resulted in strong market share performance across most of our categories.
Net pricing declined by 1.7% which was driven by our consumer value program. This program included the shift of
marketing funds to trade and consumer promotions during the quarter. But remember, we'll be lapping the full CVP
implementation in the fourth quarter.
NACP profit results were excellent, as higher volume, better mix, and productivity improvements more than offset
current commodity costs. Volume growth was supplemented by the launch a number of innovations and product
improvements in North America during the quarter. These included new Smart Ones and T.G.I.Friday's varieties and
more improvements in enhanced taste, variety, value, and convenience.
Now let's turn to U.S. Food Service. As we discussed last quarter, we had expected the industry and with it, our sales to
recover at a bit faster pace. As it is, Food Service had its best quarterly sales change in five quarters, but was still down
about half a percent. Sales gains in branded ketchup and condiments were offset by weakness in frozen soups and

desserts and non-branded sauces. We continued to be very pleased with the bottom line in this business. Improved
capabilities and streamlined processes enabled us to grow operating income by nearly 13% in the quarter and 19%
year-to-date. One of the ways we're driving branded condiment sales is by expanding the availability of Dip and
Squeeze and launching our new, all natural Simply Heinz condiments, which are packaged in more environmentally
friendly materials.
Now, jumping the pond, we have posted solid performance in Europe, while lapping a very strong quarter with the
launch of It Has To Be Heinz in the UK. For the quarter, constant currency sales were flat, as net pricing of 2.5%
primarily coming from the UK and Italy was offset by lower soup volume in the UK and in Germany. The UK business
posted positive organic sales growth against the 7% increase last year and while lapping a record soup month in
January.
Russia also posted a strong quarter and notably the Italian baby food category returned to growth. Constant currency
operating income increased to the double-digit rate driven by strong gross margin gains which provided the fuel to
invest in higher marketing and in Keystone. From an innovation standpoint, we launched several very promising new
products in the UK that have tested well with consumers. We are particularly enthused about the new fridge pack beans
that Bill highlighted at CAGNY last week.
In our Asia-Pacific market, constant currency sales grew 10%, driven by strong results in India, China, and Indonesia.
Overall, volume increased 4.5% and Foodstar contributed nearly 6 points of growth. The Australian business continues
to face a difficult trade and competitive environment. We have appointed Nigel Comer, who has successfully led our
Watties business in New Zealand for many years, to head up our Australian, New Zealand and Japanese businesses.
The drop in constant currency operating income in the segment primarily relates to lower profitability in Australia and
higher marketing spending across the region. Additional investment in marketing spending is supporting some exciting
new products being launched across the Asia-Pacific, including the new U Da Man drink from LOL in Australia,
extensions of Green Rice cereal China and new Black Gold and hot chilly soy sauces in Indonesia. A portion of our
higher marketing investment this year has been in support of our infant formula launch in China. Overall, we are
pleased with our progress to date. We are very excited about the halo effect the advertising is having on our base baby
food portfolio including jarred foods, cereals and nutritional supplements with our total organic sales up 35% year to
date.
In our Rest of World segment, we delivered constant currency sales growth of 10.5% driven by net pricing in Latin
America, which only partially offset the high inflation there. Volume was down 4%, primarily reflecting economic
difficulties in Venezuela and the beginning of a labor strike at our factory late in the quarter. We expect a continued
decrease in volume and operating income in Venezuela during the fourth quarter, reflecting the economic and labor
challenges in that country.
Turning to cash, we delivered $438 million of operating free cash flow representing 160% of net income. This excellent
performance was driven by strong profitability, working capital management and continuing financial discipline. We
are also pleased to tell you that during the quarter we completed a $500 million multi-year private bond placement
which we'll fund in May, the proceeds of which will be used to help retire a $750 million bond that comes due in July.
As you would expect, we are continuing to focus the team on strong operating discipline. With this in mind, we have
reduced trade spending to below year ago levels, taken price increases where necessary to help offset commodity
inflation, and are continuing to drive down our cash conversion cycle. This discipline is helping us post strong results
in a difficult environment.
Now, I would like to hand it over to Ed McMenamin to cover our financial scorecards. Ed?
Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance
Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I will take you through some of the details that underpin another solid
quarter for Heinz. Looking at EPS, I'll give you three perspectives on the company's results that reflect the impact that

currencies and last year's divestitures have had on our comparisons, against what was our strongest quarter in fiscal '10.
First looking at the results on a constant currency basis, EPS was $0.86 up 3.6% versus prior year. Our current period
results were impacted by about $0.02 from unfavorable currency movements; more details on that in a few minutes.
Reported EPS from continuing operations was $0.84, up 1.2% from prior year. And finally, including the $0.11
unfavorable impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.12 or almost 17%.
Now turning to our P&L scorecard. Net sales grow almost 3% on a constant currency basis and 1.5% after the impact
of currency movements. Organic sales growth of 1.7% benefited from both volume and pricing, while the acquisition of
Foodstar added another 1.2% of growth. Our gross margin at 37.8% is continuing to benefit from our global supply
chain efforts with an improvement of 30 basis points from our highest margin quarter of last year. Productivity
improvements are the main driver, primarily in the US, the UK and continental Europe.
Marketing was lowered $2 million this year, as investments in our emerging markets, the UK and US food service were
offset by a shift in North America from traditional advertising to trade promotions. As a reminder, last year's marketing
was more back end weighted, while this year it's more evenly distributed throughout the year. Operating income
increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis as our improvements in gross margin more than offset investments in
project Keystone.
Given the impact foreign exchange has had on us this year, let's take a quick look at currency trends. These charts show
a 15-month time horizon on a few of our key currencies. The pound and the euro are well up from last summer's levels,
but still down 2% and 8% respectively from Q3 of last year. The bolivar was devalued by 50% last year and remains at
$0.000430 to the dollar. While Australia is representative of many of the Asia-Pac currencies, showing strength versus
the dollar.
This chart lays out the effects those currency movements have had on our P&L. The largest impact continues to be on
our revenue line, the majority of which is the devaluation of Venezuelan bolivar, which have now lapped in Q3. The
euro and the pound continue to be the largest drivers of currency impact to EPS, given the relative size and profitability
of our European businesses. Currency movements in Asia-Pacific continue to be favorable but on a smaller profit base.
Adjusting for currency translation, EPS would have been $0.02 better. We now have the major currencies locked for
the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current earnings outlook for FY '11.
Turning to the P&L, I'll focus on the few of the line items that were not on the scorecard. Gross profit dollars were up
almost 4% on a constant currency basis, benefiting from improved margin, favorable volume and the Foodstar
acquisition. SG&A was up 7% on a constant currency basis and up 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This
reflects our investments in project Keystone as well as the Foodstar acquisition.
I'll go deeper on the drivers of operating income growth on the next few slides, but I'll cover the activity below
operating income here. Net interest and other expenses are favorable $6 million driven by reduced net debt. The
company's 26.1% effective tax rate for the quarter was down 110 basis points or a little over $0.01 of EPS. The
improvement was primarily due to increased income and lower tax rate jurisdictions along with foreign tax planning,
partially offset by higher repatriation costs this year. We are now estimating our full-year tax rate to be around 27%
reflecting the recent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit as well as favorable foreign tax settlements. And finally,
offsetting the benefits from the tax line, shares outstanding reflect a 2% increase versus last year, an impact of around
$0.02 on EPS, resulting in the delivery of $0.84 for Q3.
Now, let's take a deeper look at sales. The third quarter delivered constant currency sales growth of nearly 3% while
organic sales grew almost 2%. Volume increased 0.5% driven by the emerging markets and North American consumer
products, partially offset by soup in Europe along with declines in US Food Service and Australia.
Net pricing increased sales by 1.2% as price increases in the emerging markets, primarily Latin America, combined
with US Food Service and the UK. These were partially offset by increased trade promotions in North American
consumer products and the Australian business. The 1.2% benefit from the Foodstar acquisition in China was more
than offset by the 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.

As I mentioned earlier, our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 37.8% on both a reported and constant currency
basis. Productivity improvements along with higher pricing and favorable mix in our US consumer products business
have more than offset higher commodity costs and about a 20 basis point headwind from Venezuela. We also realized a
slight gain on the sale of specialty channel distribution rights for one of our smaller European product lines.
As you've been reading in the press and hearing from all of our peers, commodity costs in general have shown an
abrupt increase recently. Overall, they are a bit more of a headwind than we expected last quarter but they are
incorporated in our revised EPS outlook. At this point, we would expect our market basket of commodities to show an
increase of over 4% this fiscal year, while our procurement teams have developed plans to hold our input cost increases
below 2%.
Having covered the key components of the P&L, let's turn to the cash flow. As you can see, another strong performance
in operating free cash flow at $438 million this quarter. Driving this performance were further improvements in
working capital management. Capital expenditures are 2.7% of sales, in line with our plans to increase investments in
project Keystone. The $135 million this year for acquisitions relates to the purchase of Foodstar. And dividends reflect
the 7.1% increase we announced in June.
Now, let's briefly review our results for the first nine months of the year. Looking at our P&L scorecard, all of our key
measures compared favorably to last year on both on a reported and constant currency basis. Focusing on the constant
currency growth, net sales grew 2.5% driven by our top 15 brands which outpaced the company average, growing 4.2%
organically. Our gross profit margin was up around 80 basis points as higher net pricing and productivity improvements
were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Consumer marketing was up 2.3% to just over $300 million.
Operating income increased 6.1%, while increasing investments in both marketing and Keystone. At $2.37, EPS was
up almost 8% on a constant currency basis, while the dilution from higher shares outstanding was roughly offset by a
110 basis point decline in our effective tax rate, which came in at 26%.
Updating the slide I showed you for the quarter to reflect year-to-date impact of currency indicates an $0.08
unfavorable impact as the FX headwinds in the first half were more substantial than recent trends. On a year-to-date
basis, organic sales improved 2.1% with balanced support from volume and price, and the same is true for the emerging
markets, which grew over 15%.
The volume increase reflects growth in the emerging markets as well as improvements in North American consumer
products and the UK businesses. These were partially offset by declines in US Food Service and Australia. Pricing was
favorable 1% largely due to Latin America and US Food Service while NACP reduced net price as a result of increased
trade spending for the consumer value program, which began late last year. The Foodstar acquisition added about 0.5
point to sales growth, while currency cost us nearly 2% at the sales line.
Looking at the year-to-date balance sheet scorecard, capital expenditures of $195 million were 2.5% of sales, up 60
basis points from last year but still favorable to our 3% full year estimate. Cash conversion cycle was 44 days down six
days driven by improvements in all three measures. Operating free cash flow was up almost $100 million from last
year, approaching $1 billion through nine months. This performance supports the increase in our full year estimate to
$1.2 billion.
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 0.5 times better driven by lower net debt and higher earnings. ROIC was 19.3%, up 1.1%
from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations in the prior year of about 80
basis points.
And finally, looking at the year-to-date cash flow, the increase versus prior year was due to higher earnings and
reduced pension contributions as well as improvements in payables and income taxes. These increases were partially
offset by declines in receivables, largely due to the cash received last year in connection with an accounts receivable
securitization program. In addition, last year we received $75 million from closing out swap contracts and the maturity
of foreign currency contracts.
In summary an overall solid performance for sales, cash and earnings. With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update
you on our full year outlook.

Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Ed. With three quarters done this year, I would like to update our outlook for the full year. As Bill discussed at
CAGNY, we have increased and narrowed our reported EPS range for the year from $2.95 to $3.05 to now, $3.04 to
$3.10. This reflects better than expected currency dynamics for the year and improved operating performance. Now, it's
important to note that these projections do not include any one-time costs associated with closing the Quero deal in
Brazil. To the extent that the deal closes in this fiscal year, we could incur about $0.03 of transaction-related costs. Bill
also announced that we expected to deliver $1.2 billion in operating free cash flow for the year. This would be up $200
million from our original target and an all-time record for Heinz.
And turning to revenue, we've mentioned through the year that we thought our sales goal was the most challenging part
of our outlook and expected to come in at the low end of the range. We now believe that constant currency sales growth
for the year will be between 2% and 3% due to the impact of a month-long labor stoppage at our main plant in
Venezuela and slower than expected recovery in the US food service industry. The good news is that union employees
are now back on the job in Venezuela, and we are back at the bargaining table to work toward a mutually beneficial
agreement there.
Looking at Q4, we expect to make a number of investments to continue to fuel future growth. The first is the launch of
9 SKUs of T.G.I.Friday's single serve meals that we previewed at CAGNY. As Bill noted, our retail partners are
excited about the coming launch and believe that the new products could help jumpstarting the category. The second is
the launch and ongoing expansion of Dip & Squeeze in food service. The third is our continued investment in project
Keystone as we drive stronger process and system capabilities across the company. And the fourth is investment in our
new acquisitions. We are already moving quickly to improve capabilities and enhance marketing in our Foodstar
business.
In summary, the business is continuing to perform well in challenging times. Our top line performance is driven by our
trio of growth engines: emerging markets, top 15 brands, and global ketchup. Our bottom line continues to benefit from
our culture of strict operational discipline, and we are on track to deliver our full-year earnings and cash flow targets.
And we are continuing to build the runway for further growth as we invest for the future.
With that, now we'll open it up for your questions.

<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. Yes, I think it actually is JPMorgan. Just one question. Let's hope it is, at least. You
mentioned considerable investment there in Q4. So as I look at the SG&A line in your third quarter as I recall, it was
down – it was flattish. How much do you expect that to be up in Q4, and if you could give us some kind of indication
as to how strong your consumer marketing element of that will be?
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Terry, I do – G&A was up in
the third quarter and we do anticipate that it will be up in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in a number of

areas, particularly Keystone. So we feel good about that. In marketing, we have got some very significant investments
going into China as you know behind infant formula. And we continue to support our brands well, particularly strongly
in emerging markets. Having said that, it won't be as high as what we did in the fourth quarter, because as you'll recall,
the fourth quarter of last year was a very significant increase in marketing spending. So, while we feel good about the
overall number, it will probably be somewhat less in the fourth quarter than it was last Q4.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Terry, on SG&A, SG&A was
actually up in the quarter and G&A was up significantly. Now we don't break that out for you, we mix it in with SG&A
numbers. But G&A was up significantly, reflecting the investments. In fact, I think if you talk to my management team,
the one line of the P&L I keep pressing them on is SG&A, because of the investment in Keystone and some of the other
areas.
So if you go back and look, gross margin was up 30 basis points, could have been up 50 basis points, and SG&A was
up 50 basis points year-on-year. And so, I think from that perspective, I think SG&A is a line that you'll continue to see
move up until we get Keystone fully implemented and rolled out. And the big expenses will come, as we've said, this
year in the third and fourth quarter in particular, moving through next year as we get North America brought in as I said
at CAGNY last week.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: Yeah. And some of the
moderation on that is a reduction of marketing that there was a big push at the end of year of last year, as you might
recall, I think an incremental $50 million of marketing dollars. So while we will be spending incremental, probably not
to that same level. So, I think all of this is going to somewhat wash out.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Thanks and congrats on the deal.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, we are very excited

<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning folks.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, good morning.
<Q - Jason English>: Yeah. I'll echo Terry's congrats on getting a beachhead into Brazil. So congratulations on that. A
couple of quick questions. One is on price front, as inflation pressure builds, and maybe Ed, you talked a little about it
in the fourth quarter. If you feel that you're in a position now to maybe shed some light on what fiscal '12 may bring.
And how comfortable you are with being able to price in markets like Europe and it sounds like Australia, New
Zealand may also be a tough environment?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Go ahead.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think, as we mentioned last week
at CAGNY, we have priced in a number of areas. We have taken pricing on ketchup, condiments and sauces in the US,
frozen potatoes. We've moved up on select food services product. We have taken some pricing in the UK and in other
markets were commodities have provided some cost pressure. So we're moving, and not until we've done very deep
analysis on elasticities and things like that. So we feel comfortable with where we are on pricing. We will continue to
watch it. And to the extent that commodities continue to accelerate, we will take a look at what we need to do on that
front. So again, the pricing has come in this industry over many, many years and many, many decades, and so we will

deal with what comes.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I said last week Jason, and
you're probably not going to get any more color than last week, because we were pretty clear on where we've taken
price. We have taken it across a number of the businesses in Europe. We have taken it across a number of the brands in
the U.S. There is still obviously some that we are not prepared to talk about. But generally, as I said last week, there is
no way anybody is going to be able to avoid the pricing mechanism given the impact of commodity costs. They are just
too high. And right now they are very difficult to predict going forward even with some of the turmoil in the world. So
you will continue to see I think, us, independent of what anybody else does as I continue to say, price against these
commodity costs. The hope is and the plan is and the strategy is that we don't chase them.
<Q - Jason English>: One quick follow-up. And this is less Heinz specific. It's a little more macro in nature. Thinking
about emerging markets where you guys have a good sense of the consumer there. Food is obviously a higher portion
of income outlays for those consumers and we are seeing a fair amount of inflation across those markets. How are you
seeing the consumer respond? Are there any volume concerns related to that?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think Art showed you four or five
charts that said obviously, we are continuing to do pretty well on those markets. Again put Venezuela aside because of
some unique aspects of that issue. But I think as you look at those, we are up double-digit in all our key emerging
markets. And we have been able to push price through.
I think the other thing out I keep in context is that in those markets, unlike the developed markets, you are also seeing
wages and salaries lifted in concert with the increased impact of inflation. That's the benefit of markets that are growing
as opposed to markets that are static with high levels of unemployment. So thus far, it has not been an issue.
Now, the UN tries to make an issue out of some of this stuff by talking at a macro basis about stable products in some
cases like wheat, flour, sugar, rice. But from our standpoint and the targets we reach, predominately the middle class
and up, it has not been an issue thus far. I am not saying it won't be. I am just telling you thus far, we have not seen it.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Jason, it's really consistent with the
past few years. We've seen quite a bit of inflation and quite a bit of pricing in those markets with a highly fragmented
trade in those markets. It's part of doing business and therefore one of the things that makes operating in emerging
markets an advantage.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And by the way, I think we have
done more than a beachhead. I think we've opened the boats and we've stormed the shores
<Q - Jason English>: Right on. Well, congrats and good point on wage growth in emerging markets. I'll pass it on.
Thank you.

achieve success there? Whether it's a different trade channel, different issues with infrastructure, et cetera, roads and
whatever, if you could just address that.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think Diane, there is just a
couple of things to note. One, this business is virtually half of its business in tomato processing and tomato products,
which is something, obviously we bring great global capability and expertise in. So from that standpoint, it's right down
our lane. The second big piece of it are vegetables, jarred, canned vegetables which we do in New Zealand, which we
do in Australia, which we do in Poland, which we do in a number of markets and we think there are substantial cross
opportunities.
The market itself, GDP growth has been 10% to 15% over the last, say, five or six years on average with the exception
obviously, of the one bad year for all of us. We expect it to be about 7% to 10% going forward. While the infrastructure
is not where we would like it to be in Brazil, it is actually better than some of the other emerging markets we're in and
we have a lot of experience in Venezuela that we find applicable to Brazil.
What we do like, it's got great growing areas. It's also got significant opportunities in up the trade for us, because the
business we are buying is predominantly down the trade. We are going to push it into up the trade. The emerging trade
there between Carrefour and Wal-Mart is becoming a much bigger piece. The middle-class is growing rapidly among
the 200 million people. This is a business that's been around 25 or 26 years and has been growing at a compounded
average rate between 10% and 15% despite very little marketing and despite no up the trade presence.
So from our standpoint, we find Brazil to be a market we have spent a lot of time learning about. We understand the
infrastructure. This company has a world-class distribution base, which was very important to us in the new warehouse
and distribution center they've built. They've got actually state-of-the-art ponds in front for wastewater removal. And so
it is a really fantastic fit, and we find that the environment, particularly given the size of some of the cities like São
Paulo and Río and so forth, in some ways better for us and more conducive.
But I want to be clear; we have spent a lot of lot of time looking at Brazil, studying Brazil, understanding Brazil, before
we made a move like this. But I think Brazil in some ways, because of the stability of their economic system and the
government they have in place, even with the recent presidential change, is a market that we feel very confident and
comfortable going into. And as you know, the currency has strengthened precipitously, as have most of emerging
market currencies like the rupiah and the rupee, and the renminbi. But, the real has strengthened just even in last
several weeks and it is now at BRL1.65, BRL 1.66. So, a market we're very comfortable with infrastructure wise and
talent wise.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: You say that business has been growing at 10% to 15% rate?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Between 10% and 15% with the
exception of the latest year, they ran out of capacity. They are out of capacity, which we obviously will address very
shortly and that's part of our plans, as we will do some other things. And we'll talk specifics about some of the intent at
the May meeting. But they were out of capacity; we are adding capacity. In fact, they've been adding capacity.
The other interesting thing about this business, there are also implementing SAP and so we are buying a business that
will be involved with SAP. They are in the process of turning it on in the next 30 to 60 days. So from that standpoint, it
gives us a base from which to look at the rest of our Latin American businesses in terms of consolidation opportunity
using their systems and processes. It's an extremely well run company.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: All right. Terrific. Sounds great. Thank you so much.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: Good morning, Chris.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I just want to ask you, in the quarter the North American business obviously had a very
strong margin performance. And I know, and I guess to a degree with the softness on the top line in the developed
markets, do you think more of the market investment saying 2012 and really even going forward, should be committed
to the developed markets to get kind of the top line growth moving? I mean, obviously the emerging markets are doing
very well there and you've invested pretty heavily as well.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Chris, you and I have had this
discussion probably a hundred times. And as I said last week, I'm not going to give you any insights to fiscal '12 quiet
yet. We will come back and talk about that in May. Having said that, one of the things we are looking at marketing is
returns on marketing and where we can get growth. And if you look at ketchup business globally, our ketchup business
is doing extremely well and we are investing pretty aggressively behind ketchup. We are also investing aggressively
behind frozen with the launch of T.G.I.F. and some of the changes in Ore Ida, and they seem to be responding fairly
well. In the UK, we lapped a very difficult soup quarter from last year. We had no expectations of doing frankly, as
well as we probably did during the quarter.
But marketing is something we continue to look at and as I said in CAGNY and I go back and almost quote it verbatim,
you should expect continued investment going forward in marketing. And that's as specific as I can be at this point,
until we get to the May session.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. I was not trying to get fiscal '12 guidance either Bill, just so you know. I guess
what I was also – just as a – it's a bit of a follow up and I will leave it there, is just that as you're reducing promotion
across the business, is the intention to put into advertising or is that – I know it's also a means of trying to overcome
some of this cost inflation as well?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, it is a little bit of everything,
Chris. But we will put money where we will get the best return. And there is no point in spending good money after
bad as numerous examples exist around the industry showing that. And as I said last week, all the money in the world
behind a bad idea, is still a bad idea with a bad result. And in that context, we will put money where we are getting a
return. Obviously ketchup is giving us those kinds of returns, as are frozen and we'll be very selective with it. But I
don't think there should be any rush to judgment about, we are going to move money from the developed markets to the
developing markets, nor do I think, there should be any rush in judgment that we are simply going to cut D&A and
drop it. We will reinvest it against areas we think that will provide us the best returns for the shareholders.

America a bit of a time to digest the recent ones or is it that, you'd get going after more as quickly as you can?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think in response, there is a
couple of things to note. One, as I said in CAGNY last week, we have never seen more opportunities than we are
seeing now. And we've been very selective, as I also indicated last week, about our choices. Foodstar is a business that
fits right in the middle of our heartland, core category of condiments and sauces. Quero is virtually the same thing,
meals and snacks and condiments and sauces particularly, with a strong ketchup businesses, a strong pasta sauce
business and its tomato sauce businesses. And so, I think you will continue to see us focus on those areas and in those
core categories.
I do think that there are a number of lessons, and in fact we probably don't have enough time to articulate them. But the
key thing is buy a good brand. And in Brazil by the way the Quero brand is virtually 100% of the sales that as I
mentioned at the outset, which means it will move into our top 15 brands next year. Foodstar has two brands in
Guanghe and Master. And so as you look, we are trying to buy concentrated brands, buying good management.
The second thing we are trying to do is not buy businesses that have been growing simply through SKU proliferation.
Interestingly enough, the Quero business which is $325 million right now, has about 100 SKUs. The Foodstar business
has less than 40 SKUs. We are trying to find really focused businesses with strong growth prospects, with good
manufacturing capabilities.
The things we've learned are you have to put management in immediately, so that they can learn the business, because
ultimately the owners that sell these businesses decide that they'd rather go do other things or they lose interest. So you
need to get management in quickly. You need to bring financial processes and discipline in.
And the biggest lesson we've learned, and it's one we probably should have known, but we've really learned a lot of it
through China this year, is you have to get your investments upfront, not only in capital, but in marketing. And in some
of our businesses we probably waited too long in our zeal to try to sort of balance the profit hit from these businesses
from a dilution/accretion standpoint, rather than investing aggressively upfront like we're doing in Foodstar, which as
Art said we're running difficulty on capacity, although the new factory will be up in a couple of months and we'll do the
same thing here. So the biggest lesson, good management, focused portfolios, strong brands, good infrastructure,
manufacturing capacity. And invest upfront, don't wait.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: That's great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

<Q - Eric Serotta>: Good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: Good morning.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Looking at the full-year guidance, it still seems like you have a fairly wide range given that there
is only two months left in the fiscal year. Could you talk about some of the puts and takes that would, other than the
obvious, that would cause you to be at either the upper or the lower end of that range? Are there any specific customer
issues or anything other than the obvious ebb and flows of business that would cause such a wide range of outcome?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, the Middle East and Latin
America come to mind, as do currencies in emerging markets and we're lapping a very tough quarter last year in CP. So
there are a number of things. And the reason we gave ourselves the range is it reflects the pass through of currency, but
we also said it reflects the knowledge that we have right now of the issues in the Middle East and Latin America. And
you tell me where those are going to go; we just don't know.

<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think the EPS number that we're
expecting in the fourth quarter is well ahead of the EPS in the fourth quarter last year. So good healthy growth, but we
do expect to invest in the business as I outlined in the prepared remarks. So I think all those things are good.
And as Bill mentioned, a key variable is really in Latin America or Venezuela with the labor situation. The guys are
back at work, but their contract is yet to be done. So we are looking to see how that comes out. But Venezuela is an
impact.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And the investments behind T.G.I.F.
and Dip & Squeeze will be variable based on the distribution we gain and based on the number of SKUs the customers
take and so forth. We've built in obviously, projections. I will tell you that the T.G.I.Friday's business is going in far
better than we anticipated. It has been incredibly well received, as has Dip & Squeeze. But T.G.I.F., I have to tell you,
has been frankly surpassed what we thought were pretty bullish expectations.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The only the Eric, the tax rate will
be higher in the fourth quarter, as Ed mentioned. Depending upon timing of audit settlements and things like that that's
a line that's always a little bit variable.

volume is been sourced from? It doesn't look like freezer cases are getting any larger or more freezer cases are being

to the extent that you're willing to talk about or note the negatives, can't you give us some thoughts about the positives
without necessarily pinning you down as to what is working for you next year?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Absolutely. I will be glad to give
you a positive. I have a slum billion full of positives. And the positives include the launch of T.G.I.F. which will have a
positive benefit on the company next year, the launch of Dip & Squeeze which will be fully distributed by this time
next year across a number of accounts, the innovation activity we're seeing in Europe and across the company, the
continued performance of growth in the emerging markets which we expect to be every bit as good next year as this
year. And the reality is that while you see Brazil and China in terms of Foodstar and Quero as maybe negatives, we see
them as incredible positives not only in terms of the creation of a top line, but the creation of long-term profit and top

line growth.
I mean put in perspective that next year, and I said this in the script so I don't mind talking about it, next year we expect
emerging markets sales, short of something else happening, to be north of 20% of the total sales of the company. If we
continue to drive the growth in those markets that we've driven in the past, I think you can sort of get a sense of the top
line impact that both Foodstar and Quero can have in terms of engaging that number.
We've got a lot of activity planned that we'll take you through in May. There is a lot of good stuff going on, Eric. I just
want to point out you guys wrestle with quarters, I wrestle with the health of the company and the long-term prospects,
Quero and Foodstar, very positive moves, but Keystone will bring huge benefits once we get it in place. Unfortunately,
it is lengthy and it's time consuming and it's difficult; it's very complicated. We have got a number of opportunities for
investment next year, which we'll talk to you about in May.
So, I mean I see overall the health of the company next year being pretty extraordinary. I do think there are some things
that we need to continue to be open about. And one is the investment in Keystone. Two, are the dilution impacts from
Foodstar and Quero. And the reason we're not breaking those out now is because we are still working on the plans and
we'll take you through those in May, in specifics.
But we talk about the negatives, because we try to be open and transparent. We don't see them as negatives. We see
them as investments, necessary investments for the long-term health and growth of this company. They can be
interpreted as negatives. They are certainly not meant to be negatives. They're meant to be the reality of, hey, we're
investing to continue to drive the performance this company has seen over the last six or seven years and to continue to
distinguish ourselves from our peer group.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Think about innovation being a real
engine for us, constant currency sales growth, an engine for us. Productivity, we are continuing to focus on with our
global supply chain. And frankly, pricing. But we'll see how all that shakes out. So I think as Bill said, lots of good
things going on while we invest for the long term as well.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: Yeah, good question,
Eric. Thanks.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. Just one quick follow up on the Brazilian acquisition and the accounting of it.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Can you give any sense as to the margin structure of the business? And then the 20% that you
don't own is that – are you going to start a minority interest line or is that going to flow through other expense in net on
a pre-tax basis? How is that going to be accounted for?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me issue the margin issue and I
will let Ed address the accounting issues, because I think there is some clarification needed. From a margin standpoint,
this business is comparable at gross margins to our other emerging market businesses. It's in the businesses we operate
in terms of tomato processing and some of the other areas that we think we can bring enormous capacities and
capabilities to that will help us. So from a margin standpoint we are very pleased with where this business is and I think
long-term expect significant improvement in it, given it's the business we know best.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance>: In our company 20% we already have a non-controlling
interest line open for a couple of our other joint ventures. That 20% will be – its share of that profit will be reflected
down there.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Indonesia is an example of that.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: The accounting
changed on that a year or so ago on that Eric, and you'll note it's at all the way at the bottom of the P&L. So you

actually get a net income number and then there is – then you subtract net income attributable to non-controlling
interest to get to company net income. So it's a little bit different, but just take a look at the P&L, you will see it there at
the bottom.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: If you remember, from an
accounting standpoint in the old days you could take the one-time costs associated with the deal, put it on the opening
balance sheet. That is no longer the case. And that is why I mentioned the potential one-time cost that will come either
in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter depending upon the timing of closing the deal.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.

Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citigroup.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: Hey, David. Good
morning.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Bill, I wanted to start off with two big picture questions for you on the acquisition. The first
question is, and I think you were pretty clear about it but just wanted to make 100% sure I understand. The first course
of action once you acquire, once you close the deal will be to work on launching Heinz branded premium ketchup in
Brazil, is that the right way to think about it? I think you gave a target of $500 million in the first full year of ownership
of the business, is that right?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, no, no, no. I said over –
short-term, our goal is to get to $500 million. And I didn't not articulate Heinz ketchup. I said we will be launching
Heinz branded products over a period of time. The first priority is to get management in place in terms of finance,
control functions, and compliance functions, and marketing, and so forth while we start investing behind the Quero
brand and in the development of Heinz ideas for the market.
The second thing we're doing is obviously, they have been buying Heinz Seeds but we're going to bring them up to date
with the Heinz Seeds that are proprietary to us to help the crop, improve the yields, and obviously improve the ultimate
output of their products.
They are a strong company. The brands we brought – the brand we bought is number one or number two in virtually
every category from a volume standpoint and only one category falls – two categories fall below that from a dollars
sales standpoint, a value standpoint.
So I think the reality is that management, investment, processing capability, technical help and then the launch of some
businesses. You do the import of those businesses, the local production of those businesses or the export of some of
those businesses. I want to make one comment about their business that is going to be very interesting to watch in our
company.
They have uniquely developed a Tetra Pak package of beans, and they've got about three or four varieties in Tetra Pak
beans, something we've struggled to do as a company over the last decade or so. And so we can take some of that
knowledge and that know-how particularly with Tetra. They are way ahead of us in terms of working with Tetra as a
company, and we can apply that knowledge elsewhere in our organization. So this is another example of a two-way
street between an emerging market business that has actually get factual basis to help us improve in other areas of our
company while we help them.

<Q - David Driscoll>: Bill, you also mention at CAGNY that Brazil benchmarks very low on infant nutrition
consumption, I think something like 10.5 kilograms per child. It was right next to the China one. Obviously this
business has nothing to do with that at the moment, but would it be logical for us to conclude that over the course of
time, you would want to layer infant nutrition on to this operation?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I could try to obfuscate my
response with circumlocution, but I think what I'll leave it to is the fact that we'll tell you in May.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Final question for you Bill, it's just simply, do you ever worry about having enough
management time and talent to execute all these acquisitions at the pace you're going?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's always a big concern and
that's why we've had a press on in the company to continue to develop talent. That's why it's part of our strategic plan.
It's the fourth pillar, but maybe the most important pillar is to continue development, growth, recruitment of talent in
the company and spreading them out. Fortunately, we have a fairly talented group of people in Venezuela, some of
which speak Portuguese quite well and we can deploy as needed.
But, yes, that is always the ultimate issue, David, not only in finalizing and putting the people in place in the deal, but
actually getting the process through. I mean we've now done two pretty sizeable deals in the last six months in
emerging markets. And as I said, and I think I was pretty clear at CAGNY last week in one of the Q&As, we have a
number of deals that we're looking at, but we've had to spread them out because we simply don't have the resources to
get them done. We have the financial wherewithal, but not the resources. So, yes, that is a key question and something
we wrestle with virtually daily.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Really appreciate the time and very nice acquisition, right in your wheelhouse. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you, and good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask on the Asia-Pacific organic
sales of 3.9%. Can remind us, were there any issues in the quarter that would have that number down that low that you
might have called out last quarter?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think the impact in
Asia-Pacific in terms of the overall segment was Australia and New Zealand. If you look at Asia, we are up
double-digits. So it's really, the Pacific has slowed down and Asia is booming.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Program Officer>: And we are running
out of time. I promised I would go on time, guys. So, one more and I apologize to those who are down in queue. I'll talk
to you after the call.

Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar, Barclays Capital.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much. I will make it quick. Just, I think we all appreciate the growth that you are
getting from the emerging markets and the recent acquisition just announced in Brazil. But one of the original slides in
the deck showed at least in a quarter like this, all the growth came from those markets and obviously your core, if you
will, was flattish in the quarter.

How do you ensure that that – it would seem like that's really the place where you get the highest incremental return,
right, on investment. How do you ensure that that at least stays in modestly positive territory? And would you expect
that core business to be positive in fiscal '12? And is it just a matter of food service coming back a little bit, how do you
get there, because it would seem like that's the place where the returns are the highest?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Andrew, I think there are a couple
of charts that showed that the profit growth in Europe, in North America and in food service for the quarter were very
strong, despite as you point out flattish volume with the exception of North American retail which was pretty solid.
Secondly, if you look at two of our major cores, I mean you talk about the core, but our top 15 brands have been
growing very robustly at around 4% organically year-to-date, and ketchup is up around 5% organically year-to-date. So
those two businesses, the top 15 brands which are 70% of the sales for the company and generally are our better mix
items and ketchup which is not generally our better mix item, but it is really among the best in the company are all
continuing to do well.
And clearly, we have got an issue this quarter with soup in Europe between Germany and the UK, and I just pointed out
that the softness in Australia and New Zealand in the quarter, and I think fundamentally, you back out Venezuelan food
service and we show better results. But the areas we focus on most, the top 15 brands, the emerging markets, and
ketchup are all doing very well. And that's really where the focus is. And so I would expect over time, the top 15 or the
top 16 or 17 brands, that 70% number to grow and increase in its level of importance which is good for the
shareholders and good for us, and so that's really where the focus is. So while I'm not obviously ecstatic about the
performance in the developed markets, the slide did point out emerging versus developed. It didn't point out emerging
versus top 15 brands and versus ketchup, which as I said is doing very well.
<A - Art Winkleblack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: When you look at the developed
markets we talked to, food service, Germany, Australia, they tend to be our lower margin developed markets. So again
that's what – we suffer a little bit at the top line, but still driving strong bottom line.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And I think stabilization of the food
service industry and it does seem to continue to be coming back and a little bit better, to the extent that that flattens out,
that will certainly be a positive impact on us.

Officer
