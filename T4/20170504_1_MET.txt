MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Federal Security laws, including statements relating to the trends in the company's operations and
financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may
differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statement as a result of risks and uncertainties,
including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise
any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.

Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call, we
will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called
non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly
comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release,
and on our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most

directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide reliable
forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a
significant impact on GAAP net income.
Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and John
Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior
management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself
to one question and one follow-up.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of
$1.41, up from $1.20 per share a year ago. Overall, it was a strong quarter across most business segments with
favorable results from a variable investment income, expense management, and underwriting.
Equity markets, which rose by 5.5% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500, created a tailwind for earnings, while
low interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar remain as headwinds. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were
$1.46 per share, which compares to $1.31 per share on the same basis in the prior-year period. Net notable items of
$0.05 per share in the quarter included higher catastrophe losses, expenses to support our unit cost initiative, a legal
settlement, and a Penn Treaty guarantee fund assessment. These were offset in part by a retail life insurance reserve
release.
As noted in my annual letter to shareholders, MetLife has a leading position in Group Benefits with a market share of
25% among large employers. We're also experiencing strong growth in the mid-market and have over 40,000 small
employer relationships. While we pioneered this business a century ago, we consider Group Benefits an avenue for
future growth and highlighted this segment as one of our growth engines at our November Investor Day.
During the quarter, sales of Group Benefits were up by 29% with strength across all market segments and product lines.
Our national account sales were particularly strong, especially among clients with more than 25,000 employees. We
continue to invest in this business to create differentiated customer experiences, supported by strong enabling
technology and leading data protection capabilities. Over the years, our group customers have put their confidence in us
because of our financial strength and strong service capabilities. Today, they are also trusting us to protect client
privacy in an uncertain world.
The macroeconomic environment in the last eight years has affected our business units in different ways. Our group
business, for example, is correlated to the health of the U.S. employment market. We have been able to grow premiums
and fees in the group business at a compound annual rate to 4.5% over the past five years, despite modest U.S. labor
force and wage growth among large employers. All else being equal, a stronger U.S. job market would drive faster
growth in our Group Benefits business.
I have also made note of our shift away from capital-intensive yen whole life insurance in Japan. This decision was
driven by our requirement for appropriate internal rates of return and payback periods from the products we sell. This
shift in our product mix resulted in lower Japanese sales for most of 2016, but we have started to turn the corner. In the
first quarter of 2017, Japan sales grew by 8%, with strength in foreign currency denominated whole life as well as
accident and health products. Although it is too early to declare a trend from a single quarter, we are pleased with the
overall direction of our sales transition in Japan.
MetLife's net derivative losses in the quarter totaled $602 million. With interest rates ending the first quarter roughly
where they started, much of the derivative loss was driven by strength in the U.S. equity markets and costs associated
with executing the separation of Brighthouse Financial. As part of our supplemental disclosure, we have again included
an exhibit that details the fair value movements of our derivative portfolio.

As promised at meetings with investors throughout the first quarter, we are providing on this call an update on our
RemainCo MetLife hedging strategy. We have refreshed our hedging strategy to protect free cash flow from both
falling and rising interest rates. This was accomplished through a process that sought to optimize free cash flow while
balancing several key statutory, economic, and GAAP metrics. While the restructuring of RemainCo hedge program is
largely complete, the program is dynamic. We will actively monitor and rebalance when market conditions warrant.
John Hele will offer more detail on this topic.
Moving to investments. Variable investment income totaled $343 million in the quarter. Of this amount, $272 million is
attributable to RemainCo MetLife, which is above the high end of the quarterly guidance range of $250 million
provided on our outlook call in December. Private equity investments were the largest contributor to the
outperformance. In addition, hedge fund returns improved significantly from a year ago. In the quarter, our global new
money yield stood at 3.34%. This compares to an average roll-off rate of 4.45% over the past four quarters. In the
fourth quarter, our new money rate was 3.15%. Low yields continue to pressure the life insurance industry.
I would now like to provide an update on our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. Many of
you have asked whether the separation of Brighthouse Financial will still occur in the first half of 2017. Given the
complexity of the transaction, we do not believe we will have the necessary approvals to complete the separation in that
timeframe. The MetLife and Brighthouse Financial teams continue to work diligently with our regulators on all aspects
of the disaffiliation. While we do not have an exact estimate of when that work will be complete, we are hopeful it will
be in the coming months. Operationally, the separation is proceeding on schedule, and we have reached several
important milestones.
In January, Brighthouse Financial began to operate as an independent entity under MetLife. In March, most
significantly, Brighthouse Financial began doing business under its own name. In April, Brighthouse Financial
launched its first broadcast advertising campaign, called Predictability. You may have seen some of the ads during
March Madness, the Masters, or on Squawk Box. And most recently, we finalized the form of financing for
Brighthouse Captive to hold ULSG liabilities. This captive will aid Brighthouse's capital efficiency and reduce
statutory capital volatility.
Looking ahead, the next regulatory milestone would be the declaration of a hearing date by the Delaware Department
of Insurance. We remain confident that the separation will position both companies for success in their respective
marketplaces. For MetLife, the separation remains the cornerstone of our transformation to a company with lower
market sensitivity and a higher and more sustainable free cash flow ratio.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the court ruling that
rescinded our status as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. On April 21, the Trump administration
issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report within 180 days on the SIFI designation process
used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC.
On April 24, MetLife filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit asking the court
to hold appeal in abeyance until that report is complete. As we said in our filing, we believe an abeyance will enable the
new administration to determine whether any of FSOC's positions in this case should be reconsidered, and whether it is
appropriate for the government to continue pressing the appeal. The timing for a ruling on our motion is at the
discretion of the Court of Appeals.
Before I close, I want to update you on our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased $858
million of our common shares. To-date, we have bought back approximately $1.5 billion of our common shares, or
roughly half of our $3 billion authorization that we announced in November 2016. We are on track to fully execute this
authorization by year-end 2017.
With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our Q1 financial results in greater detail.

Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance
underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments
on cash and capital.
In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last evening, we released disclosure labeled 1Q
2017 supplemental slides that addresses the net derivative loss in the quarter. I will speak to these slides later in my
presentation. We will continue to release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, or $1.41 per share. This quarter included five notable items
totaling the negative $61 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First,
unfavorable catastrophe experience, net of prior-year development in Property & Casualty, decreased operating
earnings by $45 million, or $0.04 per share after tax.
Second, Corporate & Other was negatively impacted by a guaranteed fund assessment for Penn Treaty insolvency and
an increase in litigation reserves, which decreased operating earnings by $44 million, or $0.04 per share after tax.
Third, expenses related to our unit cost initiative, also in Corporate & Other, decreased operating earnings by $21
million, or $0.02 per share after tax.
Fourth, reserve adjustments, primarily resulting from modeling improvements of individual life products, increased
operating earnings in MetLife Holdings by $34 million or $0.03 per share after tax. In addition, activity related to a
separation resulted in an increase to operating earnings of $42 million in MetLife Holdings and offsetting $42 million
decrease to operating earnings in Brighthouse Financial.
Finally, variable investment income was above the company's 2017 quarterly business plan range, excluding
Brighthouse Financial, increasing operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax, and the impact of
deferred acquisition costs or DAC.
Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 12% on a
constant-currency basis. On a per share basis, operating earnings adjusted for all notable items were $1.46, up 11%
year-over-year and 12% on a constant-currency basis.
Turning to our bottom line results. We had first quarter net income of $820 million or $0.75 per share. Net income was
$726 million lower than operating earnings primarily because of net derivative losses of $602 million after tax. For
more details about the difference between net income and operating earnings, please reference page 3 in our
supplemental slide disclosure this quarter.
Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after-tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, the derivative
loss is driven by strength in the U.S. equity market and the repositioning of our hedging strategies. For the total
company, the $602 million GAAP derivative net loss included, number one, $402 million or two-thirds of the total for
asymmetrical and non-economic accounting which included costs to reposition the RemainCo hedges to protect from
changes in interest rates on a statutory basis.
Number two, $139 million of VA hedge ineffectiveness, primarily in the Brighthouse Financial, including the impact of
the transition to their new hedging strategy with, number three, the balance of $61 million largely driven by other risks
in VA-embedded derivatives. The asymmetrical and non-economic accounting is a recurring feature under U.S. GAAP,
as the derivative assets are mark-to-market, but a significant portion of MetLife's VA and life liabilities are not.
As Steve mentioned, we have made significant progress at RemainCo with protecting our statutory capital, and thus,
free cash flow from future changes in interest rates. We have obtained further hedge accounting treatment on a
statutory basis and restructured the hedges such that our free cash flow percentage is expected to stay within a 65% to
75% band on average over two years with a range of the 10-year treasury rate from 1.5% to 4%.
As stated in the recently filed Form 10 amendment, Brighthouse Financial has made significant progress in
repositioning to its new strategy. This strategy targets hedging to the statutory measurement at CTE95, while also
holding a targeted buffer of $2 billion to $3 billion. The new hedges protect on the downside using a portion of buffer,

but offer upside potential to Brighthouse Financial. Brighthouse Financial believes that this new strategy will reduce
hedging costs over time and improve statutory results.
Brighthouse Financial and MetLife share a common philosophy of preserving free cash flow through the hedging
strategies and protecting statutory capital. But the circumstances of the companies are a bit different. Brighthouse
Financial is hedging to CTE95. Brighthouse Financial has a greater concentration of variable annuity business than
RemainCo, and this capital measure better reflects Brighthouse Financial's business. Since Brighthouse Financial
maintains a large capital buffer, it can retain some risk like a deductible reducing hedge costs.
In contrast, RemainCo has a more diverse business with a lower concentration in variable annuities and no longer
writes new variable annuity business in the U.S.
Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $50.52 as of March 31, down 5% year-over-year primarily
due to the impact of derivative losses as well as the actual assumption review in the second quarter of 2016. Tangible
book value per share was $41.64 as of March 31, down 6% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.13 per
share versus the prior-year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse
Financial accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease. This was primarily due to the previously disclosed
impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit in variable and universal life and the second quarter 2016 modeling
changes.
Excluding Brighthouse Financial, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.03 per share year-over-year.
This is primarily due to higher claim volumes in Mexico and the impact of a DAC assumption change in the company's
Chile pension business, as well as a onetime reserve adjustment in Japan. In the U.S., underwriting results were
essentially in line with the prior-year quarter.
The group life mortality ratio was 86.9%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 85.7% but below the midpoint of the
annual target range of 85% to 90%. This is the second lowest first quarter mortality ratio for group life in 13 years.
Only the first quarter of 2016 was lower. MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 48.6%
and 53.8% after adjusting for notable items discussed earlier. This result was favorable to the prior-year quarter of
56.6% and at the low end of the targeted range of 53% to 58%.
Finally, the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 79.9%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of
81.2% and within the 2017 annual target range of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily due to
renewal actions in dental and lower new claims severity and disability.
Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the three product spreads presented in our QFS was 165 basis
points in the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII was $343 million, up
$178 million versus the prior-year quarter driven by stronger private equity and hedge fund performance. Product
spreads excluding VII were 129 basis points this quarter, down 2% year-over-year (sic) [2 basis points year-over-year].
Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for
approximately $0.01 of EPS improvement year-over-year.
In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.5%, and 21.6% after adjusting for the notable item this
quarter related to Penn Treaty, litigation reserves, and the company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the
prior-year quarter of 23.8%, primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group and expense efficiencies.
Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.08 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $194 million,
up 37% and 34% adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The primary drivers were favorable expense margins and
strong non-medical health underwriting results. Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 5%
year-over-year driven by growth across all markets. This is at the high end of our guidance of 3% to 5%, which
excluded the loss of one large dental contract which will occur in the second quarter.

Group Benefits sales were up 29% with growth across all markets. We saw a particular strength in the jumbo case
market due to more quote activity and higher closing ratios while persistency continued to be favorable.
Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS reported operating earnings of $280 million, up 16% but down 1% after
adjusting for notable items in both quarters due to less favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $479 million,
essentially unchanged year-over-year. While 1Q tends to be the seasonally weakest for PRT transactions, we continue
to see a good PRT pipeline. And we expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will
continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.
Property & Casualty or P&C operating earnings were $29 million, up 32%, but down 3% after adjusting for notable
items in both quarters. Elevated catastrophes net of prior-year development reduced operating earnings by $45 million
in both quarters. Nearly half of these cats were due to hailstorm activity in Northern Texas. We have taken steps to
address this. And as a result of our homeowner, policy count in this area has declined 18% year-over-year. We expect
that pace of decline will accelerate through additional rate increases and management actions.
Our P&C combined ratio excluding cats and prior development was 89.8%, modestly better than the prior-year quarter
of 90.0%. We continue to see improvement in our non-cat auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats
and prior-year development of 97.2%, well below the 100.7% in the prior-year quarter. Lower auto claim frequency
was partially offset by higher severity, as repair costs continue to increase on technology-laden vehicles. We have been
taking targeted rate increases in auto over the last 12 months of 7% to 8%, and expect to take similar rate actions in the
immediate future.
P&C operating PFOs were $875 million, down 1% year-over-year. Overall P&C sales were down 5% due to price
increases and management actions to drive value.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $295 million, down 3% from the prior-year quarter and 4% (sic) [5%]
(25:30) on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth and lower
expenses were offset by higher reserves and taxes due to the change in the Japan effective tax rate. Asia operating
PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 3%, and up 1% on a constant currency basis. PFOs, including the joint ventures at
ownership, was up 3% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis.
In Japan, sales were up 8%, driven by foreign currency life and accident and health growth. Other Asia sales were up
89%, representing good growth in all markets, driven particularly by China, with the growth of our protection business
through our professional agency channel, as well as a large group case in Australia.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $143 million, down 5% and down 8% on a constant currency basis after
adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting due to higher claims in
Mexico, and the impact of an assumption change in the company's Chile pension business. Favorable market impact
due to better yields in Mexico and Encaje as well as volume growth, were partial offsets. Latin America operating
PFOs were $916 million, up 5%, and 6% on a constant currency basis. Total sales for the region were up 3% on a
constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales, particularly (sic) [partially] (27:07) offset by lower
pension sales in Mexico.
EMEA operating earnings were $75 million, up 19%, and 34% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were
favorable expense margins and volume growth. While unit cost improvement is ahead of plan, a meaningful portion of
the year-over-year decline in expenses is related to timing and favorable items that are not expected to repeat in
subsequent quarters. EMEA operating PFOs were $614 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period, but
up 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Turkey as well as employee benefits in the UK and Egypt.
Total EMEA sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher
margin products in the region.
MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses, reported
operating earnings of $385 million, up 44%, and up 12% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers
were improved underwriting and market results. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 8%, mostly
due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the company's affiliated broker-dealer unit. As

previously guided, we expect operating PFOs to decline by approximately 12% in 2017 versus 2016.
Corporate & Other had an operating loss of $99 million, compared to an operating loss of $190 million in the first
quarter of 2016. Adjusting for notable items in the current period, the operating loss was $30 million. This unusually
low quarterly loss for Corporate & Other is primarily due to the incremental tax benefit of $151 million reflected in the
earnings by source table at the bottom of page 28 in the QFS. The incremental tax benefit is required by GAAP
accounting rules to adjust the company's overall consolidated quarterly tax rate to equal the company's annual projected
effective tax rate. As a result, it enables the consolidated tax rate to be consistent period-over-period, it causes
Corporate & Other to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
As for the company's effective tax rate, we expect it to be between 21% to 22% for 2017, down from 23% as
previously guided. The primary reason is the benefit of non-U.S. operation at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate of 35%.
Brighthouse Financial operating earnings were $244 million, down 25%, and 17% after adjusting for notable items in
both quarters. The key drivers of the earnings decline primarily related to the previously mentioned unfavorable
underwriting, including $39 million from the loss of the aggregation benefit and $10 million from the previously
discussed 2Q 2016 modeling changes. As a reminder, Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial
statements do not match the financial statements of Brighthouse Financial Inc. and related companies shown in the
most recent Brighthouse Financial Form 10 due to accounting timing differences.
Brighthouse Financial PFOs were $1.1 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2016. Overall, annuity sales
were down 35%, and life sales were down 54%, mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor
and lower sales from the MetLife Premier Client Group. Sales of the company's index-linked annuity product, Shield
Life Selector (sic) [Shield Level Selector], remains strong in the first quarter 2017 at $455 million, up 25%
year-over-year.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$3.8 billion at March 31, which is down from $5.8 billion at December 31. This decrease reflects the net effects of
share repurchases, payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses. Please note that
first quarter cash at the holding companies include minimal dividends from our operating subsidiaries. And we expect
operating subsidiary dividends to increase in the second quarter.
Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from
Brighthouse Financial prior to separation subject to regulatory approvals.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our
principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding Alico, was 465% on an NAIC basis at year-end 2016. For our U.S.
companies, preliminary first quarter statutory results were operating earnings of approximately $870 million and a net
loss of $107 million. Statutory operating earnings were up 18% from the prior-year quarter primarily due to favorable
underwriting and lower operating expenses. The net loss was primarily the result of losses on derivatives.
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $24.1 billion as of March 31, down 2%
from $24.6 billion at December 31. The decrease in statutory capital was driven by Brighthouse Financial with total
adjusted capital or TAC reduced by $1.2 billion. This drop was a function of certain restructuring transactions of the
separation, which caused VA reserves to be less responsive to equity markets in the quarter. Several restructuring and
capitalization actions are expected to occur prior to the separation which positively impacting TAC. Many of these
have been completed in the month of April.
As a result, Brighthouse Financial combined TAC has increased by approximately $1.5 billion since quarter-end. On a
pro forma basis as of March 31, 2017, after giving effect to all restructuring and separation-related transactions
including those in April, we continue to estimate a buffer of approximately $2.1 billion above CTE95. This will result
in a combined pro forma RBC ratio for Brighthouse Financial of approximately 650% as of March 31, 2017. Further
details will be included in the next amendment to the Form 10, which we expect to file in May. For Japan, our solvency
margin ratio was 909% as of December 31 which is the latest public data.

Overall, MetLife had a strong first quarter in 2017, highlighted by favorable impacts from equity markets, lower
expenses, and solid underwriting in the U.S. Top line growth was particularly strong with sales up 15% year-over-year
for MetLife as a whole and 21% for MetLife on a post-separation basis. GAAP net income was negatively impacted by
net derivative losses, two-thirds of which were asymmetrical and non-economic.
In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to
implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long term, sustainable value to our
shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Good morning. Steve, just a question on the separation. You mentioned the complexity that
may delay the timing. Just a question on that. Do you still feel confident in the structure of the transaction in terms of
the dividends, the capital for each business? Or do you see the delay being more administrative complexity?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hi, Tom. Nothing changes in terms of our expectations other than the timing, and the
timing is – I used the word months. I didn't use the word quarters. It is a complex transaction. We're working closely
with our regulator. There's a lot of information to impart. We are working very diligently and provide the information
as fast as humanly possible, but it is a large volume of information and analysis that is going on. So, that's what has
resulted in the expected delay from what our initial thought was, which was made many months – many quarters ago in
terms of expectation around timing. Once you get into these transactions and you see the complexity associated with
them, you see [ph] what occurs (36:25) in terms of amount of work that has to get done to make sure that everything is
detailed appropriately and analyzed appropriately.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a question on expenses to make sure I
have my head wrapped around these. So, John, if I'm understanding the flow of the strategic expenses for RemainCo,
that would imply you still have another $260 million to $270 million left for the balance of the year that would come
through operating in corporate. That was my first question on expenses. And then, also on Brighthouse, I just want to
get a sense for how much of the kind of annualized $200 million increase in expenses this year is embedded in the 1Q
result.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: The answer to your first question is yes, that's what you would expect for the year, and – could
you say the second question again? I did not quite get that.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Yeah, in the Form 10, it indicates Brighthouse expenses are expected to go up $200 million
in 2017 versus 2016 levels, and I just want to understand how much of that planned increase is embedded in the 1Q
number. Is any of that – or is it just a small amount? Just some indication of how much is in the 1Q number.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Probably about $30 million of that is in Q1.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: $30 million on an annualized basis?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: No. $30 million in the quarter, it's $200 million...
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: In the quarter, building to, like, $50 million quarterly run rate?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay. So, a little more than half. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was in regards to the changes you made to the
derivatives program, should we expect any impact to your ongoing benefits from some of the low interest rate hedges
that would come through – that would have been coming through operating earnings?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Not – there's not a material change to the benefit that we get from those hedges. Of course,
rates are higher now, so we get less benefit, but those are still essentially there.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Okay. So, no material change other than interest rate moving. And then, just secondly, coming
to the year, you had guided to $450 million to $650 million of corporate losses excluding the expense initiative costs.
Does that outlook change now that you've lowered your consolidated tax rate outlook?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah. So, we expect still to be within that range, but we do expect the lower tax rate for the
year now.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on the derivative losses. Obviously,
the derivative loss declined significantly from 4Q but was still relatively large. So, I was a little surprised with the loss
in interest rates and that rates are generally flat or lower depending on which part of the curve you look at. So, just
wondering what caused that. Was that related to sales of some of the hedging positions or something else? And then,
how the GAAP loss in hedge – on the hedging program affected your – or whether it had any effect on stat capital.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: So, there's a few things going on, Jimmy. First is although the 10-year treasury dropped a little
or almost flat quarter-to-quarter, swap rates were up a little bit, so some noise from that. That's asymmetrical and
non-economic but you get the GAAP noise from that. And we also had some strong equity markets in the quarter and
you got some GAAP noise from that as well. We also, as we pointed out, had some hedge ineffectiveness in the quarter
and that impacted the total GAAP net income.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: And then, just in terms of the changes you implemented, I'm assuming you change
from swaps to swaption, as you've had discussed before, but did you – is that correct? And how – if you can discuss
some of the other changes that you've made and whether you have changed the size of the hedge program, whether you
made it bigger or smaller.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We actually did a variety of things. We were able to get some more statutory hedge accounting
for some types of derivatives by changing their technique and structure. We did move from two different instruments
like that, and we have accomplished our primary goal of making stat capital for RemainCo less sensitive to changes in
interest rates. And as you can see from the numbers and the breakouts, RemainCo has less sensitivity across the board.
And in terms of equities, it is relatively insensitive. I mean, there's always movements. And every time you look at
these results every quarter, there's a lot going on in a quarter when you have derivatives as well as variable annuities.
There's the time decay of the derivatives. It's the aging of the portfolio. Your basis risk or otherwise known as VA
hedge ineffectiveness, and all these got grouped together. So, there are sensitivities going up and down. We've
minimized that, but there'll always be some movement here due to all of these factors.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Okay. And then, lastly, just you mentioned the strong sales in Asia – in Japan, I
think up 8%. To what extent do you view this as sort of a turn in your sales and results have been pretty weak the last

few quarters versus maybe some front-selling related to the discount rate changes that are going into effect in the
second quarter?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: So, let me try that. It's Chris Townsend here. So, Japan sales were up 8%
year-on-year, and this is driven primarily by foreign currency, [ph] life sale growth (42:46) that were up 51%. As you
know, we made the shift from yen life to foreign currency life at the end of 2015, beginning of 2016. And we also had
very strong growth in accident and health, which is up 6%. So, the foreign currency business now makes up about 70%
of our total life sales, and we think that's fairly consistent as a mix going forward. And as a number of our competitors
have pulled yen life products and changed pricing following that, reserve discount rate change. We're seeing customers
and agents being pushed much more to foreign currency life products, and we're very well positioned to provide those
given the breadth of distribution we've got.
So, we see that as a fairly consistent theme. We probably did benefit from a bump in A&H sales, pre-repricing
[indiscernible] (43:31) products where we've repriced in April. And as you know, following that reserve discount rate
in the sort of financial year-end, you'll expect sales in the third sector to fall off in the second quarter. But overall, we're
very comfortable in terms of Japan sales. But it's too early to sort of list our guidance for third sector at the moment.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Hi. Thank you. In Group Benefits, can you just talk about the competitive environment and where
you're seeing the best opportunities? And given relatively strong industry results in recent quarters, you've seen any
uptick in price competition?
<A - Maria R. Morris>: Hi. This is Maria Morris. First of all, I just want to say we were very pleased with our group
sales results in 2017. It's a competitive market. As you know, it's always competitive. But having said that, I'd say that
life and disability has been rational. We've seen a little bit more of an intense competition in dental, especially down
market. But overall, we feel very comfortable with the market that we are in. You probably saw that we had strong
growth and strong persistency. We've been able to get our renewal actions. And overall, it's been a rational market.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Got it. And then, one thing to clarify, just on the pace of buybacks. Should we expect it to slow at
all until you receive the dividend payment from Brighthouse? And I'm assuming that $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion is
contingent on the transaction being approved. And I guess also, are there any restrictions to your being in the market
around the time of the transaction?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: No. We don't anticipate any change in the program that we put in place between our
existing cash reserves and earnings. We believe we're on track for the program being completed by 2017.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Thank you. And just to follow up on Erik's question around the share repurchase. As I understand
it, there was kind of a bright line test that RBC couldn't fall below 400%. And it sounds like, whatever happened with
hedge losses in the first quarter didn't bring you close to that. But is that 400% applied to the statutory entities related to
RemainCo, or all of the current MetLife?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, RBC's only measured once a year. And so, we're confident of all long-term projections.
We always knew that there's a lot of pluses and minuses as you do this restructuring, unwinding reinsurance

transactions. You see the pieces moving back and forth. And the Brighthouse [indiscernible] (46:19) RBC, we haven't
done the debt infusion yet from that. So there's a lot of moving pieces here. And you have to look and – you have to
take that into account. We're strongly capitalized across the board for all of our businesses.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just on MetLife Holdings, the results were stronger on a
normalized basis than I would have thought. I mean broadly speaking, should we think that in quarters in which you
have – you see favorable equity market performance, that MetLife Holdings will not run off as quickly as you've
guided to?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, there is a block of VAs in MetLife Holdings. And so, favorable equity markets, you
have better fees on an ongoing basis, and that will continue to be one of the factors.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thank you. Good morning. A question about the group insurance business. Steve, it's been a
long time since I can remember you sort of starting off the conference call talking about or highlighting that business.
Given your size and scale there, particularly at the large case market, is there anything, beyond further economies of
scale, that you think you could gain from a large acquisition within that business line? And relatedly, why do you think
you're seeing more success, particularly in the jumbo case market? Has competition declined there, or have you just
gotten a bit more aggressive?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: John, as to the first part of your question, we always look at any opportunities out there
in the marketplace. And the group business is one in which we have a very favorable view going forward. And it's been
a strong part of our company for many decades. So, if there's opportunities in the marketplace to make an accretive
acquisition, we certainly are going to be quite interested in looking at that. Maria, do you want to take the second part
of the question?
<A - Maria R. Morris>: Sure. In terms of where we've been investing in group insurance, I think we're seeing the
benefits of our investments in our growth. So, as an example, we've been investing in our voluntary benefit platform.
And so, we are seeing large groups, as well as medium-sized groups, really gravitate toward carriers, both for their core
benefit programs and to offer voluntary benefits to their employees toward a carrier like MetLife, where we're in a
position to do that.
We've talked historically about benefiting, as an example, from the exchanges where we're, in some cases, the only
non-medical carrier on the health exchanges. And I think going forward, the other place we really put investments is in
our ability to ensure that employee records are secure. So, a lot of work in our security platforms. That's been very
helpful up market, as we've looked to bring on new group life and disability business as well.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: So Maria, is it fair to say that when you talk about really strong growth in sales at the jumbo
case market, that a good chunk of that is actually voluntary and not employer paid?
<A - Maria R. Morris>: It's actually both. I would say that we've had a very strong sales quarter up and down the
market, so double-digit growth in the jumbo market. But we've had high-single-digit growth in the regional market.
And as you know, small market is actually not seasonally first quarter focused, but even there we've had strong growth.
We've had growth in both our core business and our voluntary business. Our voluntary business is up double digits
from a sales perspective. So overall, very strong sales quarter for group.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thank you. And then a question for John. On the change in the hedging strategy implemented
at both Brighthouse and RemainCo, can you give us some sense as to the duration of the program that you've put in
place now? And how often some of these hedges need to roll? I'm just trying to understand how the new instruments
compare with some of the older hedges, I'm not sure if you even still have them, that had extended into the 2020s.

<A - John C. R. Hele>: So, on RemainCo, the duration is about the same. And it's basically some longer-term hedges
mainly in that. Brighthouse is like a one to three-year type restructuring of hedges that they're doing. And they've made
significant progress to get their hedging done now. So, if you think about future sensitivities, we point out, look at the
Form 10 that was recently published, there's sensitivity through VA as well as ULSG in there. And you can see both on
a stat and a GAAP basis what the expected sensitivity should be going forward.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: No, I understand that that disclosure is there. I was just trying to understand duration and
maybe the risk of having to roll.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes, so, for Brighthouse, it's about one to three years.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Suneet Kamath>: Thanks. Just wanted to start with the stat capital. I guess it was down about $1 billion from
year-end despite not taking any dividends out. So, John, could you just walk through the mechanics in terms of why the
capital was down?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: So, it was only down $500 million, from $24.6 billion to $24.1 billion. And as I said, most of
that is Brighthouse Financial. And they had some of their restructuring caused less sensitivity to the reserves. The total
CTE95s, which is what they're really hedging to in their strategy, is still at the buffer when we take into account all the
transactions that will happen, so on a pro forma basis. But as of March 31, you're seeing partway through the
restructuring all the steps that have to happen. So, you're seeing this at sort of the low point. And as I said in my script,
it's up significantly from March 31. And that there'll be a whole series of further transactions that have to happen to get
there. So, we gave you sort of the pro forma view of it. And they expect to be, like, a 650% RBC pro forma for all that
as of – if all that had happened as of March 31.
<Q - Suneet Kamath>: Okay. And then, just another question on the updated Form 10. Two of the changes were that
the debt-to-capital at Brighthouse is now going to be 25%, and then the CTE95 buffer has gone from, I guess, around
$3 billion to $2 billion to $3 billion. So, can you just discuss what drove those two changes?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: So, the first Form 10, all the calculations, the values as well as all the core assumptions and
projections were all done as of June 30 last year, and the updated Form 10 is as of December 31. And things change a
lot between June 30 and December 31, so there's a series of changes. And I think Brighthouse will be a dynamic
company in how they manage their business. And that's the reason for that. Still strongly capitalized and will provide
good value over time to shareholders.
<Q - Suneet Kamath>: Okay. And just one last clarification question, if I could, on the 9% ROE target for
Brighthouse. Is that the guidance for sort of out of the gate, or is that more of a longer-term expectation?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: I think what happens with Brighthouse is for the next little while, it is about that type of range
because of just how kind of GAAP works. And their – but their key focus is to build up over time to reduce the hedging
cost to start getting cash out of the company. And that's a key focus, it's to run it mainly on a statutory basis.
<Q - Suneet Kamath>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Just to follow up on John
Nadel's question regarding kind of the – your appetite for group market acquisition. Given your capital position, like,
what size of a transaction will you be more comfortable in doing it, without kind of seeking external capital?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hi, Humphrey. Well, first of all, we certainly will have some capital in reserve for
acquisitions. But please remember that we do acquisitions that are of larger size, like the Travelers deal back in 2005;
the Alico deal in 2010. We would access the capital markets for any funds necessary above and beyond what we hold at
the holding company. And it's just important to reiterate our philosophy on acquisitions. They have to make sense
strategically in terms of what we are planning for the company and going forward, and direction and businesses we
want to be in. And second of all, they have to be accretive for our shareholders and create shareholder value. Have to
earn more than their cost of capital. And at any point in time when there's an acquisition opportunity, we'll look at the
capital markets what it costs us to raise capital and what kinds of returns we'd expect from acquisition, including
synergies. And we make a determination in terms of what we're willing to pay for that business.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: Got it. And then, just a housekeeping question. Do you have any updates regarding
the dividend stopper in some of your [ph] debt clause (55:55) right now?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, we do not believe that this will be a factor going forward. We have steps that we can
take, if we need to, to adjust for this. So, that's something that we've been planning for, if we need to execute it.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: Got it. Thank you.
