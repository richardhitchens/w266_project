remarks, we'll move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are off to a solid start to 2017. Our earnings per share for Q1 was $1.34 and we are encouraged by the momentum
we see in our revenue performance. As you know, accelerating revenue growth through capturing opportunities across
our diversified business model has been a key priority for us.
In addition, we are seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and continue to return significant amounts of capital
to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs.
In many ways, our Q1 results show the steady progress we are making on the range of growth and cost initiatives that
we have put in place over the last couple of years and that we reviewed at our Investor Day last month. These
initiatives have been supported by the spending that we did over the last two years. We expect that these efforts will all
come together to help us produce steady results during 2017 and position us well for the longer term.
Going forward, we remain focused on delivering improvement in EPS as we progress through 2017. And beyond this,
we are equally focused on our strategies to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth. While it is still early in
the year and we have work to do, our first quarter is a positive start to the year.
With that, let me turn to the detailed results, starting with the summary financial performance on slide 2.
Revenue for the first quarter was down 2%, reflecting lower discount revenue and net interest income following the
Costco portfolio sale in Q2 of last year. When excluding FX in Costco-related revenues in the prior year, our adjusted
revenue growth accelerated modestly to 7% on a sequential basis. The first quarter also included, as expected given the
volume growth we are seeing, a greater year-over-year increase in provision and rewards than we experienced in the
fourth quarter. Net income was down 13% versus the prior-year first quarter as we continue to grow over the cobrand
exits from 2016.
As we move through 2017, we expect net income and EPS to grow due to the benefits from our cost reduction
initiatives and the seasonality of revenue. Of course, we expect a return to year-over-year net income and EPS growth
as we get to the second half of 2017. Earnings per share of $1.34 reflects our net income performance and also the
benefits of our strong capital position. Over the last year we returned $4.1 billion of capital to shareholders through our
share repurchase programs, which has resulted in a 6% reduction in average shares. These results brought our ROE for
the 12 months ended in March to 25%.
So with that as the summary, let me now turn to a more detailed review of our results starting with billings. You can
see on slide 3 that worldwide FX-adjusted billings were flat in the quarter versus the prior year. To get a better
understanding of the underlying trends on slide 4 as we have in recent quarters, we show billings growth adjusted for
both changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of Costco. Here, you can see that adjusted billings growth
accelerated modestly to 8% in the quarter. The acceleration was broad based, as you can see in both the segment view
of billings on slide 5 and the geographical view of billings on slide 6. Across all of these views, I would point out a
number of trends in our billings performance this quarter.
In the GCS segment we continue to see strong growth in the small business and middle market customer segments.
Adjusted volumes in the U.S. grew at 11% in the quarter, and outside the U.S. volume growth accelerated. In the large
and global GCS customer segment, spending volumes were up a bit as compared to last year.
As we have said for a while now, we would expect that this will remain a slower growth segment absent an uptick in
travel and entertainment spending by larger corporations, which we have not yet seen.

The U.S. Consumer segment growth rate was consistent with Q4 2016. We are pleased with the impact of the initial
changes we made last October at our U.S. Consumer Platinum product. It's too early to comment on the most recent
changes to the product as they just took effect at the end of the first quarter.
In the International Consumer and Network Services segment, the billings growth rate improved sequentially to 8% on
an FX-adjusted basis. Looking at the two parts of this segment, volumes from proprietary cards grew at 11%, reflecting
continued strength in several international markets.
In GNS, the FX-adjusted growth improved from 4% in Q4 to 6% in Q1 as we saw sequential improvements in all of
EMEA, JAPA and LACC. GNS plays an important role in strengthening our global network.
I would remind you, though, that going forward, as we previously discussed, we do expect pressure on GNS volumes
due to the changing regulatory environment, specifically in the EU, Australia, and China. Given the lower margins we
earn in GNS, however, this will have less bottom-line impact.
Moving to International in total, you can see on slide 6 that our billings growth rates remained strong as we saw our
fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit in FX-adjusted terms growth, and overall International accelerated to 13%
FX-adjusted growth. The improvement in International is broad based, with strength in both our corporate and
consumer businesses. As we look at a few key markets, for example, we see continued strong FX-adjusted growth in
the UK, up 17%, in Mexico, up 15%, and in Japan also up 15%.
Finally, I would briefly note a couple of calendar impacts to growth rates in the quarter. As I mentioned at Investor
Day, the leap day in February 2016 negatively impacts growth rates this quarter by about 1%. Offsetting that
somewhat, we did see a benefit in March as the Easter holiday moved from Q1 last year to Q2 this year. In many
international markets, there is an extended holiday around Easter, which impacts volumes.
Stepping back, we are encouraged by the momentum we see in the adjusted billings growth rate. The improvement is
coming across our segments globally and reflects returns on the investments we have made over the last couple of
years. We still have work to do, and the competitive environment, especially in U.S. Consumer, remains intense, but
we are focused on driving more volume onto our network from our wide range of growth opportunities.
Turning now to our Worldwide Lending performance on slide 7, our total loans were up 12% versus the prior year on
an FX-adjusted basis, slightly below the growth rate we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. As we have for several
years now, we continue to grow U.S. loans faster than the industry, driven primarily by our success in growing loans
from existing customers.
During the first quarter, more than 50% of the growth in U.S. Consumer loans came from existing customers,
consistent with the trend we described at our Investor Day. As we look forward, we believe that we can continue to
grow loans above the industry rate, given our unique growth opportunities, while maintaining best-in-class credit
performance.
Looking at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that net interest yield has been steadily expanding, and rose
again sequentially in Q1 to 10.3%. Yields typically widen in the first quarter due to seasonality, but the steady trend we
are seeing is driven by the impact of a number of factors, including a shift in mix to non-cobrand customers, who are
more likely to revolve, less revolving loans at introductory rates, some specific pricing actions, and of course, a benefit
from increases in benchmark interest rates without an offsetting change to our personal savings deposit rate. We do
expect deposit rates will move up over time, though it remains to be seen when that change will occur and how much
rates will increase.
Before turning to provision, let me touch on our credit metrics. Delinquency and loss metrics across our lending and
charge card portfolios continue to be very strong. In the worldwide loan portfolio, you can see that the delinquency rate
was flat to Q4 and loss rates increased slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. The modest increase in lending
loss rates versus the prior year is in line with our expectations and consistent with our view that loss rates would begin
to increase due to the seasoning of new accounts and the shift towards non-cobrand products, which have a slightly
higher write-off rate, but also generate greater yield. And this quarter's lending results reflect that dynamic.

The combination of continued strong loan and receivable growth and modestly higher year-over-year loss rates,
including in certain charge card segments, has caused our provision, as expected, to grow well above the growth rate in
loans as you can see on slide 9. As we look forward to the balance of the year, we expect that provision will continue to
grow faster than loans, a trend that is fully contemplated in our earnings expectations.
Turning to our revenue performance on slide 10, FX-adjusted revenues were down 2%. When we adjust for both FX
and Costco-related revenues to get at the underlying trend, revenue grew at 7%.
I will say that adjusted revenue growth in the quarter outperformed our own internal expectation, as in the month of
March, billings and revenue both came in above our plans. We are pleased with the momentum in our adjusted revenue
growth rate, and we are encouraged to begin the year a bit above the full year range we provided at Investor Day of 5%
to 6% adjusted revenue growth.
Looking at the components of revenue in more detail, discount revenue declined by 3% but increased by 6% on an
adjusted basis. The discount rate in the quarter was 2.45%, up 1 basis point year-over-year, due to lower rate volumes
coming off the network, more than offsetting the impact from merchant negotiations, mix and the continued rollout of
OptBlue in the U.S.
While the discount rate increased year-over-year, the ratio of discount revenue to billed business declined by 4 basis
points, which I will come back to in just a minute.
Net card fees grew by 7% in the quarter reflecting continued strength in our premium U.S. portfolios, including
Platinum, Gold and Delta, as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia.
The Platinum fee increases we announced in March are not yet impacting the results as the fee increase for existing
customers does not go into effect until September.
Other fees and commissions grew 5% in the quarter, while other revenue declined by 16%. Other revenue growth is
impacted by the sale of a small business, which provided back office systems to run third-party loyalty programs during
December 2016.
Net interest income is down 5% due to lower average loans, but increased 15% on an adjusted basis driven by the 12%
growth in adjusted loans and the higher net interest yield that I mentioned previously.
Coming back now to the ratio, discount revenue to billed business on slide 12, you can see that this ratio was down 4
basis points versus the prior year, while the reported discount rate was up 1 basis point.
The decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billings this quarter is driven by a shift in billings mix towards GNS and
higher incentive payments to cobrand and corporate card partners as the volumes in those categories accelerate.
Turning now to total expenses on slide 13, our expenses were 1% higher than the prior year during the first quarter;
though I'd note that performance trends varied across the different expense lines.
At Investor Day, we highlighted that our spending on Card Member engagement is reflected across marketing and
promotion rewards and Card Member services expenses. And I'll discuss the changes in those P&L lines on the
following slide.
Moving to operating expenses, total operating costs during the quarter were down 3% versus the prior year. I'd remind
you that in the prior year, operating expenses were impacted by the $127 million gain from the JetBlue portfolio sale
and an $84 million restructuring charge.
We continue to make progress on our cost reduction initiatives, and believe that we are on track to remove $1 billion in
the company's cost base on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017.
As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect the year-over-year decline in operating expenses to be larger as we exit
2017 than what we saw in Q1. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.9%, which is below our full year 2017
expectation of 33% to 34%.

The Q1 tax rate benefited from some discrete tax items. We continue to believe that our full year rate will be more in
line with our 33% to 34% expectation.
Moving to the summary of our Card Member engagement spending on slide 14, total engagement spending in Q1 was
$2.8 billion or 4% higher than the prior year. Looking at the components of that spending, as expected, M&P was down
4% versus the prior year. These results are consistent with our comments at Investor Day about anticipating a reduction
in our M&P spending versus 2016 levels. We continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our marketing spend by
using our scale to consistently drive cost savings from our ongoing marketing operations.
We also continued to shift our focus towards existing Card Members and increase our use of digital channels, both of
which can add efficiencies. With all these efforts, despite a lower level of marketing spend, we acquired more new
cards during the first quarter than we did during Q4, including 1.7 million cards across our U.S. issuing businesses, and
2.6 million on a worldwide basis.
Over 60% of the global consumer cards we acquired in the quarter came through digital channels. And digital is
particularly important, as you know, for acquiring new millennial Card Members.
Going forward, we continue to anticipate that full year 2017 M&P will be lower than 2016 and more similar to full year
2015 levels. I'd note, however, that the ultimate level of marketing expenses will be influenced by our financial
performance and the opportunities present in the marketplace.
Moving to rewards. Consistent with our Investor Day expectations, rewards expense was up 6%, despite a small decline
in proprietary billing volumes versus the prior year. Adjusting for the Costco cobrand volumes in the prior year,
rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 20%, while adjusted proprietary billings grew by 6%. This
growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost to proprietary billings of 87 basis points. The greater
year-over-year increase in reward expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S.
Platinum products, that we implemented at the beginning of Q4 2016, as well as continued strong growth in our Delta
cobrand portfolio.
Cost of Card Member services increased 14% reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services,
including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta.
As we highlighted at Investor Day, this is an area where we can offer differentiated benefits and will continue to invest
as evidenced by the roll-out of the new Uber benefit on our Platinum cards a few weeks ago.
Turning now to slide 15 and touching on capital. We continue to use our strong balance sheet position to return a
significant amount of capital to shareholders. Over the last nine quarters, we have returned 101% of the capital we have
generated. I think this shows the commitment we have over time to leveraging our business model and capital position
to steadily create shareholder value. Now, we, of course, just completed our submission for the 2017 CCAR process
earlier this month.
And as I'm sure you're all aware, the process continues to evolve each year. We remain confident in the strength of our
business model and our ability to drive shareholder value through capital returns. Now, of course, we also use capital to
support business-building activities, such as growth in our loan balances, potential M&A activity, in addition to
returning capital through dividends and share buybacks.
I'd also remind you that our capital plan for the upcoming year will be dependent upon the Fed's review, and we expect
to hear back from them about our submission in June.
Stepping back, over the past several years we have embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and
drive sustainable revenue growth. Those efforts, which we covered at Investor Day, include amongst others, focusing
on further penetrating commercial payments by leveraging our small business and middle market assets and our global
commercial segment, driving more organic growth through expanded engagement with existing customers, better
leveraging our digital and big data capabilities for new customer acquisition and other targeting, growing our merchant
network, and pursuing lending expansion opportunities. These actions were targeted to provide a mix of returns over
the short, medium and longer term.

While the impact from those efforts will play out over time, we are encouraged with the trend that we have seen in our
business metrics and revenue growth over the past several quarters. And believe that these initiatives are driving real
momentum. As we look out to the balance of the year, we believe that our outlook for the full year 2017 EPS to be
between $5.60 and $5.80 remains appropriate.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we anticipate that EPS will grow through the year, and as we have in the past, we will
continue to balance delivering earnings to the bottom line and investing for the moderate to long term. We do believe
that our 2017 plans appropriately balance shorter term profitability with the steps we need to take to generate
sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.
With that, let me turn it back over to Toby and we'll move to Q&A.
Toby Willard
Thanks, Jeff.
Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank
you for your cooperation.
And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Kerry?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thanks and good results. I guess, I'm just making sure that the EPS outperformance in the
first quarter relative to what you articulated at the Analyst Day was really a result of revenue outperformance as you
mentioned, Jeff. And I guess when we think about the difference between the $5.60 versus the $5.80 in your range, is
the difference how much you'd spend on investments?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, a couple comments, Sanjay, and thank you for the question. You are correct that
relative to our expectations early in March at Investor Day, what surprised us frankly in the month of March was how
strong the revenue performance came in.
And so that is the main driver of why our EPS for the quarter ended up being a little bit stronger than I would have
expected back in that first week of March. On the margins, I'd also point out that we had a few tax discrete items. We're
always working on various tax audit settlements and things like that. They're a little bit hard to time, and so those came
in and added a couple pennies as well, although over the course of the year that number is not particularly material.
In terms of our guidance for the year, I guess, I'd come back to what I said in my earlier remarks. Sanjay, we feel really
good about the start we're off to, but gosh, it's only one quarter and we have a lot of work to do as we go through the
year. Certainly, we are encouraged by the revenue performance, and I would say based on the first quarter, I certainly
think it's much likelier that we will be at the higher end of the revenue range that I talked about at Investor Day, which
was for adjusted revenue growth to be at 5% to 6%. But we'd like a little bit more time pass before we convert that into
what that might mean for EPS.
I would just conclude by saying we certainly feel very confident in the $5.60 to $5.80 EPS guidance range that we have
reconfirmed again today.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Great. Thanks, Sanjay.

Thank you. And now to the line of Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Just to follow up on that, on Sanjay's line of questioning. You've in the
past articulated various scenarios for revenue growth translating into certain levels of earnings growth. And so given
that you're now accelerating towards the high end of your range, which is really quite impressive given the competitive
environment, how do we conceptualize that relationship between revenue growth and operating leverage as it relates to
the earnings outlook?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, you're right, Eric, that we have a pretty simple financial model we like to talk about,
which all starts with taking advantage of the range of revenue growth opportunities we have and to the extent we can
get good revenue growth, the fixed cost nature of our business allows us to get pretty steady operating expense
leverage. And the fact that we're not overly capital intensive in our business allows us to use our capital strength to add
a little bit more to EPS growth. It's a pretty simple model, but it all starts with the revenue growth line.
You heard us talk a lot at Investor Day in early March about how focused we are on the objective of getting to a
sustainable 6% revenue growth rate and when you look at the business model we have if we can achieve that, we
certainly are then confident we can get to EPS growth of more than 10%, steadily.
What I would say, this is one quarter. We feel really good about the quarter we're in. Certainly in 2017, I'd remind you
that when you think about the prior year including a big gain on a couple of portfolio sales as well as a half a year of
earnings from the partnership that we no longer have, our EPS growth if you consider those things in 2017 is, of course,
quite high; way, way, way above the more than 10% level, and that's because we're getting an unusual amount of
operating expense leverage because of our efforts to take $1 billion out of the cost structure. And because as we've built
into our guidance and as we're off to a good start on, we have pretty good revenue growth in the projections we have
for 2017.
So, what all that translates into 2018 and beyond, we'll have to see. But I think we feel pretty positive about the start
we're off to this year.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Looking to ask a question on a less glamorous subject. Could you
comment on where attrition has been running and how that's trended over the last 12 months? The new account growth
is very impressive and I just was hoping to balance it with the other side of the equation. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Sure. Thanks for the question. As you have heard us talk about probably in multiple
forums, when you look across our geographies and our customer segments, our attrition rates are modest and actually
remarkably stable. They just don't move that much.
I think it certainly got a lot of attention when we talked about the fact for a few weeks last year, in the U.S. Consumer
premium segment, when you looked at our Platinum Card you had a very modest uptick in attrition that quickly came
back down. But all of these numbers for attrition across all of our businesses are in the low single-digits on an
annualized basis. So, we really haven't seen any change when I look across the different businesses and the different
geographies, Craig, in those numbers.

And to just finish off the Platinum story, while we saw that one little blip for a few weeks, in fact, we ended 2016 with
more Platinum Card Members in the U.S. than we've ever had and more spending on the Platinum Card than we've ever
had in a year.
So, we are always focused on providing great values to our customers. We very much try to target our value
propositions at customers who want to build long-term relationships with the company; that's what we're all about. And
right now we don't see any signs of any change in our ability to do that.
So thank you for the question.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, good evening, Jeff. I was wondering if I can ask a question on rewards. They were up 20%
year-over-year. I believe last quarter you talked about something closer to 13%. Is this really just the ramping up of the
costs associated with the updated Platinum Card value proposition? Are you still expecting rewards to grow at that
pace? Or given the changes that you made, are you now expecting them to grow faster? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So, a couple things. Good question, Ryan. If you go back probably a year, you heard us
first say at our Investor Day in 2016 that when you just acknowledge the reality of the competitive environment, mostly
in the U.S. Consumer segment, we said at the time we expected our rewards costs to grow a little faster than billings. In
fact, if you look at most of 2015 and 2016, they really weren't. They were growing roughly in line with billings, but our
expectation for some time has been that you would in select cases see us change some value propositions.
In early October of last year, we did make some more significant value proposition changes in both the business and
consumer Platinum products in the U.S. We're pleased with the early results on both of those. But that step-up is what
drove our rewards costs up. In Q4 of 2016, I'd say you saw probably the full effect, because you probably didn't get
quite the full effect in Q4. In this quarter, and so you will continue to see that ball park level of year-over-year increase
until we're done lapping those changes as you get to the last quarter of 2017.
All that said, I would remind everyone, we feel good as a general matter about our value propositions today. And I
think the mere fact that we had another really strong quarter of acquiring new Card Members is a demonstration that
across the range of geographies and customer segments and products that we have, we think we have very competitive
value propositions when you look at both what Doug Buckminster referred to at our Investor Day is the sort of real
table stakes elements of the product, which are about rewards and pricing, as well as the experiential value that we
work very hard to uniquely offer given the range of unique strengths we have.
So I would expect to see, in sum, the rewards costs continue to grow for the next couple of quarters. It is mostly
Platinum although there's also some really nice growth we're seeing in a few of our cobrand relationships like Delta that
also pushed the number up a little bit. But it's mostly Platinum and we should be done lapping it as we get to the end of
the year [indiscernible] (34:48).

Thank you. And now to the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi. Thanks, Jeff. I just want to ask you, it's on slide 16 of the appendix. If you don't have it in
front of you, I don't want to disorient you. But the question is the spending per Card Member did decline to $3,297 this
quarter. And I was just wondering if you could just give some context. In fairness, when you look at it, it does look

seasonal, but any context that you can give, if you don't have that in front of you, that's fine. But is that $3,297 is that a
good or a bad number? Should that be going up or down? The context for that should be helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: I'll admit I'm paging through, James.
<Q - James Friedman>: I'm sorry. It's...
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: To be exact with the numbers. But I guess I'd make a few comments. First off, remember,
when you look at average spend year-over-year, the sale of the Costco cobrand has caused some dislocation that tend
to, on a year-over-year basis, actually go in the other direction because the average spend per card was a little lower.
When you look sequentially, and Toby just handed me this. Yeah. So if you look – now, I don't have the page in front
of me. So you see that when you look year-over-year at the 7% increase.
When you go sequentially by quarter, you are correct that in Q4, most of us – and I put myself in this camp – tend to
spend a little bit more in Q4, given the holiday season, than you do in other times of the year. So I don't particularly see
anything in the sequential change that should be particularly meaningful. I think the more significant thing is to look at
the year-over-year change where you're taking the seasonality out, you do see it up a little bit. Although as I said that is
aided somewhat by the shift in the mix of cards because of the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio.
<Q - James Friedman>: Got it. Thanks for the Hail Mary there, Toby.
<A - Toby Willard>: Thank you, Jamie.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes, Jeff, I wanted to just shift gears to cobrands briefly. I think you have the Hilton deal that
might be coming up. Can you talk about when that renews and size it? And also, how you view sort of an airline hotel
deal versus a retail deal?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think, Don, as I'm sure you expect me to say, we really value all of our cobrand
partners. And I would put Hilton in that category and you didn't ask, but it's probably on your mind, I would put SPG in
that category and we work really hard every day to create value for our Card Members, for our partners, and for our
shareholders.
Beyond that, I can't comment on specific contract terms or what might be the ultimate outcome of Marriott as they
think about what to do with the two cobrands that are now offered to both Marriott Rewards and SPG Card Members or
what Hilton might choose to do as it thinks about its current two cobrand partners.
What I would say is that to the distinction you made, we do think that there are certain types of cobrand partners who
are interested in building value and business together. Cobrand partners who are focused on some of the travel and
entertainment oriented strengths that we have, I would remind you that we run a big consumer travel agency and we
have a joint venture to run a big business travel agency and we have a long, long, long, long legacy of being very strong
in attracting a customer base that is very travel oriented.
And so we do think that allows us to bring some unique strengths to travel co-oriented cobrands that's quite frankly
probably aren't there in certain retail cobrands where often a retailer as we've talked about on and off over the last
couple years, often the retailer is really after in many ways a payment vehicle that will allow their customers to do
some level of borrowing.
And while as you know, one of our strategic initiatives is trying to capture more of our own customers' borrowing
behaviors, as a general matter, we remain a spend-centric oriented company and we're less likely to be real focused on
or real competitive on products where the economics are really driven 100% by lending. So we'll have to see where
things like Marriott and Hilton go going forward, but we're focused every day on providing value to those partners.

<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: Thank you. Good afternoon. So, Jeff, 7% revenue growth in the quarter and March was the
strongest and you had the leap year effect. So, I mean, I guess that would suggest that there's a possibility that you
could have some accelerating – an acceleration in revenue growth. And I know you're reiterating 5% to 6% and I know
you're only through one quarter, but looking at the trends it seems like you might be able to go above the high end of
that range.
And then partly affecting that, it's kind of – I mean, I've covered this company a long time, the International business
seems to have more momentum than I can remember. The spend growth accelerating each of the last three quarters, is
that helping to drive that acceleration? And why is International – I mean, you're still just scratching the surface of the
potential, but why is International – is it just more investment there? So, sorry, it's kind of two questions but related.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, thanks to the question, Bob. Certainly we are encouraged, as I said, by the
momentum we see across our billings growth, our loan growth and our revenue growth. It is early in the year, right, and
I guess I'd make just a few balancing comments. Yes, March came in stronger than we expected and certainly revenue
growth came in stronger than we expected. We do do a little bit of rounding.
I will point out to simplify on the slides if you go calculate the precise numbers you'll see that our Q4 revenue growth
rate on an adjusted basis was about 6.4% and in Q1, it was 6.6%. So it does round 6% to 7%, but you have to put it into
a little perspective.
Leap day certainly hurt us in Q1. I will say outside the U.S., and particularly in our business segment, Easter moving to
April probably helped us a little bit. And then yeah, we feel really good about the momentum we have had – built over
International.
So you will see some modest wins though as you get later into the year for some regulatory reasons I talked that's going
to impact the Network business. That will have a bigger billings impact in revenue or profit impact. It has some small
revenue impact. So we're driving the management team on getting to as much revenue growth as we can get to. We are
really pleased with the start we're off to. As I did say earlier, it does certainly [indiscernible] (43:01) we should be at
the higher end of that 5% to 6% range that I talked about yesterday for the year for adjusted revenue growth. I just think
we'd like to see a little bit more time pass and a little bit more [indiscernible] (43:17) before we move beyond that
number. So thank you for the comments.
<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Ho>: Yeah, appreciate the comments on March. Just curious, there's been a lot of debate on the disconnect
between rising consumer confidence in the U.S. and not translating to overall kind of consumer spend, but obviously,
you're seeing it in certain areas.
Your T&E billings for the U.S. are still down year-over-year, but certainly trends are looking better. How much you
think upside do you believe based on your new rewards propositions in some of these service-oriented categories, travel
and entertainment, would you capture kind of in the next cycle if it were to play out? Obviously, it's not really in your
numbers and your guidance so far.

<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah. Well, there's probably a couple questions there, David. The first thing I'd say is that
through March 31, as we look at our results, it's hard for us to see anything that's suggestive of a material uptick in
consumer confidence or consumer or commercial spending. While we have been gaining momentum, as we look at the
many different areas gaining momentum, we can see a change that we have made in how we're running the business
and what value propositions we're offering, et cetera, that seems to be what is driving the change, as opposed to us
getting the benefit of just a generally stronger economic environment.
So certainly, we are as hopeful as anyone that there, in fact, is stronger economic growth to come in the future. I just
can't say I see any evidence of it right now in our results.
As to your comment on T&E, certainly, one aspect of the changes we've announced in the U.S. to our Platinum
products is to position them both for the Consumer and Small Business segment as being the go-to products for the
premium, travel-oriented Card Member. And we do think that positions us even better than we already are for – or
positions us to be in a good spot to benefit from any increase in consumer spending or commercial spending in those
areas.
As I say that, I would remind you that I think we still consider and go into that latest round of changes as a very, very
strong player in the T&E segment. And I think that is the company's heritage. It remains a tremendous strength of the
company. Certainly, we have broadened our offerings tremendously over the last couple of decades. But that T&E
strength we do think continues in the latest moves we made are just the latest step in ensuring that we don't lose that
positioning.
So we'll have to see. I certainly hope that we see an uptick in spending. I just can't say we've seen it yet. So thank you,
David, for the question.
<Q - David Ho>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now to the line of Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Okay. Thanks for taking my question, Jeff. Just curious, I mean, it's been observed, the
strength in the International business, you talked about the decline. You pointed to some anomalies related to the tax
rate. I am curious if one of the things that we're seeing here is the greater contribution from your International
businesses on the tax rate, and given potential tax reform, something everybody should be thinking about.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, you are correct. If you just think about the U.S. with the cobrand portfolio sales,
and really steady, nice growth in International, you are correct that we're generating a little bit more of our earnings
outside the U.S. And that does have a positive impact on our tax run rate. And that's actually why even for the year
before any of the discrete items that came in this quarter, we gave slightly lower guidance for the tax run rate than what
you'd seen in the prior year results.
Tax reform, boy, we'll have to see. As you've heard us say in other forums, due to the nature of our business, we have a
pretty darn high effective tax rate. And if you dig through the details of our financial statements, you will realize, we
pretty much paid that full tax rate in cash to the U.S. So we are a very, very significant taxpayer, so any lowering of
corporate rates in the U.S., we are likely to be a significant winner on because we're not a particular beneficiary of any
of the varied and many things that help other organizations, in fact, pay lower rates. So we'll have to see. Certainly
we're not running the company counting on any changes in the tax area, but it would be a great thing if it were to
happen.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hey, Jeff, and just to follow up on that, given that you talked about the tax rate coming back
up a little bit through the remainder of the year and not to read too much into the first quarter tax rate, does that suggest
that you think that the business mix is going to shift a little bit? Is there an implication there that we should be
considering?

<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No, it's really just the math, Rick, of if you take the size of the settlements that drove the
discrete items in Q1, in a single quarter, they were enough to drag your tax rate out of our 33% to 34% range, if we
don't have other settlements, which I generally don't build them into my forward-looking comments because they're
harder to forecast. Over the course of a full year, they aren't quite enough to pull you out of your range. They certainly
would – what I would expect will pull us to the lower end of that range, but not necessarily out. But there's no
differential assumption I'm making about mix.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Thanks, Rick.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Arren Cyganovich from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arren Cyganovich>: Thanks. I was surprised of the strength of the net interest yield. You mentioned that there
was some seasonal benefit in the first quarter. I was just curious is if you think that current mix shift that you're getting
also as a benefit will continue. And maybe just your thoughts on the future trajectory of that net interest yield for the
card loan business.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, you're correct, Arren. There is a seasonal element, but as I mentioned earlier there's
really quite a number of other factors that have helped us steadily drive the net interest yield up, including some pricing
actions we've taken, including the fact that with the funding mix we have right now, the personal savings rates we have
on our deposits haven't really moved so, in fact, the Fed interest rates increases so far have been a net positive for the
company, including the mix of customers moving to one where there's a little bit more revolve, which of course, helps
the yield.
And then we also – and this is a benefit that will aid it over time, you're helped a little bit right now because we had in
our efforts to win back cobrand Card Members over the last year or two, we had a number of people who were on
introductory or promotional offers who are flipping into paying regular rates now and that's helping move the rate up a
little bit right now.
So it's a lot of factors there. Seasonality fades a little bit and the one-time impact from winning back some of the
cobrand Card Members will fade a bit over time, but all the other things, we think, will hold and we think this
continues more broadly. Could be an area where there is a long, long runway for steady growth in net interest income,
right. And where we've been growing our loans by having over 50% of the increase come from existing customers,
boy, those are people we know. We understand their risk profile. It's further cementing the broad customer relationship
we have with them. So we feel really good about what we're doing here.
<Q - Arren Cyganovich>: Thank you.
<A - Toby Willard>: All right. Kerry, we'll take one more question. Thanks.
Operator
All right. And that comes from the line of Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in here. So most of my questions were asked and
answered already, but I did just want to follow up on a comment you made, Jeff, about some of the initiatives you're
taking to attract millennials to the platform. Perhaps you can elaborate a little bit on what you're doing within the
context of a recent New York Times article on the topic.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, Jason, I appreciate the question. I think first off it's important to maybe level set a
little bit the facts. So if you look at last year in our Global Consumer – I'll get to B2B in a minute, but in our Global

Consumer business, over [ph] 55% (53:11) new customers brought in [indiscernible] (53:16). And in fact, that number
was up about 16% versus the prior year.
If you look at the growing number of applications of new Card Members who are coming through mobile channels as
you would expect, almost half of those new applicants and Card Members are millennials.
If you look at the things we do as a company in the digital sphere, we talk a lot about how the unique nature of our
closed loop network allows us to be particularly adept at working with companies in the social media, digital, and
payments field. We really feel like we have been at the forefront of how you bring those three worlds of digital and
social media and payments together. And the partnerships we've done with Airbnb, with Twitter, with Facebook,
[indiscernible] (54:16) Facebook to have an Amex spot.
When you look at our pay with points program, which is much broader than anyone else's in the industry, it is
disproportionately used by our millennial customers. So we feel really good about our track record of attracting
millennials to the franchise. We feel really good about the range of things we do using our unique assets to appeal to
millennials.
And lastly, I'd say though, whether you're a millennial or a baby boomer or in any cohort we are, however, about
building long-term customer relationships. And we build products, we build value propositions, we build service
experiences that are trying to attract and retain people who are about long-term [ph] relationships, not necessarily
(55:18) people who are looking for the latest great thing and they're going to swap out of it in six months.
So, look, you can never do enough in this area. So we're focused every day on trying to do better, but I think our track
record with millennials is strong. And I think our ability to leverage our unique assets is strong. So I appreciate the
question, but we feel pretty good about what we're doing here, so.
