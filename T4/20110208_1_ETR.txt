MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please stand by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Release
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for introductions and opening comments, I would like to
turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please go ahead, ma'm.
Paula Waters, Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard; and then Leo Denault, Entergy's CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate
everyone with questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions. After the Q&A
session, I will close with the applicable legal statements. Wayne?
J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thanks, Paula. I'll begin today with our most frequently asked question, what's the latest in New York and
Vermont? Starting in Vermont, at the end of October, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board denied a late-filed
contention on hard to access electric cables, finding that reopening the case was not likely to lead to a different
outcome. The petitioner, the New England Coalition, appealed that decision to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In
parallel, we continued to supply the NRC staff information on related issues to ensure the safety valuation report
remains complete as time continues to pass. And as you know, we are over five years since our original filing.
Regardless, once the expected supplement to that safety valuation report is issued, we're expecting a positive decision
from the NRC on the [inaudible] license renewal application. Importantly, NRC regulations allow for the Commission
to issue the license during a pending appeal.

We are committed to maintaining an open and timely communications in Vermont, however great the challenge is,
from a – for gaining public support and disproving the negative put in the public's mind that the age of the plant is
determinant of its condition. That is essentially the position Governor Shumlin took last month when he said, "it was
designed to be shut down in 2012 and that 40 years is up in 2012." He went on to say, "it's old, it's tired and it should be
retired." In fact, he has encouraged New York to take the same position.
States or Governors are certainly free to voice their opinions, but the NRC, which has jurisdiction in these matters,
must deal with the facts. The truth is, what those in the industry already know to be true, that the 40-year license was
based on the expected economic life, not the physical life, that nuclear plants were designed for. Recognizing this fact,
the NRC set two principles in reviewing license renewal applications: first, that all operating plants provide and
maintain an acceptable level of safety; and secondly, each plant's licensing basis is required to be maintained during the
renewal term in the same manner and to the same extent as during the original licensing terms.
To that point, with the constant replacement of equipment and design upgrades, most of the 1970's vintage plants are in
excellent operating condition. And Vermont Yankee's operating record certainly supports that fact. For example, during
the first 30 years of its life, Vermont Yankee's average capacity factor was below 78% and it never had a breaker to
breaker run. Over the last five years, the capacity factor has been above 94% and it has had two breaker to breaker runs.
In fact, Vermont Yankee has been evaluated in the excellent category as compared to its peers.
Efforts also continue to secure a new power purchase agreement with the Vermont utilities. Negotiations have been
ongoing for some time now and we have made progress toward reaching agreement on key terms and conditions that
would provide citizens of Vermont continued access to clean and affordable power. However, while we would certainly
prefer to sell power in-state, that is not a necessary condition, of course. We expect to have clarity by around the middle
of 2011 on all the open issues we are pursuing, including but not limited to procuring a PPA with the local utilities.
The importance of Vermont Yankee's continued operations to Vermont was highlighted in a presentation given last
month by the ISO New England to a Vermont Senate Committee. The system operators' assessment of the reliability of
the Vermont electric systems found what you would expect. That was without Vermont Yankee, existing state
reliability risk increased. [inaudible] studies on the performance and costs of transmission solution alternatives to VY
are expected in the first half of 2011. But not only would reliability likely deteriorate, studies have shown power rates
would also rise as supply is reduced.
To that point, on January 26, 2011, IBM, the major employer in Vermont, said quote, it pays about $35 million a year
in power, to power its Vermont facility and the company estimates those costs will go up by 25% if Vermont Yankee
goes offline. And in an open letter to Governor Shumlin on February 3, 2011, community leaders representing industry,
labor and energy stakeholders expressed concern as the window of opportunity was closing to allow the Public Service
Board to complete its docket of Vermont Yankee's operations beyond 2012 and emphasized the serious economic
consequences for Vermont if the plant is not allowed to operate under a renewed license.
One final note on Vermont Yankee, in early on November we announced a process for potential sale of the plant. The
confidential nature of the process does not allow me to provide any updates today, but all our actions remain consistent
with the objective of keeping the plant open and meeting stakeholder needs. For the pessimists, and I know there may
be a lot of you out there on this issue, one thing you should know is – and it may not have been communicated well, but
over the last few years, VY's earnings contribution to Entergy at best has simply covered its fully allocated overhead;
some of that is fixed and some of that is variable.
Turning to New York, on December 3rd, a significant milestone was achieved when the NRC issued the final
supplemental environmental impact statement. In short, the NRC staff concluded that there were no environmental
impacts that would preclude another 20 years of operation for the Indian Point units. The ASLB will now hold hearings
on these new contentions, which begin at the end of this year or early next.
Also in December, the administrative law judges with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation
issued a ruling and schedule in the water quality certification and the state pollutant discharge elimination system, or
SPDES, water permit proceedings. The schedule is set for hearings to begin June 14th before the ALJs on a number of

issues, including the threshold issue regarding whether Entergy could even obtain air permits necessary to build and
operate cooling towers at Indian Point, given the air quality nonattainment status in the area. Related issues, of course,
include effectiveness of our proposed best technology available alternative, waste water screens. A decision by the
ALJs on the issues to be tried starting this summer could be referred to the commissioner of the New York Department
of Environmental Conservation by the end of this year or early next.
As you know, on January 18th, President Obama issued an executive order based upon the principles that the regulatory
system "Must protect public health, welfare, safety and our environment while promoting economic growth,
innovation, competitiveness and job creation and must promote predictability and reduce uncertainty and must identify
and use the best, most innovative and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends."
He went on to say, "A government-wide review of the rules already on the books to remove outdated regulations that
stifle job creation and make our economy less competitive." The executive order was issued to make clear "that this is
the operating principle of our government." Certainly, the cooling tower versus waste water screens matter at Indian
Point and similar cooling water intake issues around the nation would seem to be a good opportunity to meet the
President's stated operating principle for government as the EPA moves towards issuing new intake structure rules.
Then on January 27th, Chairman Fred Upton of the House Energy and Commerce Committee called on the NRC for
greater transparency and certainty in the license renewal process. He stated that "Gone are the days of reasonable
expectations for a stable and predictable regulatory process and that this uncertainty and lack of transparency in the
process is needlessly putting plants and thousands of jobs at risk." In particular, Chairman Upton cited the applications
for Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee, saying "Today marks an unfortunate milestone for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission as the timeline for the reactor renewal process has now doubled without explanation, eclipsing 60 months
with no end in sight."
And just yesterday, on the Senate side, in their own letter to the NRC, Senator [inaudible] referenced Chairman Upton's
letter as well as President Obama's executive order, questioning the extended timeframe to review license renewal
applications for plants in some areas of the country and the need to protect the rights of the applicants as well as the
public or local citizens in the process. They request responses to their specific questions by February 24th as well as
such things as e-mails and phone logs supporting the activity to-date. The mounting frustration on these issues seems to
be driven by the fact that Federal government has clear jurisdiction of these issues and Congress is questioning whether
that is being exercised as intended. In any event, we're hopeful that this increased attention will bring expedited
resolution.
Moving on to the utility, when we announced the [inaudible] spin-off in 2007, a lot of people questioned who would
want the utility stock when EWC or Enexus at the time, was so attractive. We answered those questions with our belief
that the utility was still a work in progress or unfinished business. Part of our strategy back in 1998, when we changed
management, was to make it the premier utility in America, but between dealing with operational issues and the cost to
rebuild the system after five of the six largest hurricanes in the history of the company and the fallout from numerous
system agreement disputes, we have never achieved the full potential that we had envisioned for the utility. But today,
it is a lot closer than it was then and it's a lot closer than some may have noticed.
In October of last year, we raised our long-term net income outlook for the utility segment to a 6% to 8% compound
average growth through 2014 from the previous 5% to 6%; one of the fastest growing utilities, if not the fastest, in the
country. As you know, we have secured recovery of $2.4 billion of storm costs and established cash reserves of nearly
$330 million today, something achieved we wouldn't have imagined even possible five years ago. One of the two key
drivers of the industry-leading outlook is earning our allowed ROEs in all jurisdictions, particularly in Arkansas and
Texas. The rate actions approved in both states in 2010 were constructive, but there's still more work to be done.
Looking ahead, timely recovery of increasing capacity costs is expected to be a significant risk affecting Entergy Texas'
future financial performance. To that end, we are working with our State legislatures on legislation to be introduced in
the near future that would give the PUCT exclusive authority to implement streamlining measures such as distribution
and cost recovery riders, purchase power capacity riders and a formula rate plan.

Another substantial aspect of Utility growth plans are additional investments that are consistent with our obligations to
maintain effective and efficient operations. In January, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the
acquisition of the 580 megawatt Acadia Plant with cost recovery beginning immediately after purchase. With this final
regulatory approval now in hand, closing is target by March 31st. After the Acadia acquisition closing, four of the
utility operating companies will have acquired five plants since 2005 through a well-developed highly regulated and
disciplined procurement process, the same we expect to use and continue to use going forward.
On that point, utility operating companies continue to negotiate on potential acquisitions of two gas-fired generation
resources and an approximately 500 megawatt PPA proposal of a third-party supplier identified in the summer of 2009
long-term RFP that concluded last summer. While no definitive agreements have been reached to-date, we remain in
active discussion, targeting conclusion at around the end of the first quarter.
Regarding the Nine Mile Self-Build Project, a fourth resource, selective through the RFP evaluation process that was
certified by the independent monitor, project development activities are ongoing with the definitive announcement
estimated in the first half of 2011. This 550 megawatts combined-cycle natural gas plant is targeted for completion no
later than the summer of 2015.
On a less positive note, Westinghouse has informed us that they will be unable to deliver Waterford 3's replacement
steam generators for installation this spring as originally planned. After hydrostatic testing, which is the last step in the
fabrication process, Westinghouse found separation of stainless steel cladding from the carbon steel base metal and the
channel head on both replacement steam generators in areas beneath and adjacent to the divider plate. For those who do
not have a Ph.D. in engineering, let's just say that would be a bad thing. Westinghouse continued its analysis to
determine the root cause and develop repair options.
Meanwhile, back at Entergy, spring 2011 retooling activities will include extensive inspections to validate preliminary
engineering analysis that supports Waterford 3 operating safely for another full cycle before replacement of the steam
generator.
In transmission, the FERC approved an interim extension of the Independent Coordinator of Transmission arrangement
in November 2010, and in certain enhancements to that arrangement in December 2010, providing for analysis of
longer term structures. Charles River Associates has completed the cost-benefit analysis studies on the Entergy system
joining the Southwest Power Pool, as well as Entergy Arkansas joining the Southwest Power Pool on a stand-alone
basis.
They're expected to complete comparable cost-benefit analysis on the Entergy System or Entergy Arkansas stand-alone
joining the Midwest ISO at the end – by the end of February. Results of these studies will be critical factors to retail
regulators, including the Entergy Regional State Committee, or what we all call the ERSC on evaluating alternatives
for the current transmission structure.
Under the procedural schedule established by the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Entergy Arkansas' assessment
of its proposed system agreement strategic options is due in May. Last October, Charles Rivers and Associates (sic)
[Charles River Associates]' final report on the cost and benefits of Entergy Arkansas joining SPT on a stand-alone basis
found that the moderate power exchange and variable economic benefits were not sufficient to offset the fixed costs of
Entergy Arkansas joining the SPT RPO. The Arkansas Public Service Commission has set a target date of October 7,
2011 for a final order on Entergy Arkansas' post system agreement structure.
We need look no further than the most recent system agreement issued to illustrate why the current agreement has been
the source of so much dispute. An initial decision by the FERC ALJ, issued last December, found that Entergy's
accounting for wholesale opportunity energy sales violated the system agreement and awarded refunds to the utility
operating companies. This case concerned a limited amount of short-term wholesale energy sales, less than 0.5% of the
total system to third parties from 2000 to 2009.
In previous orders, the FERC rejected arguments that these sales were inconsistent with the system agreement and that
the other operating companies had a right of first refusal on these assets. Subsequent to the ALJ's initial decision, the
FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions in January, supporting the company's actual practices and consistent with utility

operating companies' rationale filed in its own briefs. We continue to believe we and the FERC staff are on the right
side of this issue. And given past practice and supporting FERC decisions and FERC staff positions, we were very
surprised by the ALJ's initial decision.
Turning to 2011, we have numerous goals at the utility, basically with regard to the regulatory calendar. In addition to
the annual formula rate plan filings in Louisiana, Mississippi and New Orleans, the utility will address potential timing
of future rate case filings and continue to pursue other regulatory mechanisms, like riders on formula rate plans in
Texas and Arkansas; and the future regulatory processes and structures going to the Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Louisiana, given that the FRP framework expires with the 2010 test year.
Achieving resolution on long-standing issues regarding transmission structure and system agreement is another
aspiration. For this to happen in 2011, it will require parties to put the scars of numerous years of litigation behind them
and focus on what is important now. There are numerous things that we believe that we can agree on, but achieving
total agreement among the retail regulators on every issue is highly unlikely. But we clearly believe it is in everybody's
best interest to come to a self-determined, mutual agreement on many of the issues that we can agree on as possible.
Operationally, during 2011, the utility will focus on managing major projects in its capital plan, consistent with cost
and schedule objectives, including planned fossil fuel – possible generation acquisitions in the self-build CCGT plant,
nuclear's [inaudible] upgrades and revised plan to install the Waterford 3 replacement steam generators, and ongoing
transmission in generation investment projects. Completion of the majority of these projects is planned for 2012 and
beyond.
Regarding EWC's goals in 2011, EWC will continue to focus first and foremost on maintaining safe and secure
operations for its generating fleet. But I can't emphasize enough the importance and the effort we put to resolving
lingering uncertainties on license renewal. The NRC operating licenses expire next year not only at Vermont Yankee
but also at Pilgrim. While Indian Points' license renewal process will extend beyond 2011, EWC will focus on
encouraging the federal and state regulatory processes to move toward an expeditious conclusion. In addition, EWC
will continue to execute on opportunistic but disciplined portfolio and risk management activities and transactions like
the sale of the Harrison County power plant, which closed on December 31, 2010.
Before turning over to Leo, I want to recap a strong year of operational and financial accomplishments. Not only did
we set another record for the sixth year in a row, and ten out of the last 11 years since 1999, for the highest
consolidated operational earnings per share in company history, we also had the highest ever operating cash flow in
company history. 2010 operational achievements are just as impressive.
At the utility, we achieved a number of constructive utility regulatory outcomes and improved customer service metrics
across the board compared to 2009. In nuclear, we delivered the highest utility fleet capability factor ever at 94.1%,
completed two breaker to breaker runs at Fitzpatrick and at Vermont Yankee, set new plant records in consecutive
operations at Fitzpatrick and Waterford 3 while at Pilgrim and Cooper record runs continue today, and recorded the
highest plant production for a cycle at Indian Point 2 and for a refueling year at Palisades. 2010 ended with more than
half of our nuclear plants evaluated in the excellent category as compared to its peers.
Despite this strong operational and financial performance, total shareholder return for 2010 was negative. The overhang
or uncertainties in New York and Vermont that I discussed earlier are certainly significant contributing factors, as is the
specter of the depressed power prices compared to previous expectations of the market as, evidenced by 2010 total
shareholder return in which the bottom two quartiles in the Philadelphia Utility Index were dominated by the so called
hybrid or merchant generators.
Having said that, we have to do a better job of driving the pace of favorably resolving the outstanding issues that we
can influence while continuing to enhance our market-based point of view on power prices and expediting the
execution of our hedging strategies, but maintaining the same discipline that we always have had in that regard. Just as
we have not been waiting on operational regulatory issues to resolve themselves, we have not lessened our resolve on
achieving the aspirations we have previously articulated.

Despite going from leader to laggard on stock price growth, we believe we have made substantial progress in meeting
our aspirations going forward. Utility is one of the fastest growing in the country and EWC is one of the better hedged
merchant generators relative to near-term commodity prices in a very uncertain market.
Operationally, new records have been set in almost every aspect of the business. At the same time, our board of
directors and management's commitment to seek and act on transactions that create value has not changed. The golden
strategies I discussed today are those same ones we've talked about for a long time now. If at times it seems we have
changed course or are saying something inconsistent with what we may have indicated only months earlier, it's only
because we are a market-based point of view company and that's how our strategies develop.
Nobody knows better than you all that markets are dynamic. Given the realities and uncertainties of the market, a static
point of view will inevitably lead to warehousing greater risk, lowering the probability of success and ultimately, it will
endanger the financial viability of the firm.
Options and optionality are good things and we strive to create and preserve them in the same way we think about
generating free cash flow. In particular, in times of economic stress, if you have enough cash and have preserved your
options, the future can look and can turn out very differently than if you're locked into a one-dimensional course of
action or strategy.
You can rest assured we continue to refine our point of view every day and to position the company with the flexibility
and financial and operational strengths so that we can and will execute on transactional opportunities at the appropriate
time consistent with the realities of the marketplace.
In regards to the board, I'm pleased to announce that former Senator Blanche Lincoln was elected to serve at the last
meeting. She was one of the most respected members of Congress and will bring immediate insight to the board and
management on virtually all of the issues I discussed today.
We look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Conference in April, and we will continue to establish the groundwork
for our strategies to capture opportunities for future success. Speaking of the Analyst Conference, we strongly
encourage you to book your travel reservations now if you have not already done so, because all flights into and out of
the city have sold out in past years for the Jazz and Heritage Festivals. We're in the planning stages now to make our
conference the most informative and the most memorable event that we've ever hosted.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Wayne. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2010
financial results, our cash performance for the quarter and the full year, an update on our share repurchase programs
and a review of our 2011 guidance, including some comments on quarterly timing of results.
Before we turn to results, I'd like to note that we have revised our business segment disclosures to reflect the internal
reorganization announced last June. Entergy will now report these three business segments: Utility, Entergy Wholesale
Commodities, or EWC, and Parent & Other. EWC is made up of all non-utility generation, a portion of which was
previously reported in Parent & Other. The utility segment has not changed. To assist in 2011 analysis, our release
includes restated 2009 and 2010 financial statements on a comparable basis.
In reviewing 2010 results, a few things stand out. As Wayne mentioned, we achieved record operational earnings per
share for the sixth year in a row; we completed the $750 million share repurchase program as scheduled. Utility EPS
grew nearly 23% and EWC completed the planned sale of its interest in the Harrison County power plant, which
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $44 million. And at our nuclear plants, we completed two breaker to breaker runs and set
two new records for consecutive operations.
Before I talk about the full year, I'll quickly review the financial results for the quarter. First, we completed the business
unwind of the infrastructure we had put in place to support the non-utility nuclear spin-off. As such, this is the final

quarter that results will include the special item associated with this effort.
Slide 2 summarizes fourth quarter 2010 as reported in operational earnings, showing a decrease compared to one year
ago. Turning to slide 3, the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results are outlined in more detail.
Starting with EWC, operational results were down versus fourth quarter 2009. The decrease was due to lower net
revenue and higher income tax expense. EWC's net revenue declined largely as a result of lower nuclear generation.
During the fourth quarter of this year, EWC's nuclear fleet experienced 72 outage days compared to only six outage
days in 2009. This quarter's outages included scheduled refueling outages totaling 43 days at Fitzpatrick and Palisades
as well as unplanned events, most notably the extended outage at IP2 when a main transformer had to be replaced.
EWC also had some positive items in the quarter including the gain on the sale of EWC's interest in the Harrison
County plant.
Now turning to the utility, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 were lower than last year. The major drivers were an
increase in non-fuel operation and maintenance expense due largely to higher fossil outage spending, the timing of
liability spending and higher compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by the net effect of higher other income
and net revenue. After excluding the effect of regulatory item that was offset in other income and the absence of the
2009 adjustments, net revenue increased $0.08 during the quarter. Sales in the fourth quarter 2010 were higher than last
year and the effect of regulatory actions also contributed to higher revenue.
Overall utility retail sales grew by 5.2% or 3.3% on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see economic recovery
across our service territory that mirrors national trends with slow but steady gains in employment and a continuation of
healthy industrial sector growth.
In industrial segment, sales grew 7% quarter-over-quarter. The positive benefits of facility expansions and the
economic rebound continued, although the growth has slowed somewhat as the recovery matures. Expansions
accounted for about half of the growth.
Looking at specific industrial segments, the trends from the first three quarters of 2010 continued. Chemicals, refining
and miscellaneous manufacturing remained the strongest sectors. Our refinery customers continue to run at high
utilization rates in spite of a challenging operating environment. Some of the refineries in Entergy's service area are
among the largest in the country and to-date have fared better than the average for their sector.
The chemicals segment has also done well with improvements in demand from exports and domestic end users of
chemicals in the automotive and general manufacturing industries. On the flipside, wood products continue to be a soft
spot due to troubles in the housing market but the segment is a small portion of Entergy's overall sales.
We are encouraged by the steady improvement in utility sales for all of our customer classes throughout 2010 and we
continue to expect 2011 retail sales growth in the 2% range or about 1% when you exclude industrial expansions and
co-generation losses. Finally, Parent & Other results declined in the fourth quarter due to several individually
insignificant items.
Slide 4 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow in the current quarter
was $761 million or approximately $160 million below the same quarter last year. This change was due to higher
pension funding, lower net revenue at EWC, and an increasing in refueling outage costs for EWC's nuclear plants due
to two refueling outages in this quarter versus none last year. These decreases were partially offset by lower working
capital requirements at the utility.
Moving to full-year results, slide 5 compares 2010 as reported and operational earnings to 2009. Higher earnings at the
utility were partially offset by the lower results at EWC; Parent & Other results were essentially unchanged.
On an operational basis, 2010 earnings per share ended the year at $7.10, up 6.4% over 2009. The main drivers for this

year.
Items providing a partial offset include lower net revenue at EWC, higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense
at the utility and EWC, as well as an increase in taxes, other than income, associated with strong utility revenue growth.
Slide 6 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the full year. For the year 2010, operating cash flow was the
highest in company history, at $3.9 billion. The $1 billion increase is due primarily to the receipt of roughly $700
million of proceeds associated with storm-related debt issuances for 2008 hurricanes in Louisiana, the absence of
hurricane and ice storm restoration spending at the utility and higher utility net revenue. Other factors including higher
pension funding and lower net revenue at EWC provided a partial offset.
I will now turn to an update on our share repurchase program, summarized on slide 7. During the fourth quarter, we
completed roughly $213 million of share repurchases, acquiring a total of 2.9 million shares at an average price of $73
per share. Of the repurchases made during the quarter, $209 million were applied to complete the $750 million
program. We also have available the $500 million share repurchase program, we announced last October.
As with any investment decision, execution is subject to our ongoing evaluation of business and financial conditions,
including evaluation against other potential opportunities. While we did not include this program in the mid-point of
our 2011 guidance, execution of it would fall within the overall range.
Slide 8 details our 2011 earnings guidance, which we are affirming today. 2011 guidance ranges from $6.35 to $6.85
per share on both an as reported and operational basis. The details shown on slide 8 should be familiar to you as they
have not changed since we initiated guidance last October. In keeping in pace with past practice, we have, however,
adjusted a few line items to reflect actual 2010 results.
One last point on earnings guidance as it relates to quarterly results, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, slide 9
outlines some key events to keep in mind when considering the quarters. Utility net revenue can be affected by the
timing of regulatory rate actions such as the Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas rate actions that were effective
around mid-2010. For EWC, scheduled refueling outages vary from year-to-year in both the timing and the number of
outages. Overall, we expect one last – less planned refueling outage in the fall of 2011 compared to 2010.
Quarter-over-quarter, non-fuel O&M variances are affected by both the timing of spending and the occurrence of, or
absence of specific events. Finally, tax items are lumpy by nature. Significant tax benefit in 2010 was realized in the
third and the fourth quarters.
In closing, I'd like to recap some accomplishments from this past year that position us well for the future. We
established EWC to enhance our focus in key areas of merchant generation business, including license renewal for its
nuclear plants and our analytical and market facing capabilities. In the near-term, EWC is among the best positioned
merchants providing certainty in a bearish environment, having executed significant hedging for 2011 and 2012 based
on our point of view for those periods. Over the longer term, EWC is focused on capturing the potential upside for
business from the positive effects of ongoing economic growth and new environmental regulation.
At the Utility, we made meaningful progress on the regulatory front with a rate case settlement in Arkansas and Texas.
While there is more work ahead, the regulatory improvements position Utility to succeed as we look to the opportunity
for protective infrastructure investments, including the supply plan acquisitions selected in the 2009 summer long-term
RFP.
While there is no doubt that 2011 will be another busy year, we will continue to do the necessary actions to capture the
near-term growth we see at the Utility and the long-term optionality embedded in our merchant business.
And now, the Entergy senior team is available for your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Gordon with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Gordon.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So we've had a couple of companies articulate the impact of bonus depreciation on cash flow and
also talk about what they're doing to either offset or not offset the resultant rate base sort of impact on the regulated
side or the 199 tax deduction on the merchant side. Can you talk about what incremental cash flow you expect to get
and what the impact that might be on sort of your base-case earnings and what you're doing to offset it?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Greg. This is Leo. We are
probably a little unique, I guess, in this situation. While there is benefit to the bonus depreciation and I guess right now
we've estimated it's probably about $500 million or so. We'll actually see the incremental benefit from the cash flow
over time, later than most people would, given the fact we have a significant NOL position right now. While the bonus
depreciation does fall in line ahead of the NOL utilization, it's not going really change the cash flow profile in the near
term because it just pushes out the utilization then of the NOLs.
Because of the NOL situation that we're in, we're also – not only – the production deduction falls behind the NOL. So
that's out there a few years as well for us so really no earnings impact to us from it. It gives us an incremental cash flow
at the back end, I guess, of our planning period if you were to think about it that way; and the rate base will follow the
realized benefits in bonus depreciation. So the impact in the near term on us is going to be a lot more muted than you
would see across the industry given the NOLs.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So really it's $500 million of cash, but that cash would have come in from other – you would
have been utilizing NOL to get a commensurate amount of cash had you not gotten the bonus depreciation so it's
basically a status quo situation, is that ...?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it is more money. So that is a good
thing. But it's just going to be – fall in line in front, but then it will add that $500 million basically to the back end.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So why not double the buyback? I know that's a rhetorical question. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And next we'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: My first question has to deal with some news reports out of Vermont about some speculation
that even if Vermont does not approve the relicensing that you guys might opt to continue to run the plant and to sort of
challenge that in the Federal jurisdiction so to speak, and I was wondering if you could just comment on that?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Rick, you have anything to say? You want ...?
<A - Richard Smith>: Well I don't think we would comment on what's reported out of the papers in Vermont. There's
something being reported every day up there and speculating what might happen probably isn't helpful for any of the
situation right now. We're currently still working with the utilities to get PPA in place and we expect to file something
with Commission around the certificate of public good and then we'll see what the legislature tells the commission they
can do with that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So, I mean, I guess take it one step at a time sort of approach; is that how I should sort of
read it?

<A - Richard Smith>: Yeah, I think that's right.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. The second question that I have is the EPS guidance for 2011. You mentioned in the
prepared remarks that there was a potential to do sort of a Harris (sic) [Harrison] County sale perhaps or something of
the sort in terms of your flexibility. I was wondering if anything like that was in 2011 guidance? And also, just for the
nuclear decommissioning trust, what's your expectation for the performance of that? Whether that was in 2011
guidance? If you could sort of elaborate on that?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As far as Harrison County, I guess that
was – are you asking if there's...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: If there is a similar sort of – I got the impression, and maybe I heard it wrong, but I got the
impression that there might be similar opportunities in the future for you guys to do similar things like what you do
with Harris (sic) [Harrison] County and I was wondering if that was in EPS guidance for 2011 or period? And then the
second question was whether – what the expectation for 2011 nuclear decommissioning trust earnings would be?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. As far as Harrison County,
certainly, that was something that we had in works already in 2010. If you think about the way we've managed the
non-nuclear wholesale assets business, which is where Harrison County fits, now under EWC, since we got out of the
IPP development business, the ongoing strategic and operational efforts there have been to capitalize on operational
improvements, to enter into a contracting strategy similar to what we would do with any asset that we have, but also
restructuring of those plants and their ownership as well as sales. And we've had sales in 2006 and 2008 of some of the
properties that we owned in that business as well.
I'm not going to really comment about what is or isn't in guidance. Similar to last year, we – last year, we did have
some opportunities there with Harrison County we were looking at, but certainly they were confidential. Right now, as
we look at 2011, there's really nothing on the horizon but there could always be some sort of transaction around assets
in that business. There's other plants in that business. There's a district energy business that falls under there with some
combined heat and cooling assets. I guess for right now there's nothing in the works, but at any point in time we could
have some transactions around some of those facilities, some...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As far as the decommissioning earnings,
we don't really make public estimates about what may or may not be going on in there. In terms of the way that works,
as you know, it's a lot more draconian in terms of the accounting. If the market really deteriorates, as you recall last
year – in 2009 we met some significant other than temporary impairments on some of the assets within the
decommissioning trust funds, and as we go forward they are more or less just as investments are made and securities
are turned over inside those funds, that's when we recognize some of those gains. So it's a lot different going down than
it is going up, but we don't really specify too much about what's in that. It's not significant most of the time.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
And next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah, hi guys.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Steve.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: How are you doing, Steve?
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Just, I apologize to ask for this clarification, but just on the RFPs at the utility, can you just go
through to detail again on potential – the different acquisition versus new build and timing of those events?

<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Gary, do you want to try it this time?
<A - Gary Taylor>: Yes. So, Steve, I think what I hear your understanding is you want to have acquisition versus new
builds and the relatively timing for those. Those basically, we said we're still in negotiations with two of the
counterparties. We would hope that here in the first quarter we would expect to come to conclusion with that. The
self-build itself is actually scheduled and will not go into service until the fourth quarter of 2014, to 2015. In each of
those, they have their cases that we would bring in front of the LPSC for their portions of the ones that we consider for
the other utilities; and depending on those, they are typically an individual proceeding, not necessarily covered through
the FRP (sic) RFP path; outside the FRP (sic) RFP process.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. So the self-build is already pre-approved?
<A - Gary Taylor>: No. We will have to file for that at CCN as well and then we basically would go through
traditional rate making for it.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And the two parties on – those would – would those be two separate plants or two
parties vying for one plant?
<A - Gary Taylor>: I cannot really kind of elaborate on that, Steve; we need to really conclude the negotiations.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then I guess one other question, I guess for Wayne. Just we're starting to see more
large-scale M&A in the sector. Just kind of [audio gap] that. Make a difference in any of your strategic thinking and
should we take the view that given that you've been pretty aggressively hedging your – at least your near-term power
price exposure that you're more inclined to be comfortable on the regulated side of the business strategically?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the opportunities on the unregulated
side are pretty risky at the current time, not only in terms of the outcome but with the rating agencies also where it puts
a little bit more pressure on our capital structure and our ability to execute the more commodity-driven we appear to be.
There would be some benefits to adding to the regulated side, I think, in terms of credit quality and freeing up cash
flows and maybe optimizing the balance sheet.
The real issue with regard to, I think, large-scale transactions, that really hasn't changed a lot. You know the difficulty.
We're already in multiple states. Other possible combinations would be multiple states. It could be tied up for quite
some time even if you had a transaction that made sense. And the difficulty in a transaction like this is a transaction is
more than just taping two business plans together, it has to create real value and be articulated and executed in a way
that shareholders actually can see what the strategy is other than just getting bigger and allowing any cash flows to fall
into the organizational – slack for the organization and you never see it.
That's tough to do. It's tough to find somebody that's like-minded and also has the right set of circumstances where you
can pinpoint where the – what the strategy would be and where the additional cash flows or opportunities will be from
that. The fact that you have other companies out there getting bigger and you have other companies out there that's very
focused on that as a strategy doesn't really change our own point of view.
Frankly, I even – I do have a point of view that these companies can get too big. There's a lot of issues to manage in
these companies regulatory-wise. At some point in time, I think you're beyond scale where the regulatory issues are
being managed too low in the company and are not being managed as well, maybe, as it might be if the company was a
little smaller, a little focused. At our current size, I mean, it's a busy schedule around this place to keep track and keep
our best people on top of these issues. Other people may just – may do it better than we do but that's a lot of
jurisdictions to manage for a lot of these companies.
Having said that, like we've told you before, where we continue to look at small transactions, larger transactions all the
time; we have for the last 12 years. And sometimes they make sense, they look like they make sense and we may have
exploratory discussions and realize they make no sense from the standpoint of bad data or you just see the world
differently and it's a potential train wreck.

We don't – we haven't stopped trying to find one that works, large scale or small scale, but if you like – I think as you
indicated, at this point in time, given the way the world looks, we probably would err verily on the side of trying to find
something more on the regulated than the non-regulated but that's, like I said, very hard to do.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.

And next we will go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hi. One high-level question, one granular one. High-level question, you guys gave out EPS
growth expectations for the utility but just curious kind of looking at the forward curve, what do you think just the
overall consolidated EPS growth looks like over the next couple of years? I mean – that's the high level question;
granular one, can you refresh us in terms of just how much cash inflow you expect from deferred tax benefits over the
next few years?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Leo?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As far as overall earnings growth, we
really haven't necessarily put out an aspiration or anything on that. Certainly, if you look at what the forward price
curve is, see where we're hedged, particularly in the near term, EBITDA that's coming out of the EWC business should
be reasonably flat to declining as we've said in the past. And so just to continue to offset that with growth in the utility
is what we see happening over the course of the next couple of years. So longer term, we see a lot of growth in the op –
in the business but, certainly, like all of the merchants in the near term, we've got the decline in EBITDA to deal with
as it relates to what's going on in the EWC business.
As far as how much cash is coming out of the deferred taxes, we don't necessarily get that granular with where the cash
flow comes from. We still see that we're in the range to be able to return to that $4 to $5 billion that we have as an
aspiration over the next several years. And as you might guess, we're always looking to try and get more rather than
less because we believe from a financial point of view that returning the cash that you've all invested with us is the
right thing to do. So that continues to be the objective. We continue to see ourselves in that range of being able to
provide it and we'll continue to work on making more.
<A - Michael Lapides>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.
Operator
And next we'll go to Marc de Croisset with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Marc de Croisset>: Hi. Thank you. Two very quick questions. It looks like you had some pretty strong cost
control at EWC in the fourth quarter. In fact, I think it's an $0.08 benefit year-on-year from lower O&M. I guess I was a
little surprised to see that since you have so many refueling days in the quarter, and I believe that was 72 days. Could
you elaborate on how you managed O&M with all this activity?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, there's a couple of things. One, as
it relates to the outages, when there's an outage, you'll see less O&M show up because of the way the accounting for the
outages work. So that's one thing working in our favor from the O&M. If you look at the cash flow statement and how
operating cash we said was offset to some extent by the cost of the outages, so that, that spend actually tends to not
show up as higher O&M costs necessarily. And so what we also had was we had some costs in 2009 as it related to –
we had some incremental maintenance work done actually at Harrison County that showed up in 2009 that then wasn't
there in 2010.
<Q - Marc de Croisset>: So it sounds like some of the O&M is capitalized, would that be correct?

<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's deferred on the balance sheet and
then amortized over the period after the outage.
<Q - Marc de Croisset>: Got you. And second question on your capacity contracts and I don't know how these – how
material these may be, but I see some uplift in 2013 and 2014. Could you give us any color on what's happening in the
capacity markets?
<A - Richard Smith>: Well, I mean, it's Rick. I think it's a little bit of an expectation that the economy is slowly
rebounding out of the recession that we've been dealing with in the last couple of years. So with that higher load growth
and you're into higher heat rates. And so I mean there's an expectation that's converting into higher capacity prices.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: If I could just – if you're talking about – I think
Rick got the market in general, if you're talking about our sold forward table, we did have a FERC order that set the VY
capacity price around the de-list; so the dynamic de-list, we went in and got that – capacity price was set at the capacity
price if it's headed for the de-list, which is a little bit higher than where we were before.
<Q - Marc de Croisset>: Thank you very much.
Operator
And next we'll go to Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Good morning. Wayne, can I just ask you, you mentioned the Vermont decision would occur by
the middle of the year. Could you just tell us why the middle of the year? What happens by the middle of the year that
makes that decision-making process come to a conclusion?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there's a number of factors. Again, we're
expecting the NRC will move forward and sometime within this timeframe we're expecting to get a license renewal
from them. That's a critical issue. At the same time, as we've indicated before, there are substantial expenditures,
refueling outage and things of that nature that occur later in the year that somewhat force our hand in terms of making
some decisions relative to the future of this plant and we don't – it's not really timely to get into what those choices are
but they're critical choices that we'll need to make probably somewhere around the mid-year.
It's choices that certainly affect all of you and choices that affect 650 people that work at that plant. And like – I think
maybe as some of the business leaders have pointed out, time is running out in terms of Vermont themselves
influencing the destiny of that plant. But we strongly believe, as obviously the Senate does, that this is Federal
jurisdiction and we have choices that need to be made and we'll make them at the appropriate time.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: So we should not look anything in the legislature, is that a fair point, happening? From the
Vermont legislature from your perspective?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well we certainly are looking for support from
the people in Vermont. We're looking for support for the utilities. We want to be regarded as good partners with
Vermont. But at the same time, I mean in some respects, we're being pushed into a bit of a corner here. And there's a
point where there's a line in the sand and we've got to make a decision whether we're pushed any further or not.
But we're not ignoring the legislature, we're not ignoring the governor, we're not ignoring the – and I'm sure they're not
ignoring the IBM or the business leaders and other people also. It's a very complicated situation. But as we said, we
will – despite all of the different things that are said that may or may not be accurate, we're going to make the right
decision for all of our stakeholders.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Thank you so much.
