MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Texas Instruments' first-quarter 2011 earnings call. At this time,
for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please, go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first-quarter 2011 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's
CFO is with me today.
For any of you that missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over
the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement
contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete
description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 8th. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue
and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update.

In today's call, in addition to a review of the first quarter's financial results, we'll describe the current demand
environment. We'll discuss the impact the Japan earthquake has had on demand and on our operations in that country.
We'll also update you on our recovery plan and our anticipated costs associated with the earthquake and its aftermath.
I'll start with the demand environment. As a reminder, in January, we said we believe the inventory correction that had
occurred in the second half of 2010 was largely complete and that we expected demand in the first quarter to be above
our seasonal average. There is much evidence that this did happen. Specifically, orders were strong, re-sales were very
strong and our core businesses performed well.
That said, we had two incidents that created noise on top of this strong underlying demand signal, the earthquake in
Japan and late quarter, unexpected weakness in baseband demand by a single customer. In fact, during the months of
January and February we were tracking consistent with our expectations for above-seasonal demand, which led to us
narrow our revenue and earnings guidance ranges at our mid-quarter update around the prior midpoint.
In March, the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our revenue due to the disruption at many of our customers'
Japan factories as well as damage to two of our factories in Japan. This impact, combined with our baseband customer's
unexpected weakness resulted in revenue in the lower half of our expected range.
As we have previously explained, baseband is a product line that we are exiting and since our resources there have
already been minimized, it has practically no long-term impact on us. The revenue impact from the events in Japan will
be greater in the second quarter than in the first quarter, considering that we will only be operating with partial output at
our factories there, that our Japanese customers are still in the early stages of restarting their own factories and that we
and our customers may face potential supply chain disruptions.
We're working closely with our suppliers to get what we need, but it's too early for us or anyone else to say these issues
are resolved. In a few minutes, Kevin will update you on the recovery status of our factory operations in Japan.
The key point is that we believe underlying demand continues to be strong. The earthquake has had an important
near-term effect on our business but we do not believe it is disruptive to the underlying demand trends. As a result, we
believe that second half will be strong once the short-term impact of the earthquake has passed.
In total, TI revenue of $3.39 billion grew 6% from a year ago and declined 4% sequentially. Revenue from our core
businesses increased 14% from year ago and was even sequentially. In total, our core revenue was 71% of total revenue
in the quarter.
The breakout of our core revenue results includes Analog up 12% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Embedded
Processing grew 21% from year ago and declined 1% sequentially. Wireless, OMAP and connectivity revenue
increased 10% from a year ago and declined 3% sequentially.
Non-core revenue declined 10% from a year ago and declined 12% sequentially. This was mostly affected by Wireless
baseband where revenue fell 21% from a year ago and declined 23% sequentially to $334 million. The sequential
decline was well below the seasonal average and the month of March was exceptionally weak, below January, in fact.
We believe the decline does not reflect on demand in the broader smartphone market, but instead was the result of
weaker demand for this particular line of 3G handsets. Although we don't believe a competitive chip offering will be
available until late this year, we do not expect a seasonal recovery in this revenue in the upcoming quarters and in fact,
expect that it will continue to decline.
Baseband revenue fell to below 10% of TI revenue in the quarter, down from 12% last quarter. Other non-core revenue
fell 2% from a year ago and fell 5% sequentially.
Turning to our segments, the most significant driver of Analog growth from a year ago was High Performance Analog.
Power Management and HVAL were both up by similar amounts, although by a lesser amount than HPA. Sequentially,
Power was up the most with HVAL about even and HPA down a few points.

The biggest factor in Embedded Processing revenue growth from a year ago was catalog products, with
communications infrastructure and automotive products both up strongly but by lesser absolute amounts. Sequentially,
products sold into automotive applications were up the most, growing at double-digit levels while communications
infrastructure and catalog products both declined.
You'll note that our catalog products in Embedded Processing and Analog including both HPA and Power have grown
rapidly over the past year. These are products that are typically sold through distribution into a wide array of customers
and applications. For example, in Embedded Processing, we're seeing recent strength in a lot of industrial applications,
such as motor drives in China, metering applications in Europe, as well as higher demand in security and medical
applications.
These are areas where the scale advantage of TI's sales force means that we are identifying an increasing number of
opportunities and are working hand in hand with our distributors to ensure these customers' systems are chock full of
TI's analog chips, digital signal processors and microcontrollers.
These are also the areas that will be further strengthened by our recently announced plans to acquire National
Semiconductor. Adding National's 12,000 analog products to TI's existing analog portfolio of 30,000 products will
significantly enhance our portfolio. Having a combined sales force that is ten times the size of what National has today
should also significantly accelerate their growth. We expect very good things to come from this combination.
Wireless revenue will increasingly be driven by our core product areas of connectivity and OMAP applications
processors. We continue to be encouraged by our design win momentum in both areas. In applications processors, we
introduced our OMAP 5 processor in the quarter, a multicore product based on ARM's latest Cortex A15 core. The key
to OMAP 5 is that we will again push the envelope on both performance and power efficiency. Many of our
competitors in this market try to attain our leadership performance metrics without fully appreciating the critical
importance of power efficiency to mobile applications.
We have also continued to win a broad swath of smartphones, tablets, e-readers, personal navigation devices and other
mobile computing applications with our OMAP 3 and OMAP 4 products setting the stage for strong OMAP growth
over the next few quarters as these programs ramp into production.
In our Other segment, the revenue decline from a year ago was primarily due to lower royalties that were mostly offset
by revenue from our transitional supply agreements. Sequentially, declines in custom ASICs and royalties were
partially offset by higher revenue from calculators and DLP products.
Turning to distribution, re-sales grew a very strong 8% sequentially. On average, re-sales would more typically decline
a couple of points in the first quarter. Although we were able to help distributors increase their inventory at an absolute
level, their TI inventory declined by a couple of days given the strong re-sale environment.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by providing an update on our recovery operations in Japan.
As Ron said, we had two wafer fabs damaged by the earthquake: our recently acquired Aizu fab and our Miho factory.
Our operations teams have done a great job responding to the crisis. We will soon be restoring Aizu to full production
status and just last week we started initial production in Miho. We expect that Miho will be able to start full production
loadings in mid-July, although it will be several months later before we see the revenue effect due to the manufacturing
cycle time.
In the meantime, we have identified alternative TI manufacturing sites for 80% of the devices that we manufacture in
Miho and we are working with customers on those qualifications. Of course, this transition will take some time to
complete.

In addition to the lost output and therefore lost revenue that is associated with this disruption, we are also incurring
additional costs. These costs include the underutilization expense we incur from having our manufacturing assets only
partially loaded, scrapped inventory, the recovery teams that we have assembled from across the world, as well as other
one-time costs.
In the first quarter, these costs totaled about $30 million, almost all of which was in cost of revenue. We recorded this
in our Other segment. The situation in Japan will remain fluid as we progress and gather information. We will continue
to communicate with you as well as our customers as we learn more.
Gross profit in the quarter declined $141 million sequentially. This included the impact of almost all of the previously
mentioned earthquake costs. The remainder of the gross profit decline was mostly associated with our lower revenue. It
also includes the seasonal effect of increased holiday and vacation time in the fourth quarter as well as the first quarter's
annual pay and benefit increases.
The combination of R&D and SG&A increased $36 million from the fourth quarter. We have continued to increase our
investment in our core businesses especially targeted programs in analog and microcontrollers. We've also continued to
increase our field sales and applications engineering resources in important emerging markets such as China.
We have adjusted our estimate for TI's annual effective tax rate for 2011 to 28%. This is partly the result of lower
expected taxable income, which includes considerations such as our earthquake related costs and certain anticipated
acquisition related costs.
Net income in the first quarter was $666 million, or $0.55 per share. In the earnings per share calculation, please note
that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we
pay dividend equivalents. In the first quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was about
$10 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you will likely calculate EPS to be a penny higher than we have actually
reported.
When comparing with our $0.78 of EPS in the fourth quarter, recall that the fourth quarter included $0.14 from the
combination of a gain on sale and a tax benefit that was primarily associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D
tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2010.
I will leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release, however, let me make just a
few comments. Cash flow from operations was $516 million. This was down $714 million from the last quarter. Cash
flow reflects lower net income and the payment of accrued annual profit sharing and performance bonuses in the first
quarter.
Capital expenditures declined to $194 million in the quarter from $301 million in the fourth quarter and included
additions to our assembly and test capacity as well as our analog wafer fab capacity.
We used $771 million in the quarter to re-purchase 21.9 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $153
million.
We increased our inventory by $158 million in the quarter. Most of this increase was planned and supports our goal to
maintain short lead times and support high customer service levels. About one-third of the increase was Wireless
baseband inventory that resulted from unexpected weak demand from a single customer. We've already taken action to
begin to correct the excess baseband inventory.
Orders in the quarter increased 14% sequentially to $3.58 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.06 in the quarter
from 0.89 in the fourth quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.41 billion to $3.69 billion in the second quarter, or up
1% to 9% sequentially. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.60.
Prior to the earthquake, we were planning for low double-digit second-quarter revenue growth. Because of the
earthquake, we reduced this near-term outlook to about half our normal seasonal growth mostly due to a combination

of lower output at our Japan factories, lower local Japan demand as well as potential supply chain disruptions. The
foregone profit on this revenue would be about a nickel of EPS in the quarter. Additionally, the EPS estimate we have
provided includes about $0.05 of negative impact for earthquake-related costs. So in total, the second quarter EPS
impact from the earthquake is about a dime.
Our estimates for 2011 R&D, capital expenditures and depreciation are unchanged.
In summary, we're encouraged by underlying demand as evidenced by orders and our trends during the first two and a
half months of the first quarter. Although we certainly have a near term operational challenge associated with the
earthquake and its aftermath, we're confident that its impact will be confined to the near term and we're looking
forward to a strong second half of the year.
Our market position is solid and will only get better as we bring the National portfolio and team onboard later this year.
We remain focused on growing our core businesses significantly faster than the markets and we're intent on translating
that growth to attractive earnings and returns to our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
as opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you
an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, Ron, the first question is given the hiccup
on the baseband business this quarter, how should we think about that going forward? I know you said don't expect a
seasonal recovery, but when you look at the guidance for Q2, how would you have us model that business?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: John, I would say probably unchanged from what we have told you in the past. Although,
certainly, it looks like that guidance has more and more opportunity to come to fruition here, which is basically, we still
expect that by the end of 2012, that revenue will be essentially gone and so kind of a linear progression from where we
were in first quarter down basically to zero in first quarter '13 would be about the best we could provide you in terms of
guidance.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: And then, guys, as my follow-up, when you look at the Op profitability on the Analog
business, on up revenue operating profits were down almost $70 million sequentially. I'm just kind of curious if you
can talk a little bit about pricing in that business currently and also when you look at the weakness in the high
performance market, is that expected to rebound in the second quarter and why was Q1 so weak for that segment?
<A - Kevin P. March>: John, profitability was down – back to the initial comments that I made about our increase in
investments in certain projects in Analog and Embedded Processes and a similar story holds in Embedded Processing
as well. We have stepped up our spending on product development in those areas. In addition, as I mentioned, we are
increasing our salespeople and field app engineers in support of those areas, so actually similar to what we did a year
ago in Embedded Processing where we stepped up the investment there. We've done it again this year, stepping up the
investment in both those segments.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, John, thank you for your questions and we'll move to the next caller, please.

We'll go nest to Tim Luke, Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tim Luke>: Thanks so much, Ron. As you plan going forward, how should we think about your inventory level?
Obviously, it's up a little bit in this quarter, how are you thinking about that trending as you move into the year?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Tim, I will go ahead and take that. We don't normally give a forecast, per se, because that's
really more a function of what the following quarter's outlook will be. So we won't give you a specific number, but I
would just remind you of what we talked about. We have already taken action to start bringing the baseband inventory
down and so we would expect that to decline during the second quarter.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow-on, Tim?
<Q - Tim Luke>: As you describe the outlook for second half of the year, you say that you expect a quite good second
half. Where are the areas that you see the greatest grounds for optimism around the second half? And maybe as part of
that, it did look like your book to bill, your order numbers were strong in the quarter and maybe you can give us some
color as to where you saw the best lift in the order book? Thank you.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Tim, I don't think we believe it's necessarily going to be driven by any particular market
segment. In fact, I think that's part of the reason why we're somewhat optimistic because we see it being pretty
broad-based underlying strength.
That certainly happened, you know, as we said in the prepared remarks there was some noise in first quarter, but if you
peel back pretty much the isolated events of one baseband customer and a Japan earthquake, underlying business was
really pretty strong. In fact, you know, I think, you know, if you look at the baseband numbers, we gave you them
pretty specifically. You see pretty much $100 million decline, of which, about half of that was unexpected.
So you know, basically, we had about a $50 million unexpected decline in baseband. We had about the impact of the
Japan earthquake on revenue, you know, since it came so late in the quarter was about $20 million, but you need to
look at where we were relative to our guidance, you know, we were, you know, below the middle of the range but not
very far below, which means areas outside of baseband and outside of the Japan related impact actually ran pretty
strong in the quarter.
So again, we have to kind of get through second quarter and some of the noise associated with Japan, but we think that
broad-based strength will then become increasingly evident once we get into second half. But again, not driven by any
particular area but rather broad-based.
Okay. Tim, thank you, and let's move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Uche Orji with UBS.
<Q - Uche Orji>: Sure, thank you very much. Kevin, maybe I will just go back to your comments on Japan. With
regard to how your customers have reacted to it, have there been any-one would expect subsequent to an event that
there would be a jump in safety stocks and people trying to make sure they're not having any stock outs. Do you see
any such? And has that kind of stabilized as we look at how demand could trend through the rest of the quarter? And
also, while you're answering that, if you could also talk about any adjacent products, like we're hearing about wafer
supplies being tight still from Japan if you are exposed to that and if such comment is true?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Uche, on customer reaction to the earthquake, I will go back to what Ron said. We actually
saw quite strong demand during the first two and a half months of the quarter that really outside of the baseband and
direct Japan impact, continued through the quarter.

I don't think that we can necessarily point to any specific example of where people might be moving to take on more
inventory or safety stock but by the same token, I don't know that's an unreasonable thing for us to think that could
occur. It's probably a little bit too early though for us to be able to point to any meaningful examples of that.
As it relates to the supply side, that is one of the things that we're mindful of in the second quarter outlook, and as we
have talked about before, many semiconductor suppliers, that is suppliers of raw materials to semiconductor
manufacturers such as TI and others have the manufacturing facilities in the earthquake zone and in many cases, those
particular suppliers have been working to bring their factories back online. We've been working with them as well as
other suppliers to try to ensure a continuity to our total supply, but right now, I would say the situation remains too
fluid to really be able to give, either from us or anyone else, any certainty as to what that supply situation will look like
until we get further through second quarter.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, Uche, did you have a follow-up to that question?
<Q - Uche Orji>: I do. Actually, a different question. Ron, and I know you talked about investing in both Embedded
and Analog Processing – Embedded Processing and Analog as kind of the reason for the gross margin weakness. Is
there any specific change in mix particularly if you look at embedded, you know, where you talked about
communications infrastructure as well as automotive being down? Is there anything more significant going on in
Embedded beyond just investments that may have resulted in the margins being a little bit weaker?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Not outside of what we talked about. You know, you always have some variation across
catalog products or, you know, automotive or comms infrastructure which are the three categories that we discussed
there, but I think other than what we discussed in our prepared remarks or put in the release, there's nothing that jumps
to my mind that would have been what I would call a mix change.
Do you have anything, Kevin that comes to your mind?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Not in those two segments specifically. I would just say, broadly speaking at the company
level, we did talk about the costs of revenue took an impact for the Japan damages cost of about $30 million. We also
mentioned that royalty revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. In addition to that, I did mention in my
prepared remarks that the compensation-related costs in our manufacturing areas like the other areas we had the benefit
of the seasonal decline for vacation in first quarter offset by pay and benefit increases in the first quarter, so that
combination of events all pools together to deliver the GPM results that we looked at.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, thank you, Uche. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
Next is Glen Yeung with Citi.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thanks. Kevin, for you maybe. We obviously now have down gross margins with all the
goings on in the first quarter. Can you maybe provide for us the path back to the mid-50s on gross margins? What are
the things that need to happen, sort of correcting, for lack of a better term, the issues in Japan and what else do we need
to see to get us back to the mid-50s?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Glen, I would first say that we're probably going to be a quarter or two out on that. Keep in
mind I did mention that there was about $0.05 of additional impact that we expect in first quarter related to the Japan
earthquake – excuse me, in the second quarter and most of that is going to be in cost of revenue. So we're probably in
the third quarter before we see a resumption of the gross margins back in the level that we prefer to see them operating
at.
And really, you know, I think an interesting point that should be noted that Ron brought up in his comments, 71% of
our revenue in the first quarter was our core products and those tend to be products that enjoy very healthy gross
margins, so as we move through time and baseband continues its wind down and so on, all of those things will come
together and help support more reliable and solid gross margins starting in the second half of the year.

<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow-up, Glen?
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: I do. It's kind of end-market related. You brought it up a little bit, but I just wanted to get
your sense as to what you are seeing in a few end markets, wireless infrastructure, automotive and industrial, just what
you saw and what you expect to see in those end markets?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. Let's start with wireless infrastructure. I mean so first quarter we saw things down
sequentially there, but I think that is pretty much a seasonal pattern that we would expect to see, you know, what were
drivers of the revenue even though there was a seasonal decline was still most of the revenue was associated with North
American data expansion. We did see some increased volume in China really in more kind of legacy GSM, 2G type of
sales and again we have no change to the outlook you that you've heard us talk about over time, which is, we think
we're really at the start of a very long growth spurt that is really going to be based on data traffic, capacity expansion
that is going to go across the world. And so on the one hand, you will see CapEx spending increases, especially in the
Wireless area, we believe, by the various service providers, but we actually think our opportunity to grow will be
actually significantly above those CapEx increases really because we're catching more of the bill of materials via
integration.
So just for example, we used to sell DSPs. Today we sell layer one system on a chip. In the future we are going to be
selling layer one, two, three system on a chip and really capture more of the customer's system opportunity via that
higher level service.
Automotive, you heard us say, was strong. A lot of that was driven by unit sales increases in automotive. I think just in
the month of March, they were up something like 17% year-on-year. This is an area that we believe the end market will
be impacted by the Japan earthquake, and I don't mean so much end market meaning consumer demand, but rather the
automotive manufacturers' ability to supply given various constraints in terms of their supply chain. So that's one we're
going to watch, but first quarter was strong, maybe a little more dampened outlook going forward.
And then industrial, I would say good strength, not only in first quarter. Our view is that is a market that is going to
continue strong as we move through 2011 and you know, I would say that's across multiple regions, U.S., Europe, but
also as you heard me say in prepared remarks, even out of China as they continue to expand not only that local
economy, but they're supplying to the rest of the world.
Okay, Glen, thank you and hopefully, that answers your question there. We'll move to the next caller.

We'll go next to John Barton with Cowen.
<Q - John Barton MBA>: Thank you. Kevin, if you could go back to that $0.05 cost from the earthquake in the June
quarter. Just break it out a little bit: underutilization charge, scrap product, restart costs and also your thoughts on those
categories what could stretch into September, please?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, John, we're not going to go any lower than to say right now, we're estimating about
$0.05 of cost in EPS and it will be mostly manufacturing related. Obviously, some of it will be in those categories you
just described, as well as repair costs and other types of costs associated with bringing the lines back up, but I'm not
going to go any deeper than just to say that it's about a nickel or so in the quarter we expect right now.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Would you like to try with another one, John?
<Q - John Barton MBA>: And that goes to zero in the September quarter?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Right now, we can't see that far out with a great deal of clarity so we withhold any kind of
forecast on third quarter until we get closer to it.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: We'll probably give you more on that in July. Okay, John, I'll give you one more.

<Q - John Barton MBA>: Back to the book-to-bill, 1.06, where was it tracking before the earthquake and what I'm
after there is how much of an increase in bookings did you see as customers tried to give you visibility and/or create
safety stock?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: John, I would describe the order trend as strong throughout the quarter. We did see some
turn-up in the couple weeks, last couple weeks of March associated with you know maybe customers like you
described, trying to provide more visibility, but that was not a big factor. Book-to-bill and our order trends were solid,
literally from the start of the quarter all the way through.

The next is Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
<Q - J. Steven Smigie>: Good, thank you. With regard to your comments about a good second half, I'm just curious
what would constitute a good second half for you guys? If you were seasonal, would that be a good second half? Would
it require somewhat better than seasonal? How should we think about that?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Sure. Do you have a follow-up question?
[Laughter]
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Yeah. Steve, we're already out on a limb trying to talk about in general things turning back up
in second half. I don't know that we're sitting here trying to say whether it would be above seasonal, but certainly a
seasonal or better second half is what we would characterize as a strong second half and as is kind of in the range of
thinking that we have.
Do you have a follow-on?
<Q - J. Steven Smigie>: Sure. You had an above seasonal Q1, very solid bookings here and you are talking about this
good back half and that's sort of in the context of, you know, some discussion of PC weakness out there and high oil
prices and debt ceilings and a lot of negative macro data points. Just curious, how you sort of, you know, put those two
together, the negative macro data points and your seeming strength. Is it share gains? It is something else? If you could
just give some thoughts there, I know you guys aren't economists, but any thoughts there would be helpful.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Again, I think, Steve, what we're seeing here is just a general broadening of the economic
recovery around the world including in the Western economies that you have been watching and surprisingly weak, you
know, for a long period of time. That along with the proliferation of electronic devices gives us confidence that there's,
you know, going to be quite a bit of long-term growth for semiconductors. I think we talked in the last couple of calls
about our interest in the emergence of say, tablet PCs, for example, where our potential content in tablet is more than it
is in PCs. So actually that transition from PC weakness to tablet strength, we view positively.
The emergence of the data communications demands that Ron was talking about earlier, puts more and more demand
on the networks and we have a lot of content inside those, and we view that very favorably. The fact that automobile
sales were somewhat depressed during the last couple of years as people kind of held onto their cash and their cars
were getting older, they eventually have to replace them and electronic content continues to go up inside those cars and
again, that gives us confidence that semiconductor content is going to be quite attractive as we move into the future.
So no particular area and no debate on some of the macro headlines that you're talking about, it's just broadly speaking,
there's underlying demand that we saw even coming through this period where people were a bit rattled with all the
headlines you just talked about, including an earthquake, we still saw strong demand.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, very good, Steve. Thank you for your questions and we'll move to the next caller.

Go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James Covello>: Great, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. On the royalty issue that hit
the Q1 gross margins, is that expected to carry over to impact Q2 gross margins as well?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Jim, we don't typically forecast down that low, but we think that royalties will probably run in
the – call it the $50 million kind of range on a quarterly basis going forward.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Which is about where they were in Q1, so probably, just looking forward, we don't really see a
big transition. Although, Jim, as you know, royalties can always bounce around based on, you know, what happens
with our licensees' revenue and things like that, but probably at a level in first quarter that we would expect roughly to
hold through the rest of the year.
Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
<Q - James Covello>: Yes, please, on the production issues out of Japan, is there any risk that, you know, some of the
share that you were unable to satisfy or some of the shipments you were unable to satisfy this quarter go elsewhere and
are hard to get back, or do you think you can take them back as you ramp up production in other regions?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Jim, I don't think there's much concern on a share shift standpoint. Again most of the products
are designed in. It's difficult or undesirable for many customers to want to redesign somebody else in, not impossible,
but difficult.
This is a short-term interruption and frankly, we're moving very quickly to qualify products into other factories. So the
reaction from our customers has actually been quite good so far. At this point, I would minimize any risk to our share
position due to the earthquake.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Yeah, Jim, I would think of it this way. A customer, you know, all the different directions they
can put their energies, it's going to be much more expedient for them to work on taking a device that we used to
manufacture in Miho and say re-qualify a similar device that we could provide them out of RFAB, than to go back to
the design stage and try to redesign a board to use a competitor's device and again, very, very few of these devices, if
any, would be pin-for-pin compatible with competitors' devices. They're highly proprietary, and so again, what we've
seen is – and what we have encouraged is a pretty intense effort to work with us on getting the 80% of devices
re-qualified over into other areas, while at the same time, we're doing our best to recover production in Miho as fast as
possible as well.
Okay, thank you, Jim and we'll move to the next caller.

you seeing in the industry? Are there any complementary products where lead times are stretching out? And then I have
a follow-up as well.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Ambrish, clearly we had to adjust lead times for our customers for deliveries for
products that were impacted from our Miho factory. But aside from that, I'm not aware of any others to point out.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: And then my follow-up. Any buyer's remorse after pulling the National deal

<A - Kevin P. March>: Frankly, I can't – I'm pretty enthusiastic about us getting that deal closed. When you take a
look at the opportunity we have to actually accelerate the growth of the National portfolio, it's pretty exciting. Our
incremental cost to accelerate that growth is exactly zero, because we already have the sales force in place. So as soon
as we can expose their products to ten times the size of the sales force, we should expect to see a meaningful shift in a
fairly short order in the revenue growth of those products.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I mean there are just not very many opportunities, Ambrish, to be able to pick up a
12,000-product analog portfolio and a very high quality analog portfolio and basically be able to get it at a reasonable
market price such as we were able to with this acquisition.
So you know, we've obviously spent a lot of time out meeting with investors and, you know, frankly, the feedback from
our largest investors has been very encouraging regarding that acquisition, TI's use of capital for that acquisition and
what they believe we'll be able to do with it. So I think they share our enthusiasm for bringing that National team
onboard and doing it as quickly as we can.
All right, Ambrish Srivastava, thank you for your questions and we'll move to the next caller.

We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.
<Q - Ed Snyder MBA>: Thanks a lot. In light of that National acquisition and the fact that you're investing, as you
pointed out, in field sales and engineering, does that change your dynamic? I know it hasn't closed yet. You haven't got
the green light completely, but why add field sales and engineering when you are bringing on National's sales force
with their engineers on top of it? Are the growth opportunities that strong?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Actually, it is, Ed. We're continuing on our organic growth, pursuits that we've had all along.
Recall that we spent the last year and a half expanding our manufacturing capacity with the idea of rapidly growing
organically our own internal portfolio of some 30,000 odd analog products. That has not changed and the expectation
for each of those businesses inside our portfolio to have growth rates running 2x their markets has not changed and so
in order to do that, we continue to want to add people in areas where we see the actual growth opportunity at.
The exciting part again, for us, is it's incrementally quite easy for us then to add the additional 12,000 products that
National's portfolio will bring to us into our sales people's hands and on those same calls now have an even higher
probability of walking away with the sale every time they show up at the customer.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Yeah. Just you know, to reinforce because we used to get this question a lot from investors
whether our aggressive growth goals for Analog would be purely met organically or whether we would do it via
acquisition. You know, our goal in terms of the organic growth has not changed whatsoever and that's basically to be
growing 2x the market. So we're continuing to execute the strategy to make sure we deliver on that goal and then what
we'll be doing with the National portfolio will certainly be in addition to that.
So Ed, do you have a follow-on question?
<Q - Ed Snyder MBA>: I was going to follow-up to that one. Incrementally, obviously, you have talked a lot about
helping out National by adding so many more sales force to their feet on the street, but then you have the National guys
helping you guys out, too and that's incremental, to I guess what your organic growth would be then, I expect?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah. It certainly cuts both ways. Great salespeople are hard to find and great FAEs are even
harder to find and we're combining these teams together and we're pretty encouraged. We have already got the largest
sales force in the industry and it's going to be even larger. So I think the ability to multiply on that from a growth
standpoint is clearly in our favor.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I think, Ed -- you are familiar with National, I know, I forget the exact number, something like
45, 46% of their recent revenue is coming from the industrial market, and that's a much stronger position in industrial

and a lot of it comes because of the power management capabilities they have for high voltage type of applications and
so they will have relationships with customers and certainly portfolio – what do I call it, lead-in type products that we

Next to JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
<Q - JoAnne Feeney PhD>: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit more, if we could, on Japan. I'm
curious, you've moved, it sounds like, more than you originally planned to other facilities, 80% up from 60%. I'm
wondering what percentage of those parts are already qualified, or when do you think they will be qualified?
<A - Kevin P. March>: JoAnne, I think initially we had indicated that somewhere around 60% or so was available into
other factories and we have since been able to increase that to about 80%. Qualification is underway for many of those
products already. It's really a function from two sides. One, we have got to qualify it inside the factory we're moving
those products into and the second part is the customer has to gain confidence that the parts are actually working as
they expect them to work. So that is probably going to be taking us through this quarter and maybe even next quarter
on some of these products.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Just another data point I would add is at RFAB these days, we have about 100 devices
qualified for production there and we're adding about ten new devices per week into RFAB. If you just go back a
month ago before the earthquake or I guess a little more than a month, we were probably adding at a pace of about five
new devices per week in RFAB and certainly the acceleration that has happened since then is because of trying to move
those Miho products and provide some production alternatives there.
Do you have a follow-on, JoAnne
<Q - JoAnne Feeney PhD>: Yeah. On the composition side, you had a month or so to look at this. I'm wondering how
the composition of your existing inventories matches up against the shortfall out of the Miho facility, whether you will
be able to draw down inventories to meet customer demand or whether there isn't a particularly good match there in the
inventory set?
<A - Kevin P. March>: There was already, you know, material that Miho had produced that was in our assembly and
test sites and we had finished good material as well. We had a better recovery of wafers than we initially anticipated
after the earthquake. We thought more were damaged than we had actually believed to be the case initially. So between
those, we've got some inventory to be able to handle our customer demands, but clearly, not enough, which is why we
are re-qualling many of those products into other factories. And is also why we had to re-profile the lead times on those
particular parts because we don't have enough material on hand to meet the demands of those customers.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, thank you, JoAnne. We'll move to the next caller.

Next is Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Hey, guys. I know you probably can't answer this definitively, but how confident do you feel
that you're incorporating most, if not, all of the impact from Japan and in that vein, are you incorporating any impact
from any sort of demand destruction from Japan domestically?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Chris, right now, we have given you our best estimate which we think is – with what we know
today, an all-in numbers, if you will, and that is we think about $0.05 impact the second quarter. As we get further and

further into bringing equipment up and actually making sure that it functions as intended, that may change, but right
now, we think that's a good number.
The kind of knock-on effect I alluded to in my opening remarks and that is, given that our revenue growth sequentially
in the quarter we expect to be about half of what we would normally experience on a seasonal basis, if we run the math
on that, we think that's about another $0.05 of earnings forgone from a revenue standpoint in the quarter so between the
forgone earnings of $0.05 and the actual expected increase in recovery costs of $0.05, it looks to us to be about a $0.10
impact in the second quarter.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Yeah. Do you guys expect any sort of makeup in the second half especially on the gross
margin side? In terms of modeling, should we assume that once you get back to the revenue levels you had last year,
your gross margins will be the same or similar?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Chris, I will remind you again that $0.05 that I talked about for second quarter costs will pretty
much all go through cost of revenue, so that will have a negative impact on our gross margins, but to the extent that that
pretty much wraps up the repair costs and the recovery costs, we should expect to see our gross margins begin to move
back to levels that you grew accustomed to seeing us at, at those revenue levels.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Thank you, Chris. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
Next is Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Yes, thank you. First question: your guidance range is fairly wide, up 1 to 9. I'm just
wondering if the variables there are simply Japan, or is there anything else that's behind that range?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Tore, I believe that range is very consistent with what you have seen from TI historically. We
will usually start with a range at that level and then try to narrow it as we move into the mid-quarter update, but this is
consistent with what we have historically provided at the beginning of the quarter.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Okay, very good. Could you also clarify a little bit more what is happening in the
distribution channel? I think you said sell-through was very strong, TI inventory was down and yet, you know, you
have done a good job to sort of get the inventories back up. So what exactly is happening there? Are distributors
wanting to build more inventory, or – I'm just trying to understand that better, thanks.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I think, well sell-through was strong and frankly, we had expected it to be strong coming into
the quarter. That was certainly part of the characterization we gave back in January that we thought we were coming
into an above seasonal first quarter and you know, you only had to go back to their – those distributors' reports and they
were talking about order strength in fourth quarter, positive book-to-bill to come away with that type of consideration.
I would say that inventory is about where they would like to have it and frankly where we would like to have them. As
we mentioned, days were down a few, but basically in the six-week range for their inventory. That's about where they
have historically been, especially if you make adjustment for the increasing amount of distributor inventory that we're
carrying on consignment programs.
So consignment moved up a little bit, about a third of our distribution revenue is now being supported on consignment
programs and as that continues to move up, and by the way, we will also, as we bring that National portfolio on board,
we will move that into consignment programs with distribution as well, but as the percentage of our distribution
support that is supported by consignment inventory moves up, then naturally, the amount of inventory that the
distributors need to carry would move down correspondingly. So, but again, I would say they're generally right in the
range where they would like to be.

We'll go next to Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi guys, just a question on calculators versus your regular semiconductor business. That's
usually up, the calculator side, in the second quarter. Any reason, Japan or otherwise, that that wouldn't constitute the
usual 2 to 3 points of sequential growth?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I think you've got it right, Ross. If you look at calculators from first to second quarter, very
typical would be a doubling of their revenue, and there's no reason where we wouldn't expect that same. That could be
2.5 to 3 points of company level revenue growth first to second quarter coming from that seasonal lift in calculator
demand.
Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Yep, different topic though. On OpEx, your OpEx went up about $36 million sequentially.
You mentioned about the investments in Embedded and Analog. Is that the majority of that $36 million? Should we
think that about that sort of magnitude going forward as you continue to invest, or were there one-time things in that
sequential comparison that won't occur again as we go forward?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Ross, the only one-time thing that we point back to is we do our annual pay and benefit
increases in the first quarter so there's about two-thirds of a quarter's worth of that in there. So you will see a bit more
of that as we go into next quarter as you get a full quarter effect of that. Plus, back to your earlier question about
calculators and so on from the seasonality standpoint. You'd typically see our SG&A go up a bit there on marketing
costs. So you'll typically see our OpEx move up in the second quarter. I think last year, if you go take a look at that, it's
a good way to think about how this year may play out as well.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: The only other point I would make, Ross, is we provided annual – we don't do it for SG&A but
for R&D guidance of $1.7 billion and now certainly that could round up or round down to that number, but that would
give you also some rough guidelines on that.
Okay, thank you, Ross. We'll move to the next caller.

We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Thanks, guys. Kevin, any thoughts on the amount of debt that you are comfortable taking on
associated with the National deal?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Craig, we talked about we would probably issue somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion
of debt as part of that acquisition. I don't have any more updates for you on that. I still think that's probably a good
number frame for modeling purposes.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Yeah. You talked about lead times, pretty clear message there. As you look at pricing dynamics,
especially in high volume analog and power management, any change to pricing over the last month or two especially
since the quake?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Craig, pricing pretty much across the board is trending normally. So, you know, I don't think
we have seen anything that we would say is first of all, abnormal to begin with, much less that we would correlate to
the quake.

Next is Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Hello, Tristan.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Hi. Good afternoon. Could you give us an update on the market share you believe you have with
OMAP 4 and in terms of the market share gains that you expect over the next few quarters, is that relative to previous
OMAP products, or it is relative to the competition and if so, why do you think you were gaining share in that space?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. So I don't have a share number for you specifically, but there's probably lots of
third-party people that make their living at trying to make that assessment, so I guess I would just reference you in that
direction.
In terms of gains that we're making and what gives us confidence that we will see share gains, it's as simple as looking
at the pipeline of wins that we have underway. To some degree, Tristan, it depends upon how you define the market. I
don't mean that cute.
What I mean though, is that our view of mobile computing and the opportunity there is a pretty broad definition of the
opportunity. So it includes tablets and it includes smartphones, but it also includes areas like data terminals. You know,
the guy that, you know, in the brown truck that delivers a package to you that pulls a little data terminal out and records
the delivery and has you sign on the pad, we view that as an OMAP, a potential OMAP application and in fact, we have
wins in that space.
So again, a very broad definition of the opportunity for mobile computing and by no means does that diminish our
enthusiasm for OMAP in smartphones and in tablets. In fact, I would say both of those are must-win areas, but we also
have a much broader definition where we're going to be able to take that same OMAP technology and put it into a lot of
different areas: e-readers, personal navigation devices I mentioned previously, are all areas where today we have
OMAP design wins in that pipeline that I'm referring to that, you know, these aren't, you know, demo projects that
somebody did at a trade show. These are production programs that we have in development for customers that will be
going into production in 2011.
And so, you know, there's always uncertainty as to how much success a particular product will have out in the
marketplace, but in terms of the quality of the customers, the size of the potential opportunities, we are quite confident
it's going to translate to very solid market share gains for us in that market.
Do you have a follow-on, Tristan?
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Quick follow-up on the production for RFAB. Any type of guidance in terms of production we
can expect from RFAB by the end of this year and also, how would that compare with the peak potential output from
that same fab?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. Tristan, you know, what I would say today is the revenue amount coming out of RFAB
is still relatively small. We have said all along that we are capable today from an equipment perspective of ramping
RFAB up into about a $2 billion production level and that we will pace that based upon market demand. Certainly,
events such as we've had in Japan have resulted in somewhat of an acceleration there, but I don't have a specific
number to be able to say, we will be at this dollar value or this percent utilization other than it's ramping nicely, maybe
even ahead of plan based on, you know, the added motivation of getting those Miho devices qualified over there.
Okay, operator, I believe we have time for one more caller.

Operator
We'll go next to Ramesh Misra with Brigantine Advisors.
<Q - Ramesh Misra>: Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Ron, very roughly, what was your percentage of revenues
from Japan? And longer term, do you expect that to change? In other words, are you seeing customers in Japan looking
to diversify their supplier base from being heavily Japan-centric to something that's a little more balanced?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. Our percent of revenue from Japan last year was about 10% and to the question of are
we looking – do we believe customers will look for more diversified supplier base, I don't believe so. I think our – I
shouldn't say I don't believe so. What I mean is I think it's way too early for customers to be going through that. They're
focused on bringing their factories back into operation in that earthquake zone. I don't think at this point they're trying
to figure out whether they should be there or whether they should be someplace else. That can happen and probably
very likely could happen later, but I haven't heard of customers re-evaluating their location status.
<A - Kevin P. March>: I would just point out also that the output from Miho is not just sold into Japan but it is sold
around the world. So there's not a direct connection between Miho or Aizu factories and the actual revenue we gain in
Japan.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: One thing I will mention as a longer term benefit for TI is, you know, it's always – there is cost
to our customers, there's distractions to our customers to re-qualify a product from one fab to another fab, but as we
have said before, because of the supply disruption out of Miho there has been an intensified effort on behalf of the
customers to go ahead and help us internally multi-source those products into other fabs and that's something that, just
from an operational and logistics perspective, we'll benefit from over time having the same devices in production at
multiple fabs and having those customer qualifications already in place just always provides us a different level of
flexibility.
Okay, Ramesh, do you have a follow-on question?
<Q - Ramesh Misra>: Okay, that is helpful. A very quick one. On your mid-quarter update, you said you felt that the
PC business had bottomed and begun to rebound. Are you still seeing that and I guess broader PC including the
mobile?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Yes, Ramesh, that, in fact, is correct. I think what we said was earlier in the quarter because
there had been a chipset recall, we had seen disruption in that business but that as we moved later into February as that
other supplier basically got back on-line and moved forward, we had seen even at the mid-quarter update, recovery in
our PC-related business and I would say that did continue through the month of March. So that business is continuing
well at this point.
Okay, and with that, we'll wrap up. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good
evening.
