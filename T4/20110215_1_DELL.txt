In Q1, we will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 2nd and the Wells Fargo Tech
Summit on April 7th. Also, on March 31st Dell and UBS will host a conference call with Steve Schuckenbrock to
discuss our services business.
Next, I'd like to remind you all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Actual results and events could different
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which
are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and
in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please note that on today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross
margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP financial
measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the
Investor Relations portion of our website at Dell.com and in the press release included in our 8-K filed today. I
encourage you to review these documents.
Please also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Rob.
We had a very strong fourth quarter and it caps off a solid full year for the company. We had great contributions from
all parts of our business in the quarter, and have now grown revenue and improved profitability for four quarters in a
row.
As we've said before, our teams have been focused each quarter on delivering an operating income target. We have had
quite a few areas where our execution improved significantly. We were vigilant on costs. We reduced complexity and
optimized our supply chain. We expanded our enterprise solutions and services footprint, and we were disciplined on
price and sales execution. This quarter's results really speak to the momentum we feel in the business, and we're
confident on the sustainability of this performance.
Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter P&L, and then I'll revisit our full-year results before turning to our outlook
for the next year. Our key performance metrics are provided for your reference on pages five and six in the web deck.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $15.7 billion, up 5% year over year and 2% sequentially, driven by another strong
showing in our enterprise solutions and services business and strong commercial client growth, led by large enterprise
and the SMB business. Enterprise solutions and services grew 7% to $4.6 billion in revenue, while our client product
business grew 4% to $8.4 billion. Also, our consumer business showed improvement and was modestly profitable at
2% operating income.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.3% to revenue. And we delivered record earnings per share
of $0.48, the highest ever in any quarter for the company. Earnings per share was up 182% year over-year and 14%
sequentially.
For the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We delivered 21.5% gross margins, driven by strong
supply chain execution, continued broad component cost declines and good pricing discipline, and sales execution,
which positively impacted all of our lines of business. OpEx was $2.1 billion or 13.3% of revenue, and was driven by
increased investments in our solutions teams and sales capacity and additional expense related to our performance
based compensation plans. As we reiterated last quarter, our variable compensation plans are directly tied to revenue
growth, operating income growth, and cash flow, so we feel good about how these plans are working.

Operating income grew 61% to $1.3 billion or 8.2% of revenue. All of our commercial and public segments showed
improved operating leverage in the quarter. The commercial segments as a whole delivered 10.6% operating income,
representing a 270 basis point increase from the previous year. Interest and other expenses were $18 million, driven by
approximately $60 million of quarterly interest and banking fee expense, offset by foreign currency impacts and
investment income.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.7%, driven by an increase in earnings attributable to lower taxed jurisdictions. For
the full year, our tax rate was 22.2%.
Earnings per share increased 89% year over year to $0.53 per share in the quarter.
In the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations, $1.6 billion in free cash flow, and our cash
conversion cycle was a negative 33 days. We ended the quarter with $15.1 billion in cash and investments, and we
repurchased $200 million worth of stock in the quarter.
As we describe on slide 10, we are committed to an A credit rating to support our captive finance company and ensure
access to commercial paper. We continue to actively manage our global liquidity and continue to monitor the credit
markets for favorable entry points.
Also because this topic has come up a couple times now, let me say again we have no intention to take the company
private. We're focused on funding the strategic transformation of the business and maintaining a moderate share
repurchase program. This year, we returned nearly 20% of free cash flow to equity investors in the form of $800
million in share repurchase.
Now let's take a look at our lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find detailed on pages 11 through
15 in our web deck. Enterprise solutions and services revenue grew 7% to $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in
servers and networking, which grew at 16%. Rack and blade servers both grew 26%.
Our storage business grew 6% sequentially and declined 4% year over year. EqualLogic had another strong quarter,
with revenue that grew 49%. Clearly our storage business has transitioned from primarily being a storage reseller to a
full-fledged storage technology provider. Because of this change in mix, our total gross margin contribution for storage
has more than doubled over the last two years. We've made a conscious decision to invest organically and inorganically
to grow our intellectual property and we're pleased with the progress here.
Turning to client, we continue to see a strong corporate refresh cycle, driven by consistent growth in large enterprise
and the SMB businesses. We anticipated more pricing pressure than actually materialized in the quarter and are hopeful
that this environment will continue.
Overall client hardware revenues were up 4%. Client revenue in large enterprise grew 20%; and in SMB, it grew 10%.
Consumer client growth was up 10% sequentially but down 6% year over year relative to a strong Windows 7 launch
last year. Software and peripherals [S&P] grew 7% to $2.7 billion, driven by strong performance from display and
peripherals, and now represent 17% of our revenue.
Geographically, we saw revenue growth across all regions, with APJ up 17%. And the Americas and EMEA were both
up 3% in the quarter.
Emerging countries continue to be a key driver for us. BRIC countries grew 21% and now represent 13% of our
consolidated revenue. India was up 37%. China was up 21%, and Brazil was up 15% year over year in the quarter.
Revenue among BRIC-plus-ten countries grew 19%, and for the full year revenue is now almost $10 billion. In
particular this quarter, revenue grew 33% in Southeast Asia.
Turning to our segment level performance on pages 16 through 20 in the web deck, in our large enterprise, public, and
SMB segments combined, revenue grew 9% to $12.4 billion. Strong demand, good sales execution, and a favorable
cost environment led to double-digit gross margin dollar growth in servers, storage, client, and S&P business. The
combination of these segments delivered $1.3 billion in operating income, or 10.6% of revenue and up 270 basis points
from the prior year.

Our public business revenue was up 4% to $4 billion. We continue to see a mixed environment here, with challenging
customer dynamics in Europe. Server and storage revenue was up 13% and 12% respectively. Overall public OpInc
was $366 million and improved 50 basis points to 9.2% of revenue.
Our small and medium business had a very strong revenue and profit quarter as well. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up
12% to the highest level in two years, driven by strong demand across all product lines. Servers and storage revenue
were up 22% and 20% respectively, while our client hardware was also strong with revenue there up 10%. We
delivered operating income of $450 million or 12% of revenue.
In our consumer business, revenue was $3.3 billion and up 11% sequentially, driven by the holiday season, and down
8% versus the previous year after last year's launch of Windows 7. More importantly, consumer delivered 2.1%
operating profit. We continue to make progress in our product and marketing initiatives and in matching our supply
chain with the retail buying seasons. This was again the case during the holiday season.
Overall operating profit improved due to supply chain transformation, favorable component environment, and a
streamlined product portfolio.
Now I'll turn it over to Steve Schuckenbrock to discuss our large enterprise and Dell Services performance.
Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services
Thanks, Brian.
First, let me start with the large enterprise segment. Revenue was up 12% to $4.7 billion, led by an ongoing hardware
refresh and early stages of new project investments among large corporate accounts. Client revenue was up 20% and
server growth was up 14%. OpInc as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points sequentially and 400 basis points
on a year-over-year basis, driven to our record high of $502 million or 10.7% of revenue. Moreover, FY '11 revenue in
large enterprise was back to FY '09 levels.
Profitability has improved 190 basis points from 6.4% operating income two years ago to 8.3% in FY '11. The
profitability improvement in large enterprise is indicative of the changes we're making in our business. The first is a
change in mix in our business to more enterprise solutions and services. At the beginning of FY '09, enterprise
solutions and services represented about a third of our large enterprise business and less than half of our gross margin
contribution. As we close FY '11, enterprise solutions and services mix has increased to 41% of our revenue and over
half of our gross margin contribution.
The second change is better client dynamics in the back half of this year, particularly as component costs improved
coupled with a resurgence in corporate demand.
The third significant change is better overall sales execution. All year long, we have been motivated and disciplined
with respect to managing for OpInc dollar growth. We have made significant investments in sales and marketing
capabilities and are definitely seeing the results of solution selling, better pricing execution, and strong positioning for
robust demand that is aligned with our most profitable products. We believe all of these changes are sustainable into
this year. We will continue to drive the mix towards our enterprise solutions and services business, and we feel good
that corporate demand will continue.
As you know, I recently moved back to head our services business. First, I want to thank Peter Altabef and the Dell
Services team on the successful integration of Perot Systems. It is never easy to take two separate organizations and
blend them into one. But in the last year, the team in Plano has delivered on its first year revenue and cost synergy
targets and put together a services organization with annual revenue of $7.7 billion. This team now includes 43,000
people within Services and IT, operates 60 technology support centers in 90 countries, and manages 36 customer data
centers.

Also, the acquisitions of InSite One and SecureWorks attest to our intent to grow IP in areas customers value and
where we see continued business growth. InSite One is the largest independent provider of object storage used to
catalog medical imaging. It is a fantastic acquisition. Similarly, SecureWorks gives us a beachhead in security and
positions us to offer more cloud based solutions. SecureWorks leverages unique industry leading IP to process more
than 13 billion security events per day and protect more than 3,000 customers on a worldwide basis.
For the fourth quarter, Dell Services revenue grew 1% to $1.9 billion. Transactional warranty support of 1.1 billion, flat
on a year-on-year basis, and up 2% sequentially. Outsourcing revenue was $656 million, up 2%. We have experienced
slightly longer sales cycles this year, but the level of bid activity continues to be elevated. Our project services grew 6%
to $190 million. Solutions surrounding globally delivered application services, domestic enterprise resource planning,
and engineering services saw the strongest year-to-year growth.
Our services backlog is now $13.9 billion, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Services backlog includes deferred
services revenue and contracted services backlog and provides useful information regarding trends and changes in the
size of our services business over time.
Deferred service revenue, which consists primarily of our extended warranties, were $6.7 billion, up 10% year over
year. Estimated contract and services backlog, which is primarily related to our outsourcing services business, was $7.2
billion, up 8% overall; and importantly, includes our new customer signings, which were up 17% on a year-on-year
basis.
We are very confident in the value we can create for our customers and shareholders through continued innovation and
outstanding service delivery. I look forward to updating you on our services strategy on a separate call on March 31st.
Now let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Steve.
Let me quickly wrap up with a look back at the full year. Fiscal year '11 revenue was $61.5 billion, up 16%.
Non-GAAP gross margins improved 90 basis points to 19.1% for the year. And operating income grew 40% to $4.1
billion or 6.7% of revenue. And we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share and GAAP earnings per share of $1.59 and
$1.35 respectively, our best performance in five years.
Cash flow from operations was $4.0 billion. Our enterprise solutions and services business is now a $17.6 billion
franchise, up from $14.5 billion two years ago. As Steve pointed out, an increasing percentage of our profit
contribution is coming from these solutions and services businesses. Our supply chain teams have also done an
excellent job of redefining and optimizing our supply chain to accelerate our competitiveness. Over the last couple
years, we've moved significant manufacturing capability to contract manufacturers. The ODMs now produce about
70% of our products. We now ship approximately 42% of our client hardware as fixed configurations, and freight most
of this volume over the water. Our product quality is also significantly improved, such that we were able to realize
lower warranty expense.
Consistent with the plans we shared with you in June, we've also been investing OpEx in the future of our business.
During the year, you saw us ramp our growth investments as our margins improved in the second half. We're pleased
with the results we achieved this year and believe they demonstrate that our strategy has taken hold and is progressing
well.
Let's turn to our outlook for the full year. For fiscal 2012, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 9%, non-GAAP
operating income growth of 6% to 12%, and continued strong execution on cash flow with cash flow from operations
exceeding our net income.
We believe the favorable component cost environment should continue into the first half of fiscal year '12, but the rate
of cost deflation could slow as we move through the second half of the year. We also note that we continue to make

strategic investments to grow our enterprise solutions and services business. On a quarterly basis, we anticipate interest
and other to increase to around $60 million in expense per quarter.
Our tax rate for the full year FY '11 was slightly over 22%, and we see our tax rate next year to be in the 23% to 25%
range.
I want to reiterate that our teams are aligned and incentivized for reaching revenue, operating income, and cash flow
targets. In FY '11, we consistently hit our operating targets every quarter. We did so by making appropriate tradeoffs
and pruning lower margin business in favor of revenue that delivered higher margins. We also modulated our operating
expenses in the first half of the year and then made prudent investments in the back half of the year as margins
improved again. We effectively improved operating income throughout the year while making key long-term
investments that will drive our performance in the future.
As we move into FY '12, we will sustain this discipline and performance around managing for profitable growth. For
the first quarter, we expect normal seasonal declines in our consumer and public businesses, and as such, a slight
sequential decline in revenue overall.
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.
Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brian.
It has been a great year. There's a lot to celebrate from FY '11, and I'm very pleased with our full-year results and the
strong performance we're seeing in our commercial businesses. FY '11 was largely about building out our enterprise
solutions and services portfolio and fixing and transforming our supply chain to get us healthy and more competitive.
We grew our enterprise solutions and services revenue 27% to $17.6 billion. And Dell branded storage now represents
nearly two-thirds of storage revenues and over 80% of storage profits. During the year, our supply chain improved
significantly, and client gross margin dollars improved more than 40% in the second half of the year.
We remain focused on developing and acquiring new technologies and capabilities, and our IT solutions portfolio has
never been stronger. Among these investments are the recently completed acquisitions of SecureWorks for managed
security services, Boomi as a SaaS platform to ease data exchange between cloud based and on-premise applications,
and InSite One, a cloud based leader in medical archiving solutions.
Our strategy around the efficient enterprise and flexible supply chain continues. We continue to develop and acquire
key IP and enhance our sales capabilities. And we're also narrowing our focus on three key solution domains, namely
end user computing, data center and information management, and services and all things cloud. Each of these solution
domains represents key areas Dell has to win.
If FY '11 was largely about getting operationally fit, then FY '12 is going to be about leveraging this position of health
and strength to move more aggressively and accelerate our transformation as a services and solutions company.
Customers are now seeing Dell in a fresh light, and we're heading into the new year with strength and optimism.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Robert L. Williams II, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Michael.
Just a quick reminder to please limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Casey, let's go ahead and take the first
question.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill Shope>: Great. Thanks, guys. I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on component pricing,
particularly as a margin driver. Which components benefited the quarter most, and which components do you expect to
fuel the continued benefit you stated going into the first half?
And then as a follow-up to that, when you comment on the sustainability of results, is that a gross margin statement for
fiscal '12? Or will you adjust OpEx downward as we approach more normalized gross margins in the back half of the
year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Bill. I think on the component
side, I guess I would make the point that components continue to be favorable, as we said coming out of the third
quarter. I think memory, obviously, contributed in the quarter. LCDs continued to contribute as well. Just generally, we
saw overall a very favorable component environment in the fourth quarter.
But I would also say that there were a lot of other areas that contributed to the improved performance in margins and
operating income in general. Great supply chain execution we talked about, product quality improvements. We had
good pricing execution in the quarter, expanded product offerings, and moving into some high priced bands in all parts
of the business. And you see the performance improvement we saw in the consumer business.
So a lot of specific items that contributed to that improved performance, not just components.
As we think about heading into fiscal year '12 and the outlook that we provided, we've talked a lot about more – and
what we provide really is operating income. So our energy is focused around operating income and cash earnings as the
priority. And we're not really fixated on gross margins.
We've been saying this for a while. Over time, we've said that our strategy should result in higher gross margins and
higher OpEx for the company. I think you're starting to see some of that. And we saw operating income for the year in
the 6.7% range of revenue for the total year, which is a nice improvement over last year's 5.6%. And based on the
outlook we gave you for fiscal year '12, we would expect to see continued improvement in the operating income
percentage.
So that's how we're thinking about it. We'll modulate around that as we move throughout the year.
Operator
Our next question will come from Richard Gardner from Citi.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay, thanks. Thank you very much. I think you just answered one of them. Just to be clear,
Brian, you are committed to continued expansion in operating margin percentage this year, it sounds. Could you talk
about the areas that you see, the opportunities that you see, both in terms of improving product mix or reducing costs
that will contribute to that continued expansion this year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I think it's going be a lot more of the
same in terms of the areas of focus. You'll see us continue to focus on the supply chain. There are areas we can
continue to find cost on the product side. Pricing is clearly an opportunity. Expanding the business on the enterprise
side clearly has to be the biggest priority for us as we mix up the business in general.
So I think you'll see that as we move forward as well and some of the investments we're making from an acquisition
standpoint. But also the OpEx we put into the business is primarily focused on those higher margin areas that should

ultimately drive expansion of overall operating income for the company. So I think that's the way we're thinking about
it.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay, and then as a follow-up for Michael, I guess. Michael, you talked about this year
being an even more aggressive year in terms of the company's transformation. Is there a takeaway from that statement
regarding the company's acquisition strategy for this year? Or is the acquisition strategy going to remain pretty much
the same? Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it will be very similar to what you've seen us
do in the recent history here where we're looking for relatively smaller sized ingredient acquisitions where we can
leverage them with our substantial customer access and distribution.
A couple of points, just to add on to some of the recent questions. Clearly there are mix improvements going on in the
business. That's helping the margins.
You'll also recall that we embarked on a real change in our supply chain about two years ago and have really made
some remarkable progress. And that showed up quite a lot in the second half of the year. I think this year, we'll have a
full year effect of that. And we're quite pleased with the improvements there, and we think those are sustainable.
Operator
Our next question will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yes, hey. Thanks a lot. Michael, could you elaborate a little bit more on software in particular?
You have that chart in your remarks going through your acquisitions. Could you just clarify a little more on where you
think you are in management software? And perhaps just a little more elaboration on your software strategy in
particular?
Because you've bought storage. You obviously are pretty good in servers. So if you just talk about where you are on
software and what your strengths and weakness may be there? And then I just have one quick follow-up.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think you're already seeing us in systems
management and some of the software around supporting the systems infrastructure. The KACE acquisition was
completed about a year ago. And I think we have more than tripled the size of the business and had really great success
with that. We're looking at how we can expand that platform into new customer categories and new capability.
And we're finding a great ability to combine more and more offers together. So we have a very strong server platform.
The storage platform continues to grow. We have strengthened the PowerConnect line, particularly with our own
PowerConnect 10-gig switch, and software to help the management and orchestration of large numbers of virtual
machines. Recently, we acquired SecureWorks, which has a substantial amount of IP in managing security incidents,
and has become a trusted provider to thousands of companies around the world. That's a platform we think we can
grow quite substantially at attractive margins.
Operator
Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question for the first half of 2012.
It looks like, at least for the first quarter, you're expecting relatively flat revenues. You commented that you expect the
favorable component cost environment to continue into the first half of the year. And your gross margins have gone up
150 basis points or more in each of the last two quarters.

So I guess the question is, why wouldn't gross margins continue to go up in the first half of 2012? Are you expecting
some change in the pricing environment? And then I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: I think, Toni, if you recall the third quarter
conversation, we were probably a little bit hesitant to commit given – anticipating a little bit more challenging pricing
environment. It really didn't play out that way.
So I think we'll take a conservative approach and be hopeful that that's the environment that continues. If we see
continued progress in terms of the execution of the team and supply chain changes that we've made as well as a great
environment, then it should be a good environment for us, and that's what we're hopeful for.
But again, we're driving operating income, and we're going to make some investments in that sort of an environment to
ultimately position us for the long term.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, Toni, and I would just like to emphasize that
for us, profit growth is more important than unit growth. And that will be the defining philosophy that we use here.

Our next question will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi, thanks very much. This is for you, Brian, if I could. Could you talk a little bit about the
underpinnings of your revenue growth guidance for FY '12? In particular, I'd like to hear how you're thinking about the
client revenues, the growth trajectory there, as well as services to get to the guidance that you've talked about, please.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I think we've given you a range that
we think captures some of the potential volatility we can see in the environment. I do think we're fairly well aligned
with what we think – what most of the industry projections are around client growth for the year.
Again, we're more heavily weighted towards the commercial side of that business, so we should do slightly better than
that in terms of overall growth rates. And we would expect that's how it will play out for us. Other parts of the business,
we would expect to grow faster than the market on our enterprise solutions and services side of the business.
So if you can put all that together, that's how you get to that range that we laid out.
<A - Robert L. Williams II, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, Casey, let's allow each of the analysts one
follow-up. So Keith, if you have a follow up, we'd be happy to do that.
Operator
Okay. Our next question will come from Steven Fox with CLSA.
<Q - Steven Fox>: Hi. Good afternoon, two questions. First of all, just following up on that revenue question, you
talked about the revenues for – the sales cycle rather – for the services business elongating, and your public services
revenue is about 40% of the total. So why would the services business grow maybe faster than average or below
average?
And then secondly, can you just talk about the SMB margins a little bit more? How sustainable are the Q4 levels? What
could pull them in or allow them to stay at those levels?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I guess I'll let Steve answer the
services question. I think clearly there are lots of areas where we have room to grow in the services business and places
we're going to make investments to expand beyond the current footprint we have in services, so that's got to be a big
part of the answer in terms of how we grow faster than the market.

<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: Yes, our public business was 40% of its revenue in the
services space is indicative of the strength of our healthcare business.
If you look at the combination of our transactional business, which is more historical Dell, and the acquisitions that
we've made over the course of the last year or so, we've got a phenomenal healthcare business – in fact, ranked the best
or at the top quadrant of the space by Gartner. We are quite excited about some of the growth opportunities, including
the acquisition we just made of InSite One and some of the capabilities that we're bringing to hospital communities and
focused on patient care.
You'll see us do similar things across other industries. And when you look at the cloud strategy and you look at what
we're doing relative to bringing IP, like we did with SecureWorks, like we did with InSite One, like we're doing with
some of the PAC [Primary Assessment and Care] systems in the healthcare space, you'll see us do similar type plays
across other industries, which I think will underpin growth rate not only in pub, but across large enterprise and CSMB,
as well.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: And Steven, on SMB, we're very, very
pleased with the profitability of that business. It's 12% of revenue right now; great execution by the team, great
progress in growing the business; the BRIC countries driving some strong growth for them.
There's clearly opportunity to continue to improve enterprise mix in the SMB business and that will help us continue to
drive high margins there. As Michael said, we value that profit more than we do unit growth, and this is a place where
it's playing out well for us.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And I think we are highly differentiated in SMB,
and we're finding that the acquisitions we're making have their fastest and first takeoff in SMB, but also applicability to
all of our commercial businesses.
<Q - Steven Fox>: Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question will come from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian Alexander>: Yes, maybe to follow up on Keith's question, the revenue growth guidance for FY '12, 5% to
9%, assumes acceleration from where we were in the fourth quarter. And most companies out there are expecting stable
to perhaps moderating growth in calendar '11 from where we exited 2010. And in fact, the only categories that grew
above 5% in your fourth quarter were servers and software and peripherals.
So just going back to this, what gives you the optimism that growth will actually accelerate from where we were in the
fourth quarter? And if you could be more specific by customer segment, product segment, or region on where you
expect to see that acceleration? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: I think there are a couple things going on.
In the consumer business, for instance, we made some conscious decisions to prune some of the growth we had in that
business within the quarter, especially during the holiday season. I think we look back at that as a smart decision that
helped us generate 2% operating income in the quarter.
We'll continue to watch that business and we'll continue to make those tradeoffs in a smart way. But I think we expect
to grow faster in consumer this year. So that's clearly an area that you'll see us modulate around margins, but probably
grow at a faster rate.
I think if you look at the rest of the business, we continue to feel strong. There's going be strong growth on the
corporate side around the client refresh. We think the server business will continue to have above average growth rates
for the industry. And some of the acquisitions that we've done will begin to contribute in terms of growth for the
business from the enterprise side, as well.

<Q - Brian Alexander>: And then my follow-up – thanks for that, Brian. My follow-up would be the 2% consumer
margin that you just achieved, how much of that would you say was driven by sustainable improvements that you've
made in that business? And do you expect, per your margin target for FY '12, do you expect to be able to sustain low
single-digit operating margins in consumer, especially given the fact that you expect it to grow nicely this year? Thank
you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: I can tell you, we're counting on the
consumer business to deliver improved margins in FY '12 from the fourth quarter.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And we had very strong growth in our XPS and
Alienware businesses. I think they grew 42% in the quarter. I think you'll see us focus on more profitable opportunities
there.

Our next question will come from Scott Craig from Bank of America.
<Q - Scott Craig>: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks, just a quick question around the services business. Can you maybe
describe the margin progress you've made in the services business over the past couple of years since you did the
acquisition?
And then just to follow up on the consumer operating profit question; that 2%, Brian, that you want to expand on, is
that something that we'll see pretty consistently through the year? In other words, will it be 2% every quarter or is that
more of an annual target you were talking about? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: I'll take the first part. We don't want to get
locked into micromanaging that. We're on a good track with that business and we think the trajectory is good.
Obviously, there is going to be some level of volatility in that business as you see demand ebb and flow and
investments we need to make. But we would expect that we'll improve from 2% in the coming year. When we look
back on the total year, I think we'll feel pretty good about it. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk about service.
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: Yes, I think just generally about the margin
improvement opportunities as well as progress that has been made in services, our ProSupport business continues to
resonate exceptionally well with customers. And the attach rates are up year on year. We expect continued
improvement in attach rates into this year. That's a wonderful profit source for us. And as you saw in the preamble
here, the backlog is now up to $13.9 billion, and that's an indication of both our outsourcing business as well as in our
transactional business underpinned by ProSupport.
If you look at our outsourcing and our projects business, both of them saw revenue growth. But importantly, we've
made real progress in some of the outsourcing contracts and saw improvements across those. And in the projects
business, we see significant opportunity to improve the profitability as we lean into this year. So we feel very good
about not only the progress we've made but some of the opportunities that lie here in the short term.
<Q - Scott Craig>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from Maynard Um with UBS.
<Q - Maynard Um>: Hi, thanks. Presumably, a more solutions based sale is higher gross margin across your product
portfolio, and you've spent a lot of time transitioning your sales force to become more solutions oriented, and

presumably with services eventually being the driver to that value proposition. I'm wondering if you can just talk about
how long you think it will take to transition Dell to become larger in solutions versus point product. Or maybe put
another way, how much of your revenue do you think you can generate that's solutions based in fiscal '12, including the
hardware?
And then my follow-up, can you just talk about your smartphone and tablet strategy? Presumably, that's higher margin.
How much of that is helping the consumer business, and what should we be looking forward to from Dell? Thanks.
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: Okay, let me start with the services piece of that
question. First of all, we really put a significant investment in place starting in fiscal year '11 where we increased the
capacity of the sales force, but as importantly, increased the capability of the sales force, with 115,000 hours of
training, 116 new courses, certification of technical specialists across the entire product line as well as into the services
categories. And so it was a pretty significant effort. And I think you're seeing in the results, in the margin expansion,
and in the growth in the enterprise business, and in the growth in the solutions space overall a real indication that these
strategies are paying off and beginning to work.
I hesitate to put a percentage on how much of our total revenue is going be "solutions," but I would tell you that
looking at the contribution of the enterprise business overall, which is up 32% on gross margin year on year and up
over 20 points of revenue year on year, and then watching the continued growth of our services business will be the
best leading indicators. And while I could look at large enterprise, and as I said on the call, we went from about a third
of our revenue being enterprise and services to over 40% of our revenue, I think you can see that number easily get up
to the 50% range as we look into the future.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And on a gross margin basis, I think almost
two-thirds of our gross margin now comes from server, storage, network, services, software, and peripherals. So from
that standpoint, the epicenter of the company has really shifted in terms of profitability to these other areas and away
from the PC, which is now only about a third of the company's margin.
On smartphones and tablets, we were very pleased to introduce the new Venue and Venue Pro, which are Android and
Windows Mobile 7 based 4.1-inch products. You'll see us enter the 10-inch tablet space with both Android Honeycomb
and Windows later on this year, and we think those will be reasonable platforms for us to participate more broadly in
this space. We've also rolled out services for mobility because we see many customers really looking to integrate these
mobility solutions into their environment. And that's a source of demand inside our services unit and we're focused on
helping customers address those needs.
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: Yes, I think that's a really critical opportunity for us in
the services space. Every customer we talk to is now looking at how do I manage, distribute, and compute, and that
goes all the way to smart devices. And so this past week, we announced some exciting services on application
development, security, and manageability of those endpoints.

Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Thank you very much. My first question is just with regard to the push out of Sandy Bridge. I
was just curious. Have you seen any pauses in terms of demand with people waiting for that? Or has there been any
hiccup?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Shannon, actually one of the benefits of
our shorter supply chain has been that we've had minimal impact to our customers. We had very little in the pipeline,
and the impact for us in the fourth quarter was basically nothing. We expect no impact as well in the first quarter, and I
would say that on the shipment side as well as the demand side.

<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay, great. And then, Michael, I had a question for you as a follow-up to the tablet question.
Given you have HP webOS out there; Microsoft has now done a deal with Nokia. Just can you give us a little idea on
how you're thinking about the OS landscape? And clearly you're talking about both Win Mobile 7 and Android. But
how are you thinking about partnerships going forward and how Dell will work with both Android and Windows and if
there's any other option that you would look at? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: For tablets, it's just as I said. It's Android
Honeycomb and Windows, and we have customers that have a preference for either one. It's very easy for us to create
platforms that share a great deal of hardware commonality that can run both – either operating system. And we're
presently not considering any other options. I don't really see any other viable options that are worthy of consideration.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: But no change following the Nokia-Microsoft decision? That relationship remains the same?

Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you. Can you just talk about revenue linearity through the January quarter? And
particularly, what was the pace of business in the month of January versus the end of the calendar year?
And then just as a follow-up, there are pretty consistently positive data points on corporate demand, but more mixed
data with some of your peers in China talking about a big deceleration in PC growth this year and some U.S. retail data
that has taken a turn for the worse. Are those factors you're seeing in the market, or do you think they're temporal or
specific to other vendors? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, Katy, I wouldn't call out anything
specific with January. It's about what we expected, the post-holiday consumer trend that we would usually see. We've
been talking about muted demand in consumer now for two or three quarters. We don't see anything that has changed in
that regard. As you know, that represents about 20% of our business today.
In terms of the rest of the trends, we would expect to see going into the first quarter the normal seasonality that we
would see quarter on quarter. And it hasn't really called out anything different and don't have any real specific concerns
about China right now.

Our next question will come from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Thank you. Good afternoon, two quick questions here. Steve, I wanted to come back to your
comments around the elongating sales cycle. I want to see what the opportunity therein as it relates to Dell could be. In
terms of as you guys come back here with a more focused enterprise solutions push, maybe a lower cost type of
platform, are you being folded into some of these folks here who are maybe stress testing their budgets a little more?
Are you seeing maybe a nice value add, lower cost platform? And how big could that opportunity be, if it is so?
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: I'm trying to make sure I understand your question. But
what I would tell you is that there's an enormous opportunity for Dell to do more attach of its services with hardware
solutions. I'll give you some terrific examples of things we're doing with storage, as an example, where we do
deployment and we do this wonderful program that we're learning from our future acquisition of Compellent around
Copilot and how they do the management, proactive management of capacity and overall load balancing services with
their customers as a part of their hardware offering. It's a wonderful offering. It's something that you can see us do

across our entire product line in the future.
If you look at some of the new capabilities we're offering where we integrate our server, our storage, and networking
products and wrap that with software and bring that to the market, that offers a significant amount of services from
consulting to implementation to helping customers with virtualization and also providing other types of services in the
future that we could potentially leverage from that footprint into a cloud.
And so I think there are plenty of opportunities to take advantage of the hardware business and to drive that into
different types of services offerings than you might have historically seen from Dell. I'm not sure I captured the
question perfectly, but if it was how do we extend out from the hardware business and do more in the services space
and wrap solutions around it, we see numerous opportunities to do that.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: And then as a follow-up either for Michael or Brian, how should we think about the ability
of Dell to really sustain this push in terms of a bigger, more powerful solutions provider? Just from an R&D
perspective, as we see other vendors, other service providers, other solutions providers try to gravitate toward the
higher profit segments within IT, I presume there's going to be need for greater differentiation. I just want to get a
better sense of how we should think about R&D going forward.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I think in the businesses where we have 60%,
70%, 80% gross margin, you'll see us invest R&D in the 10%, 15%, 20% of revenue range. We're doing that today and
that will continue.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: There is a dramatic shift of where the
R&D dollars in the company are going that has occurred over the last two years. As you look at what we've done with
the product portfolio on the client side, simplifying that product portfolio, leveraging our ODM relationships, we've
been able to reposition significant dollars away from our client business and into the enterprise side of our business. So
there's a pretty dramatic shift in where those dollars are being spent. And to Michael's point, they would be fully
aligned with those products that are high margin for the company.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Thank you, an architecture question regarding large enterprise for Michael or Steve. Do you
have a view on the consolidated stack versus best-of-breed point solutions? Does it matter for Dell or do you have a
roadmap in place that you can speak with customers about?
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: I think we've been pretty clear that we think open wins,
and we think it's really important to make sure that choice is preserved for our customers. We've built a strategy around
what we call open, capable, and affordable. And that means that we preserve customers' choice. We innovate at every
layer of the stack. And we drive for total cost of ownership as the key metric that our customers care about.
Now when we talk about open, it's very clear that some of our customers can benefit from how each of those layers get
integrated together. Are so we are offering solutions that have servers, have storage, have network capability bundled
together and can be sold as a unit to a customer. And that unit can be bought in increments of say 50 virtual machines
or 100 virtual machines or whatever the case might be, scaled quite nicely with the customer's business. And so frankly
with Dell, you can get it integrated or you can continue to – and you can continue to preserve your choice at every
layer. And we think that option and that flexibility is one of the critical things we do better than any of the competition.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would just point out; there is something wrong
with some of the rhetoric that's being put in the industry. I think if you go do your own research, what you'll find is that
the larger the customer, the larger customers will absolutely tend to prefer more best of breed, which is exactly the
opposite of the rhetoric that you're hearing or being sold from some others in the industry.

<Q - Jayson Noland>: Just as a follow-up there, is Dell limited at all when it comes to integrated or bundled solutions,
given that you partner on the networking side?
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: Not at all. In fact, we do integration with our own IP as
well as with partner IP today. And you can actually – I think what's really key to us is that we can, in fact, bring a
vertically integrated solution from Dell to our customers in small, medium, and large customer spaces, and we can
preserve the choice that our customers want to make at every one of the layers. And I think that's a unique capability
that we intend to preserve because we think it's what drives the best value for them.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Okay.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And our PowerConnect business is one of our fastest
growing, relatively new lines within our enterprise product organization. We're continuing to invest there. What we're

Our next question will come from Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys; a question with regards to the sustainability of the operating margin
outlook going forward. If you take your guidance for revenue and operating income growth at the midpoint, it implies
operating margins of about 6.7%. And clearly, 8.2% was solid in Q4. And based upon the gross margin commentary for
the first half of fiscal year '12, it sounds like we're going be on a downward trending trajectory for operating margins
throughout the year to get to the guidance for the year. So I was wondering if you could comment on the puts and takes
on why the current operating margin level is not sustainable.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, I don't – our math around the
midpoints would suggest that it's up year over year. We'd have to go back and confirm that with you in terms of how
you're doing that math. But we expect to see operating income continue to expand. We saw good progress in the second
half of the year, and we expect it to continue to improve as we move into next year.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Okay, and then a quick follow-up regarding Dell DCS, Data Center Service group. Can you
talk a little bit about maybe the size on an absolute level of this group? We've heard some pretty positive commentary
out there with some of the large customers; and then maybe a little bit on the margin profile here and your strategy
going forward? Thanks.
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: I don't think we're talking about size in terms of revenue
and margin specifically at BCS. But I can tell you that the business continues to expand. And as we've disclosed in the
past, at 21, it's now 22 of the top 25 clouds in the world, we believe we continue to take share in this space. And
margins have continued to improve throughout the year. And in fact, we see pretty positive momentum as we transition
into next year. So without giving you specific numbers in terms of size or revenue or numbers of units, et cetera, I think
we continue to be quite bullish in the DCS business overall.

positioned in those opportunities. And as I said, I think it was a reasonably favorable competitive market that we've
seen, and we're hopeful that that continues.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: And to be clear, your guidance implies the competitive market gets more aggressive going
forward. Is that correct?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: I think what we've said is that we've got
optionality in terms of how we manage the P&L. We've got good pricing disciplines in place. We've got a lot of
aggressive work around cost. I think given all of that, we feel comfortable that we can continue to drive operating
income expansion.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: And finally, on the tablet and smartphone space, do you think your supply chain will transfer
well to this form factor given that the components are very different? NAND, for example, touch screens, et cetera, do
you think your supply chain transfers and you can generate incremental contribution margins in this segment?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's absolutely our plan. And certainly as we've
understood the space and what others have done there, we believe we can enter the space and do it in a way that
contributes to our profits.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much.

We'll now take our final question from Louis Miscioscia with Collins Stewart.
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: Wow, so first question, Brian, just a clarification on the operating margins. I believe when
you're talking about that, you're talking on an annual basis, not a sequential basis for improvement, correct?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: That's right. That's right.
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: Great. On the services side, Steve, one of the things I think that the concept was in maybe
buying Perot was that, hopefully, we get some hardware pull-through. Can you just talk about that, whether you're
actually seeing some pull-through? Is it material yet, or do you still expect that some time in the future? And one more
services question follow-up.
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: First, yes, we are seeing hardware pull-through. We're
solutioning Dell hardware and Dell reference architectures into our core service offerings when we compete for bids in
the marketplace. And so yes is the answer to your question, we are seeing hardware and solutions pull-through and
quite excited about the advantages that that gives us.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer>: And we have better synergy expectations
around that in the first year.
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: Right, integration.
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: And then the follow-up was, did you say that services signings were up 17%; and if so,
maybe if you can just pinpoint which part of services? Maybe if you can just give us some thoughts on the whole year;
has that just picked up recently and the first through third quarters were a bit softer than that?
<A - Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Dell Services>: No. What I said is the new logo signings, the new
customer signings, so brand new Dell services customers is up 17% on a year-on-year basis. We've added some
significant new customers to our list, and we're seeing those relationships expand. I just had the opportunity to spend a

fair amount of time with those customers. We'll tell you we're off to a really good start, which is a critical phase of any
of these relationships, is to get out of the blocks well. And we are getting out of the blocks very well with those
customers. The pipeline continues to expand. I think what you'll see us do is more aggressively qualify that pipeline
because I think some of the elongated sales cycle issue is a result of chasing a lot of things. And so we'll narrow down
the focus to those things that are right in our wheelhouse that we know we can win. And I think you'll see a lot of
progress in that regard as we move forward.
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: Good luck on the new year, guys.
