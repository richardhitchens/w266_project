MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Today's call is
scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask
questions at the conclusion of the questions from the investment community.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome, thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017
first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app.
During our call today, please note the following unless otherwise stated. First, we'll be talking about results for the first
quarter of 2017 and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry, PMI volume,
and PMI market share performance now reflect cigarettes and PMI's heated tobacco units for those markets that have
commercial sales of iQOS. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the
most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our
website.
Reduced-Risk Products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the
potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?

Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are increasing our 2017 reported
diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates by $0.04 to a range of $4.84 to $4.99 for a favorable tax item only.
Our guidance continues to include $0.08 of unfavorable currency. Excluding currency and the tax item, our guidance
represents a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.
As a reminder, we expect our currency-neutral financial growth to be skewed towards the second half of 2017, notably
reflecting increased heated tobacco unit capacity and improving returns on our RRP investments as the year unfolds.
Let me now take you through our first quarter results, beginning with our combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit
shipment volume, which declined by 9.4% or 7.8% excluding estimated inventory movement. The decline was due
primarily to the impact of lower cigarette industry volume, partly reflecting the macroeconomic environment in
Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Russia, as well as a high prevalence of illicit trade in Pakistan and the
Philippines.
As seen on the left side of this slide, over half of the total decline consisted of low-price segment volumes, some of
which contributed very little, if any, unit margin. This limited the impact on our profitability and differs dramatically
from the overall price segment split of our premium positioned portfolio, as shown on the right.
Our first quarter volume decline was slightly larger than anticipated due to essentially to the lower industry volume in
Pakistan and Philippines as well as the magnitude of unfavorable inventory movements in Italy and Spain. For the full
year, we expect a combined decline of 3% to 4%, broadly in line with last year. The expected improvement over the
balance of 2017 is supported by three main factors: the lapping of challenging first half comparisons versus 2016 in
select geographies such as Argentina, the EU region, and Turkey; a lower impact of estimated unfavorable inventory
movements on a full-year basis; and significantly higher heated tobacco unit volume.
Despite the cigarette-driven volume decline, net revenues in the first quarter increased by 1.7% excluding currency.
This growth reflected favorable pricing, particularly in the Asia and EEMA [Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa]
regions as well as higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales. For the year, we continue to anticipate
currency-neutral net revenue growth above 6%.
Adjusted OCI declined by 1.7% excluding currency, primarily reflecting lower cigarette volume as well as significantly
higher investments behind the commercialization of iQOS, notably in the EU region and Japan. Adjusted diluted EPS
were flat at $0.98 with no currency impact, as the favorable effect of currencies such as the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese
yen, Russian ruble, and Swiss franc were offset by the negative effect related to the Egyptian pound, Mexican peso, and
Turkish lira.
Our strong pricing variance represents 6.7% of first quarter 2016 net revenues and included positive contributions from
all four regions. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, notably
Argentina, Germany, Indonesia, and Turkey, as well as others shown on this slide.
Our first quarter market share excluding China and the U.S. declined by 0.9 points to 26.8%, due principally to brands
in below premium-priced segments such as low-price Morven Gold in Pakistan, Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines,
and Next/Dubliss in Russia. Our premium brands performed well in the quarter, contributing 0.2 points of market share
growth, driven by the strong performance of our heated tobacco brands.
I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU region. Industry volume declined by 2.8% in
the quarter, consistent with the secular decrease in the market and our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%. Our
volume was down by 7.1% but was impacted by estimated unfavorable distributor cigarette inventory movements,
notably related to the implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive [TPD] in France, Italy, and Spain. Excluding
these inventory movements, our volume declined by 2.9%, broadly in line with the industry.
Our regional market share was essentially flat in the quarter, with growth in markets such as France, Germany, Poland,
and the UK offset by declines, notably in Italy and Spain.

In Italy, the sharp decline was due mainly to Philip Morris, reflecting the growth of the super low price segment as well
as Marlboro, which is the only major cigarette brand above the round €5 per pack price point. Marlboro was also
impacted by the TPD's ban on pack sizes of 10 cigarettes, which contributed approximately 12% of the brand's cigarette
volume prior to the ban. On a sequential basis, our total share in Italy was slightly up versus the fourth quarter,
supported by the growth of HEETS.
In Spain, the sharp decline was due principally to Marlboro cigarettes, notably reflecting the brand's passing of the
round €5 per pack price point in the vending channel, which accounts for nearly 30% of Marlboro's cigarette volume.
Moving to Russia, industry volume declined by 7.9% in the quarter, due primarily to the impact of excise tax driven
price increases. For the full year, we expect the decline to moderate to a range of 5% to 6%. Our February
quarter-to-date cigarette share declined by 0.4 points versus the same period last year, due mainly to the slower
penetration of competitors' price increases. However, our share has increased sequentially over the past two quarters,
driven by low-priced Bond Street as well as Philip Morris, which has benefited in part from the consolidation of certain
local brands in the Philip Morris trademark.
As evidenced by the brands driving our sequential cigarette share performance, we are observing further down-trading
in Russia. While the presence of big packs has declined following the ban on their production as of July last year,
residual volumes remained in the supply chain, and we are continuing to witness price competition around limited pack
editions with discounts equivalent to the per-stick price of big packs. Importantly, we are effectively balancing our
market share and profitability growth in Russia.
Turning now to the Philippines, we continue to prioritize the growth of our premium portfolio's profitability over the
defense of low margin volume and share. Higher pricing and favorable portfolio mix reflecting the strong performance
of Marlboro drove profitability growth in the quarter despite the cigarette industry volume decline of 15.6%. Marlboro
cigarette share increased by 5 points to 32.5%, driven by in-switching from lower priced brands. To further highlight
Marlboro's strength, its sequential share has now increased for 11 straight quarters.
Our total cigarette share decline in the quarter was due mainly to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as
continued competitor discounting at the bottom of the market. This led to widened price gaps notably compared to
Fortune and Jackpot. We are therefore encouraged by the government's renewed focus on addressing illicit trade,
including excise tax stamp compliance. We are hopeful for sustained enforcement to address the issue long term, which
we believe should ensure that prices at the bottom of the market reflect full excise tax payment.
In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.5% in the quarter, reflecting the continued soft economic
environment and above-inflation tax-driven retail price increases. While history shows that quarterly trends in the
market can be volatile, we anticipate a decline of 1% to 2% for the full year, in line with 2016. Our cigarette market
share declined by 0.5 points in the quarter, due mainly to Sampoerna A, our leading lighter tasting machine-made
kretek brand, as well as Marlboro in the whites segment following its passing of the IDR 20,000 per pack price point.
The decline was partly offset by the growth of full flavor machine-made kretek offers such as U Bold and Marlboro
Filter Black. The latter has been gradually expanding since its initial launch in 25 cities last September and reached 1%
national share in the first quarter.
In Japan, the strong performance of iQOS continues to be the primary driver of our result. Market share increased by
5.4 points in the quarter to 30%, driven mainly by the growth of Marlboro HeatSticks. Marlboro share, including
cigarettes and HeatSticks, increased by 5.7 points to 17.1%. Industry volume declined by 7.4% or by 4.3% excluding
inventory movement.
The strong performance of iQOS in Japan is further evidenced by the weekly offtake shares for Marlboro HeatSticks.
As seen on this chart, the brand closed the quarter with a weekly offtake share of 9.6% nationally, 11.6% in Tokyo, and
14.9% in Sendai. We believe that the strong offtake performance in Sendai in particular clearly demonstrates the
growing potential of the heated tobacco category in Japan.
Turning to the commercialization of iQOS more broadly, we have now launched iQOS in key cities in 24 markets
globally following city launches in Colombia and Lithuania during the first quarter and in Poland and Serbia earlier this

month. By year end, we continue to expect iQOS to be in key cities nationwide in a total of 30 to 35 markets, subject to
capacity.
Importantly, our heated tobacco portfolio is beginning to achieve strong national market share growth sequentially in
some of our early launch markets beyond Japan. For example, in Italy, Switzerland, and Portugal, our national share
reached 0.5%, 0.9%, and 0.4% respectively in the first quarter of 2017. These results have been achieved despite iQOS
focus areas representing less than 35% of cigarette industry volume in each market.
Our share performance in Germany is also worth highlighting. Given the limited focus area and relatively brief period
since launch, national market share data are not yet meaningful. However, HEETS have recorded strong sequential
offtake share growth in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, reaching a combined share of 0.6% in the first quarter and 0.8%
in the last week of March.
Let me now provide an update on our heated tobacco unit capacity. We enter 2017 with approximately 15 billion units
of installed annual capacity and continue to anticipate approximately 50 billion units of such capacity at year end. This
translates to over 32 billion units in expected total capacity available for commercialization in 2017.
As additional capacity has come online this the year, we have begun to gradually increase the number of iQOS devices
available for sale in Japan and will continue to do so as the year unfolds. In addition, we have started to implement our
plans to reach installed annual capacity of 100 billion units by the end of 2018. As a result, we expect to have
approximately 75 billion units in total capacity available for commercialization in 2018.
In support of these plans, we recently announced our decision to convert our cigarette factory in Greece to heated
tobacco unit production. Consequently, we are increasing our planned capital expenditures in 2017 to $1.6 billion from
the $1.5 billion previously communicated. We continue to target operating cash flow of $8.5 billion this year.
In conclusion, our first quarter results generally came in as expected while cigarette volume was lower than anticipated.
Our key assumptions for the full year remain intact, namely currency-neutral net revenue growth of above 6%,
supported by favorable pricing as well as higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales. To build upon the
exceptional performance of iQOS, we are making significant investments behind both commercialization and the
expansion of heated tobacco unit capacity. Importantly, we currently estimate that approximately 1.8 million adult
consumers have already quit smoking cigarettes and switched to iQOS.
Finally, the full-year outlook for our business remains strong. Our 2017 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of
approximately 9% to 12% excluding currency and the favorable tax item compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in
2016.
Thank you, and I will be happy now to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Chris. Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi, Jacek. How are you? Thank you. I just wanted to ask you two questions if I could. I
just want to get a sense of – you have this available – you have iQOS available in 24 markets today. There have been
some comments maybe it's going to go into France and there are more markets still to come throughout the year. As
you look at your capacity development throughout the year, you've given the numbers clearly what's available for the
year. But you're having a pretty quick uptake obviously in Japan, meaning you're needing more and more volume for
that market. I just want to get a sense of, is it more important now to have this available in more markets or to make it

more widely available in the existing markets in which you're in? Do you have the capacity to do both of those in
2017?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. Look, it takes a bit of time in each market to build the necessary capacity infrastructure in
order for the national expansion. So what we have learned so far from the experience we have with the
commercialization of iQOS is that the best is to start always with one or two cities and start building the expansion
based on what we have learned and what we have installed in these cities. This requires quite significant deployment of
additional sales force, but also the creation, establishment of iQOS stores, boutiques, flagship stores, et cetera. So we
always will need that runway. And essentially, opening these markets every year does not put at this stage that much of
a constraint on available capacity, but allows us to build faster, much broader base ahead of 2018 or 2019. So this is
how we look at this thing.
And as you might have noticed, Chris, we also have made now the decision to take this theoretical capacity expansion
of 4 billion per month, which we have announced half a year ago that we have that option. We have decided to
essentially implement this plan. So we're already committing ourselves to this 100 billion year-end capacity next year
to essentially accelerating our plan.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And do you still expect iQOS to achieve breakeven profitability in 2017?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Absolutely.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And just I have one quick one if I could on the volume performance for the
underlying business. And it was obviously weaker than we thought, obviously weaker than you thought. And there is
obviously some adjustments from inventory and timing changes, and you gave some color around that. But going
forward, it expects a pretty significant improvement in the underlying volume performance of the business. I just want
to get a sense of, look across a lot of the markets, there are some pretty significant market share declines in some
markets. Do those start to narrow, or is it more about iQOS developing and contributing to your overall volume? I just
want to get a sense of that balance you expect for the rest of the year.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, there are some markets where we have posted in a quarter more sizable market share
losses. We have highlighted in my remarks the sequential development. So in both markets we see the improvements
Q1, Q4 of the sequential within a quarter, et cetera. I think we keep a strong grip on the conventional business in the
markets where we for whatever reasons under pressure.
Italy is a little bit more complicated because on the one hand, we're focusing on a combustible business while also
building the base for the iQOS. But there are some problems in Italy, which frankly speaking are beyond our power to
execute. As we know, the tax structure in Italy is not really supporting for narrowing the price gaps. Marlboro in a
conventional business on a conventional cigarette is above the €5 price point. So I guess there will be some pressure on
Marlboro in Italy in a conventional business continuing for the year.
But on the other hand, Germany still continues to be on a strong term. France, despite the fact that we have a first
quarter – I know it's a bit early – of the plain-pack implementation, but France posted very good results in a quarter.
And the rest is purely the comps. Remember that we're comparing the first quarter to the relatively weaker declines in
Q1 of the first quarter last year in Argentina, and then we had this massive tax increase. There were a number of other
geographies where we also faced a bit of challenging comps in Q1.
If I may ask, Chris, what came as worse than our expectations, frankly speaking, is Italy and Spain when we had to take
the inventory adjustment. I mean, we knew that comparing to the Q1 last year, we will have to adjust, but I think during
the TPD buildup of inventories and especially in Italy conversion of 10s or ban on the sales of 10s, we have anticipated
the higher conversion of 10s to 20s when it comes to the retail store replenishment. And I think this comes weaker than
we thought. Is it over or is it going to continue, we'll have to see.
But anyway, we don't expect any major at this point inventory adjustment for the year, so at least this headwind is
removed. And as I said, number of comps if you look both in the EU but in other regions, we should have it. It should
be more helpful or more supportive. And as I said, we still feel confident on the total volume outlook. Obviously, as

you know, we're focusing more on the combined volume. Otherwise, we'll have to start making a number of
assumptions with regards to the cannibalization, et cetera. But I think they are a good proxy that we can close the year
with the volume performance at par or maybe even slightly better than what we had for the full year last year.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay, that was very good color. Thanks for your time.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Just to follow up on Chris's question, so if we're still looking to break even in 2017, Jacek, given
the momentum that the business is seeing, on balance it would seem that you're still on track to generate incremental
profits from iQOS in 2018. But how are you thinking about the need for reinvestment spending given your first-mover
advantage and the traction that you're seeing from the product? And would you be able to offer any kind of order of
magnitude guidance around what that level of profitability might look like? Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, we have said it I guess earlier this year that we look, and reconfirmed this today. We're
looking at the revenue growth above 6%. And earlier, we have said that we're still looking at the margin, operating
profit margin expansion somewhere in the tune of 10 to 20 points. Clearly, we could have achieved better margin
expansion, but this does factored in increased investment, namely behind the iQOS. This is both on the OpEx and on
the operating costs, and as we announced today, also on the CapEx to prepare the capacity.
So I think we're well invested, frankly speaking, on above 5%, but on a combustible although there is some relocation –
or allocation of the resources from a combustible business to reduced risk products. But I think we feel pretty
comfortable with the investments which we plan to make this year, as I said, to support the revenue growth above 6%.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: That's helpful. And just in terms of the longer-term outlook for 2020, Jacek, you had pointed to a
higher profit number when you spoke at the CAGE [Consumer Analyst Group of Europe] conference. So can you just
offer a little bit of context on what the implied HeatStick volumes would be for that $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in
incremental profit? Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. Look, there are a number of times recently I've been confronted with this question, Vivien.
Yes, we gave that outlook I guess two years ago or so. And I have already admitted – maybe I shouldn't – I have
admitted I think at the CAGE conference a few weeks ago, both numbers seem to be wrong. Our 2020 was wrong, and
we're going to keep the target well ahead of that line. Definitely the volume number was wrong. You could see at the
pace which we're cruising today, we see the penetration in the markets in Japan, it goes well above the 3% to 5%,
which we have marked as the target for 2020.
So you have to give us the time to really put our brains around what really is the size of the opportunity today. Clearly
it's a much bigger opportunity than we had thought two years ago, but I would refrain from giving a new target at this
stage. We have also said to investors that in 2018, somewhere in 2018, we'll try to come up with a new growth
algorithm for PMI, and I guess this would be the best timing to put some milestones of what we want to achieve with
our big objective to go to the smoke-free future as PMI.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: That's helpful. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So first in Japan, so there have been some press reports about PM planning to take some pricing
on your combustible business. So can you confirm whether you filed for a price increase application in Japan in
combustibles?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Judy, you will appreciate, but I can't comment on our pricing, future pricing decisions, at least at
this stage. So we'll have to leave it as it is now.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: But when you think about your full-year guidance at this point, does it include any of the
potential price increase in Japan?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Judy, please, I can't comment on future pricing.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: That's fine. And then I guess staying in Japan, so obviously, you've seen some pretty strong
share gains even in Sendai as your competitors have launched in that market. So how do you look at that market, and
what are the lessons learned in looking at that market and applying a similar share performance to the broader Japanese
market or your ability to defend your share as your competitors begin to expand more nationally in Japan?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, if we just look at Sendai, and maybe the data is not fully reliable for us and for our
competitors there, but I think in Sendai in the quarter, the total heat-not-burn category must have crossed 20% market
share.
What I hear, what I know from our side and what I hear about our competitor, we're both operating with some sort of
capacity limitations. And I know that there are quite the waiting lines in Sendai and other places in Japan to buy iQOS
or competitors' device, which tells me that demand today is 20% and is growing and it has a large portion of unsatisfied
demand. People are not allowed to buy devices because devices are not available. I wouldn't be surprised if Sendai
category, the heat-not-burn category in Sendai, would cross the 30% share of total market by the year end, and maybe
even that number is wrong.
I think we clearly can see the work of multi-pack for people those who have successfully managed to quit smoking and
moved to the heat-not-burn category, sharing the benefits with their peers, with their colleagues, et cetera. There's a
classic word-of-mouth type of an effect. The category is gaining awareness both in terms of its existence and the
benefit that the category offers. So it's all augurs for a great future, but I think it's a big question now what is really the
– how long are the growth rates going to be there and what is the ultimate size of the thing. Is it 100% of the market? I
guess no.
But remember me saying on a number of occasions, this is not the most innovative industry if you look at the history of
this industry, the filter cigarette, the flip-top box, and that's about it. And it's a little bit about the capsules and a
slimmer format. It took a while to convert cigarettes, conventional cigarettes, from a non-filtered to filtered cigarette.
But it happened in less than about five years, ten years. It depends on the market. Maybe we are in front of such an
opportunity here. We'll have to see. It all goes into the right direction. Obviously, Japan is a little bit in a better
situation due to the marketing channels' availability compared to other markets, et cetera. But even if we start factoring
this in, you may just dispute on the timeline of the curve the difference of one or two years, but it seems that the
product might have – there are consumers, a sizable group of consumers, a very sizable group of consumers who are
waiting for that product.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay, got it. And then just lastly on the capacity-related question, so with a €300 million
investment that you've talked about for the Greece plan, that gives you 20 billion additional sticks from an iQOS
HeatSticks perspective. So that would be 50 billion plus 20 billion, 70 billion. So would there be incremental CapEx if
you are to get to 100 billion capacity by end of 2018? And should we take that into consideration just from a CapEx for
2018 perspective?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: There will be impact on the CapEx in 2018. We have not announced the number of the CapEx
for 2018, so we'll have to wait a bit. The only thing which we have – the Greek numbers we showed, the number for the
Greek factory conversion is included in my $1.6 billion for this year as CapEx impact on the cash flow. And then I
guess we will have other factory conversions or capacity expansion capacities which we'll be announcing as the year
unfolds in order to build up to that 100 billion. Because always is the question of the machinery and equipment, and it's
obviously the question where are we going to host; i.e., where are we going to locate that manufacturing capacity.
Especially we're thinking in the context of converting existing combustible assets.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: All right, okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. I have a couple of quick questions on iQOS. Could you give us an update from your test
for Platform 2? I believe you were testing that in the first quarter. And if so, could you again give us an update on that
how that performed and any plans to roll that out?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Bonnie, we must have some miscommunications. We haven't test Platform 2 in the first quarter.
We have said we're going to test it later this year.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: P3 and P4 as well in some cities or in some locations. But we have not done these tests yet.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, so it's on track then to be tested this year still?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Correct.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And then question on your tax benefits for iQOS. I guess I'd like to better understand
these tax benefits in the markets you're in. So on average, are you still seeing around a 20% benefit across all of these
markets? And then curious, what are the economics on iQOS in markets where there's no tax benefit? Could you still
generate profits on iQOS that would be comparable to your combustible cig business?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: First thing is iQOS is lower tax on the heat-not-burn category. It differs country by country, but it
would be better or higher benefit than the 20%. I guess Japan is about plus/minus 20% benefit. That's one. Second is, to
my knowledge frankly speaking, I don't recall a country in which we have commercialized at about 20%, speaking to
commercialize in which the heat-not-burn category is not classified with a lower tax burden.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I might be wrong, but I don't think so. We haven't any single country market today where we
wouldn't have – where heat-not-burn wouldn't have a lower tax classification.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: That's what I thought, Jacek. But what about a scenario where fast forward several years
where some of these governments might change the tax benefits, which we can argue why that shouldn't be the case,
but just let's think about a worst-case scenario. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the economics on iQOS if you had
no tax benefit. Help us understand that and how you think about that.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: iQOS HeatSticks are sold at the price of premium segment of the market.

<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Right.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: So even excluding the tax benefit, we are premiumizing our portfolio. We're operating with the
positive product mix category territory. Secondly, as we roll out and build up the capacity, we also are gradually
lowering the cost of manufacturing. So as we have said from the very beginning of our journey in this new category,
one should expect that one day the consumables; i.e., the HeatSticks, will be manufactured at a very close unit cost to
the conventional cigarette.
So I have a cost approaching the conventional cigarette, and I am operating at the margin level of the premium
segment. So it would be equal if I would have a rapid expansion of the Marlboro volumes across the geographies. So at
least from a mix perspective, I am better off. But this margin is clearly market by market better than my other profit
margins or unit margins on my entire portfolio.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Benefit on that.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, and then just last quick question. Certainly your conversion rates with iQOS and
HeatSticks have been very high, which is great. But I'm curious to hear about trial. How has that been building in some
of your iQOS markets in terms of just essentially recruiting new users to try this technology?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay, Japan is clear that the trial is frankly speaking limited because it's all the factor of how
many devices we allow the trade to sell. So trial is, the number doesn't exist in a sense. There are the line of people
waiting at least for the devices in many shops. The trial is these people are buying and getting the device.
In other markets, frankly speaking, the trial rates are about the same as we had mid-term in Japan. In a sense, when we
went from a 60% coverage to the national expansions, you remember we have lifted the trial rates and we have lifted
the conversion rate. And all of the markets or most of the markets where we are now with iQOS are enjoying about the
same statistics and the same leading KPI, if you like.
Remember that the product which we're selling either ourself or through our selected trade partners is only for adult
smokers. All right. So we don't have much interest, if at all, for the non-smokers. But by our own rules of conversion,
the product is only allowed to be sold to adults. It's obvious because it's a tobacco and nicotine containing product, but
also only to smokers. And that's also important for us that we don't create any unintended consequences, both when it
comes to people who successfully quit smoking or people who never smoked before.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right, okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Thank you. So I'm a little bit confused about your attitude towards market share in the
conventional business. When I look at the sequential market share, so I'm looking at the market share you quoted in Q1
versus what you quoted in Q4. Outside Europe, you've seen declines in pretty much every geography that you've listed
in the press release. And so my question – which looks worrying to me. But listening to the tone of your prepared
remarks, you implied that this is roughly in line with expectations and not a bit concerned. So am I wrong to read that
there has been a decline sequentially since 4Q outside Europe? And how concerned are you about the market share
trends in conventional?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Adam, I will very gladly help to un-confuse you.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Thank you.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: But we will have to go geography by geography and have a look at this trend. If I take the
significant market share erosions which we observed, one obvious comes, for example, Philippines, a very sizable
market, and we have total significant share losses and it obviously weighs on the total PMI volume and the share
performance. But we have highlighted very much that instead of protecting low-margin volumes in absence of the
proper law enforcement when it comes to compliance with regards to the tax stickers, we just have two years ago
changed the strategy and the focus on managing the Marlboro for the price, reduction of the price gap. And so far, the
strategy is very successful. Marlboro growth, significant market share despite the fact that there is some down-trading
in the market. And secondly, we're in double-digit bottom line OCI growth territory.
Then you have some markets where the trends, okay, Indonesia is, as we know, is the continuous shift between
hand-rolled to machine-made, et cetera. The recent launches which we have made in the machine-made segment,
including the Marlboro Black kretek, which a quarter in the market and not in full even distribution, has achieved a
very strong 1% market share. So that by Indonesian standards is very strong. And also U Bold initiatives, et cetera, I
think so far they all go well. Will we grow market share in Indonesia? That remains to be seen. [audio gap] (42:23)
reflect the market share. I feel positive about this one. That's the large markets with any share fluctuations and share
erosions matters for PMI.
Then you have markets which you have typical Q1 distortion, which are driven by the price increase patterns. You take
Mexico, you take Canada, and just it's the timing of the price increases may change year on year. You might have a
different purchasing pattern by the trade, and therefore you might have this fluctuation.
Now we are watching carefully the performance of the combustible business, and we're obviously, as always, watching
very carefully the market share performance. I have mentioned, Adam, performance in Italy, and I call it out that that's
going to stay for a while because there was a structural problem with the market. It's a pretty wide price gap, lack of
effective tax solutions at the bottom of the market. And I compound, temporarily I hope, with the elimination of the
packs of 10 cigarettes, which obviously Marlboro has some quite significant exposure in that part of the market.
Spain, okay, it's always when you cross the price point, you need to suffer for a couple of quarters until either the
market takes the next pricing or consumer is adjusted to it. On the other hand, I have a very high-priced Marlboro in
France and it continues to grow. So I hope, Adam, I have at least partially helped to un-confuse you.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: And just a special thank you because you have. And second of all, just to throw the
comments forward, you say that in the full year, you now expect between minus 3% and minus 4% volume declines on
a total basis. My guess is that's going to be – how can we put it? It's going to be somewhat weak in the second quarter
and gradually improve to that minus 3% to minus 4%, both I'm guessing as the conventional business gets less bad and
as the HeatSticks picks up. Is that how we should think about it sequentially?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We should have – well, maybe I turn it the revenue. I think as of Q2, we should expect much
more robust revenue growth, which is a combination of pricing, better volume mix, which frankly speaking we didn't
talk about the mix specifically in the quarter, but mix in Q1 came much better or much lower than the mix in the Q1
last year. So some of this comp is going to lump. And as I said, as of Q2, we should see a much stronger volume –
revenue growth on the way, as I said, to achieve above 6% for the full year net of currency revenue growth.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Can I ask a very quick follow-up, somewhat technical question? When you quote
HeatSticks market share in Europe, I'm thinking about in Italy and Switzerland, for example. Is this offtake market
share, or is this shipment market share?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, this will be offtake market share. It depends on the market which data we have available, but
we usually refer to what we call the in-market sales, so it's not us to the distributor but ex-distributor sales. It may not in
all markets be of the retail but to retail. Now it depends where we...
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: I understand. Thank you very much, very clear. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray (sic) [CLSA].
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Just a question on iQOS, it looks like your volumes from fourth quarter to first quarter grew
by around 20%, but your revenues by more like 26% or 27%. Can you just touch on what's driving that acceleration
and what's giving the mix lift? Is it faster growth now in countries with a bigger tax benefit, or is it more – is it driven
by more devices outside Japan? What's happening on the margin there?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: There could be some distortion from devices. But as we said for the full year 2016 when we were
announcing full-year results, roughly devices in the other piece – in our piece, related revenues should account for
about 20% to 22%, somewhere in this range. So we might have a bit higher shipments of the devices, but I wouldn't
look at this purely from the quarterly perspective because there are different sources of supplies, and of course anyway
we have to start shipping more devices in order to follow this up with higher shipments or in-market sales of the
HeatSticks, so you will always have some distortion there.
On the IMS basis, and I maybe go back to the very appropriate question Adam just asked before is, on an IMS basis,
you might recall the shipments of at least in Japan – sorry, on an IMS basis the sales in Japan of HeatSticks quarter on
quarter grew about 30%. And then what we see is about – just HeatSticks. If there were any distortions in the revenues,
it's presumably coming more from other locations and devices.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at Japan, even on an unadjusted for inventory
movement basis and more so when it's adjusted, taking that the cigarettes and the HeatSticks volume together at the
category level, it looks like there's actually positive growth, which is clearly better than historically it's been. Are you
seeing increased usage occasions, or what do you think is driving some of that better total momentum overall?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I want to say that Japan – I think Japan is somewhere squarely in line with the secular type of a
decline. So I think Japan is in this 3% to 4% type of decline all together, all the categories. And I don't think in the
longer term this should change, absent obviously any other changes to the market. But as we are today, this is what one
should expect as a baseline for Japan total configuration, somewhere in the range of 3% to 4%.
Now there is some – I think JT was taking some price increases on the C category. They're relatively lower total share
but I think there might be some elasticity kicking in. And always, on a quarterly basis, Japan numbers, one, have to
properly adjust from all the pipelining of the new product launches. It's always on a conventional business, but I think it
still continues. There might be some comps as well when JT was taking Mevius I think last year, pricing of Mevius up
last year. So there presumably were some distortions in the market. But as I said, nothing today would indicate that the
total category trend in Japan would be outside the 3% to 4% type of a bracket.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Okay, thank you, and then just one last follow-up on capacity. I know you've outlined a lot of
things about that. If you clarified this one part, forgive me if I missed it. But I know you had been saying you expected
to be off of capacity constraints at the end of Q1. That's now obviously been a few weeks. Are you still rationing
devices in Japan, or do you have the flood gates open? What is the right way to think about where you sit today?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We start shipping and we start slowly lifting the quotas for Japan as of Q2, but we will not be in
a position to significantly lift it before Q3.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The devices, because we are still catching up with the capacity of HeatSticks. But capacity of
HeatSticks every month on the January, February, March, we are increasing it. You could see this in our shipments, and
we're going to continue doing this for the whole year.
