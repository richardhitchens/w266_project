The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be
providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in
our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify
important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further
details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an
explicit public disclosure.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.
Charles H. Robbins
Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, it's only been seven weeks since we last spoke at our
Financial Analyst Day, and our overall outlook remains consistent with what we outlined at that time. In fiscal 2017,
we continued to execute well against our vision of delivering customers a highly secure, intelligent platform for their
digital business. We managed our business through a dynamic environment, and at the same time, delivered significant
innovation to further accelerate the next phase of our transformation.
In Q4, we generated revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61. For the full fiscal year,
revenue was $48 billion, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39. We drove strong margins and record
operating cash flow for the year. Our results demonstrate solid execution against our strategic priorities, accelerating
our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network, and delivering technology in the way our customers want
to consume it. In June, we announced a new era of networking with the launch of The Network. Intuitive. This is an
example of the industry-leading innovation Cisco's providing to its customers.
The Network. Intuitive. is a new intent-based network that creates a fully integrated, intuitive system that is designed to
anticipate actions, stop security threats in their tracks, and continue to evolve and learn over time. We are applying the
latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and define the network.
From a security standpoint, the new network enables our customers to detect threats in encrypted traffic with
unprecedented accuracy using Cisco's encrypted traffic analytics and intelligence from Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence
unit. We have created the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy, solving a previously
unsolvable problem.
Our new Catalyst 9000 switches represent the foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities and provide
highly differentiated advancements in security, programmability, performance, and lower operating costs by innovating
at the hardware and software layer. This offering is also a great example of how we are moving our core business to a
recurring revenue model.
Customer reception to this new innovation has been incredibly positive. As we've always said, transitions of this nature
are multiyear, but during the first four weeks in the market, our pipeline and product orders are strong, with over 200
customers having ordered the new Catalyst 9000, the heart of The Network. Intuitive. platform. Our software value
proposition in this portfolio is also compelling, as the large majority of our customers are adopting the most advanced
subscription offer available. Building on this early success, we intend to further accelerate our leadership in
intent-based networking through the combination of our expertise in network infrastructure, AppDynamics visibility
into applications, and Viptela's automation capabilities.
I believe that over the next several years, we will see continued increasing relevance of technology as customers add
billions of new connections to their enterprises. The network has never been more critical to business success, and we
are looking forward to helping our customers take advantage of the insights and intelligence that are only accessible
through our highly differentiated platforms.
In Q4, we also announced an extension of our strategic partnerships with Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. We plan to
deliver the first enterprise security application on Apple iOS, and we are integrating our comprehensive security

portfolio with IBM's Cognitive Security Operations Platform. Additionally, we are collaborating with Microsoft in two
important ways. First, we are implementing a software layer on our data center switches that gives Microsoft the
flexibility to run their own operating system on our industry-leading hardware platforms in their Azure infrastructure.
Second, we are collaborating together to enable businesses to build and host their IoT applications in Microsoft Azure
while extending the power of those applications to the edge via Cisco's leading fog computing solutions.
Now let's review other key parts of our business starting with Security. We believe we are well-positioned as the
number one enterprise security vendor. With growing cyberattacks and the need for our customers to protect their
business-critical data and applications, we are aggressively providing security everywhere: in the network, in the cloud,
and at the endpoint. We don't believe any other company can match our capabilities given the criticality of the network
in our customers' security architecture. Our best-of-breed products and integrated security architecture combining
analytics and automation are winning in the market.
Our Security Business delivered a solid quarter, with double-digit orders and 49% deferred revenue growth. This caps
off a year in which we delivered 9% revenue growth with more than $2 billion in revenue, making us the only company
growing at this scale. Our leadership position in network security continues to expand, driven by our next-generation
firewall portfolio with over 6,000 new customers added in the quarter, which is three times our nearest competitor,
bringing our total customer base to nearly 80,000.
Customers continue to rapidly adopt our advanced threat portfolio. We delivered revenue growth of 9%, and we added
over 7,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 42,000. Building on our differentiated
security innovations, we recently completed the acquisition of Observable Networks, which extends our Stealthwatch
solution into the cloud with highly scalable behavior analytics and comprehensive visibility. This platform expands our
cloud security capabilities by providing greater support and compliance for applications deployed in Amazon Web
Services, as well as Microsoft Azure environments.
Additionally, to combat the 90% increase in cyberattacks against IoT devices over the last year, we launched IoT
Threat Defense solution, an extensible, scalable security architecture created to defend devices in connected healthcare,
electric utilities, and manufacturing industries.
In the data center, we're helping our customers take full advantage of a multicloud world that has become the norm in
managing their applications and hybrid cloud solutions. Our goal is to deliver the best multicloud platform built on an
intelligent, intuitive network, enabling faster automated and highly secure delivery of applications in the cloud.
We believe Cisco is best positioned to do this, as everything we do in the data center is in support of both modern and
traditional applications, both on-premise and in the cloud. Cisco has led the industry over the past four years with ACI
combined with UCS, Tetration, CloudCenter, and our Security Solutions.
In Q4, we saw strong performance of our multicloud infrastructure portfolio combined with our cloud-based SaaS
offerings including WebEx and Meraki cloud networking. For example, ACI, our fastest-growing data center switching
platform, had a record quarter with growth of 38%. We continue to see strong customer adoption driven by our ability
to accelerate data center application deployments across private to public clouds.
HyperFlex, our hyperconverged offering combined with CloudCenter is gaining traction with customers, benefiting
from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategy. You will see us continue to strengthen our
partnerships with public cloud providers as they look to Cisco to help our joint customers manage workloads across
their private and public clouds.
Lastly, we are delivering the right consumption models to enable continuous value and innovation for our customers.
Our strong momentum continued in Q4, with 50% growth to $5 billion in deferred product revenue related to software
and subscriptions, which has doubled from two years ago. For the first time, over $1 billion or 11% of our product
revenue came from recurring offers, which grew 40% year-over-year. Overall, 31% of our total revenue was recurring,
and revenue from subscriptions now represents 51% of our software revenue. Going forward, you should expect to see
our software business benefit from the transition of our campus networking portfolio to a subscription model.

To summarize, our Q4 and full fiscal year results reflect a strong year of progress. We see tremendous opportunity in
intent-based capabilities across our portfolio, and we will continue to evolve our business to be the leading provider of
highly secure, software-defined, automated and intent-based infrastructure. Our innovation is as strong as ever, as we
focus on accelerating our core networking, security, software and cloud-based businesses. While it will take time, I
firmly believe our core business is better positioned for the long term as we realize the benefits from our
next-generation intent-based networking portfolio.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials.
Kelly A. Kramer
Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year followed by the Q1
outlook. This quarter played out generally as we expected, and as we indicated in our guidance in our last call, we
executed well, drove solid profitability, strong cash flow, and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities.
Total revenue was $12.1 billion, down 4%. We continued to focus on driving margins and profitability with strong
non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 3%, and operating cash flow was strong,
growing 5% to $4 billion.
For the full fiscal year, we had revenue of $48 billion, down 2% with product down 3% and services up 3%.
Non-GAAP operating margin was a record $15.2 billion expanding to 31.6% of revenue, up 0.6 points. Non-GAAP
EPS, also a record, was $2.39, up 1%, and we generated record operating cash flow of $13.9 billion, up 2%.
Let me provide some more details on our Q4 revenue breakdown. Total products revenue was down 5%. Switching
declined 9% driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by growth in the ACI portfolio, which was up 38%. We
saw good initial traction of our new intent-based networking portfolio of the Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Routing
was down 9% driven by weakness in enterprise access. We did see a spending pause related to our acquisition of
Viptela that we will integrate into our SD-WAN portfolio. Collaboration was down 3% due primarily to a decline in
Unified Communications endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in conferencing. Deferred revenue grew 4%.
Combined with the unbilled deferred, the two were up 16%.
Data Center declined 4% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we did see solid traction of our
hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. During the quarter, we launched our UCS M5 servers bringing greater simplicity
and performance for next-generation data-intensive workloads and applications.
Wireless grew 5% with strong Meraki performance, as well as the ramp of our 802.11ac Wave 2 portfolio. Security was
up 3% with strong performance in unified threat, web security and advanced threat, offset by declines in our legacy
firewall products. We did see very strong order growth during the quarter. Deferred revenue grew 49% as we continued
to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 1% driven by growth in software and
solutions services, partially offset by a decline in hardware maintenance. We drove good growth in deferred revenue,
which was up 12% in total, with product up 23% and services up 6%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring
software and subscription offers was up 50% to $5 billion.
We continued to transform our business to delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and
recurring revenues. In Q4, we generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of almost 4 points
from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions increased 18% and now represents over 50% of our software revenue.
In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were flat. Looking at our geographies, Americas was down 2%, EMEA
was up 3%, and APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICS plus Mexico also down 2%. In
our customer segments, Enterprise declined 1%, Commercial grew 4%, Public Sector was up 2%, and Service Provider
declined 7%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was $4.8 billion, up 3% compared to the end of fiscal year 2016.
From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 63.7%, down 0.9 points. Product gross margin
was 61.9%, down 2 points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 1.8 points. While our total gross margin was
solid, our product gross margin is continuing to be negatively impacted by memory pricing, which we expect to

continue in the near term. Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%.
For the full fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin was 64.3%, a decrease of 0.4 points, with product
gross margin down up 0.9 points, and service gross margin up 1.1 points. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded
to 31.6%, up 0.6 points by our focus on driving cost improvements, operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of the bottom line, our Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 3%, while GAAP EPS was $0.48. For the full
year, we had non-GAAP EPS of $2.39, up 1%, while GAAP EPS was $1.90. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash
equivalents and investments of $70.5 billion, with $3 billion available in the U.S. Q4 operating cash flow increased a
solid 5% to $4 billion, with free cash flow of $3.8 billion, up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned
$2.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our
quarterly dividend.
For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 2% to a record $13.9 billion with free cash flow of $12.9 billion, up
4%. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year through share buybacks and dividends, which
represented 71% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of
returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well and we're focused on driving operational efficiencies
and profitability to drive strong cash flow, enabling us to make the strategic investments to build long-term shareholder
value.
Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance includes the type of
forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 1% to minus 3%
year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP
operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is
expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61.
Consistent with how we talked about our business at our Financial Analyst Conference, in fiscal 2018, we will be
redefining and simplifying our product reporting categories to better align with our evolving business model. We will
continue to primarily run and operate our business by the three geographic segments, and so this change will only
impact how we report on our products. Starting in Q1 fiscal year 2018, we will realign our reporting into five distinct
categories: infrastructure platforms, applications, security, services, and other.
I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments.
Charles H. Robbins
Thanks, Kelly, and thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As we'd discussed many times in the past, we're
working on a multiyear transition. And while I'm confident with our progress, it's clear there's more for us to do. In Q4,
we made ongoing progress, generating 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers and growing 50% in deferred
product revenue related to software and subscriptions to $5 billion. I'm optimistic about our future, the direction we're
headed, and how we're transforming Cisco for the future. We are well-positioned to succeed in a cloud and
digital-ready world, where the network is one of the most strategic assets for our customers.
Looking forward to fiscal 2018, as I said earlier, you can expect us to do the following: execute against our strategy and
invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value; leverage the power of the network to
maximize our opportunities and differentiation in existing and new markets; drive relentless focus on innovation,
creating continuous customer value across every element of our portfolio; and drive the right consumption models for
our customers and accelerate our shift towards more software and subscription revenue.
Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions.

Thanks, Chuck. Mark, let's go and open the line for questions. And while Mark is...
Operator
Thank you.
Marilyn Mora
...doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question, so that we have plenty of
time for others in the audience to ask their questions today.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks. And I appreciate the color around the software and the recurring metrics, very helpful. I
guess just a couple for me, just sort of easy clarification. Kelly, you haven't mentioned the number of Cisco ONE
customers. I would love to get that. And then, a pseudo-question itself, Chuck, Switching has had a little bit of a
difficult year. I think three out of the four quarters was down quite substantially actually on a year-over-year basis. As
we look into 2018, how do you think about that business in that year? Is that another year of transition to where the
portfolio through, for example, your most recent announcements will go for potential pause and update and learning
curve, where that business could still be prone to declines? Or we should finally see some better results in that
category?
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Ittai, I'm shocked you asked a Switching question. Kelly...
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: I'll answer the easy one first.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: I've given up on the Data Center business.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Okay. Good. Well, I have an easy answer. On Cisco ONE, we have over 20,000 customers
now with Cisco ONE.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Perfect. That's great.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Okay. So, Ittai, let me touch on the Switching situation. First of all, the results we saw this
quarter were not a surprise to us. If you think about our guide last quarter, we anticipated this. And we also knew at the
time that we were going to be making the announcement in June about the new platform, and so we anticipated these
results.
Now, any time we do a major platform announcement, particularly in Switching, there is a period of time where our
customers pause, because they want to understand what this means. So we did see a pause and we actually anticipated
it, but we saw great traction with the new platform. As I said earlier, just in the four weeks where we closed the quarter,
we had 200 customers that embraced this new architecture and purchased the new Catalyst 9000 platform. And as I said
in the opening comments, the great majority of them also opted for the advanced software subscription that goes on top
of it, and we've had a lot of conversations over the last two years as to whether we could really drive a subscription
business on our core Switching platforms. And what we see is that at least early indications are that we can do that.

So, we talked about our Data Center business. The ACI portfolio, again, record quarter, growing 38%. And then if you
look at what we launched in the campus, typically what we see is these are three-year cycles to transition these
platforms, but this is also not a typical platform transition. This is not speeds and feeds only. We brought forward some
incredible innovation in this platform.
And if you think about not only the actual product itself, but the solutions that we announced around automation, which
really gets at the operating expenses that our customers are incurring to manage their infrastructure, you're looking at
one of the key drivers of why customers move to the cloud. It was because of the complexity and the cost of their
private infrastructure. So the ability to go drive significant cost out for our customers while managing this stuff over the
next few years, we think is a huge difference from a normal transition.
And the other is the fact that we launched Encrypted Traffic Analytics, which is our ability to determine when there's
malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it, and that's an innovation that only Cisco can actually deliver.
And both of those pieces of technology are what are included in that advanced subscription, which is what tells us that
the customers see tremendous value in that subscription.
So normally, we see three years. It's very early. And we would like to believe that we can accelerate that based on the
incremental innovation that's being delivered as part of the platform, Ittai, but let's see how it goes over the next quarter
or two.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Chuck. Mark, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets.
<Q - James Suva>: Hey. Thanks so much and the opportunity to ask a question. It's Jim Suva here from Citi. Last
quarter, I believe you gave a little bit of commentary of a bit of a pause in the federal government spending and also
Europe. It appears – is that still continuing yet? Has it taken a step up to improve or deteriorate a little bit? And how
should we think about that? And does Europe have any impact from Brexit? Thank you very much.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Hey, Jim. Thanks for the question. And since you asked, why don't I just quickly cover
sort of all the headwinds that we talked about in Q3. I'll give you a quick update on all of them, including the two that
you asked. First of all, we talked about Mexico last quarter, which is generally in the same state it was last quarter. We
didn't see any significant change, and again that's largely driven by Service Provider weakness due to regulatory
transitions as well as geopolitical dynamics, NAFTA renegotiation, et cetera. Emerging countries were slightly better
but there's still just tremendous uncertainty and disparity between performance in those countries, and Service Provider
is generally the same as it was last quarter.
The two that you asked about in particular, we did see some shifts. In U.S. Federal, I would say in Q3 we had a real
lack of clarity around budgets. In early May, we began to see obviously the clarity with a continuing resolution. And
the way that the dollars get released in Federal, we're in like the fourth phase based on how they prioritize releasing
those budget funds. So we saw some improvement, not where we'd like for it to be, but we saw some improvement
particularly late in the quarter, and obviously in Federal, we're going to be facing the same issue again in 90 days at the
end of September as we try to get another budget resolution passed. But you can see on a global public sector
perspective, you saw our orders last quarter were at minus 4%. This quarter, they were at plus 2%, and that was clearly
– a big part of that was the improvement we saw in the U.S. Federal business.
On the UK, if you go back to Q3, we talked about it being significantly down, and one of the primary drivers was the
headwind created by currency. In Q4, what I'll tell you is that headwind from currency remained. It did not ease up.
However, our teams did a really amazing job and we saw significant improvement in our Enterprise and Commercial
business in the UK. And if you look at the overall performance in EMEAR, you can see that the strengthening in the
UK for us actually helped achieve the result at the EMEAR level. I'll say one final thing in UK. While Enterprise and
Commercial were – we saw a good uptick, Service Provider remained about the same. All right?

Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
<Q - Pierre C. Ferragu>: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to get a sense for how you see like your
near-term trend in the business? If I look at your revenue guide for next quarter, so we are still slightly down
year-on-year, but sequentially, the kind of revenue change you're guiding for is actually probably better than the
average seasonality for Q1 of the last few years. So, am I right thinking the environment – you see the environment, the
business environment slightly improving sequentially after this quarter, this weaker quarter, you were anticipating? So
that's on the revenue front.
And then on the margin front, I think like from the top of my mind, you've probably been beating your gross margin
guidance range for like eight or nine quarters in a row or something like that. And your gross margin came in slightly
down sequentially. And so – and you're guiding for a slightly lower operating margin next quarter than what consensus
is anticipating. So, if you could give some perspective on what's happening at the gross margin level, it's relatively
small movement, but I'm sure you can give us some visibility on what were the drivers there? Thank you.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah. Pierre, let me give you a little color on the revenue question and sort of the business
conditions. And then I'll let Kelly talk about the Q1 guide as well as the margins. In general, I think if you just look at
our order rates that we released today, we went from negative 4% last quarter to flat in Q4 – I'm sorry, from Q3
negative 4% to flat in Q4. So clearly that we saw improvement there. I will tell you that across the customer segments,
just so you have some visibility, I think we showed the high-level numbers, I'll give you a little bit of a double click.
On the Enterprise side, we didn't see a lot of variability around the world in the performance there. Commercial, every
region around the world improved from Q3 to Q4. Public Sector, every region improved from Q3 to Q4. And SP, we
had weakness everywhere. So that's just sort of little color on the orders that we saw in Q4. Kelly, you want to talk a
little bit about the revenue guide and margins?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah. Sure. On the revenue guide, as you know, Pierre, we call it like we see it. And as
Chuck mentioned, the bookings being much better in Q4 than Q3 certainly helped a lot. And I'll just mention that we
are starting off with a strong backlog with our backlog being up 3%. And we have good momentum as we go in the
quarter. So we feel good about the revenue call for Q1. As I talk about margins, yeah, our margins for Q4 were in the
range, but we definitely saw in our product margins go down 2 points year-over-year. And it really comes down quite
simply to 3 points. The one and the biggest impact by far has been the increase of memory pricing and DRAM
specifically. For the overall business, that accounts for more than half of the 2 point decline.
The second point that's really impacting that is an overall productivity. Whenever you have large parts of portfolio or
my largest business unit down 9% like Switching, which is also a very profitable business, it impacts your ability to get
cost savings in that quarter. So that was the second biggest driver. And then we just had a third driver but to a much
lesser extent was a slight uptick in pricing erosion.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: All right. Next question, please.

Our next question is from Steven Milunovich with UBS Securities.
<Q - Steven Milunovich>: Great. Thank you. On the Security side, you said at the Analyst Day you expect low to
mid-teens growth. You did talk about strong orders today, but the revenue growth was much less. I think you cited
some legacy products holding things back. Do you have confidence that the reported revenue is going to get back into
the double digits consistently?

<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yes, Steve. So first off, I'll say on the Security, this is – I have zero concerns about the
business. This is a revenue timing issue. Our orders were – they were some of the strongest, we saw some of the
strongest order growth in the quarter as we've seen in the last two years. So, it's simply a revenue timing issue. It's
funny if you go back to Q4 2015, the first call I did, there was concern about our Security revenue at 4%, and at the
time our deferred software was growing 26%. And this time, we had 3% revenue but our deferred software was
growing 49%. So the strength in the business, I'm still comfortable with. Kelly, any comments on it?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: No. I think you said it well, and it's literally just timing. We expect an uptick come back there
in the next quarter.

Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: Yeah. Good afternoon. Yeah, hi, Chuck, Kelly.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Hi, Vijay.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: Yeah. Hi. Yeah. My question is on what feedback and commentary you're hearing from your
sales teams, your top customers, channel partners in this new model to purchase products like the Catalyst 9000 with
subscriptions being OpEx dollars? Hopefully you get the software security feature attached. And then the next part of
the question is, is demand for the subscriptions OpEx model primarily coming from your U.S. corporate customers or
are you also seeing...
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Hey, Vijay. Can you speak up a little bit? It's a bit hard to hear you.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: Okay. So I think – yeah, the question is what commentary you're hearing from your
customers and channel partners and your sales teams on purchasing the newer products such as the Catalyst 9000 with
software and security features using the subscriptions model, and is it...
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Vijay, speak up just a tad bit higher there. We...
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: I got the first part.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: Yeah. Can you guys hear me now?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Much better.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: That's much better. Much better.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: Yes. So yeah, I think the first part of the question is the commentary from your customers on
purchasing new products with subscriptions model. The second part of the question is, is the demand for the
subscriptions model primarily coming from U.S. customers? Or are you seeing overseas demand as well for
subscriptions-based purchasing? Thanks.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Okay. So I'll answer the first part, and I think Kelly – I have an instinctive answer on the
second part, but you probably have the mathematical answer. So what we're – first, well, I think that when you look
back at what we announced probably I think back with seven weeks ago, so it must have been eight weeks ago or nine
weeks ago when we announced The actual Network. Intuitive., it was probably one of the most significant launches
we've had in almost a decade.
And what I would tell you is, there's a lot of emotional momentum right now within the employee base, with our
customers, with our partners, with our sales organization about the innovation. And specifically, your question, I think
that what we always knew is that when we attempted to introduce a subscription model on a Switching product, we

knew that we had to bring innovation that had such a high return for our customers that they would not have a problem
buying it in that model, and that's what we've seen.
When you look at the automation platform that we're delivering to our customers and we're going to continue to
enhance over the next several years and you look at the security capability that, frankly, only Cisco with our
understanding of the network and with our threat intelligence that we get from Talos and with our ability to build
silicon that can actually make that happen, I think our customers are actually quite pleased with the innovation. And so
far, we've seen a high correlation with that to the advanced subscription. So, as far as the geographic issue, Kelly?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah. I mean, as far as the geographic, it's following very closely with our natural foot. We
definitely have more in the Americas, but we have a very healthy pipeline in Europe, as well as APJC, so it's getting
traction everywhere.

Our next question is from Timothy Long with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Timothy Patrick Long>: Thank you. Just wanted to check in on the web scale client base. How did that trend in
the quarter? And you could also address the – kind of the Switching and Routing competitive environment there? It
seems like white box is really not taking off, but some of your competitors are having good traction. So, if you could
just update us on progress with that large customer base, that's great. Thank you.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So when we were together seven weeks ago, the story here hasn't
changed significantly. As I've said in the past, we have re-engaged in a very big way. I will tell that you we've had
some wins. We actually had the press release that I talked about in my earlier comments with Microsoft about running
their OS on our cloud silicon switches, and we continue to make traction with these customers.
As I've said, we're looking at each of them very individually as to what it is they need, and we're also looking at
broad-based partnerships with them not only for their own infrastructure, but as they realize that the importance of
having this multicloud capability and the ability to run not only applications in a central public cloud but be able to run
portions of those applications out at the edge of the network, is leading to a very complementary partnership that we're
talking about with all of them. So I would say that not a lot has changed in the last seven weeks, but we still continue to
make solid progress. And I'm optimistic.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Okay. Thanks, Chuck. Let's go ahead and tee up the next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hey, guys. I have actually two questions, but it's about margin and cash. You touched on it a little bit,
but you knew about memory pricing when you entered the quarter. I think when you gave the guidance, still product
gross margin was weak. What was the delta? What was weaker than expected during the quarter that drove gross
margin down? And the second question is cash repatriation. If it doesn't happen, you already now have $70 billion in
cash, but only $3 billion in the U.S. So, do you consider plan B for bringing the cash to the U.S.? Or any other use for
the cash?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: All right. Hi, Tal. So on the memory, yeah. We've talked about memory for the last three
quarters, and then we started to see this as a headwind initially in Q2, and it's just gotten progressively worse. I think
it's very much public information that the prices continued to decline. And in this scarce supply environment, our
supply chain team has done a great job securing supply for us, but those prices continue to be at market – at prices as it
goes forward, so it's continuing to be a moving target. And again, as I will say to the guide, our gross margin ended up

in the range of our guide. So, those are just some of the variables as we go forward. As I look forward, I think we
expect the memory pressure to continue on in the near term and we're taking that into account as we give you guidance
going forward for Q1.
On the cash, yeah. We have $3 billion of cash domestically. We've been accessing commercial paper. We increased
that a little bit this past quarter, and we've been able to access and get access to capital to take out debt if we need to as
we go forward, because, again, we are continuing to ensure we have the flexibility we need, whether it's for strategic
M&A or to continue with, obviously, our dividend and share repurchase. So we don't see any issues with that going
forward, and we'll continue to be as efficient as possible as managing our cash and any debt we need to take out.

Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: Thanks. Just two clarifications from Kelly, and then a question. The clarifications being,
Kelly, you mentioned the tick-up in price erosion. Did that remain below 3%? And then on the other clarification. On
the Switching commentary, can you give us the Data Center switching growth all-in beyond just the ACI portfolio and
what the campus switching decline was? And the real question is, looking at the drag on growth from the shift to
subscriptions, what was [audio gap] (41:23)...
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Paul?

Okay. Our next question is from Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan Securities.
<Q - Rod Hall>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to, Kelly, maybe get you to comment on the
inventory movement. The inventory is up quite a bit this quarter. I'm assuming that might be forward purchasing in
memory, and then I assume that might protect your margins looking forward. But I wonder if you – could you confirm
that? And if it is the case that it's memory, how long are you protected? How long are you hedged?
And then also, Chuck, maybe going back to that carrier order volume. Could you just maybe dig into where you're
seeing weakness in orders in the network? Can you help us pinpoint that? Or is it more broad and related to product
slowdown? Just kind of generally from a part of the network point of view, where is that sluggishness materializing?
Thanks.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah. So, Rod, on the inventory, you're correct, a large majority of the inventory increase is
driven by memory advance purchases. So that protects us for a large portion, but we also have been – as I mentioned in
the last call, we've also been securing and committing to our purchase commitments for even more access to supply.
That also will ensure that we have the supply albeit perhaps at higher prices if they continue to rise. But the bulk of the
inventory going up, the $400 million is memory, and then there's also a little bit of just inventory built up as we
continue just to execute on our revenue in Q1.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: And hey, Rod, on the second part, thanks for asking about the Service Provider business. I
think the way I would characterize it is, it's less about different portions of the network, and it's really about the

disparity across large customers, as I've said in the last couple of calls. We literally had some very big customers that
were growing double digits and others that were on the opposite side of that. So, it really is more of a customer
variability issue than it is a single place in the network infrastructure that is causing a problem. And that's what we've
seen for several quarters, and again, some of it is based on regulatory issues and geopolitical dynamics. Others are
based on consolidation going on in a certain part of the industry. So that's kind of the color as to how I see it. Hopefully
that's helpful.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Okay. Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn, can you hear me?
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Yeah.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah. We can hear you now.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: It is a Cisco telephone just in the interest of full disclosure.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: We thought your question was going to be hard and you came back.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: No. Go ahead.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: I'm just kidding.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: So let me ask a question and then two clarifications. The question being, what was the drag
on growth from the shift to subscriptions this quarter? And can you talk about what your product segment growth
would look like on a normalized basis, i.e., adjusting for the shift in subscriptions? I'm aware that Wireless LAN and
collaboration have been the two places in Security where it's been first implemented. But can you talk to us about what
the growth will look like on a product line basis correcting for that?
And the clarification, Kelly, you mentioned a tick-up in price erosion.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: Was it still below 3%? And can you tell us what the decline in campus switching was? And
what was the all-in growth rate of Data Center? So not just ACI, but taking into account the 7000 and whatever other
products are in that. Thanks a lot.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah. Sure. So, on the shift, first, it's not much different than we told you. It's basically about
2%, between the 1.5% and 2%. And you hit the – obviously it's Security it impacts the most. Collaboration has always
been that way, and that just continues to grow. But if you restated it, Security be impacted, Wireless would be
impacted, and now with Cisco ONE really ramping up and it's added hundreds of millions of dollars onto the balance
sheet, that would have an impact as well. And that is the piece that will accelerate even more as we get more traction on
the Catalyst 9000 switches platform. So it's kind of across the board.
In terms of Data Center overall, so if I look at Switching, and Switching being down 9%, the bulk of it was campus
switching, and that was over double digits. So that was the biggest drag. Data Center, Switching all-in was basically
flattish to slightly up. But basically flattish.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: And price decline?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Oh, and price decline, yes, it is – you're talking about a year-over-year rate impact?

Operator
Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates.
<Q - Simon M. Leopold>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if we could maybe double-click
down on the Security business in light of the headlines we've heard in the security space over the last couple months in
terms of attacks. I think in the case of [ph] nuanced (47:09) highlighted employing Cisco. And I recall your discussions
in the past about the need for Security to be an architectural solution and not a point solution. So it sounds like the
market is moving towards the pitch you've made. And it's made sense for a long time. I'm just trying to see if you can
help us quantify the outlook for your Security business if you see an inflection point of the business moving more
towards a solution sale than point products versus what we've seen in the past. Thank you.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Thanks for the question, Simon. The short answer is yes. And what's happened is, if you
think about how our customers are building their IT infrastructure or their – how their IT assets are being deployed,
they're in a massively distributed mode. And they're trying to navigate and manage technology assets spanning from the
public cloud to connected vehicles, connected mining operations, all the way back to their private data center over to
SaaS applications. So the architecture of sort of hairpinning all that stuff back to a central point in the enterprise is not
going be sustainable.
Therefore, we see our customers transitioning to a new and fundamentally new architecture that's enabled by the
network. And that's why they're moving to the security architecture because, as I said, our teams have built this strategy
where you have to deploy security everywhere which is at the endpoint in the network in the cloud. And I think as it
relates to some of the attacks, I don't remember the number exactly last quarter or the quarter before relative to our –
the threat, new threat customers that we have, the AMP customers. But I believe the 7,600 this quarter was a pretty
significant increase over what we saw during a quarter over the last two quarters, and I think that's probably related to
not only the architectural buy-in that our customers have, but also the fact that that solution was pretty resilient during
the recent ransomware attacks.

Our next question is from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Securities International.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Kvaal>: Yes. Thank you very much. And I would like to delve into the Service Provider outlook a
little bit if we could. It sounds as though we understand that things aren't perfect around the world for you. My question
is, how much of where we are in Service Provider do you consider to be typical? And how much of this is structural? I
mean, do you think that we should see the Service Provider orders be in that 1% to 3% growth range that you've
highlighted for the overall business? Thank you.

<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Let me see if I can break this down into three sort of qualitative areas that I think we are
focused on that can actually improve the service provider performance over the next three to seven quarters over the
next two years. I think first is we have increased our presence, our relevance in the web scale cloud providers that
we've talked about. That's first and foremost. Second is there's innovation that we are working on that we talked a little
bit about at the Financial Analyst Conference that will be coming out probably a few quarters from now, that will give
us some transition opportunities in some of our platforms. And then finally, I think the other is there's – but I would
characterize it as a combination of sort of macro issues as well as technology transitions. I think you're going see
customers and we're beginning to have discussions with customers who are thinking about 5G.
And while we're not in a macro radio space, one of the key things that they are working on or thinking about is, as I add
a significant number of new devices at higher speeds and lower latency out at the edge of the network, what is that
going to mean for the performance I'm going to need in the core of the network. So I think as we see some of the
geopolitical dynamics hopefully settle down, but I wouldn't count on that right now, but the overall – I think the 5G
trend in that transition is the other one that could help us over the next couple of years.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question.
Operator
Our last question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to follow up on the gross margin question. A lot of
focus today on the call. How should investors anticipate potential margin volatility over the next one to two years
related to the transition to the highly attractive subscription model? And then, Kelly, can you weigh in on rev rec ASC
606? Like when could we see Cisco introduce some guidance around that as well? Thank you.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Sure. So on the gross margin, I think we need to – we will have an impact on the memory for
the next couple quarters coming up here for sure. I think the public information out there on what's happening with the
supply, there are people that think that maybe it eases up, but it's too hard to call. So I think that's going to be a
headwind for us. I think the other parts of gross margin are continuing to – we're executing and managing those well
like we always have on the cost savings side then managing price as well. So I think it's really the big question mark
and the big headwind is the memory.
On the rev rec change of ASC 606, we will be giving more color on that in our 10-K and kind of give you a feel of
what some of the implications will be. So we'll get more color in that and we'll try to quantify for you the impact from a
revenue and bottom line perspective. I will also just reference you back to – I did have a page in the Analyst
Conference deck laying out what of our offers would be impacted and what wouldn't be to kind of give you a feel along
those lines as well to help you think through it. But we'll give you progressively more details starting with our 10-K
coming up here in a few weeks.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Kelly, and thanks, Mark, for the questions. Chuck, why don't I turn it over to you to
wrap it up?
Charles H. Robbins
All right. Thanks, Marilyn, and thanks, everybody, for participating with us today. I think there are four key messages
that I would probably leave you with. First is that this launch that we announced back about eight weeks ago was the
first of what I believe you should expect from us in just an ongoing cycle of innovation, and very positively received by
the press, analysts, customers, partners, employees. And I said, when I took this job, we're going to increase the pace of
innovation, and this is the first wave of what you're going to see coming from us. And when you look at the innovation
that was introduced, particularly around the automation, around the new platform and the innovation we drove in the
security capabilities, that's what you're going to see from us going forward.

Secondly, I think with our customers and the environments in which they are operating now, the network's never been
more relevant. I talked about how they're building out their infrastructure in very distributed ways. They're managing
hundreds of thousands of devices today, and they have to be ready to manage a million or more by 2020, and I think
that is why this automation and analytics capability and the security built into the network is so important.
The third is that we continue to have our customers looking for us to help them really build out this secure, intelligent
platform that spans across this multicloud environment for their digital business, and I think that our security results on
the number of new customers embracing the technology, I think, is indicative of how they're buying into this new
architecture.
And then fourth, I would say that the strategy we laid out, we are executing very well against. We're managing the
business through this transition. When you look at the year that we just completed, having record EPS, record cash
flow, at the same time that we, this past quarter, increased the software and subscription deferred business, 50% to $5
billion. And so, I'm very pleased with where our teams are, what our teams are doing, how we're executing and how
we've increased the innovation and the response from our customers.
So we look forward to talking to you all again next quarter, and thanks for joining us today.
Marilyn Mora
Thanks, Chuck. I'm going go ahead and provide some last closing remarks here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings
conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2018 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at
1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD,
Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public
disclosure.
We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations
team at Cisco, and we thank you very much for joining today's call.
