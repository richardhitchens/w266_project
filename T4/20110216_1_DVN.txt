MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At
this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir,
you may begin.
Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Devon's Year End 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast.
Today we will follow our standard format. I will begin with a few preliminary items and then I'll turn the call over to
our President and CEO, John Richels. John's going to provide the highlights of 2010 and his thoughts on the year
ahead. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production, will cover
the operating highlights as well as our 2011 capital program. And then finally, Jeff Agosta, our CFO, will finish up
with a review of the year's financial results and our guidance for 2011.
At that point, we'll open the call to your questions. I'd like to point out that we have our Executive Chairman, Larry
Nichols, and other members of the senior management team with us today for the Q&A session. As usual, we'll
conclude the call in about an hour. And if we don't get to your question during the day or during the call, the IR staff
will be around the rest of the day to take any follow up.
As always, we ask each participant to limit his or her question to one initial inquiry and one follow up and we'll attempt
to enforce that. A replay of this call will be available later today through a link on our home page. That's
devonenergy.com. After the call today, we will file a Form 8-K. That will provide our full-year detailed forecast for
operating items as well as our capital plans for 2011. And the Guidance section of the Devon website will contain a

copy of the 8-K along with any other forward-looking estimates that we mention on the call. To access that
information, you just click on the guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the Devon website.
Before we get to the business of the call, we are obligated to remind you that the discussions today of our expectations,
plans, forecasts, and estimates are all considered forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. And while we
always strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could cause our actual results to
differ from these estimates. For a discussion of those risk factors, see the Form 8-K that we are filing today.
One other note, we refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use these measures,
U.S. Securities law requires us to provide certain additional disclosures. Those disclosures are available for your review
on our website as well.
Before we jump into the call, I have a couple of things to remind everybody of. First, our strategic repositioning that
took us out of the Gulf of Mexico and international businesses triggered accounting rules for discontinued operations.
However, the accounting standards for discontinued ops do not apply to our Gulf of Mexico divestitures, so that creates
a confusing situation.
While we have excluded the international production volumes for all periods presented and collapsed the revenues and
expenses associated with the international operations into the discontinued ops line item on the income statement, the
results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations are included in our continuing operations for the portion of 2010
up to the point of sale of those assets. For that reason, we're providing supplemental information in our press release
today that isolates our results from go forward North American Onshore operations.
Similar to the last several quarters, the accounting treatment for discontinued ops affected the comparability of earnings
estimates from the Street during the fourth quarter. However, now by this time most analysts are reporting fourth
quarter estimates for continuing operations only. The First Call mean of those analysts that forecasted continuing ops
was $1.41 a share – no, $1.40 a share, and our actual results of non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share exceeded those
expectations by $0.06.
With those items out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2010 we undertook the strategic repositioning of Devon
by selling our international and Gulf of Mexico properties to focus solely on North America. The process has gone
extremely well, and today we're reporting some very good results which reflect our continued commitment to capital
discipline and cost management, and as you know, ultimately we're focused on maximizing our per share returns.
We're emerging from the repositioning in a very enviable situation. The depth and breadth of Devon's North American
property portfolio provides many years of visible economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas.
Our asset base underpins our confidence that we can deliver strong growth in oil and liquids over the next several years
from opportunities that we have already captured within our asset portfolio. Furthermore, we have one of the strongest
balance sheets in the industry, and we're in a position to supplement our top line growth and enhance our per share
returns with our stock buyback program.
Looking now to some of the specific highlights of 2010, we entered into sale contracts for our Gulf of Mexico and
international assets with proceeds expected to top $10 billion, far exceeding initial expectations. Essentially, all of these
transactions have closed with the exception of Brazil. In the midst of the repositioning, we generated outstanding
results from our go forward North American business. North American onshore oil and gas production grew to 619,000
barrels equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. That's up 8% from the year ago quarter when we announced the
repositioning.
The repositioning also drove cost savings across several expense categories in 2010. This included general and
administrative expenses, which declined 13%. Reported net earnings for 2010 were $4.6 billion, or $10.31 per diluted

share, and that's the highest reported earnings per share in Devon's history. Cash flow before balance sheet changes
climbed 21% over the prior year to $5.7 billion. And when you combine that with almost $7 billion in divestiture
proceeds received to date, Devon's total cash inflows approached $13 billion in 2010. With that cash flow, we funded
our E&P and midstream capital budgets including $1.2 billion of acreage capture focused on oil and liquids-rich plays.
We retired $1.8 billion of debt, ending the year with a near bulletproof balance sheet, and with net debt to adjusted
capitalization ratio up 10% including cash on hand of $3.4 billion.
And in addition to our capital program and debt reduction, we also returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders
through our stock buyback program and dividend payments. In 2010, we repurchased over 18 million shares. We
continued to be active in the market subsequent to year-end, and through last week we had repurchased a total of 23.5
million shares or just over 5% of our outstanding shares. With an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion, this gives us an average
cost to date of $69.60 per share.
Finally, we had another strong year of company-wide reserve growth. We added 464 million barrels, boosting year-end
proved reserves to an all-time record of 2.9 billion barrels. This means that our North American reserve additions more
than replaced all of the year's production and the roughly 200 million barrels of proved reserves associated with our
divestitures. We ended 2010 with record proved reserves in spite of selling properties worth more than 20% of our
enterprise value during the year.
Looking more closely at the 2010 reserve activities, our drill bit reserve additions, so that includes discoveries,
extensions and performance revisions, for our go forward North American Onshore business totaled 389 million BOE.
These additions were 175% of our 2010 North American Onshore production. When we announced the $500 million
Pike joint venture with BP, you'll remember that's our joint venture in the heavy oil – in the oil sands in Canada – we
said that our 2010 drill bit F&D would likely come in between $14 and $16 per barrel.
Following that announcement, we stepped up our acreage capture and spent another $700 million on acreage in the
Permian basin and in our Cana play and on other undisclosed new plays, bringing our total acreage capture for the year
up to $1.2 billion. This resulted in total drill bit capital of $6.1 billion including capitalized G&A and interest, and in
spite of the additional acreage capture, our organic North American Onshore finding and development costs came in, in
line with the original estimate at $15.74 per BOE. This positive result is because our drill bit reserve additions far
exceeded our original estimates.
It's worth noting that we achieved our 2010 F&D results without increasing our percentage of proved undeveloped
reserves. In fact, at December 31st, our North American Onshore undeveloped reserves accounted for just 29% of total
proved. It's important to remember that one-year F&D costs can be somewhat arbitrary. I'll remind you that when we
reported our 2009 results, we told you that the $6.59 per barrel F&D cost for 2009 was unrealistically low. If you
combine our 2009 and 2010 results for the go forward business, you arrive at an average F&D for the two years of a
little over $10.60 per barrel. That's a very competitive result even with the unusually large acreage acquisitions in 2010.
Price revisions for our North American Onshore properties gave us a net positive boost in 2010 adding another 71
million barrels. Positive gas price related revisions, principally from the Barnett shale, more than offset negative price
revisions related to higher oil prices and the sliding scale royalty impact on our thermal oil sands in Canada. This
underscores the value of a balanced portfolio of properties. Taking into account the net price revisions, our total North
American Onshore reserve additions from all sources were 464 million BOEs, more than double our North American
production. That boosted Devon's North American Onshore reserves to 2.9 billion equivalent barrels, representing 9%
growth over year-end 2009. And that's important because this reserve growth really supports our future production
growth.
Looking to 2011, we're forecasting our North American onshore production to total between 236 and 240 million
equivalent barrels. This implies a growth of 6% to 8% over our 2010 production of 223 million equivalent barrels. The
preliminary forecast that we provided last November called for a 20% increase in oil and liquids production for 2011.
However, updated liquids yield data from some of our emerging plays has resulted in a slight shift in the gas to liquids
ratio. We now expect our 2011 production growth to be driven by oil and liquids growth in the high teens.

Before I turn the call over to Dave, I'd like you update you on the status of the $3.2 billion sale of our assets in Brazil to
BP. While we had expected this transaction to close in 2010, we have not yet received approval from the government of
Brazil. However, we see nothing that would lead us to believe that this transaction will not ultimately be approved.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights and our 2011
capital budget. Dave?
David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Our growth in reserves and production reflect the outstanding results achieved
with our 2010 capital program. We drilled 1,584 wells onshore in North America, including 1,493 development wells
and 91 exploration wells. Almost all of the wells were successful. We exited the year with 71 Devon-operated rigs
running, and today at the height of our winter drilling program in Canada, we have 90 rigs running.
Let's look now at some of our areas, area by area – look at some of the area by area highlights. At our Jackfish thermal
oil project in eastern Alberta, our fourth quarter daily production averaged 22,200 barrels per day net of royalties. The
Jackfish volumes that were curtailed in early December as a result of outages on the Enbridge pipeline system have
been restored and production at Jackfish is currently running about 30,000 barrels per day net of royalties, the level we
expect to average in the first quarter.
More than three years into production, Jackfish continues to be one of the best performing SAGD projects in the
industry as measured by both production per well and by steam oil ratio. Construction of Jackfish 2 is now complete
with total capital expenditures through startup projected to come in at just under $1 billion. Plant commissioning
activities are underway, and we expect to begin injecting steam in the second quarter of this year. We expect to deliver
first oil late this year with production ramping up throughout 2012.
Review of our regulatory application for Jackfish 3 is currently underway. Pending approval, we could begin site work
around year-end with plant startup targeted for 2015. Detailed engineering work continues, and we have all major
equipment orders in place. Devon operates all the Jackfish projects and owns 100% working interest. With the initial
phase of Jackfish running near capacity and no major turnarounds scheduled in 2011, we expect our thermal oil
production to grow nearly 3 million barrels over the 2010 level to about 12 million barrels in 2011.
At Pike, our SAGD oil sands joint venture with BP, we began appraisal drilling in the fourth quarter and plan to drill
about 150 stratigraphic core wells this winter. We also are acquiring some 60 miles of 3D seismic data. This drilling
and seismic information will help us determine the optimum development configuration for the initial phase of
development. We hope to begin the regulatory process for the first phase of Pike around the end of the year.
In aggregate, we plan to spend approximately $600 million on our thermal oil sands projects in 2011 as we continue
toward the goal of growing our net SAGD oil production to between 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by 2020. This
represents roughly a 20% compound annual growth rate in SAGD production through the end of the decade.
At year-end, we had 440 million barrels of reserves booked in our thermal oil sands. As we move through the
development of Jackfish and Pike projects, we expect to book roughly 1 billion additional barrels of net resource.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 57 new wells in the fourth quarter, which brought our full-year total
to 191 wells. In 2011, we plan to spend about $100 million drilling approximately 170 wells in the Lloydminster area,
allowing us to hold production steady at roughly 40,000 barrels equivalent per day.
Also in Canada, in 2011 we plan to spend about $150 million testing more than a half dozen different oil and
liquids-rich gas plays that we have identified across our vast land base. This includes fractured oil shales, tight oil
carbonates, and tight oil clastics in the Deep Basin. Specifically, we plan to drill 13 wells this year, testing the Viking
light oil play on our 900,000 acres of fee title lands in the Kindersley area of Saskatchewan. In the Deep Basin of
Alberta, where we have nearly 600,000 net acres, we will drill several wells targeting the Cardium light oil play and the
liquids-rich lower cretaceous zones including the Cadomin formation. These are just a few of the areas we'll be testing

in 2011 to better understand the potential for commercial success in these new plays across our vast Canadian acreage
position. We will keep you updated as we move forward.
Shifting to the Rocky Mountains, we are currently testing the oil potential on our 220,000 net acre position in the
Powder River Basin. We are in the early stages of evaluating several cretaceous oil objectives, including the Parkman
and Niobrara. In 2011 we plan to spend about $50 million and drill 15 wells testing these play concepts.
Moving to the Permian Basin, our net production averaged 45,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the fourth quarter,
up 16% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter oil NGL production in the Permian was up 23% over 2009
and accounted for 73% of our total Permian volumes. We continue to be very active in the Basin with 17 operated rigs
running. In 2011, we expect to spend $650 million and drill about 300 wells in the Permian. Growth from our Permian
assets is expected to contribute approximately 3 million barrels of liquids growth over 2010 levels to 14 million barrels
in 2011.
In our Wolfberry light oil play, we currently have six operated rigs running. Since drilling our first Wolfberry well in
late 2008, we have drilled more than 140 wells, allowing us to de-risk large portions of our 197,000 prospective net
acres. Our drilling results to date support EURs of between 100 and 150,000 barrels of oil per well across roughly
160,000 net acres. On our 37,000 net acres located in the northern part of the play, we have had marginal success.
However, this acreage has potential in some additional zones. In 2011, we plan to spend $250 million in the Wolfberry
and drill approximately 125 wells from our inventory of more than 1,000 risked locations.
Also in the Permian Basin, in the Avalon Shale play, we are currently running four rigs. Devon has assembled over
200,000 prospective net acres in this condensate and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early stages of
evaluation and drilling results have varied depending on location within the broader play area, we are beginning to see
some trends. In the fourth quarter, we drilled three Devon operated wells in the central portion of the play. One of these
wells was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of 360 barrels of condensate per day and 1.7 million cubic feet
of gas per day. In 2011, we plan to spend $160 million in the Avalon and drill about 75 wells as we continue to
delineate the play on our acreage position.
Elsewhere in the Permian, we continue to see solid results from the Bone Springs oil play where Devon has 170,000 net
acres. In the fourth quarter, we brought four Bone Spring wells online with an average 30-day IP rate of more than 400
barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have three rigs running in the play and plan to spend $85 million to drill
approximately 45 Bone Springs wells in 2011. Our four remaining operated rigs in the Permian are targeting
conventional formations. This includes objectives such as the Delaware, Wolfcamp, Clear Fork, and Wichita Albany
that we are accessing primarily with horizontal wells. In the fourth quarter, we drilled some very strong conventional
wells, including a Delaware horizontal well on our Cotton Draw unit that came online with a 30 day IP rate of 700
barrels of oil per day. In 2011, we plan to spend a little over $100 million and drill 50 wells in these conventional
targets.
Moving north to the Texas panhandle where Devon has assembled approximately 62,000 net acres in the Granite Wash
play, we stepped up drilling activity during the quarter with the addition of a fourth rig that was relocated from the
Barnett. In the fourth quarter, we brought five Devon operated wells online with average IP rates of 2,730 oil
equivalent barrels per day, including 580 barrels of oil and 870 barrels of NGLs. Production history from our Cherokee
Granite Wash wells continue to support EURs of about a million barrels equivalent. At roughly $7 million to drill and
complete, these wells generate outstanding full cycle rates of return.
In 2011, we plan to spend 175 million and drill 55 wells with an average working interest of about 50%. Our activity in
the Granite Wash is expected to contribute approximately 1 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year liquids
growth.
Moving to the Cana-Woodford shale in Western Oklahoma, we continued to add to our acreage position during the
fourth quarter and now have approximately 243,000 net acres. Devon is currently operating 23 out of the 39 rigs
running play-wide. In the fourth quarter, we continued – we continued to aggressively de-risk our position and secure
the term acreage we acquired last year. We continue to see outstanding results from Cana. In the fourth quarter, we

brought 21 operated wells online with average five-day IP rates of 4.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including
an average of 66 barrels of condensate and 174 barrels of NGLs. Fourth quarter net production from Cana averaged a
record 137 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day with over 20% of this production stream coming from
condensate and NGLs. This is a 17% increase on a sequential quarter basis.
I also want to briefly update you on the status of our Cana in-fill pilot program we initiated last year in the core area.
Production history from our 500-foot spaced wells continue to perform well, supporting an 8 Bcf type curve. These
results support that we have eight to ten wells per section, and that's the likely spacing in the core area. However, to
date, we have only booked five wells per section in the core area. From a reserves performance perspective, Cana was a
leading growth area for the company in 2010. Extensions, discoveries, and performance revisions at Cana accounted
for 105 million BOE of additions.
Related drill bit capital was 729 million, including roughly 200 million of additional acreage capture. At year-end, we
had 175 million equivalent barrels booked at Cana-Woodford. With some 11 Tcf equivalent of risked resource potential
and more than 5,000 risked locations remaining, we expect many years of highly economic production and reserve
growth from Cana. In December of 2010, we began processing gas in our new Cana liquids extraction plant. The
facility has an initial processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day and is capable of extracting up to 15,000
barrels of liquids per day. The plant is expandable to 600 million per day inlet capacity as we grow Cana volumes. This
facility allows us to capture additional value from the liquids-rich Cana gas stream.
In 2011, we plan to invest over $800 million of capital and drill more than 200 wells. By year-end, we expect our net
production from Cana to reach 250 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 14,000 barrels per day of
condensate and NGLs. This will contribute approximately 2.5 million barrels to our company-wide year-over-year
liquids growth.
Shifting to the Barnett shale field in North Texas. In the fourth quarter our net production held steady at a record 1.2
Bcf equivalent per day, including over 42,000 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day. We continue to achieve
outstanding results in the Barnett with pad drilling and improved drilling efficiency. In 2010, we were able to offset
rising service costs by further reducing the number of days it takes to drill a well. In 2010, we averaged just 13.3 days
from spud to rig release, down from 14.4 days in 2009.
In the fourth quarter, we completed a 21-well drilling program from a single pad in which we averaged just 10.6 days
from spud to spud. From a reserve performance perspective, extensions, discoveries, and performance revisions in the
Barnett shale accounted for 112 million barrels of additions, including 26 million barrels of positive performance
revisions. This marks the seventh consecutive year of upward performance revisions in the Barnett that in aggregate
total over 230 million barrels.
Drill bit additions more than replaced our Barnett production of 70 million equivalent barrels for the year. Related drill
bit capital was $1.1 billion. At year-end, we had 1.1 billion barrels equivalent booked in the Barnett with thousands of
remaining un-booked locations.
In 2011, we plan to invest about $900 million of capital in the Barnett, running a 12-rig program. This will result in us
drilling 300 operated Barnett wells and participating in about 25 non-operated wells. The 2011 program is focused on
the liquid rich areas of the play. This level of activity will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and maintain
current production levels. Our expected year-over-year production growth in the Barnett should add approximately 2.5
million barrels to our company-wide, year-over-year liquids growth.
When you step back and look at the overall results of our 2011 – or excuse me, 2010 capital program, you see that from
both the perspectives of both reserve additions and production trajectory, the results were very good. What it is not
reflected in these numbers is the tremendous resource capture beyond proved reserves that we accomplished over the
last year. Last August we told you that we had acquired 260,000 net acres in new plays that we were not ready to
discuss. Our goal was to identify and establish large first-mover positions in highly economic plays that had not yet
become competitive.

Since that time, we have continued building these positions and now have roughly three quarters of a million acres in a
handful of new plays. In 2011, we have allocated roughly $200 million of capital to continue building these positions,
acquire seismic and test several of these new play concepts. While it is unlikely that all of these plays will be
successful, we are excited about the potential and expect to have positive news later this year.
In total, we expect our full-year 2011 E&P capital expenditures to be between $4.5 and $4.9 billion for our North
American Onshore business. As John mentioned, with that level of spending, we expect overall production growth of
6% to 8%, led by high-teens growth in oil and NGL volumes. When you add roughly $1 billion for – $1 billion for
capitalized G&A and interest, mid-stream and other corporate capital, our total 2011 capital demands are expected to
fall between $5.4 to $6 billion.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?
Jeffery A. Agosta, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today we will begin by looking at some of the key drivers that impacted
our 2010 financial results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2011.
As Vince mentioned earlier, we have re-classified the assets, liabilities, and results of operations from our international
assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. Our fourth quarter results from continuing
operations represent just our North American Onshore business, or in other words, the results of the repositioned
Devon. However, it is important to note that our reported full-year results from continuing operations do include a
partial year of results from our now-divested Gulf assets.
Let's begin with production. For 2010, Devon's reported production totaled 228 million oil equivalent barrels. This
includes approximately 5 million barrels of production from our now divested Gulf of Mexico properties. Excluding
the Gulf production, you will find that our North American onshore assets produced 223 million barrels during the
year. This result represents a 3 million barrel increase over 2009 which was driven entirely by higher oil and NGL
production.
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter of 2010, Devon produced 56.9 million equivalent barrels or approximately
619,000 barrels per day. This is about 6,000 barrels per day shy of our guidance range due to a number of minor
operational issues which reduced our fourth quarter production by approximately 11,000 barrels per day. These
included volume curtailments attributable to the Enbridge pipeline outage, other third party facility outages and delays
in well completions.
In spite of these curtailments, when compared to last year's fourth quarter, production from our North American
onshore assets exhibited strong year-over-year growth of 46,000 barrels per day or 8%. Increased oil production from
our Permian Basin properties and growth from our liquids-rich Barnett and Cana shale plays drove this result.
Our 2011 budget calls for the first – for first quarter production of 630,000 barrels equivalent per day, up slightly from
the fourth quarter. However, continued curtailments due to third party facility outages and unusually severe winter
weather in Texas and the mid-continent region have negatively impacted first quarter production by about 1 million
barrels or approximately 10,000 barrels per day. That production has now been restored, and we are currently
producing approximately 630,000 barrels per day. Assuming no additional surprises, positive or negative, we would
now expect first quarter reported production to average 615,000 to 625,000 barrels per day.
Looking beyond the first quarter, we expect production to increase in each of the remaining quarters of 2011. The plan
calls for the biggest jump in the second quarter, up to 645,000 to 655,000 barrels per day as we tie in a large well pad in
a liquids-rich area of the Barnett, and we begin to see the impact of the increased activity levels in Cana and the
Permian Basin.
Moving to price realizations, it was another strong quarter for oil. The WTI benchmark price rose steadily throughout
the fourth quarter and averaged $85.15 per barrel. Our company-wide realized price came in at $68.35 in the fourth

quarter, or 80% of WTI, right at the midpoint of our guidance. The escalating oil price environment boosted our fourth
quarter realized price by almost 10% over the previous quarter, and our full-year realized oil price by 27%.
On the natural gas side, the Henry Hub index averaged $3.80 per Mcf for the fourth quarter. Our realized gas price
before the impact of hedges came in at 87% of Henry Hub or $3.32. We had fourth quarter hedges totaling 1.6 Bcf per
day, or nearly two-thirds of our natural gas production with a weighted average protected price of $5.87. Cash
settlements from our hedging position increased our average realized price by $1.32 to an all-in realized price of $4.64
per Mcf.
For natural gas liquids, in the fourth quarter, our realized NGL price improved to $34.65 per barrel, or just over 40% of
the WTI index. An increase in seasonal demand combined with higher overall prices led to a 19% increase in realized
prices over the third quarter of 2010. For the full year of 2011, we expect Devon's realized NGL price to range between
35% and 40% of the WTI benchmark price. We expect continued supply growth from the industry to keep downward
pressure on NGL pricing in 2011.
Taking a brief look at our hedging positions, for the first quarter of 2011, we now have approximately 784 million
cubic feet per day swapped at a weighted average price of $5.43. For the full year, we have an average of 730 million
cubic feet per day swapped at an average price of $5.49. In aggregate, this hedging position represents roughly 30% of
our expected natural gas production for the year.
To facilitate a portion of this hedge position, we sold call options on 19,500 barrels of oil per day for 2011 and 2012 at
$95 per barrel and call options on 588 million cubic feet per day of gas for 2012 at $6 per Mcf. Additionally, we now
have collars in place covering 45,000 barrels of oil per day with a weighted averaged floor of $75 and an averaged
ceiling of $109. We will be posting a hedging schedule on our website after the call that will provide some more detail
on these hedge positions.
Turning now to our Marketing and Midstream division, our Marketing and Midstream operations once again produced
another high quality quarter generating $127 million of operating profit, bringing our full-year operating profit to 510
million. Increased gas throughput and strong cost control drove our solid performance. Looking ahead to 2011, we
expect our full-year operating profit for our Midstream division to be between $485 and $535 million.
Turning to expenses. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expenses were right in line with our expectations at $418
million or $7.36 per barrel produced. In spite of higher Canadian dollar exchange rates and upward pressure on oil field
services and supplies, our LOE per BOE remained flat when compared to the third quarter. Looking forward to 2011,
we expect industry inflation to continue. As a result, we are forecasting a moderate increase in LOE to a range of $7.50
to $7.90 per BOE.
For 2010, Devon's full-year DD&A expense for oil and gas properties also came in at $7.36 per BOE, a 6% decline
from last year. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets. We anticipate that our DD&A rate
will increase to a range of $7.40 to $8 per barrel in 2011.
Moving to G&A expense, the company did a very good job of controlling G&A costs during 2010. As John said, for
the full year our reported G&A expenses totaled $563 million. That is a decrease of $85 million or 13% versus 2009.
This significant reduction in G&A is entirely attributable to the operational efficiencies achieved through our strategic
repositioning. We expect our 2011 G&A expense per BOE to remain roughly flat with 2010.
Turning to interest expense, for 2010 it totaled $363 million, right in line with our expectations and up slightly from
2009. However, it's important to note that our 2010 interest expense included a one-time $19 million charge related to
the early retirement of senior notes that we repaid in June. Excluding this charge, interest expense actually declined by
$5 million as compared to 2009. As we look forward to 2011, we expect our interest expense to decline to a range of
$300 to $340 million.
The final expense item I would like to touch on is income taxes. Devon's adjusted full-year 2010 income tax rate came
in at 32% of pre-tax earnings comprised of a 2% current tax rate and a 30% deferred rate. As we discussed in last
quarter's conference call, additional carryover benefits from a prior-year tax return led to a lower than forecasted

current tax rate in 2010. These carryover benefits and the accelerated depreciation provisions that were passed into law
in December also reduced our adjusted fourth quarter current tax rate. In Q4, our current tax rate was a negative 12%,
and deferred taxes were 42% of pre-tax income for an overall adjusted tax rate of 30%. Looking to 2011, we would
expect an income tax rate similar to that of 2010 with less than a third of the tax expense being current.
Cutting to the bottom line, for the full-year 2010, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were an impressive
$2.5 billion or $5.75 per diluted share. Higher oil and gas revenues and strong cost control combined with a reduced
share count increased diluted earnings per share by nearly 80% over 2009. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted earnings
from continuing ops came in at $1.46 per diluted share. As Vince mentioned earlier, this result exceeded the mean
earnings estimate by about $0.06.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to conclude with a quick review of our financial position. As John
mentioned, cash flow from operations and proceeds of asset sales closed to date approached $13 billion. During the
year, we deployed our cash inflows to fund all of our capital investments, resulting in a greatly expanded reserve base
in midstream infrastructure while enhancing our long-term growth prospects.
In addition to our capital program, we also repaid $1.8 billion of debt and returned more than $1.4 billion to our
shareholders through our stock buyback program and dividend payments. Devon ended the year with one of the
strongest balance sheets in the industry. At December 31st, our debt had declined to $5.6 billion, and cash on hand was
$3.4 billion. While Devon clearly possesses a great deal of financial strength and flexibility, we're fully committed to
exercising capital discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength, and optimizing our
growth per debt adjusted share.
The upcoming year is a great example of how our disciplined approach to the business will benefit our shareholders.
Our focus on maximizing returns on our capital investments is leading to top line production growth of 6% to 8% in
2011. We expect our shareholder-friendly initiatives of stock buybacks and debt reduction to boost our debt adjusted
production per share to a double-digit growth rate. We believe this disciplined per share growth we are delivering in
2011 will compare very favorably to our peers.
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A.
Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations

open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I apologize. My handset is all screwed up so I have to do it
on speaker phone. Can you hear me okay?
<A>: Yes.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great stuff. My question is really about the rig count. Can you just elaborate a little bit more as
to where exactly you're allocating rigs for the coming year? And I guess the key thing I'm interested in is that I
understand your focus obviously is on liquids, but where the liquids are is Canada of course where right now we're
looking at something like a $40 discount versus some of the international crudes, and on NGLs where we're looking at
a $60 discount. So can you just talk about how you see the actual strength of the liquids portfolio and what you might –
or how you might want to try and address the apparent maybe disadvantage that you have versus some of your more

international peers that are going to be seeing some of the more robust oil prices?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Dave, why don't you handle the rig count question?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Why don't I handle the rig count
right now. We do have right now about 90 rigs total working for the company. And let me just try to go through it
quickly here not in too much detail.
But in Canada we have about 23 rigs working, and of course we're at the height of the drilling season in Canada, so
that's high relative to what it will be for the rest of the year. But we have about ten working in our thermal program and
those are drilling those stratigraphic wells in Pike that we talked about. Then we have another 13 deployed across the
rest of Canada.
The more liquids rich ones would be about three in the Lloyd area there, and then we're also testing some concepts as I
mentioned, some exploration concepts that are liquids rich there. We have about 23 located in Cana that are drilling –
primarily drilling the liquids portion of the play and the extension of the play to the northwest from our core. We have
13 right now in the Barnett that are concentrating on the liquids rich portion, and four in the Granite Wash.
We also – going to our Texas Gulf Coast area, we have four rigs working in the Carthage area, around an area where
we have traditionally high return PUD program that we're executing there, proved and undeveloped program; one in
Groesbeck; one in North Louisiana; and one in South Texas. And then particularly in the more liquids rich and oil rich
area of the Permian Basin, we have 17 rigs working there. And I detailed where those are located in the call pretty well.
I think it's six – they move around a little bit. But it's roughly six in the Wolfberry, four in the Avalon Shale, three in
the Bone Springs, and four drilling other conventional targets. And then we have three rigs up in Wyoming, some of
which are testing our more oil oriented concepts in the Powder River Basin. We have one rig working in Washakie as
well. So that details it all.
Vince, you want to talk about the second part of the question?
<A - Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah, I think your question was oil and liquids
growth, how much of it was oil and how much of it was liquids and what areas it's coming from.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: It's more about the realizations because I understand the liquids focus, but what I'm really
looking at here is that obviously the world has kind of changed here in the short-term anyway, and the incremental
value of those liquids is perhaps lagging some of the higher international prices. I'm just wondering if there is a change
of focus that you can maybe bring to bear away from NGLs maybe more towards the oilier plays. Just talk a little bit
about how you anticipate your relative benefit to the industry from your current liquids program.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Sure. Well, you use the word
"disadvantage," Doug, and your observation is correct that currently Brent is commanding a higher price per barrel than
North American crudes, and obviously NGLs prices are depressed. I would point out that even in the current
environment, our liquids rich Cana and Barnett plays earn a better rate of return than almost anything in the deepwater
and Gulf of Mexico – deepwater Gulf of Mexico or international arenas because of the long cycle times and the impact
of production sharing contracts on returns. And that's in a depressed natural gas and liquids environment.
I'd also point out that a lot of our growth is black oil. Our largest liquids growth areas in 2011 are the Permian and
Jackfish. Three quarters of our Permian growth will be oil, not NGLs, or of our total liquids growth in the Permian will
be oil and not NGLs. And of course Jackfish, 100% of that growth is oil. So we are not changing our oil and NGLs mix
during 2011. We anticipate growing them both and maintaining our percentage of oil, which is more oil than NGLs.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's the answer I wanted, Vince. Thanks very much indeed.
<A - J. Larry Nichols>: Doug, Larry Nichols. I might add one comment. When you think about disadvantaged from
one perspective, we're advantaged from another, that is we do not have the political risk in the United States and in
Canada that many of the international plays have as we see Egypt going through its turmoil and as that turmoil spreads
through other parts of the world, we're in really an advantaged position because of the politically stable countries that

Next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Thank you. Good morning. Just sort of a follow-up question to that. Obviously the Louisiana
light sweet differential is looking pretty strong as well. Do you all have any kind of flexibility to move some of your
volumes around to get there for the most part?
<A - Darryl Smette>: This is Darryl Smette, and we have some flexibility, but not an awful lot of flexibility, quite
frankly. As you know, most of our heavy barrels in Canada are sold in the U.S. market, mainly to refineries in the
Midwest in the Chicago, Minneapolis areas. And the oil that we produce in the Permian Basin, most of that oil goes to
the local refineries in that area. Some of that oil is moved into Cushing, but there is a lack of capacity getting oil out of
Cushing, which has in part contributed some to differentials that we're seeing right now. But while we have some
flexibility to move oil around, that flexibility is fairly limited.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Thank you. And the second question, in the Niobrara, can you talk about – or in the
Powder River Basin, I guess I'll call it, can you talk about what you drilled so far and kind of some of the results you
might be seeing?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: It's still a little early to talk about
results. We just got our first wells down and are completing them, so I think probably next quarter we'll have a lot more
to say on that.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Are some of those first wells, are they going to be targeting the Niobrara or, I mean, the
Parkman? And is the Frontier a consideration as well?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Primarily Niobrara and the
Parkman with the early wells.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Thank you.
<A - Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: All right. Operator, we're ready for the next caller.

The next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Singer>: First in the Permian Basin, the Bone Spring, Avalon Shale, you talked about the rig counts that
you have in both places. Are you or do you plan on drilling the Bone Spring on the same acreage that you're testing the
Avalon, and do you have an updated view on the potential from each play and the EURs there, please?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah, where we're actually drilling
the Bone Springs is a little – not exactly the same acreage, although we think there is some overlap in the prospectivity
in general. We're not drilling those in exactly the same locations. The Bone Springs – the first and second Bone Springs
tend to be more up in New Mexico a little bit to the north of where we're drilling our Avalon wells. And then the third
Bone Springs are located in Texas a little bit to the southeast of where we're currently drilling our Avalon wells. So

they are in different areas.
If you look at the Bone Springs, you want to talk about the EURs that we potentially have in there. We give those
EURs on the order 300,000 to 400,000 BOE, perhaps even a little bit better as we get down into the third Bone Springs.
It looks like it's a little bit higher recovery than the first and second Bone Springs. The Avalon, we've said previously
on the order of 400,000 to 600,000 BOE per well, and that's where we're currently continuing to evaluate that and
staying with that range.
<Q - Brian Singer>: And you do think there's overlap in prospectivity? Did I catch you said that?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah, we think there's overlap in
prospectivity. We haven't actually drilled them on the same locations, but we think the prospectivity overlaps, yes.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Great. Thanks. And a follow-up question, you mentioned in your opening comments that you're
seeing a little bit more gas than you originally expected in some of your liquids rich areas, obviously 20% growth
versus high teens growth is not that big of a difference, but can you provide a little bit more color where you're seeing
that?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah, I think I'd say it has to do
probably more with where we drilled our initial wells in these trends versus necessarily what the overall trend may be
once we drill everything up. And so, for instance, in the Avalon, we have seen in the wells that we have drilled a little
bit higher gas content than where we drilled our initial wells, although we're seeing some trends there that would
indicate that overall it's going to be probably within the range we thought. It's just not where we drilled our initial wells.
And so that's the type of thing we're looking at.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Guys, good morning. I wonder if you could give us some idea of what the year-end 2010 overall
resource base looked like versus the year ago on an apples-to-apples basis?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You know, Mark, I think we're going to try to do a bit
of a resource update later on in the year, but I'm not sure we can tell you exactly what that is. But directionally, our
resource base has increased significantly. We have got – we've got more prospective resource in the Cana than we
thought we had. Of course we added a lot in our heavy oil projects where we think we've probably got another 750
million barrels net to Devon of recoverable resource with the addition of our Pike resource, and all of this work that
we're doing in the Permian Basin, these are all new areas.
Sometimes on lands that we had for a while because they're held by production, but we of course will know more about
that. And then lastly, we've got a very significant focus, as Dave mentioned, on new ventures both in Canada and here
in the United States. And we're pretty excited about that.
As Dave said, we've got – we've added about 750,000 acres, three quarters of a million acres, to an already large HBP
position. And that will as we get the first results from that, that will significantly add to our resource base. So the long –
the short answer is I don't think we can tell you exactly what it is, but directionally, our resource base is getting larger
over time.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: John, would you say the overall resource base replaced 2010 production?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, yeah, much more. It would be dramatically more.
And as you know, just the proved reserves that we added were more than twice our 2010 production. In fact as we said,
replaced our 2010 production and all of the assets that we sold in 2010 as well. So the resource potential, like in

addition to those proved reserves, would be many multiples.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. My follow-up relates to some industry evidence of a possible Mississippian carbonate
play in the Anadarko. Dave, can you talk about whether any of your land might be prospective for this or whether this
is something you might be looking at pursuing?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Well, we're looking at a number of
new venture plays, and we're just not going to get into the details of exactly which ones we're pursuing. But we're
certainly aware of that play.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wilmoth from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: Hi, guys. Just looking at the Permian with the horizontal success you guys have had and other
operators, have you seen any constraining factors on the rig or completion side that might hamper future growth if the
rig count continues to ramp up?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: No, we're – I wouldn't say that's a
major constraint for us. We're able to access the rigs. The rig rates are going up somewhat, there's no question about
that. But we have been able to access the rigs that we need in order to execute the program. Our constraint right now I'd
say – we think we're in good balance with the 17 rigs we have. We don't want to outrun the infrastructure, and frankly
we don't want to outrun the pace of our learnings from a technical perspective either, and that's probably more the
governor than the actual availability of rigs.
<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: Okay. And then just jumping over to the Barnett, I know you guys are planning on kind of
holding production flat with 12 rigs at 1.2 BCFE a day. Can we think longer term in terms of how long are you guys
planning on keeping that flat and at what price would the Barnett become competitive where you might think about
increasing that rig count?
<A - Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Well, this is Vince. In the first place, the Barnett is
competitive within our portfolio in the liquids rich portions, and that's why we are running 12 rigs there to keep our
production at plant capacity. The future will depend on the evolution of our view of commodity prices. We would
probably be drilling more dry gas wells in the Barnett if we had a three-year view of $6 or better for average Henry
Hub prices. But it also depends on the other opportunities within our portfolio and how they compete for capital.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me just throw something out. I always find this to
be kind of a fascinating thing about the Barnett and it just shows you what a quality asset it is. As Dave mentioned,
we're going to spend about $900 million of capital this year in the Barnett. It's going to throw off, at assuming $4.50
gas, it's going to throw off somewhere around $1.4 billion of cash flow, so $450 or $500 million of free cash flow over
our capital expenditures. And then our midstream business which, as you know, has thrown off $400 million or $500
million a year, is roughly 80% centered in that area. So there's another several hundred million dollars that's attributable
to that. So it just shows you the tremendous economics that we're getting around this play, and we have many, many
years of running room left in the Barnett.
<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: Great, thanks.

<Q - Mark Polak>: Good morning, guys. Couple questions. First one just on share buybacks, looked like the pace
slowed a little bit in the fourth quarter, and just wondering if you can update us. It looks like you did about 1.2 billion
so far, obviously lots of financial capacity. Do you still see doing the remaining 2.3 billion throughout 2011?
<A - Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: This is Vince again. I would point out to you that in
the fourth quarter we slowed down our share repurchases for the months of October and November as we finalized our
capital budget and updated our outlook for commodity prices going forward. Then we were back in the market in a big
way in December and then so far in the first quarter of this year.
When we announced the share buyback, we said we fully expected to complete it. However, we would continue to
weigh our options as the commodity price outlook changed and what was available within our portfolio changed. We
would attempt to optimize growth per share by making the correct allocation between capital projects and share
repurchases. While we were updating our view for 2011, we thought it was prudent to be out of the market.
Now that we have set our 2011 capital budget and updated our outlook for commodity prices, we're in there pretty
aggressively. I'd point out to you that at $88 a share where our stock I think opened today or close to that, we're paying
about $12 a barrel which is down quite a bit because of all the reserves that we added at year-end 2010. So we think on
a relative basis, this is still a great buy, and we are on track to complete the repurchase program within the
authorization period. And in the absence of some big change in expectations, we would expect to complete it.
John, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I think you have stated it well. Right now it still
looks like, as Vince says, a very good buy and I think it's a very prudent allocation of some of those divestiture funds.
<A - Vince White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: I apologize; we have run past the top of the hour.
Let's take one more question and cut it off.

Your last question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - David Tameron>: Good. Glad I made the cut. Let me ask two questions, Vince, sneak one in there. But first on
the Granite Wash, was that – was that Wheeler County, and/or what formations are you targeting there?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yeah, that's in Wheeler County,
and we're targeting primarily what we called the Cherokee and the Granite Wash A there. We have also prospectivity in
some of the deeper zones within the Granite Wash. To give you an idea, though, we have what we think is probably
about a hundred additional Cherokee locations that are operated and probably about 60 non-operated and probably a
little over a hundred locations within the Granite Wash A. And that's again those are the two zones that we have been
getting the results that we talk about. We'll also have some lower Granite Wash locations probably on the order of
about 200 operated and about 250 non-op. We're starting to test some of those lower ones. They're probably not going
to be quite as prolific as the upper zones, but we still think they can be very economic.
<Q - David Tameron>: Okay. Thanks. And then Vermillion basin, there's chatter that you guys are testing a liquids
play out there. Can you comment at all?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: We have tested a well out there.
We're really not ripe to talk about in any sort of detail though.
<Q - David Tameron>: Okay. Thought I'd give it a shot. Thanks.
