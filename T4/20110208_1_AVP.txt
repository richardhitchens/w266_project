MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, my name is Celeste, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the
speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over
to Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Miss Chasen, you may begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen, Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss Avon's fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings
results. With me on this call are: Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and CEO; and Chuck Cramb, Vice Chairman and
CFO.
I refer you to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release, as well as our non-GAAP reconciliation in the
appendix to today's slides, and also available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Today on the call, we'll
only focus on adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. As you will hear from Andrea in a minute – you will hear from
Andrea in a minute that we're handling today's call a bit differently. As a result, our usual slides that review regional
and P&L results will be available on our Web site. With that, I'll hand this over to Andrea.

Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everybody. As Amy said, given this quarter's disappointing results I've just decided to
handle this call a little bit differently this morning. In anticipating your questions, we're going to really focus our
comments on three key areas, revenue in Brazil and Russia, and overall company operating margins.
So, I want to just start with an overview of where we are in 2010 as we close the year and what we're looking at in
2011. 2010, was a tale of two halves for the company. We had a very strong first half and that was offset by a
disappointing second half with weakness we started to see in third quarter continuing into the fourth quarter. In the first
half, we delivered meaningful operating margin expansion, as our strong business performance offset costs related to
the FCPA investigation and the Venezuelan devaluation.
However, as our revenue growth softened unexpectedly in the second half, operating margin was pressured for the
balance of the year, so clearly disappointing. Our issues were executional rather than structural challenges and they
drove the majority of our second half performance deceleration in Brazil and Russia, and I'll get into that in a minute.
But just a quick comment on 2011 and then both Chuck and I will spend more time on this. We are squarely, squarely
focused on execution against two priorities: restoring growth in these key geographies, and delivering meaningful
operating margin expansion in the year.
If you look at this chart, as I said, on the top line 2010 was a year of two halves, driven by Brazil and Russia. So, if you
look on the left, for the total year the company delivered, without acquisitions, 5% growth in constant dollars and that
was led by a 7% first half, which decelerated to 3% in the second half.
When you look at Brazil and Russia, Brazil had a 13% first half and a 4% second half, and Russia, a 14% first half,
coming down to a 2% second half, and those two markets drove the lion's share of the deceleration of the company
between the two halves.
So obviously, the key questions are for Brazil and Russia, why did our sales decelerate? What are we doing to fix these
challenges? How long will it take? Was it structural? Was it secular competition? Or is it executional? And let me try
and answer these questions.
So, when I look at these billed sales, the deceleration was driven by service outages. Just a little context for everyone,
same on Brazil's growth between 2007 and 2010 outpaced our expectations and our infrastructure plans.
Our local currency sales were up 70% between 2006 and 2010. Our orders were up 30% versus the 2007 level, as they
reached 6 million orders that were shipped out in Q4 of 2010. So this order scale has started to push our system
capacity as our growth outplaced our planned infrastructure investments and you'll hear in a minute that we have
started to really put plans in place, whether it was distribution with new Cabreúva facilities, manufacturing capacity
enhancements and some systems. So, that has been in the works.
However, government-imposed e-invoicing changes in June of 2010, exacerbated the order processing issues for us in
the second half. So the system's instability led to service delays for our representatives, and then outages or product
shortage, and it also reduced our flexibility. So, this amplified some of our forecasting misses.
Along with the result, it resulted in product shorts at three times our historic norms in this market. So, we had lost sales
from unfilled orders, we had lost demand as representatives became annoyed, they were still placing their orders, but
less units per order as they started to receive less than they ordered in previous campaigns, and higher returns in this
period due to shorts and service delays than the typical norm for Brazil.
When you look at service disruptions on this chart, you'll see that they created approximately an eight point sales drag
in the second half. So, in the third quarter as you can see, we had about four points of sales lost, due to incremental
shorts. About two points of sales in the third quarter due to again representatives being annoyed and not placing the
same kind of demand, and then higher returns than normal at about 1.5%.
Okay, when you look at the fourth quarter, again, still lost sales due to incremental shorts. A little bit more on the
representative annoyance factor, going from 2% of sales to about 4% of sales impact. And then returns, slightly better
than the third quarter at about 1% higher than the norm.

When we look at this, the service disruptions far outweighed the impact from competition. So again, I just studied this
last month. The percent of impact on the fourth quarter sales for Avon Brazil, you can see that Avon controllable
factors were the lion share of this. So, Avon service disruption was a drag of approximately 9 points from our demand.
Leading direct sales competition did have an impact, but it was 0.6% on our sales. And then retail competitors, it was
0.3%, pretty minimalist. So that is – again, that's the numbers for fourth quarter, which attribute this short fall from
where we were in the first half to Avon controllable factors and service disruption.
What are we doing about it? Aggressive service fixes are underway. Short, medium and long term, we've got a big plan
but end-to-end from a short-term point of view, all hands are on deck to micromanage the recovery with the company's
best people and resources on site. We're accelerating a large number of legacy system modifications and upgrades.
We've added significant incremental finance and IT teams on the ground to manage them. And we're redesigning
billing and fulfillment processes to increase flexibility. Mid to longer-term investments to support continued growth
have always been in our plans. Our manufacturing investment of about $100 million since 2007 does increase our
capacity by 300 million units for this market. You all know about the new state-of-the-art distribution site in Cabreúva,
which increases the throughput over 40% and that is up and running in full in 2011.
ERP, you know that we have implemented ERP in Europe and North America. Latin America is next and Brazil is the
first stop. And that transitions 50% to 60% of the company's supply chain and financial transactions, which are being
today managed by legacy systems. It allows us to retire those systems to a global solution. And then you've heard us
talk the talk about investments we've been making in the service model transformation, which improved the
representative service proposition with a global order management system. So, that's what we're doing short, medium
and long term.
Service is gradually recovering, with revenue expected to improve throughout the year. If you look on the left, you can
see the percent of representatives' orders that have delivery delays, and the average is somewhere in the norm of 5%
and you can see that, at its worst, when we cut over here, it was at 70% of representatives having some kind of delivery
delay, and as you get to the right of that chart you start seeing that we are returning to historic norm in the first quarter.
So, that's in terms of delayed orders. When you look at the actual order fill rate, the historic norm has been quite high in
Brazil, and you can see that as we hit the second half in the third and fourth quarter, you had numbers that were down
to historic lows. And on the very right-hand side, it is gradually improving, campaign-by-campaign, it is not back to
historic norms, but all efforts are to get it back to historic norms. So, it is starting to improve as we turn the corner on
this year, but not back at our normal level.
Just a reminder of our fundamentals and the structural soundness of our business. We have had 24 quarters of
double-digit growth since 2004. Obviously, third and fourth quarter 2010, were not double-digits, however, demand
growth was double-digits. So, when you look at the demand growth, and as I've asked myself whether the products
were effective, the advertising was effective, the incentives were effective, et cetera, demand growth was 13% in the
first half and 12% in the second half. And again, you saw the numbers of what reduced that demand growth, which was
the service.
We've just completed studies about consumer perceptions. This is market research as of January. It continues to be
strong. What is our perception of Avon? And again, it is 86% of consumers say that their perception of Avon is good to
excellent. And then, has your opinion of the Avon brand changed since six months ago? Again, just completed last
month, and you see 78% say that their perceptions and opinions of the Avon brand has improved a little, to improved a
lot.
Our field fundamentals are healthy. Again, this is market research as of this January. Our active representative count
has continued to grow. In fourth quarter, our orders per campaign, despite the service challenges, reached an all-time
high of 1.4 million orders in our highest campaign. And our representatives' loyalty, in spite of their challenge and the
annoyance, is very high in terms of all representatives intending to stay with Avon, it is 85%. In terms of top sellers, it's
91%.

And then, if I just look out at an industry level at Beauty and channel share, I think Brazil Beauty fundamentals
continue to remain strong in Direct Sales. If I look at the period on the left from 2004 to 2010, Direct Selling gained 8
points of market share. Franchised Beauty gained 2 points of market share in this time period, and Retail lost 10 points.
So, that's 2004 through this last year 2010. But then if you ask me specifically in this last year, 2010 versus 2009, has
that changed? You can see that Direct Sales still gained market share, 30 basis points. Franchised did gain nice share at
almost 1 point and traditional Retail, in spite of heavy investments and a lot of intense pressure, still lost 1.2% market
share in 2010 versus year ago.
And I just have to make a comment here. We certainly are completely aware and prepared for intensifying competitive
pressure. So, we're not ignoring it whatsoever, in terms of Retail as well as other Direct Sales formats. I would just say
that we are prepared for it, but we still are seeing Direct Sales channel share, not only in the year but for that six-year
period.
Let me just turn now to Russia and start by saying, as in Brazil, our challenges in Russia for the company are
executional. Avon's market position remains very strong. At the same time, we completed market research just last
month on Russia as well. And you can see on the left that in terms of leading beauty brand image, Avon rates number 1
at 176, followed by L'Oreal and then Oriflame. And if you looked at leading brand awareness, beauty brand awareness
unaided, again, Avon leads followed by Oriflame and L'Oreal. And in terms of a beauty market share, value share,
again, we're just follow L'Oreal in the number 2 position in the market, then followed by Oriflame.
So, our market position remains strong. However, in Russia our deceleration was disappointing and largely driven by
execution as our field growth slowed off a record 2009. You can see again, before the solid line in the middle, that in
the fourth quarter last year we had well over 25% Active Rep growth and nearly 30% revenue growth on a constant
dollar basis and that gave us a tough comp, in addition to the fact that our field incentives were not strong enough to
anniversary that 2009 momentum and we are strongly course-correcting in 2011.
So, when asked why they thought their business was down in fourth quarter, 72% of our representatives said that the
incentive requirements were too high, 67% said they were less exciting incentives than the prior-year period.
In addition, one of the things that exacerbated our field deceleration was an increase in the social benefit taxes in the
Russian market. The new tax rules for entrepreneurs significantly diluted earnings for our first year sales leaders. So,
you can see on the left that before the tax changes until after the tax changes in 2010, an average first-year sales leader
with a threshold earnings that aren't lower than the rest, it impacted her about 35%. And it reduced that group's
motivation to recruit.
So, on the right, if you look at the number of new recruits in the fourth quarter and the percent change, first-year sales
leaders highly impacted by this tax change, their recruits were down 15%, that represents about 50% of the recruiting
pool, each side of this represents about half. And those sales leader with tenure over one year, where you had far less
impact from these rule changes, their recruits were up 24%. Okay, so that exacerbated, again, field deceleration because
of the recruiting impact.
What are we doing here to offset the tax burden? We just launched a new sales leadership compensation plan on
January 27th of this year, so just days ago. This increases earnings potential of these first-year sales leaders by 25%. It
eases the qualification thresholds for them, it lowers their earning thresholds and adds a new bonus level when they
recruit. So, this is going to be funded by re-allocating advertising investments because we think it's just that important
to recalibrate, obviously, the compensation for these sales leaders.
When I look at category in addition in Russia, we had weak Color and Skincare performance that dampened our second
half sales growth. If you look on the chart here in red, is Color Cosmetics performance and we're coming up against
31% and 35% growth in the third and fourth quarter last year, and had challenges with declines in this year's second
half. Same thing in Skincare; again, it's not as strong as Color, but double-digit growth and we were not able to lap that.
What were these declines driven by? Execution factors again, partly to some degree a weaker innovation pipeline than
a year ago in Skincare. Our Solutions mid-tier brand was down double-digits. And then in Color, it's less effective
consumer promotions. 2011, we are significantly strengthening our Skincare offers starting in the second quarter with a

completely revamped Solutions brand. Here you see the positioning but it's a completely new formula, completely new
brand positioning and packaging and it launches in Europe and China in the second quarter.
In Color we are stepping up innovation. So, this is stronger innovation versus year ago's pipeline with Moisture
Seduction Lipstick in the end of Q1 and SuperSHOCK Mascara in the beginning of the third quarter.
If I just get to promotions for a second, I think that we clearly knew we needed to step up the intensity and the
excitement of the promotional calendar. So, in addition to a stronger product pipeline, we've got a very high impact
aspirational consumer promotion tied in. So, this is an example that starts at the end of the first quarter with the
Moisture Seduction Lipstick where there's a raffle and a sweepstakes that include the opportunity to win a car.
So longer term – just going to the broad view of the Russian market. On the left, you'll see that the Beauty industry,
Russia, from 2008 through 2010, grew about 8% and that includes a very depressed 2009 because of the global
recession and economic impact. We outgrew that by 1.2%, 1.2 times, I'm sorry. So, Avon gained share in the 2008 to
2010 period. And when we look at the market, and again these are Euromonitor sources, for 2011 to 2014 the
anticipation is that Russia is going to grow in the high single-digits to low double-digits. And again, we fully intend to
restore our growth in this market to again stabilizing and regaining market share growth.
Turning for a few seconds to the bottom line and I'm going to let Chuck go into this in depth. Avon's adjusted operating
margin was down 10 basis points in 2010. And if you look on this chart, operational factors were offset by a 70 basis
point drag from non-operational factors related to the FCPA investigation and Venezuela. So, operationally in the year
we had a 60 basis point operating margin improvement. And that obviously included the impact of the significantly
lower sales than we had expected in the second half, for a full year total of approximately the same as prior year or 10
basis points down.
Clearly in 2011 our goal is to deliver operating margin expansion on the path to mid-teens by 2013. Chuck's going to
detail this, but this is going to be driven by gross margin gains, recalibrating the company's strategic investments and
tightly controlling costs. Very importantly, we have completed the redesign of our annual and long-term executive
compensation, which is now fully aligned with the achievement of mid-teens operating margin by 2013. So that applies
to the 2011 annual executive compensation for the high weight of operating margin improvement in this year, as well
as that mid-teens operating margin commitment which is reflected in the three-year plan for '11, '12 and '13. Okay, so
that's executive compensation.
So, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck, but I just – I want to say again, our priorities – we're disappointed in how we
closed the second half for sure, but we've got very clear priorities. Intense focus on execution to restore growth in these
key geographies and delivering meaningful operating margin expansion in 2011. So with that, I'm going to turn it over
to Chuck.
Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer
Thank you, Andrea. Let me expand on what Andrea said. We are focusing even more on margin improvement as we
enter 2011 and beyond. Margin improvement remains a key component of our annual and our long-term planning. And
importantly, margin improvement will carry significantly more weight in both our annual and our long-term
management incentive programs. Margin and incentives will be aligned.
As I think back on 2010, in terms of our adjusted margins, we had confidence as we entered the year that we would
show a margin improvement, even after the negative impacts of Venezuela and the realization that the FCPA
investigation costs would be substantially higher than they had been in 2009, we still felt we could show some margin
improvement in 2010, albeit much less than originally expected. And we also felt we could step up our investments in
longer-term initiatives. Initiatives that would give no near-term sales growth, but that would benefit us over the
longer-term.
We were still tracking well against these expectations until we experienced the revenue growth slowdown in our two
largest and high-margin international markets, Brazil and Russia. And then that end result was that we basically held

margin versus 2009, just offsetting the negative impacts of Venezuela and the FCPA investigation costs. So, as I think
about 2011, I believe that we will show margin growth. However, we are going to manage the business differently to
increase our ability to ensure margin improvement. First, we are going to cost the business against a more conservative
sales-growth assumption. Second, we are changing the mix of investment spending between RVP and advertising, with
greater weight on RVP which is more variable with sales. And third, while in 2010 we invested ahead of sales, in 2011
we will pace our investments to be either more in line with, or in some cases, even trailing, our sales growth.
These actions should give us greater control over our margin growth in 2011. However, given our declining sales
momentum throughout the second half of 2010, what I expect to see is a stabilization of our margin over the first half
of 2011, with measurable improvements coming in the second half.
I also think its fair for you to ask about where we expect the margin improvement to occur within our P&L. So, let's
take a quick walk through that P&L. We are costing to the conservative side of mid single-digit revenue growth. We
expect to deliver significant gross margin improvement. Like many other companies, we are experiencing input cost
pressures, particularly from oil-based commodities such as plastic resins and chemicals and freight costs on materials
shipped to our factories. We are also continuing to face double-digit labor cost increases in Latin America and Central
& Eastern Europe.
However, on the positive side, we see room for continued pricing, for the ability to improve the mix of our products,
particularly with our skin care initiatives, and for further benefits from manufacturing productivity through our
well-established strategic sourcing processes and further cost reductions and efficiency gains within our factories.
Our investments in advertising and RVP, in total, are more or less going to grow in line with our revenues, but we are
shifting the mix away from advertising and in favor of RVP. This shift is to take advantage of greater investment
returns on RVP. Despite this, we will continue strong advertising support in our larger and more competitive markets.
Our distribution expenses, which include warehousing and freight to customers, will be under some pressure, due to the
higher oil prices and their impact on fuel. We will also experience incremental costs, particularly during the first half of
the year, as we transition out of the old distribution center in Brazil to the new one. Effectively, we will have duplicated
costs as we run both facilities. We expect our overhead expenses to grow at a rate lower than sales. This is despite the
negative impacts of assuming that we will achieve a target bonus payout in 2011, versus payouts that were well below
target in 2010.
We're also experiencing double-digit wage pressures in Latin America and Central & Eastern Europe. We will reduce
these negative impacts by further benefits from our restructuring programs, by tighter controls over labor costs,
including a freeze on vacancies except for the most critical positions, and by repacing or slowing down our investments
in longer-term strategic initiatives.
Put all together, this is the path that should yield margin improvement with greater flexibility to deliver it.
Despite our higher sales and improved margin, which will yield higher net income and earnings per share, our free cash
flow in 2011 will probably be similar to that of 2010 as we will be facing the negative headwinds of incremental
pension payments of about $75 million, an unpayrolled mismatch of CTI cash versus expenses of at least $50 million
and also, while well below the target payout, a portion of our three-year, long-term incentive cash plan for the years
2007 to 2010. We'll offset some of this with continued improvements in trade accounts payable, as well as progress on
inventory programs. Our capital expenditures are expected to be somewhat less than in 2010 when they were $331
million.
So, that summarizes how I am thinking about 2011 in terms of margin improvement and cash flow. Now, I would like
to turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A session.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Yeah, it's Deutsche Bank. Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hey, there's a paragraph or a sentence in the press release that says the business fundamentals
remain solid. Do you guys really believe that? I know you walked through some of that, but why is that in there?
Because you want to see some more urgency here.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think, Bill, we're talking about the
structural business. I think the strategies to invest in the brand, invest in the channel, the pricing structure of the brand, I
think those are – continue to be the right direction for the company. We have executional issues; I think I detailed them
and we're not happy about them, but I think that's separate from having the wrong strategy.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. You talk about the mid single-digit growth for the year,
but like the way you wrote that same sentence, does that mean the first quarter's going to be well below mid single-digit
growth? Or am I just reading too much into that commentary?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Bill, if I can't really answer that
question because that's a guidance question in terms of what first quarter outlook might look like. What we did say,
however, is that in terms of the margin improvement, because of the slowing of sales momentum through the third and
fourth quarters, we wouldn't expect to see that coming in early in the year.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. All right, that's fair. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: Hi, good morning. It's Morgan Stanley.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Hey.
<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: So, it sounds like you'll clearly be pulling back on advertising going forward, but historically
you've indicated that your analytics showed your marketing spending was driving a solid payback. So do you think the
payback on marketing has changed here? Has something changed on that front? And are you concerned that the
pullback could drive a slowdown in organic sales growth going forward, particularly given the heightened competitive
environment in the industry?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Just to give you an example in the
fourth quarter, I think the climate we had in advertising was primarily in China, and the paybacks are difficult in China,
when we're going through a model transition. So, I think we're trying to look at it pretty carefully and make sure that,
again, major markets where we've got a lot of competition, Brazil, Russia, have good levels, strong levels as Chuck
said, and you've got to look at it over a several-year period.
So, I think we were talking about the fact that in certain categories we were seeing that we were getting to scale and
there are certain geographies where we have started to pull back and will continue to pull back until, again, the model
stabilizes and those are dollars re-allocated into RVP. China would be an example.
So there's a shift, and the net of the two, and I think you've got to balance those two levers in terms of how we're going
to feel the growth. So, the net of the two, advertising and RVP, will still be an increase in 2011, but in line with sales
growth on a more conservative basis, not ahead of, as we've reached scale.

<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: Okay. And then on a related note, within your organic sales growth results, the composition
was a bit disconcerting in that you were really relying on pricing and mix to drive your growth, and you experienced
unit declines. Can you discuss the balance you expect going forward? If you'd expect to see unit trends rebound? And
also, if you think you can continue to post at the strong pricing growth going forward, just given the competitive
industry environment?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, we do expect to see unit growth
starting to – they were negative, so we expect them to be positive. If I really dive into the price mix in the fourth
quarter, I think you've got to take out the acquisitions and actually even take out Venezuela, which impacts that. And I
think you look at several regions in the world where we didn't really push I would say, pricing and mix, even Latin
America, ex Venezuela, is about down 3% units, 3% pricing and North America was up 5% in price, mix and units
were down.
But there I think the lost units were really tied to the drop in the staff, number of doors, so to speak, is the key driver
there. I think we have been really effective in pricing and not losing specific units if you dive into where we took prices
with the analytics there. So, that isn't the impact, but overall going forward, yes, some resumption of unit growth, a
little bit more balanced in 2011.
<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: Okay. And on the pricing front, are you comfortable you'll hold onto this pricing going
forward?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: There's nothing that we've seen
in our analytics that suggests that the pricing has had any negative impact in terms of the unit development or the
market share. So, those analytics continue to bear out and we feel we've done the right things.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, just on the absolute number it's 3%,
is really the pricing number, it's obviously swayed by M&A, as well as Venezuela. But if you just look at core, the way
we look at it, it's about 3%.
<Q - Dara Mohsenian>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Hi, from Citigroup. My first question has to do with your guidance policy, Chuck. And it
seems to me that it's highly unfair that you give us guidance that you want to give us, but you don't give us what we
want to know. For example, give us a sense of the first quarter. And I don't think that where you are now, it's right for
you to cherry-pick what you think is termed guidance and what not. And I guess, it's your policy, whatever, but can you
give us a sense at least in the fourth quarter, of relative to your own internal forecast how the business trended?
In other words, if we're supposed to believe the two pieces of guidance you're giving us, how did you track in the fourth
quarter relative to your own internal expectations? Because we really don't know. Second question I have is, while it's
great that you guys are being compensated, I think on the external targets, it's crazy that you weren't to begin with, but
whatever. My bigger picture question is, maybe something more drastic needs to happen, and Andrea, it's great that
your problems aren't structural, but if they're all execution, well then shouldn't there be a bunch of people who lose
their jobs over such awful execution? Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well, let me just take that last
question first. Okay, Wendy? And then, I'll let Chuck talk a little bit about what we expected in the fourth quarter, et
cetera. But just certainly clearly operational rigor on the ground is a huge priority for the company. And I've got to
make the right organizational – make sure we have the right organizational structure, which may be different than it has
been. And make sure we have the top talent and sales in the right positions to deliver and execute this year. And when I

have something to announce I certainly will, but clearly that is the priority.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Okay, Wendy, in terms of
guidance, I know that you and I have talked philosophically through many years about it. Just to answer your question
specifically, as we are tracking through the year, and you saw Andrea's chart, which showed first half, second half, and
first half was strong, we were more than offsetting the impacts of Venezuela. We had the FCPA costs going up, we
were also offsetting those, but when we came into the third quarter and saw that we were experiencing a slowdown in
the revenue, you remember that we actually said that we pulled off of our guidance about increasing the margin this
year, which is what in fact happened; we came in flat with a year ago.
So, I think we tried to give you some sense of what the business might look like. In terms of the second part of that
question is, how did we perform in the fourth quarter against what our – we internally expected? It was softer
performance than we had expected. It was continued disappointing in terms of how the business developed.
So, I hope that at least puts it in the context. We don't want anybody to have inappropriate guidance out there and that's
why we changed that guidance on margin improvement for 2010. And then our delivery against what we expected
going into the end of the year; there was an underperformance.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey. It's Bank of America. Thanks, guys. Look, onto the management compensation
thing again. I guess it is great that you guys have adopted operating margin. I just wanted to understand, are your
targets based on absolute levels of operating margin? Or are they based on year-over-year improvement?
And then along those lines, is the base year for 2010, is that based on the GAAP base year? Or is it based on the pro
forma base year? So, if you could just give us a sense for what kind of improvement and what kind of absolute levels
are key bogies for you guys to get paid, that would be really helpful?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Okay. In terms of the margin, it
will be based upon an absolute level of margin. There are going to be parameters so that you can't achieve the margin
by doing really bad things for the business, but the overall margin objective will be a specific objective going into
2011. And it will be on adjusted operating profit, because we still have some costs coming through from restructuring.
But, in general, specific is I think the best answer that you're looking for.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Sure. Will it be based off a – it'll be a specific – for 2011 the annual target will be a
specific achievement of the 2011 adjusted margin off of the adjusted 2010 base period?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Well, it's yeah, the absolute
margin.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Correct, and the same thing on the long
term, Chris, it's an absolute number for three years.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: And then, is that three-year target, the 2013 target, that is also an adjusted number? Or is
that a GAAP number?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: It ends up being a GAAP number
by the time you get to 2013, because there's virtually no cost left. The transition costs run out. This year will be our last
big year of transition costs. Next year, 2012 will have some significant cash flow issues as we close down two
factories. But by 2013, GAAP and adjusted are the same.

<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Right. I guess I'm just thinking in terms of if there's an incremental restructuring program
that you guys announced, is there leeway within the writing of your comp targets that you'd switch to an operating
margin, or sorry an adjusted margin target for 2013? In other words, can you do a GAAP '12 and get paid the adjusted
one? It's higher than that just because you had structuring charges.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: No, I would consider that playing
a game with the numbers.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Lane. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Yes, hi, Jefferies & Company. Just, Chuck, looking at a couple of things that are impacting this
year and then how that shapes up the impact next year. Can you give us some help on what the FCPA costs were this
year? And what the impact from Silpada was this year? And then, where you think FCPA and the Silpada will impact
2011?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Okay, in terms of FCPA, this
year we ended up with costs in total of just under $100 million. I think that exact number was $96 million. In terms of
thinking about that in the future, I can't give you any guidance on it. I don't have any guidance on it. I think the best
thing is an assumption that's got to be your assumption. I will tell you that I have assumed that the cost of 2011 will be
similar to what they were in 2010.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Okay, and then the EPS impact from Silpada acquisition mid-year? And then, what the full year
EPS impact is expected to be in 2011?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: I think when we made the
acquisition we said that we thought that the first full year EPS impact would be about $0.03 to $0.05 after the fact that
we do have a high amortization of goodwill and that looks like the objective that we are still running against for 2011.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: When we go from, just directionally then, it should be a modest dilution in 2010 and a modest
accretion in 2011?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: It's actually a very, very small
accretion in both years.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Okay, and just lastly on the year changers. Venezuela was obviously a big hit in 2010. Is
Venezuela going to be another hit in 2011? Or did you reset the bar down and that goes away?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: I'm trying to figure out how to
answer that one, because there's so much uncertainty with Venezuela in terms of the economy and in terms of the
government-mandated programs. But as we're thinking about that business, which by the way for us is a very great
business, strong business, growing market share, growing rep base, we would look at it and it's been reset to a value
that's 50% of what it was a year ago. And that's the translation devaluation. There should be no accounting things
running through going into the future other than what normally happens with hyperinflation.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rick Lyall. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Rick Lyall>: It's John Bristol. So, you guys said that your core pricing was three percentage points in the fourth
quarter versus the 7% price mix that you cited in the release. You had negative gross margins of 90 basis points. What
level of pricing do you need to improve gross margins? What are your specific product cost pressures? And how can
you manage them going forward? Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: The gross margin decline that we
experienced in the fourth quarter was heavily weighted, Rick, by a change in mix. In terms of the pricing versus the
cost dynamics, that kind of pricing that we have been able to take should help us in terms of maintaining the margin. I
think the real benefits in terms of gross margin are going to come from productivity on the factory side. Although, we'll
no longer call out strategic sourcing, it's an embedded process and it continues to deliver benefits in terms of our
procurement programs.
In terms of manufacturing productivity, we continue to have strong gains that are offsetting our labor cost increases,
more than offsetting them. And then in terms of the mix side of the business, I look to 2011 to show improved mix
throughout the business, particularly within the Beauty category, and with that a stronger performance on skin care. So,
I don't look and say, hey, I've got to have X amount of pricing to make sure I get margin improvement, I have to look at
all of the factors together and those are the key factors that I think will drive gross margin improvements next year.
<Q - Rick Lyall>: Okay. Follow-up question. You're going to close two factories. Can you talk about the magnitude of
the margin benefits from closing those factories? And the timing of those?
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Well, the two factories are
scheduled to be closed during 2012, so the first real benefits start to flow through in 2013. In terms of the benefits,
there's a lot of benefits, not the least of which are the inventory management. There are throughput benefits in terms of
changing sourcing to better utilize other Avon factories, but also importantly, to use outside contractors much more
than we have in the past, particularly in the Beauty business, where we're today maybe outsourcing 10% to 15%. I think
when we get to a stabilized position that number will be somewhere between 30% and 35%.
That will have a cost reduction program attached to it, those costs will be offsetting impacts of inflation, so I'm not
going to break them out separately, but it's not an immaterial number.
<Q - Rick Lyall>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: Thanks. It's Barclays Capital. I guess we're at – where I want to start is, I appreciate the
candor around what is Avon-specific, and I would actually happen to agree that the brand, the brochure, the advertising
in an infinitely better place than it was when this whole restructuring started now many years ago. What's still really
unclear to me is just how, as managers you've remained so incredibly far from the everyday operations of your
business. I was in Russia in May, and I asked questions about spending levels, and directly what you guys have just
commented on. Is spending at scale? Will it start to normalize and margin expansion begin? And the response was no,
we love spending money, we want to keep the momentum.
So then, the answer when you report the next quarter when Russia disappoints, we pulled back on spending to hold
back in order to support fourth quarter launches. Now we've been through the fourth quarter, doesn't look like spending
went up, doesn't look like the reason is – is anything having to do with the pace of launches? It's now executional? It
just – the reasons are changing. So, can you tell me how are you getting it so wrong in a market that is so big and so
important? This problem did not pop up this quarter.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that we had said in the third quarter
that there were weaknesses in, which I just talked about again here, Lauren, in Color and Skin care, Color mostly on

promotions. Skin care mostly on the pipeline. And the staff and recruiting numbers which were weak against last year's
base, were exacerbated by the social tax change that really started to play itself out as we moved into the end of the
third quarter and into the fourth quarter, as it related to representatives and their behavior in recruiting in that first-line
sales leader. So, I tried to explain that. But I understand what you're saying and I would just say that operational rigor
in the market is critical.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: So, in both Russia and then in Brazil where what you guys do as direct sellers is you
process lots and lots and lots of orders. So again, the scale of that business as it's grown, shouldn't have been a surprise.
And I know you said that you'd seen it building. What I mean, more specifically, what do you do? How do you add
people and capabilities to be quicker to understand what's going in these very large and important markets, while still
telling us margins can go up so significantly, when there's clearly a lot of fixing to do?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, if I just take Brazil for example, the
assumptions in the margins walk to mid-teens by 2013, includes long planned infrastructure investments, technology
investments, et cetera in Brazil. When we look at the business case for example, on our Cabreúva plant, in terms of the
number of orders that we expected to come through the system by 2010, we had seen for quite some time, that we were
about a year ahead of schedule in terms of units and orders. And so, what we had done was obviously start planning for
this new distribution facility, which we have been working on and is going to be on time, on schedule, but doesn't open
till 2011.
Again ERP, and the longer-term system solutions that get us to a global platform and get us off some of these legacy
systems, and Brazil is one of the oldest markets in the portfolio. So therefore, it is saddled with some legacy systems
that isn't true for some of our newer markets.
But Brazil's legacy system issues will partly be addressed when ERP gets put in there and we had been planning that.
This change – we've had many, many changes being required every year by the government in Russia, excuse me, in
Brazil, this particular invoicing change really exacerbated our situation before we got into the medium to long-term
fixes, which really start in 2011. So again, that's what we're doing, so we do have that short-term fix, but from the
long-term fix that's already implied and does not increase spending levels from what we assumed by 2013.

Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Weiser>: Hi. Caris & Co. The profitability in North America actually was very good in the quarter and I
think you had an 8.8% margin for the full year. Can we assume that things stay on track in North America in terms of
improving profitability further in 2011?
And then, secondly, China also, the profitability seems to be improving. Can we assume in 2011 that China is
profitable? And then, can you explain a little further in China, why the rep count decline is so significant? If you're
phasing out the boutiques, how come you're not picking up more in terms of on the direct selling model piece of it?
Why is that rep count declining so significantly?
And then finally, when you said, Chuck, that margins should stabilize in first half, 2011. Just to clarify that tiny little
guidance statement, do you mean sequentially, that overall the operating margins should sequentially stabilize? Or can
you clarify that, please? Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me just answer the questions on China.
Based on top line acceleration, I'm just going to confirm what we have said before, that we expect China to become
profitable in 2012. And obviously, though, we continue to really manage costs carefully in that market, although as we
go through this transition. As it relates to the decline in Active Representatives, just a reminder that as a part of the
move away from Beauty Boutiques into direct sales and the new direct sales model, which is focused on service
centered and more stellar representatives driving productivity.

Part of this loss is some of the, I would just call them more customer representatives that were part of and attached to
the retail model in the Beauty Boutiques. So, when I look at the pilot, it is rolled out now to 20% of the market and the
full, new direct sales model will be rolled out nationally by the end of this first quarter, so at the end of this month. And
some of the early indications are positive, particularly as it relates to activity, improvements in average order increases.
So, that really is the answer of having more productive representatives which is our focus in the new model. Okay?
In terms of North America and its operating margin, we did have strong gross margin improvement in this market. We
are realizing the restructuring savings. This is one of the tenets of the turnaround is obviously real good cost
management. We also – we had a benefit from – when you include the total, we had a investment from these
accounting adjustments on Silpada. But we think it's, while it may be variable by quarter, obviously our long-term goal
here is to get North America back to respectable margins.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I'm from Bernstein. So, I guess I'm trying to ask this question in the most, I guess
objective, open-minded way possible given what some know as a bias on the stock, and some of the rationale you've
given us today. But if I take a longer view and I look at the past 10 plus years, you've had something like three
restructurings. We've had Eastern Europe, Mexico and Japan issues. U.S. business has clearly struggled, arguably fallen
off a cliff. We've had some Venezuela aggressiveness I'd argue, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is still an issue. China
growth issues, free cash flow productivity issues, clearly increased competition from traditional CPG companies, and
the list goes on and on and on.
Not to mention your GAAP EPS is the same as it was in 2003. When do you in the aggregate, think that this is actually
a structurally-challenged company? Not just a set of one-time issues that can be explained away? And if this is not a
structurally challenged – systematically structurally challenged company, what does a structurally challenged company
look like?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that the structurally
challenged question, I think if you look, and the answer is different obviously by market. But let's just take, again as I
said this morning, two of our important growth assumed drivers going into the medium to long term. You know brand
health erosion, consumer perception changes, market share losses over extended periods of time. That to me would be
structural challenges in the developing and emerging markets. A China business model, which has had constraints
because of government regulations, the only regulated market that we have. A China business model that I think gives
attractive earnings. Once we get through this transition that does not gain share over the medium to long term because
there are other factors.
At that point, I would say that you have a structurally challenged model, way too early to call because I think we're
doing the right things. So those would by my answers, Ali, that I think numbers are the numbers. Sustained share loss
over a period of time says you have structural issues in the developing and emerging markets, in spite of what we're
spending. And so I don't think we would deny that. But I really don't believe we are anywhere near that point. I think,
again, there's strong brand health and I don't want to beat a dead horse, and I am not happy about it from the execution

And albeit and I think there has been a lot of dialogue and conversations and we've had it with many of you over the
last several quarters, as it relates to competitive pressures, and I absolutely agree that BRIC markets in Brazil and
Russia are huge intensified spending targets for lots and lots of companies. But having said that, the share that we have

distribution capacity increases and/or brands and channel investments, are the right things to do for this business to

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty [BMO Capital Markets (United States).] Please state your
affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Constance Maneaty>: Good morning. Would you tell us what the operating margin target is for management
compensation? And if you don't give it on the call today will it be in the proxy? That's the first question.
Second question relates to the prior one, but maybe asked a little bit differently. There have been executional issues in
many markets over time. There was Mexico with the old fundamentals and then North America and now Brazil and
Russia. And every time we hear about these you're always putting your best people into these circumstances to execute
a turnaround. But from your point of view, what needs to happen internally so you don't have execution issues? So that
you're able to deal with whatever the local government changes without it upending results for a quarter or more?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: In terms of the operating margin-specific
targets, again, it's just been confirmed with the Compensation Committee, is to go into the proxy, but I think it will
detail the commitment to the mid-teens by 2013. I don't think we're going to disclose annual absolute what our base is
and mid teens is the absolute number that's going to be in the final year 2013. So, every year builds towards that. So
that's operating margin.
And in terms of execution, as I said and I'll just go back to Brazil for one second, the complete focus on the execution
of those things, which do retire legacy systems, do expand the infrastructure so it does not have that capacity constraint,
which is a combination of the manufacturing capacity, the new distribution facility, as well as again, an order
management solution. So it's not just for Brazil, but for the entire company, a global order management solution over
the next couple of years, as well as the finishing up of the ERP installation worldwide, with the JD Edwards solution,
are the important aspects that, again from an enterprise point-of-view, allow us not to have that stress.

And your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: It's Stifel Nicolaus, and good morning, everyone. Just one follow-up on Brazil and then one
other question. Were the sales – can you comment on the sales trends or volume trends sequentially in the quarter, in
the fourth quarter, month-by-month, just based on some of what you had talked about in terms of the issues in the
quarter? And then, unrelatedly, just back on the question about long-term growth. Given Direct Selling category trends
and Personal Care category trends, particularly in emerging markets, shouldn't sales growth be at least a
mid-single-digit level? Which I think you've even referred to in the past in terms of your overall growth. And then
related to that, how doesn't the decision to invest less, hurt that long-term algorithm?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well I think that given the weaker
momentum coming out of the year, the full-court press but some time needed that I think the mid-single-digits as
opposed to at least just giving how we ended and how, as we've come out of 2010 made sense. In terms of the Brazil
sales trends, the demand sales actually were even and we saw some higher than third quarter, believe it or not, demand
growth in some of the campaigns in the fourth quarter. It was the filling of those orders that was the issue, not the

actual demand in terms of sequential 3Q to 4Q. Or even 2Q to 3Q to 4Q, I think I showed you that.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: Let me just add a little bit on the
growth question you asked because I think it was also was longer term in nature and you're correct. The Beauty
category is an advantaged category, the channel is advantaged in the emerging and developing markets. So as you look
at the business, I can see where you would want to come to a conclusion that the overall growth has an opportunity to
be stronger than perhaps what we declared. But that's what we're going to comp the business to. And that's how we're
going to think about our infrastructure and think about moving forward.
And honestly, if the growth is better than that, we'll have – we'll be in a wonderful opportunity to make decisions about
what to do with that incremental profit.

Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley. Please state your affiliation, then state your question.
<Q - Alice Longley>: Hi. Good morning. Buckingham Research. My question's about Brazil again. Could you give us
more detail on what the real problem was? I guess you're saying it was not filling orders. What does that have to do
with the government-required e-invoices? You cited manufacturing capacity, is it that you hadn't planned well enough
for enough capacity? Is it because you didn't predict well enough exactly what people wanted? What was the real
reason you're having trouble filling orders? And how long does it take to correct that?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: I just will go back to – in some of those
things on my slides. But the capacity in the country was definitely about a year ahead of what we had projected, and we
had been working on solutions and have in place solutions for that. And what I was just saying is from manufacturing
capacity to distribution capacity, those things were all in place for 2011. In 2010, in the middle of the year, and we have
dealt with government-required changes, but this particular e-invoicing change required, did exacerbate many of our
processing issues and led to some system instability.
That system has been stabilized, but that has some de facto impact of service delays to our representatives, and outages
of products, and I quantified what those were. So, while demand remained high, we were unable to fill because our
product shorts were about three times their norm, and...
<Q - Alice Longley>: And the reason for the problem was the e-invoicing?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: E-invoicing was really the catalyst to this
issue, yes.
<Q - Alice Longley>: And are you the only company that had trouble with the e-invoicing? Or was this a widespread
problem?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think a lot of people were affected
by e-invoicing, but I can tell you that why it challenges us was a legacy system environment. If we had been ten years
old and had a different systems platform, it would have been a lot easier just to convert over. So this, I think had a
particular challenge because we're 55-plus years old in that market and have multiple legacy systems that have not
converted yet to ERP in this market, which we are planning to do.
<Q - Alice Longley>: And then, the idea is this is going to get corrected through 2011 with the new, with the better
distribution and manufacturing. How can you convince us that you're going to be able to make that massive transition,
particularly with the distribution centers, smoothly?
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Well the distribution center is already up
and we are running as Chuck mentioned, duplicative costs just to ensure that full transition, but we've been very
pleased. But as a guarantee if you would, and there will be some extra costs in the first part of 2011 just to make sure
we don't flip over to one side, but everything we'd say is pretty stable as we've cut over already in this past end of the

year, in terms of EPR. Those kind of – we are fully prepared but we're not going to do it on a non-stable environment,
so we are ready to put ERP into Brazil, but we will not do that until the environment is stable, okay, and move it to the
global solution.
And then, what we believe are the short term, as I said, system modifications and upgrades allow us to feel very
comfortable that we could get through until we go to ERP. And the Cabreúva facility I feel very confident about in
terms of moving over and shifting over to that in 2011.
<A - Charles W. Cramb, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer>: We've given ourselves
effectively 12 months to do the transition from one facility to the other. In the fourth quarter of this year, we are
shipping some of the non-Beauty business out of the new facility and we have a rolling in through the first three
quarters. By the end of the third quarter, we should be fully operational.
Somewhat conservative but given the size of the Brazilian business, given its importance, it was an area that we just
didn't feel we needed or wanted to take any risks and thus the long transition program.
<Q - Alice Longley>: Okay. Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Jason Gere [RBC Capital Markets Equity Research.] Please state your
affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Jason Gere>: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I'll just switch to maybe the U.S. a little bit. So, we've seen three
years now of declining organic sales. By our calculation, 11% organic sales in this quarter was probably the worst that
we've seen in quite some time. So, can you just give us a sense, how much increase in RVP is going to be needed to
improve the trends? The rep expectations, how are they being managed? Because the rep growth is declining too. So,
just wondering if you can give us some clarity when we should see the U.S. actually start to get better on what has been
three years of easier comps? Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, the U.S. performance did remain
pressured in 2010. I think the major challenge was anniversarying a very, very strong recruiting number in 2009. To
enhance again, the rep numbers going forward in 2011, we have shifted about $20 million. So it's not incremental, but a
shift to a significant acceleration and enhancement of sales leadership earnings to expand recruiting. So that is a very
hefty incentive. And actual enhanced earnings opportunity for the amount you can make on a recruit. As well as an
average order enhancement in the second half for more giftable programs, as well as a Mom & Baby business in this
market.
So, we have actions for increasing average order but the primary focus from an investment point of view in 2011, is to
enhance our rep growth. Okay? We do have a couple of negatives, but we hope they ease – of our macro. One is really
the U.S. Beauty growth again, was down in 2010. And that was a little bit of a headwind because we did anticipate
some modest growth in the category as we are shifting out of non-Beauty into Beauty. So, we've got short-term actions
to stabilize the revenue in 2011, enhancing all of our focus and a significant amount of money in the first half on our
sales leadership earnings expansion.
