I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.
H. Reed Nolte
Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference

Lastly, please note that our offer for Sky plc, that was announced last December, is governed by the U.K. Takeover
Code. As such, there are strict limitations as to what we can say with regard to that transaction and we are restricted to
providing information that has been publicly announced.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.
Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thanks, Reed, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. Pleasing to us as we sit here in August, that our new
fiscal year begins with real momentum. The achievements of 2017 set us up well for the next year and beyond.
In the last 12 months, we delivered 9% full-year EBITDA growth, driven by 8% global affiliate fee growth and solid
year-over-year growth of 5% in global advertising revenues. As you know, the last few years we have focused our
investments on our core video brands. This has proven to be the right strategy, and as a result, these brands are
experiencing robust domestic affiliate fee gains, reaching 10% for the most recent quarter.
And while it's true the broader industry lost approximately 2% of subscribers over the last year, we have maintained
our aggregate subscriber level. This includes subscriber additions from all of the emerging DMVPD products,
including from the newest launches, YouTube TV and Hulu Live, as well as growth in our younger channels. We are
excited by the progress of this new marketplace and believe advances in the viewing experience and increased value to
customers will provoke further innovation across all platforms and distributors and underscores the core pay-TV bundle
as the best video proposition for customers.
Creatively as well, 2017 has been a year of achievement for our teams. Our television studio produced number one
shows on five networks, including the biggest new hit of the season, This is Us. And was also a key contributor to Fox
Broadcasting having its highest number of returning shows in a decade, a positive for both businesses. Feud and Legion
reinforced FX Network's position as a creative leader, highlighted this year – this past year by the most Emmy wins
ever for a basic cable channel. James will talk later about how we plan to leverage FX's creative success. At our film
studio, Logan and Hidden Figures exceeded expectations, while serving as great examples of the benefit of original
storytelling.
In News, the Fox News Channel was the most watched cable network for the last 12 months, during which it achieved
its highest rated quarter ever in 24-hour viewership. We believe that as time shifted on-demand and ad-free viewing
continue to grow in popularity, our strength in live news and sports globally is a great advantage. News and sports, the
least likely programming to be watched delayed, comprised more than half of our advertising revenues. In fact, network
entertainment programming, while important, accounts for less than 3% of our total revenue.
Underpinning our momentum is a keen focus on our organization. With an eye to the future, we have evolved the
leadership at our Film business, at Fox News and at our national ad sales organization, and have brought in a small
handful of senior executives at the corporate level to ensure we empower our businesses globally with the best talent
and technology to drive us forward, especially in this time of transformation and opportunity.
We ended fiscal 2017 in a strong position by any measure. But importantly, the work we achieved last year, including
completing key long-term programming and affiliate deals, provides us with a superb platform for the new fiscal year
and for the longer-term.
And with that, I'll hand it over to John.
John P. Nallen
Great. Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. And as Lachlan said, we are very pleased with the overall financial results
for the full fiscal year, and I'll start my comments there, followed by more specific comments on the fourth quarter.

Total full-year revenues were $28.5 billion, up 4% over last year, led by an 8% increase in worldwide affiliate
revenues, and a 5% increase in advertising revenue. Total full-year segment EBITDA was $7.17 billion, up 9% over
last year, led by strong growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments. Overall, unfavorable foreign
currency rates reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $105 million and our growth rate by two percentage
points. Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $3 billion this year, or $1.61 per
share, while adjusted EPS was $1.93 this year, up 12%.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 2% over last year, led by double-digit growth at our Cable
Network segment, partially offset by reduced revenues at both the Television and Film segments. Total segment
EBITDA of $1.45 billion was equal to last year's result, as strong gains at our Cable Networks were offset by lower
Television and Film contributions. From a bottom-line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.27, while adjusted EPS was
$0.36, down from a comparable $0.45 last year, which, as you will probably remember, included a tax benefit of $0.07
per share from a favorable ruling we received.
Now, let me provide some added context on the fourth quarter performance at our operating segments, starting with the
Cable Network segment where we had very strong results, with total segment EBITDA of $1.44 billion, 19% higher
than last year, on revenue growth of 10%. Domestic cable revenue increased 10%, driven by accelerated affiliate fee
growth of 10% and strong advertising growth of 6%. The affiliate fee growth was supported by the renewal of two
major affiliate agreements and the advertising growth primarily reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 22%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by modestly
higher programming costs at both the FX Networks and National Geographic. Fourth quarter reported international
cable revenues increased 11%, driven by 9% growth in affiliate revenue and 9% increase in advertising revenues,
which was led by STAR's current-year broadcast of the ICC Cricket Champions Trophy. Reported international
EBITDA increased 6% over last year as higher contributions from FNG International were partially offset by reduced
contributions from STAR due to the expected higher Champions Trophy costs.
Now turning to our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA of $137 million was 5% below last year, as a 4%
decline in revenues was partially offset by a similar percent decline in expenses. Lower advertising revenues from
lower prime-time ratings including comping against the final season of American Idol and a softer, local advertising
market were partially offset by continued double-digit growth in retransmission consent revenue.
At the Film segment, we faced difficult comparisons to a year ago. This quarter we reported an EBITDA loss of $22
million versus $164 million in profits a year ago. This quarter included significant releasing costs for our summer
movie slate, including War for the Planet of the Apes and Alien: Covenant, whereas last year we had very substantial
contributions from Deadpool and The Martian and significantly higher pay-TV avails from the timing of prior releases.
Additionally, this year we had lower TV library contributions from international markets.
So, all in all, a strong earnings quarter and year and equally strong cash flow generation for the year, where we
delivered $3.4 billion in cash from operations, less CapEx, a 22% increase over a year ago. And from a capital
standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $6.2 billion in cash and approximately $20 billion in debt. Our capital
allocation priority continues to be focused on funding the Sky acquisition.
So as we look to fiscal 2018, there are several items worth drawing attention to on which we have visibility. Hopefully,
you noticed that we achieved virtually all of the metrics provided for fiscal 2017, and we'd like to again provide a
framework for this fiscal year. At our Cable Networks, the momentum seen in this past quarter will carry into fiscal
2018. We expect every quarter in fiscal 2018 will show at least high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth and our
confidence in this, our largest revenue stream, is underpinned by locked-in contracts. Internationally, we're expecting
strong total revenue growth, driven by STAR advertising increases, where we'll continue to generate market-leading
organic ad growth, we'll lap the impact of the demonetization policy, and we'll hit the $500 million EBITDA milestone.
On the Cable Network cost side, we're expecting roughly mid-single-digit expense growth from our core operations. In
addition, we'll welcome two new sports agreements to our roster, specifically the Big Ten and the Argentine Football
Association, as well as broadcasting the next cycle of the World Cup, which will bridge fiscal 2018 and 2019. These

new sports events are expected to increase total expense growth to the high single-digit range.
And for completeness, we'll have a matching gross-up in expenses and content revenues owing to the accounting
treatment of the new Big Ten contract where we'll sub-license certain events to third parties. While this has no impact
on net earnings, it will inflate segment reported expense growth by about 2 percentage points.
At the Television segment, we'll have unusual advertising revenue comparisons from several events that either don't
recur in fiscal 2018 or that we're just not expecting at the same level. Notably, we're not broadcasting the Super Bowl in
fiscal 2018. We'll have one less additional NFL divisional playoff game, and it's an off-cycle political year.
Additionally, we're not expecting an epic seven-game World Series, nor any local station revenue from spectrum use,
both of which we had in fiscal 2017.
We will continue to have double-digit re-transmission consent growth and the ad revenue impact of the new sporting
events. Segment expenses are expected to be flat over the prior year as low-single-digit core growth plus the increases
from the new World Cup and Big Ten broadcasts offset the absence of the Super Bowl.
At our Film segment, we have a promising lineup of television series and film releases, where we end the fiscal year
with the release of Deadpool 2 in early June. Additionally, this segment will see the inaugural investments into mobile
game development, following our acquisition of Aftershock. And, finally, below the line, we expect our reported tax
rate to remain in the low-30% range.
And with that, over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. So fiscal 2017, as you've heard, finished well and
we've made progress on multiple fronts. So as John just mentioned, while we benefited from a number of notable
events in the year, we nonetheless expect the underlying velocity to continue. But I'd like to talk with you for a few
minutes on the direction of the company and the potential to create what we think is really incredible value here as we
enter a new year and look ahead considerably farther than that.
As we simplified our business, focused on these core brands and creative output, and directed all of our enterprise to
those things, we've started to see good results. As we've described earlier, this has been about aligning the company
around the future of video. The underlying changes of universal connectivity, the proliferation of connected displays,
and the potential for unfettered access to these creative assets for customers globally are what make possible the
acceleration and expansion of engagement with our customers.
From Hotstar in India to Hulu Live and Sky GO and Sky Q, we've never been able to reach customers in as diverse,
flexible and rewarding a fashion as we can now. This is, of course, just the beginning. We've got great confidence in
the future of this Video business for us.
Our commitment to making our programming more available and not less, combined with the increased and sustained
investment in extraordinary storytelling, manifests everywhere in the business. Domestically, the new digital MVPD
market has already delivered an aggregate 2-plus-million subscribers, set new benchmarks in user experience and
packaging innovation, and I'm convinced will prove to be a great catalyst to increased and accelerated innovation in the
sector. And whenever that happens, that means growth is coming.
This week, we announced FX+. Comcast XFINITY will offer an on-demand, ad-free viewing experience with
unfettered access to more than 30 current and back library FX and FXX originals for just $5.99 a month. And earlier
this year, we overhauled our authenticated FOX NOW app, available in more than 90 million households domestically.
In Europe, Asia and Latin America, we've introduced FOX+ and FOX Premium, a non-linear access to programming
and a digital live experience that is second to none. And Hotstar set the pace for the streaming market in the world's
fastest growing economy, crossing 1 billion minutes of watch time in a single day during the fourth quarter. So as you
can see, the transformation of the company is not only well underway but is gaining pace.

In 2017, across the whole business, the team delivered against almost every metric we established for ourselves. And,
importantly, this sets us up for greater velocity across the business, especially in the key areas of affiliate revenues, how
we license our brands, and how we shape new experiences for customers and shape this company to create
extraordinary value.
Before turning it over to questions, I'd like to quickly touch upon the Sky transaction. The transaction has been cleared
in all of its markets, except for the U.K., where the process is still underway, and where the U.K. regulator Ofcom
concluded that the concessions we offered mitigated its plurality concerns and further was unequivocal about our
commitment to broadcasting standards. We remain confident our transaction will be approved, but more likely in the
first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you have. So thanks.
H. Reed Nolte
Thank you, James. Operator, we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community now.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you. Lachlan, you said that the core bundle is the best video platform for
consumers, which we would not argue with. And James discussed FX+ being available through Comcast and
supporting the bundle with that, and the enhanced app et cetera. Could you comment on some of the announcements
over the last few days by your competitors with these direct-to-consumer offerings, how you expect that to affect the
overall bundle?
And then the second question, which is completely different. But you've made some announcements on advertising
loads and advertising – the amount of time the ads will be. Can you just talk about your overall advertising strategy?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Sure. James, you and I, can both tackle these questions. Hi, Jessica.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Hi.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Hi. So when we talk about the core bundle, we're fundamentally talking about an
offering that allows the consumer to have the highest amount of viewing for the brands and the programing that they
want to engage with for the lowest possible price. So as you can see across all the emerging DMVPDs, we've been
included – our brands have been included in these core bundles. Having said that, I think it's not mutually exclusive
that you can launch a more highly sort of a refined bundle within that. So for instance for us, with FX+, is also a service
which will offer much of the same programming on FX, it's in the core bundle, but in a way that's direct-to-consumer in
a beneficial way.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yes. I think, Jessica, look I think it's very clear that bundling – we all know this, it
drives consumption up and pricing down. So it could be real positive for customers. And it's very much in line, we're
trying to make our products more available, and not less. I think Lachlan is right, it's not mutually exclusive to say that
other kinds of bundles and other kinds of packaging are going to live alongside that for certain customer who want it in
a different way.
So I think this is all part and parcel that we've been talking about for a while with you, which is the downstream retail
market for television is becoming much, much more competitive, and that's driving innovation both in terms of
customer experience as well as packaging innovation. With some narrow bundles and some wider ones.

We have really been focusing on the customer experience, on how we build these products and how we license our
content and brands into third-party products. But also, we remain very open minded about an independently priced
direct-to-consumer offering as well. And we're certainly mindful of what we're seeing in the marketplaces, and we're
mindful of how these things are progressing for some other firms out there as they experiment with packaging as well.
One thing we've found around the world with bundling digital products, be it at Sky GO and NOW TV or at Hotstar, is
that constant iterations and constant innovation and experimentation with packaging is really beneficial and to be able
to do that at a high pace is the best way to build our business and find the best combination. And also your question
about ad strategy?
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Yes.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: So because there's no fundamental change in the way people are consuming our
products, we now see less than – and this has been true, actually, for a couple of years and we've talked about it before
– less than 50% of the viewing on our entertainment programming, less than 50% is viewed live. And a growing
amount is viewed, obviously, on our own apps and a slightly shrinking amount is viewed on a sort of delayed sort of
non-streaming DVRs and whatnot.
So within this environment, we've achieved a lot of success in terms of streaming advertising and nonlinear advertising.
I think this past year alone, our nonlinear advertising has grown by 30%. And within that our advanced advertising
products revenue has grown by 40%, which is something that's really pleasing to us.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Yes. That's right. I mean fundamentally these streaming platforms – and as streaming
consumption becomes the primary way that people consume content, which we think will happen over time, as a
fundamentally better ad products and a fundamentally better platform for us to monetize these brands and these
investments that we're making either by pricing them innovatively to customers or by creating new ad products that are
priced at a premium with respect to targeting capability, but also create a better ad experience for customers with fewer
interruptions, shorter formats and the like.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Absolutely.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question is from Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hi. I just wanted to ask you a question about reverse retrans. You think – John, as you
were going through numbers, it's pretty clear that retrans is an increasingly important part of the broadcast TV revenue
growth story. And so reverse retrains, obviously, gets even more important as you move forward. And you all appear
quite interested in a transaction with Blackstone Group that was talked about in the press that you would have
essentially acquired Tribune, and it didn't pan out.
But I just wonder as you think strategically about Fox's positioning and Fox's future, is owning less of more in the TV
station business attractive to Fox, especially if you could dramatically increase your share of reverse retrans dollars and
have more control over how your affiliates negotiate digital rights and retrans, et cetera? Overall, I'm just fascinated by
the potential of an ION transaction. I'm just wondering how aggressively you're pursuing that?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Rich. It's James here. Look, obviously we can't comment on any kind of
speculation about hypothetical kind of corporate activity that's going on. But I would just say that, look, we think that
the retrans environment is very attractive going forward. We think that fundamentally the broadcast networks and

broadcast stations with the strength in sports and reach and all the things that are there, are delivering a lot of value to
distributors, and there's a lot to play for in terms of retrans, both reverse retrans from our non-O&O affiliates as well as
our O&O group.
And I think fundamentally, we're just very pleased with the position we have right now. We look at it; we think we
have a lot of options. We have a number of affiliation agreements coming up shortly and over the next couple of years.
And we're very, very focused on the best way to really maximize any advantage that we can get for the business going
forward.
So that's really all I would say about it. Yes, we're very focused on it, and we think it's a big opportunity for us.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Rich. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question is from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: Yes. Thanks. Two for me, both on the Cable Network side of things. Maybe first, I think you've
suggested in the past that there may be a possibility to swap some of your international cricket rights throughout the
course of fiscal 2018. So I was wondering, if you can give us an update on what that status would look like? And if you
do decide to move the rights, does it change the $500 million EBITDA target or the cost growth guidance that you gave
earlier?
And then separately, I was wondering, if you can just update us on what the sub picture has looked like recently for the
RSNs? Is sub growth there in-line with the number that you gave earlier, or any divergence there versus your more
general Cable Networks? Thanks.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Thanks, Steven. On the cricket rights, look, we have a really strong portfolio of
cricket rights. And I assume you're asking just about India. And it's been performing very well for us. From
time-to-time, new rights are available in the market, and I would just say to you that the Star Sports cricket portfolio is
very strong right now. If we could really strengthen it, we'd love to do so, but we'd be very disciplined about that. And
we certainly don't want to do things that are going to make a problem in terms of our near-term and longer-term goals
for the business.
So as John mentioned earlier in his comments, we're well on track for our targets in India of $500 million of profit – of
EBITDA next year and thereafter. So no, we don't have any plans to do anything complicated with cricket rights that
would jeopardize that, although when we see any new rights come up, we approach them in a disciplined way and in a
way that we think is going be – end up the best thing for our customers and for the business.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And then in terms of the regional sports networks' subscriber numbers, it's important
to remember that we've been able to achieve our regional sports networks' inclusion in all of the emerging DMVPDs as
they're critical viewing for most viewers. And so as such, I think the subscriber numbers are down very slightly, sort of
less than 0.5%.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: Thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you very much, Steven. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
That will come from Mike Nathanson with Moffett. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have two; one on SVOD and one on Hulu. Can you just give an update on
your latest thinking on SVOD strategy? A couple of weeks ago, you moved some content from Netflix to Hulu, and

then, as you said, you rolled out a new service with Comcast with a deep library. Is that content going to be exclusive to
FX+? And should we worry that there will be an air pocket in SVOD in the coming year?
And then on Hulu, it's early days but anything you could share about what surprised you so far as the product's been
rolled out?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Look, I think the SVOD marketplace is a really interesting one. We continue to see a
competitive marketplace for product there, but we also want to make sure that we're licensing things in a way that's
consistent with our strategy of making things – say it again – more available and not less. So monolithic, global
exclusive deals with Netflix are troublesome with that strategy.
And we think that there's a broader marketplace for us to license into. Hulu's a very attractive customer and partner of
ours and as are some of the other emerging players out there, as well as figuring out and really building businesses to
monetize some of those rights ourselves. For example, with the FX+ premium service.
So I think it's going be a mix. I don't anticipate the sort of so-called air pocket as you talk about. We are very, very
intent and very far along on really optimizing the monetization and the maximization of the reach as well as profit
potential for our shows and all of our partners who make them with us.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think it's important to remember as well that the Hulu deal that we just made is on a
nonexclusive basis. Some of that programming – there's about 3,000 hours of programming – some of that
programming was exclusive on Netflix but is now nonexclusive on Hulu. And we want that product in as many places
and distributed by as many people as possible.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And then with respect to the Hulu service, I think it's really a question more for them
but I guess they don't report like this. So you're out of luck. But I would just encourage – it's very, very early days but I
just think as a customer looking at the marketplace right now, I just think it's an incredibly exciting time, right? You
have great pricing, great new product. I think YouTube TV is tremendous. I think the Hulu Live product is really
setting a new benchmark in terms of user experience. And I think it's a really interesting time for innovation in the
marketplace. I really think it's just the last few months where we've seen these new products hit the market and they're
really setting the bar very high. And that's a great thing for customers and it's a great thing for creators and content
makers that can gain access to those platforms.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question, please?

We go now to Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Hi. Thanks. I guess two thematic questions. One, do you consider the value of a virtual
MVPD sub to be equivalent to a traditional MVPD sub for Fox? I think a lot of investors are worried that either there'll
be fewer networks on virtual MVPDs or the churn will be higher or the business model's unsustainable and that we
should sort of in our minds discount a virtual sub versus traditional sub.
And separately, just curious about how – you mentioned how news and sports is such an important part of the
programming strategy for Fox. Any thoughts about competitive positioning as either you have the potential for
companies to think about launching a news competitor in the United States with a similar conservative focus as Fox
News or digital companies coming after sports rights at some point in the future, maybe the next cycle. Any thoughts
on that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: So first, on the digital MVPDs and the value per subscriber in a, what you called, a
virtual or digital MVPD versus a traditional MVPD. Certainly, on paper, our subscribers' deals are more valuable.
Significantly more valuable on the digital MVPD than in a traditional MVPD. We're extracting more per subscriber in
every way.

Also, an additional on that, we share more data or we get more data shared with us, which allows us to monetize the
advertising significantly better as well. You mentioned churn, I think it's early days to know what churn's going to be
like in these services and presumably some distributors will manage their churn better than others.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think it's worth pointing out that not all of our affiliate agreements are necessarily
the same. So amongst the traditional MVPDs, there are some that we would much prefer to steal customers from other.
So it's not – as these things develop, you're always kind of playing that game. And as you go along with these renewals
and these renewal cycles that are not all coming up at the same time, different terms and different opportunities emerge.
I think Lachlan's right. I mean in every way, the digital MVPD customer and partnership is one that is – can be more
valuable and should be over time. I think that the flexibility it gives us for packaging and pricing and advertising
innovation is tremendous.
And so we find it – we think it's a very, very attractive new entrant category in the marketplace. Much as Fios and
U-verse were when they first entered the market, as well as when folks started licensing more broadly to KU-band DBS
satellite back in the day. So new choice and new competition has always been great for the content business, but you
have to invest in the content in a concentrated way to really make it work and make sure that you're desired and a key
part of those so-called bundles, which is a segue into your second question.
Look, the content marketplace is incredibly competitive and it always has been. The news marketplace is
super-competitive right now, and I anticipate it's going to continue to be. I think you already see so much news
consumption in the digital world as well. And all news channels have to deal with that and try to put something
together that's really going matter for their viewers and that they're going to care about.
And sports competition has always been very, very intense. We've seen multiple rights-holders around the world selling
to new entrants and new categories of rights out there. And that's something that we deal with everywhere, from the
Netherlands to Argentina and in the U.S. And I think digital entrants are a certainty in that marketplace, but that doesn't
mean that new entrants are necessarily any less or more rational than existing competitors.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Doug. Operator, can we have the next question, please?

Next up is Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Mr. Morris, your line is open. Apologies. Next we'll go
to Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian W. Wieser>: Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, I was wondering what your current thoughts
are on the strategy of maintaining minority stakes in a number of other entities, Vice and other – China, et cetera. And
separately, I also thought I'd get your take on the current state of the overall advertising economy. It feels that on
average it's slightly negative. You've got a good balance of properties, so I'd be curious to hear your take on that.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Look, with respect to minority investments that we make from time to time, it's
clearly not something that – but frankly, that we do very often. We generally look at minority stakes and investment
there as both either opportunistic, where we think there's a new category or brand or something that's going be
successful, that there's opportunities to work together with them as well, and there might be a small investment or an
investment that goes along with that.
But also, I think we look at it over time and say, well, you know, what's the – how do we exit those? Can we create a
return around those? So it's a mix. We have an investment, as you mentioned, in Vice, which we're excited about. We
think that's a great company and is doing really well. We also have investments in some virtual reality innovators,
where a minority was available and a partnership could be struck, and we think we can learn and build capabilities
amongst ourselves and create value on both sides. Roku, I think, is another good example of that.
So, there's been a variety of places where that's been effective. But it's not a – we don't have sort of approach to it as a
venture capital operation like some other firms in our space do. It's more opportunistic, and we try to do it less often

because we really like to keep our business simple. And we like to keep it straightforward, as we've discussed, and
we've really made a lot of progress on that over the last number of years. But sometimes it is the way, the way things
work. Tata Sky is another good example where, from a regulatory perspective, we couldn't own more of it than a
certain amount, but we think it's really important to drive that business forward and great for the Indian television
marketplace and for our business there. So it's a mixed set of rationale but something that we would generally prefer to
focus on our core operations than an investment portfolio.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: No, I totally agree with James. You guys are the best investors, and for us, it's got to
be strategic if we're going to have a minority interest somewhere.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Brian, thank you for your question. Operator, at this point, we are out of time and would like to
conclude our call.
