And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Fairbank. Rich?
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. Capital One earned just over $1 billion, or $1.94 per share in the second
quarter. Pre-provision earnings for the quarter were $3.3 billion. And we continued to deliver year-over-year loan and
revenue growth across our businesses.
As we discussed last quarter, we continue to expect domestic charge-off rates for full year 2017 to be in the high 4s to
around 5%. We continue to expect full-year efficiency ratio for the total company to be in the 51s, net of adjusting
items and plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. And while the margin for error remains tight, based on what
we see today, we remain well-positioned to deliver 7% to 11% growth in EPS in 2017, net of adjusting items. All of
our guidance excludes the potential impact of the Cabela's transaction.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss second quarter results for the company. Scott?
R. Scott Blackley
Thanks, Rich. I'll begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned 1 billion or $1.94 per share in the second quarter. In
the quarter, we recognized 12 million of non-interest expenses related to our anticipated close of the Cabela's
transaction. Excluding these costs, earnings per share was $1.96. We will continue to break out future deal and
integration costs, as well as the initial allowance build associated with the onboarding of the Cabela's asset. The closing
of this transaction is still pending regulatory approval.
Pre-provision earnings increased 6% on a linked quarter basis as we recognized higher revenues and lower non-interest
expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased 10% on a linked quarter basis as higher charge-offs, primarily in our
Commercial Banking business, were more than offset by lower linked quarter allowance builds. We have provided an
allowance roll-forward by business segment, which can be found on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.
Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our Domestic Card
business, we built $155 million of allowance in the quarter. Two primary factors drove that build: balance growth in the
quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs.
Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased by $36 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to
our Auto business, where we build allowance for new originations. In the second quarter, we had about a 40-basis-point
impact to our auto charge-off rate from the initial effect of accounting changes in the timing of charge-offs, which I've
discussed over the last couple of quarters in our calls. Beginning in the third quarter and continuing throughout 2018,
we expect these accounting changes to increase to annualized charge-off rates by 15 basis points to 20 basis points,
after which the effect begins to reverse over time.
Lastly, we had a $4 million release in reserves in our Commercial Banking segment as we released reserves associated
with loans that moved to charge-offs, which was partially offset by reserve builds primarily focused in our taxi
medallion business.
Turning to slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin was flat for the first quarter at 6.9%, and it was up 15
basis points on a year-over-year basis, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business and higher rates.

Turning to slide 5, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced, following the Federal Reserve's conditional
non-objection to our 2017 CCAR plan, our board has authorized repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of common stock
through the end of the second quarter of 2018, and we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share,
which is subject to board approval.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.7%, which reflects current phase-ins.
On a Standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.6%.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide 9 with second quarter results for our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and
purchase volume growth decelerated in the quarter but remained strong. Compared to the second quarter of last year,
our ending loans grew $4.3 billion, or about 5%. Average loans were up $5.8 billion, or about 7%. Second quarter
purchase volume increased about 7% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% from the prior year, in
line with average loan growth. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. Non-interest expense increased about 3%
compared to the prior-year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency.
The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.11%, and the 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end was 3.63%. Both metrics
were down a few basis points from the sequential quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, both metrics
were higher, as expected.
The impact of growth math remains largely in line with our expectations. As a reminder, growth math is defined as the
upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger
proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. We continue to expect the
impact of growth math will moderate in the second half of 2017 with a small tail beyond 2017. As growth math runs its
course, we believe that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry factors.
Slide 10 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 5%
year-over-year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about
6% year-over-year, with a 4-basis-point increase in deposit rate paid.
Compared to the second quarter of 2016, auto originations were up 14% to $7.5 billion with strong growth in prime,
near prime, and subprime. As we discussed last quarter, competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace remains a
bit muted, which continues to contribute to our growth. While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth,
there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry, including expected declines in auction prices and in increasingly
indebted consumer.
Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices, and we've dialed back on some less resilient programs even as
our overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase
gradually and that growth will moderate.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 9% from the second quarter of last year, driven by growth
in auto loans as well as deposit pricing and volumes. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to
the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in marketing. Second quarter provision for credit
losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses
for the auto portfolio.
Moving to slide 11, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 2%
year-over-year and average loans increased 4%. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our
capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 9% compared to the second quarter of 2016.
Non-interest expense was up 11%, primarily as the result of growth, technology, investments, and other business
initiatives.

Provision for credit losses increased from the second quarter of last year, driven by charge-offs in the oilfield services
and taxi medallion portfolios. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 80 basis points. Criticized and non-performing
loans rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The Commercial Bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter
was 3.9% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 1.0%. Credit pressures continued to be focused in the oilfield
services and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves, and other metrics for
these portfolios on slides 16 and 17.
I'll close tonight with a summary of key second quarter themes. Capital One continued to post solid year-over-year
growth in loans, deposits, revenues, and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage costs and improve
efficiency even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation. And we continued to carefully manage risk
across all our Consumer and Commercial Banking businesses.
Based on what we see today, we are affirming our guidance for full year 2017 Domestic Card charge-off rate, total
company efficiency ratio, and growth in EPS. All of our guidance is net of adjusting items and the potential impact of
Cabela's.
As Scott mentioned, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR process in the quarter. Our capital plan received a
conditional non-objection, which requires us to resubmit a revised capital plan by December 28. We will resubmit our
capital plan and are fully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve's concerns with our capital planning process in a
timely manner.
[ph] Pulling up (13:05), we continue to be struck by the amount of change that's coming in the marketplace and the
opportunity to capitalize on that. We have invested heavily in transforming our company and driving growth
opportunities. We are well on our way to rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture, and
along the way, we are redesigning how we work. We are delivering resilient growth across our businesses. We are
driving improving efficiency, and we are building an enduring customer franchise. We continue to be in a strong
position to deliver attractive growth and returns as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.
Jeff Norris
Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask

[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good evening. Just wanted to ask about the vintages that you're seeing and the loss trends within
the card vintages. I know you had indicated last quarter that your updated charge-off expectations incorporate your
expectation for losses in the 2016 vintage to be on par with 2015. Is that still the case, or are you seeing any changes to
that? Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Hey, John, our expectations are the same, 2016 vintage on par with 2015 vintage.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. Thanks.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Do you have a follow-up?

<Q - John Pancari>: Yes.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Okay.
<Q - John Pancari>: A follow-up to that was on the auto front. I know you had indicated that you do expect
charge-offs in the auto book to increase moderately over time, just consistent with the general pressure you're seeing in
the business. Can you just help quantify the pace or help quantify that, what you mean by moderately there? And then
also, are you providing at a higher level at this point, given the worsening severities as used car values have pulled
back?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: John, why don't I start on the back end of that question and turn it over to Rich. So in terms
of our allowance process, we've been assuming kind of used car prices to fall and to continue to fall. So we have
already been building that into our allowance, and I think that that's something that we would expect to continue.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: John, relative to the charge-off outlook, you could go back and it's probably for the last
three years, I've been saying, that we expect charge-offs to gradually increase in the auto business, and we're saying it
again. And the reason for that is the same reason that's driven this conversation over these years, which is off of an
exceptionally low base of charge-offs, the phenomenon of normalization, we have fully expected.
Now the interesting thing is Capital One's charge-offs that we have posted over time, in general haven't gone up in that
way, and there've been a couple of things going on there. The biggest thing has been sort of a gradual mix shift. Market
in that sense, particularly the higher growth that we've gotten at the higher end of the market, has sort of offset that
effect. But beneath it all, if we look at the things like the subprime business, there has been some gradual normalization
going on. It's a natural phenomenon. Probably all-in-all, the amount of normalization has not been as high as we have
ourselves internally forecasted because we've been pretty cautious about what we expect with respect to used car prices,
and frankly some of the competitive dynamics in the auto business, I think, have kind of helped in competitive meaning
the easing of some of the competition, particularly on the subprime side, I think, has eased things.
So if we look in hindsight at this three- or four-year period while we've been raising our estimate for losses, we think
there's been a lot of value creation there, good opportunities for growth. The business is in a bit of an odd place with
some easing competitive intensity, but still, the other dynamics that are associated with increasing potential for risk,
things like used cars, but all-in-all, there's a good opportunity right now, but I think you should expect losses will
gradually go up over time.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Jeff Norris>: You there, Ryan? Ryan, I think we'll have to come back to you. Let's go to the next question,
please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Great. Rich, you talked a little about credit in the credit card business. Can you talk a
little bit about the competitive environment from a growth perspective? I mean, we've seen a number of the large banks
are starting to actually show some growth acceleration. And so, what are you kind of looking at that's different and kind
of how do you see that playing out over the next year?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, I mean, Moshe, first of all, we believe the opportunity to grow continues in the
card business. What I would say is the exceptional opportunity has mostly run its course and now there's a more –

there's just a good opportunity. Let's talk about the exceptional opportunity for a second. While a lot of people were not
– they weren't as heavily marketing and not as seeing the growth opportunity that we saw, we pretty much captured
several years of outsized growth, and I think that has served us very well even though we all know, of course, the
upfront cost of that in terms of credit and allowance have been a little rough on the P&L.
What I think has happened over time – the competition is definitely intensified but it's not irrational. So let's talk about
it at a couple of levels. First of all, where the competition is most obvious to everyone who has like a television or
anything else is in the rewards space. And it is very clear that marketing levels are up, reward levels on various cards
are up. We've not only seen several players come forward with higher things like cash card rates. One of the striking
things to me is what's happening on the co-brand side. In the process of the renewal of co-brand deals, there has been a
pretty significant cranking up of some of the rewards associated with those.
The other striking thing happening, Moshe, on the competitive front at the top of the market is the early bonus, the
giveaways associated with that. Now, that particular area we worry a lot about and we pretty much live inside the
frontier of those early bonuses only because we have so much experience over the last 20 years on what happens when
you get the hoppers, the teaser hoppers, the bonus hoppers, the various folks there. So I think we all have to keep an
eye on what happens there.
So it is clear table stakes are higher, the investment is higher, and the competition is higher at the top of the market
going after rewards. That said, we continue to be very pleased with our performance there and we continue to –
winning in that space is about sustaining investment and about winning in product, marketing, service, digital
experience, brand, there's a lot to that, but we very much note the competition, but we're all-in and we still like very
much what's going on.
The other thing I would comment though is about more the revolver side of the marketplace. I think you are seeing
more growth there, but I'd put it in the rational category. We don't see really anything going on about pricing in that
marketplace. We don't see underwriting standards being compromised. So I think it is at the more kind of normal phase
in a market which is just people stepping up and investigating more and trying to grow more. So in the context of all of
that, I think it's still a reasonably healthy card marketplace. The growth opportunity we had before is not quite what it
was, but we still like the opportunity.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Did you have a follow-up, Moshe?
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Yeah. If you just kind of extend some of that to auto, you mentioned some easing in the
subprime. Are you tilting more in that direction or more in the prime -in that business at this point?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, I think we're pursuing the same strategy that we – it's probably a big word for this,
the same approach, and underwriting standards pretty much consistently across from the top of the market through near
prime and into the part of subprime that we play as well. The point I would make is that the competitive easing is more
in the near prime and prime part of the marketplace so that therefore the opportunity for growth is a little higher there.
So it's, in a sense, same approach, same strategy, same underwriting but a little bit different market dynamics
depending on which part of the market we're talking about.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Can you hear me this time?
<A - Jeff Norris>: We got you, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay. Sorry about that. I was having headset problems. A question for Scott. Scott, you noted
that the card reserve build was for both growth and the expectation for higher charge-offs, which I'm assuming you are

trying to imply 2Q 2018 charge-offs would be above 2Q 2017. But just given everything you're seeing, competition,
vintages, what you're seeing in terms of your delinquency improvement, I guess if there was no change in the macro of
the competitive environment, any sense about how you would think about charge-offs for 2018 and/or when would you
actually expect to see charge-offs begin to level off on a year-over-year basis?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah, Ryan, thanks for the question. Look, as we said last quarter, we thought that Q1 was
the high point for reserve build in the Domestic Card portfolio. As growth math is starting to moderate through the
back end of 2017 with a tail after 2017, the effect of growth math on the allowance is no longer going to be the biggest
driving factor, and over the last couple of years that's been the really big driver.
So what I would say with the allowances, as we move through 2017, increasingly the allowance is not going to be
really driven by kind of that upward pressure of growth math that we've been talking about but is really going to be
driven by more just the overall industry factors. And where those go, I think it's something that we'll be talking about
going forward, but I don't have a forecast for you for 2018.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up. Rich, when you reiterated the EPS
guidance, 7% to 11%, you noted again that the margin of error remains tight. Can you maybe just give us a sense of
your confidence of hitting the target and what are the key swing factors at this point in time just in terms of being a
bottom of the range versus a top of the range?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, yeah, thanks, Ryan. Look, I want to start by saying that I've stepped out of my
character and you might have wondered what happened to the Rich Fairbank that you knew because you'd have to go
way back a lot of years ago to where we have given EPS guidance because, kind of to your point, I mean this is in the
end the difference of large numbers and it's subject to very big swings associated with allowance and other things that
can happen. So we generally – and I want to make sure people know that – generally don't plan to be in the EPS
guidance business.
The reason that we kind of stepped out and did that last quarter was really more to show the market that while there's a
lot of noise associated with some of these credit numbers, our story and our belief in growth math, the belief in what we
could on the efficiency ratio side, the momentum of the company, and our ability to successfully get there. I think we
felt pretty confident about that. But again, we cautioned, of course, and to your point, it's a pretty small range.
So, what are the biggest drivers of that? I mean, the biggest driver still always is credit. And in a world where
everything is on balance sheet and small changes in expectation lead to – you know this – into the whopping allowance
effects, that is certainly something that is probably at the top of the list for the biggest effect. On that one, we feel good
about the trajectory of growth math but we know that small changes can have effects. So we're certainly aware of that.
I think that is the big one. I think beyond that – I think the trajectory of our spending on things like marketing, the
seizing of growth opportunities, the timing of progress on our continuing quest for efficiency will also be factors that
play into this. And the other thing I would say, of course, that interest rates, they can always play a factor. But that's
just a little window into our own dialogue with ourselves about this. But when we look at those things, while there's
always risk associated with a guidance like this, we like our chances, we like our momentum here, and we continue to
maintain that guidance.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David Ho>: Good evening. I just wanted to circle back on underwriting standards that you may have tightened
over the past year, and in large part trying to get those vintages to perform in line with expectations. Have you seen or
have you done an additional tightening for 2017 vintages? Are you comfortable in your underwriting standards there?
Obviously, it's hard to track FICO, but in terms of the mix, has that stabilized as well?

<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, David. One thing is, of course, this is hundreds of programs we're talking about
and changes that we constantly do around the edges. But to generalize, it was around the beginning of 2016 that we
started tightening around the edges, and we talked about that, and it is that tightening that had led us to be pretty
confident that, in fact, 2016 vintage was going to come in better than 2015. You may recall we had talked about that
and certainly had early indications consistent with that. Some of the slippage in the marketplace and relative to our
expectations, these are more on par with each other.
Over the course of this journey, watching the marketplace, the competitive environment, the greater supply, and
continuing to look at all of our programs and where credit was coming in, to your question, we have continued to
tighten a bit around the edges. And important, but not only, but probably the majority contributor to our reduced growth
is just our continued tightening, and particularly the tightening that's going on is less around the origination side and
more about the size of lines and the timing of line increases under the philosophy of let's continue to really book the
customers, take advantage of the window of opportunity. In our own time, we can choose when and how much to
extend the credit lines. That's more of a kind of stored energy that we get there.
And by the way, in the marketplace, there's no doubt the marketplace has become more competitive, so that's also
contributed to our slowdown as well. But all of that said, I think that we have high expectations for 2017 coming in as a
very strong vintage.
<Q - David Ho>: Right. And as a follow-up, what kind of card growth year-over-year are you comfortable with while
still maintaining your 2017 guidance? Obviously, the [ph] non-outlook (32:26) for 2018 in terms of growth math
diminishing, is it more in line with industry growth? How do you think about kind of the range there versus kind of the
industry average growth year-over-year?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, we're specifically not giving guidance for card growth, but I think you're asking
what card growth do we need to kind of be able to maintain our EPS guidance. Were you linking those two?
<Q - David Ho>: Yeah.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, because the reason I say that is the amount of card growth is – look, I think at this
point, for the rest of the year, the amount of card growth is not that big a driver on the EPS. It'll have quite a bit of
impact on next year's EPS and other things. But across the reasonable range of card growth that we would look at for
the rest of the year, anything in that range probably wouldn't have that much impact on the EPS. Relative to next year's
card growth, we're not going to give guidance on that, but I want to come back to my point that we continue to be all-in
in terms of capitalizing on growth opportunities that are out there. The growth opportunities have gone from
exceptional to good.

And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

around the issues the Fed pointed out in the CCAR planning process. And how comfortable should we be that the
problem will be remediated?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah, hey, well, thanks for asking the question. As you might expect, we're not really in a
position to talk about kind of the Fed process around CCAR. That's all guarded by confidential supervisory information
that we're not at liberty to disclose. So the things I can tell you, if you want to have – the most that we can tell you is
really to point you to the Fed CCAR report, and they're going to give you the best description of kind of the issues that
they thought that there were. I will only just reiterate the point that Rich made, which is we are fully committed to
meeting the requirements and resubmitting our capital plan within the timeframes that the Fed has established for us.

<Q - Steven Kwok>: Got it. And then the follow-up question is just around the subprime consumer behavior. Have
you guys seen any changes around the behavior of the – of them?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I would say generally no. We certainly note that the growth in revolving debt in
subprime is higher than that in prime. By the way, the last few months, that's kind of settled down a little bit, but it's
still higher than prime. So we certainly have our eye on that. Of course, that is also in the context of coming off of a
base of a pretty big retrenchment since the Great Recession.
So we'll keep an eye on the data about the consumer, I mean, the economy metrics. But beyond that, we have not seen a
lot of behavioral change. We have talked in prior conversations about the fact that there is some normalization
generally going on in the second quarter of 2016. We saw some, as an industry effect, not just a Capital One effect, a
little gapping out of some vintage performance that all would be consistent with the marketplace moving along and
getting a little more competitive, and consumers getting a little bit more indebted. But beyond that, we haven't seen
anything unique to the subprime space, and that's why our strategy pretty much continues. We've just been a little
cautious around the edges.

And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good evening.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Hey, Betsy.
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Hi.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Two questions. One on how you're thinking about recoveries. We heard from some
others recently that there is some pressure on pricing and recoveries, and I know you're not using third parties as much
as some other folks are, but maybe you could give us a sense as to what you are seeing in the marketplace and how you
anticipate that impacting you.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Betsy, yeah, we don't sell as much of our charge-off debt as other people do, but we still
do participate in that market. But just pulling up overall on recoveries, it's interesting, recoveries, we always tend to
look at that independently of other metrics, but I've certainly seen over the years how recoveries moves in tandem with
a lot of other dynamics going on. So, for example, in this journey that we talked about of the industry's credit
normalization, some of the things were – even our own expectations about credit performance, we found things where
it came in a little higher than we had expected. Recoveries was right in there as one of the little culprits in that. So we
have seen generally some softening of recovery rates beginning in the third quarter of 2016, which continued into the
early 2017. They were stable in the second quarter, but we'll have to keep an eye on recoveries, and in many ways, I
think they will go in many ways as the overall credit marketplace goes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Thanks. And then the follow-up just on the taxi exposure. I know you've
provided us just a spreadsheet showing us the exposure, but wanted to understand how you're thinking about that, in
particular, given that the criticized performing loan rate increased quite a bit in the quarter. Does that suggest that we're
preparing to just build the reserve further as time goes on here?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah. Hey, Betsy, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. So, a couple of thoughts here. First of
all, as you know, we've been disclosing the details about this portfolio for a few years because it's been an area that we
wanted to make sure that our investors and others had a good insight into what our exposures were there. That's on
slide 17 in the materials. We've got about 580 million of taxi medallions on the balance sheet as of June 30, 17%
allowance coverage ratio. So, well provided for there.

Of that, around 530 million is New York City taxi medallions. And I think at this point it's well-understood that with
the arrival of Uber and other competition that there's a lot of pressure in the value of these medallions. And we've been
seeing that pressure actually in revenues and in cash flows for several years. And as a consequence of that, we've
actually been carrying and writing down our loans to the lower fair value or carrying value for several years. So we're
kind of well on our journey to making sure that we keep these loans at market prices.
In Q2, we had a total provision of expense on taxi of around $55 million, which was primarily charge-offs, but we also
build allowance, which was all based on kind of our view of the changes in the value of medallions that happened in
the quarter. I will tell that you I've read the comments from other banks that have come out recently. I feel very
comfortable with our marks and where we are on our portfolio. And I would just say kind of in terms of what we might
see going forward, right now we're working aggressively with our borrowers to restructure loans where possible. We're
taking steps to make sure that we're protecting our collateral. I think the allowance and our charge-off levels are
indicative of kind of where prices are today. But there's certainly a risk that if this market doesn't stabilize, that we
could be subject to further write-downs if we see kind of fair values and prices drop further south.

And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Can you remind us what percentage of the cards within your partnership business are
store-only versus also general purpose cards that have a Visa/Mastercard logo on them and can be used for out-of-store
spend? And then are you seeing any kind of difference in customer payment behavior between the cards that are good
at the partner store-only versus the cards that can be used for general purpose spending?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Hey, Bill, this is Scott. We don't actually break down in any detail kind of the partnership
book from our broader card portfolio, so that's not information that we're going to be able to provide you.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay. I guess maybe perhaps just if you could comment at a high level from your experience
whether there's any customer kind of pecking order or preference for whether they're going to pay the private label
store card first versus the general purpose card? If you can, any color on that at a high level would be helpful.
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Bill, we were not in the Great Recession. We were not big players in the partnership
business. We did an acquisition since then, but, of course, we couldn't resist but peek back and see what we could
observe in the Great Recession and under stress. Look, I carry around an intuitive view, and I certainly have not seen
anything too inconsistent with this that in general these co-brand cards – the defining thing that I would put on the
co-brand cards that have a lot of out-of-store spend and become like a primary spending vehicle, these things are top of
the line, and I think that we would believe that they would lead the league tables in terms of resilience.
We've all had a lot of conversation both in our partnership business and frankly across our whole Commercial Business
about the woes of retail and what does that mean. And I think that if you look back to the Great Recession, I think that
the private label cards did seem to get hit harder. But one thing I would say in their defense is you move from a
position of sharing economics to having the entire economics. And I still think most people are motivated by the desire
to pay off and keep a good credit record.
So, look, I carry around the intuitive belief that our private label business probably runs a little bit more risk than the
high-end co-brand programs, but that I haven't seen anything to cause us to say, that – I think we still believe in these
programs you're going to get the vast majority of customers to repay, but it certainly is a risk.

And we'll take our next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Christopher Roy Donat>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to shift a little bit to expenses. First,
with marketing, Rich, as you talked about going from an exceptional opportunity to just a good opportunity, should we
expect you to continue with sort of this level of marketing spend? Or does it get harder to attract the customers you
want now that you're no longer in the exceptional opportunity for U.S. card?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes. Well, so, a bunch of things to say to that great question. First of all, notice what we
said that our dialing back in many ways is the dialing back of growth. The slowing of growth is in many ways driven
by more conservative choices about the timing and magnitude of line increases, how much credit line is granted at the
outset, those kind of things, none of which really have anything to do with marketing.
So we continue to be all-in on the origination of accounts and I don't see any change in that. And even, by the way, in
dialing around the edges, dialing around the edges, those edges tend to be around approvals in the context of the same
marketing. It just – when we get 100 customers in there, there might be a few more percent that might not make it
through the filter kind of thing. So that is kind of point number one. The so what of which is our quest for pretty sizable
growth of accounts continues, and we feel pretty bullish about the prospects.
The other thing is – another thing that I've learned over the years of being in this business. Sometimes investors feel
like, okay, well, there's going to be less growth, therefore you don't have to spend money on marketing. Usually it
almost works sometimes the other way because other people step up, the table stakes go up, and unless we really say,
okay, in a particular segment we're just not going to compete, they'd sort of have to pay more to stay in place kind of
thing.
Now there comes a point where things get so irrational we have, from time to time, just pulled out of things. But my
point about the card business, I still would call it more – it's just something that's more competitive but generally
rational. So I think our investors should carry around the assumption that we're going to continue to be aggressive in
our marketing, and I think it's – while the marketing efficiency is compared with the last couple of years, last two or
three years that have been in the exceptional category, marketing efficiency is a little more in the "normal" category,
but we're still all-in on this marketing, and I think that will continue.
<Q - Christopher Roy Donat>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up quickly with Scott. The salaries were
down 88 million quarter-on-quarter, was there anything elevated, either in the first quarter or unusual in the second
quarter?
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah, in the first quarter we have a lot of just kind of the normal taxes and such that happens
in the first quarter where that starts to run out into the second quarter, so that just doesn't carry through. So, nothing
unusual there, and it's more or less consistent with kind of seasonal trends.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, we've had an interesting
discussion about the impact of ride share on taxi medallion prices. How do you manage risk in the auto portfolio from
ride share? You're probably in the next year or two going to start to get back a lot of cars with a ton of miles on them.
And I'm curious if that's something that you're thinking about in terms of risks or how you sort of account for that in
terms of underwriting.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Rick, look, I think you make a good point. I think there are a number of factors that
while I must admit, I don't think we have put a real focus on. I don't remember being in a meeting where we're talking
about your specific point. I think if you pull up and think about the auto business and some of the longer-term issues,
all the pressure from the tech companies on things like the ride sharing you're talking about, even looking further down

the pike at what would be the impact of all the technology changes in automobiles and in the limit, the driverless cars.
But even before the day finally comes when down the road we're all doing our work in the back seat and there's no
driver, long before that, I think we all have to be very vigilant about what is the impact of technology change. I mean,
generally, the quality of technology has sometimes allowed cars to last longer and has been a good guy in the auto
business. But the question is will there be a tipping point where the old cars just don't cut it and the new ones are so
much better.
So this, in fact – I want to pause for a second and just kind of seize the moment – that one of the things that I think
banks don't do that well – I think Capital One did not do that well on things like the Uber story – is pull way up across
all of our lending businesses and ask, what is the impact? Given that industry after industry is being revolutionized,
what is the impact, especially, I think, in the Commercial C&I business of the revolution that's going on in our client's
businesses? And if we just go and make one loan at a time and do our nice underwriting standards, we can wake up and
have a lot of rude surprises like we did in the taxi kind of business. So I don't have a great answer for your specific
question, but one of the things that we put a lot of energy into Capital One is pulling way up and instituting – not only
having the conversation, but instituting a kind of risk management process associated with the extraordinary revolution
that's happening in our industries, in our clients' industries, and in some of our core businesses. It's a great challenge.
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Rick, one other thing I would just mention, we definitely, in part of our underwriting practice
in assuming that auction prices continue to fall, is taking into account the longer lives of cars. Our allowance is only 12
months, so it certainly isn't going to capture the shift in that you're talking about in terms of ride share. But part of the
reason why we continue to really pay close to attention to auction prices is there's a variety of risk that can impact that
over time, and when we're originating these loans, we're thinking about kind of all of those risks as we do that, which is
a reason why we continue to plan for auction prices to move lower from here.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Got it. And again, my point's not are there going to be fewer cars on the road because we use
them more densely or is there going to be a technology shift that basically makes old cars obsolete. I'm actually
thinking about the more immediate, which is that I'm assuming you have a fair number of customers who are taking
loans from you guys with the idea that they might be in the ride share business. And if the economics don't work out for
them, those are cars that are very, very likely to come back and have very high mileage. And I'm curious if one of the
things that we're seeing, and again since you guys are so quantitative, if we're seeing higher mileage on the repos that
are coming back in.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Off the top of my head, I actually can't give you an answer to that one. I can do some
follow-up and we can circle back with you. But, Rick, overall, we're taking into account all of those statistics in
formulating kind of our expectations around auction prices and resell values. So I think that's kind of embedded in our
assumptions
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question come from Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Hi. I've got one question on fees and then a follow-up on technology and digitalization. On
fees, it was a pretty strong quarter, and in particular, service charges had been a drag for a long time and are now up
year-over-year and interchange revenue is up a little faster than spend volume. Can you maybe just describe, is this any
kind of inflection point or is it more quarter-to-quarter noise, just fees actually was a pleasant surprise this quarter? So I
was just trying to figure out what drove that.
<A - R. Scott Blackley>: Yeah. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Non-interest income was up about 16% in the quarter.
And there's a few things that are going on there. Non-interest income for sure is lumpier than net interest income. It
certainly doesn't move quite as consistently with loan volumes. And so I'd just kind of go through and talk about a few
of the drivers. So you're right that net interchange was a large driver that contributed about $100 million in the

quarter-over-quarter variance, and a few things there. We had higher seasonal purchase volume, which was favorable.
And then as usual we have kind of the normal quarterly adjustments to rewards, liability expense, those kinds of things
that run through there and can create some quarter-over-quarter volatility, and we saw that this quarter.
We also in the first quarter had some UK PPI expense that ran through there, so that created just under $40 million of
favorability when we look at the linked quarter. And then kind of the – I'd just kind of also point out that in our
Commercial Business, that business has some lumpy fees that come in, and we did see around $25 million of higher
quarter-over-quarter fees. Those are businesses that have a business model where they generate fees, and normally we
see them kind of – a little bit there's some puts and takes. This quarter they just happened to all kind of work in our
favor and so they all came in in a positive way. But that's kind of the overall picture. I think they're all part of our
business model, but I would say that we would expect that that line item is going to continue to be a bit lumpy.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Brian, I just want to add, you asked if there was an inflection point in the interchange thing. I think
that we don't think that. It bounces around a lot from quarter to quarter. This happened to be a quarter where there was
strong interchange, but that's not necessarily a breaking point. I think that we'd continue to expect interchange growth
and net interchange revenues to be below growth in purchase volumes.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: And let us not forget last quarter I think the growth was negative. So this thing – it's
much better to squint your eyes and look at like annual trends and sort of the relationship between purchase volume
growth and interchange growth.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Maybe coming back to the closing remarks to the opening script you made, Rich, around
digitalization. This is something really three years now you've been talking about and pretty emphatically, and when
you started it was kind of – I remember when you first said RESTful APIs, I had to Google it. I was like, which call am
I on. But we've seen more and more banks come out and really start talking about what you were talking about two or
three years later.
So [ph] at times (57:43), when I'm talking to investors, that helps make it, like, okay, I see what he was talking about
for so long is important, but I still find it's hard for people to kind of put some tangible parameters around it. How does
digitalization and APIs and middleware actually translate to better revenue or better cost? So I'm sure there's some
hesitance about telling your competitors everything you're doing, but I wonder if there's – are there one or two
examples you could give backward-looking how this multi-year digital journey has started to produce benefits, either
greater revenue or less costs or a combination of both?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes. Thank you, Brian. So, first of all, we've been – look, I mean, it was 20-some years
ago the same phrase I use now which I used it way back then, which is build an information-based technology company
that happens to do banking, competing against banks that happen to use information and technology. And I'm very
struck that I've got the same battle cry 20-some years into that. But the other striking thing to me, even though I think
Capital One is pretty well-positioned to do something like this, is just how staggering the amount of change that's going
on and that will happen in the industry and the need to really transform ourselves across talent and infrastructure, the
way we work, how we develop software, where really there's nothing that's left unchanged.
So, where can you see the benefits? No one can disentangle what – no one can prove what happens when your
customers are a lot more delighted, how that affects things like growth and retention and things like that, but I just
would say that – and it's very easy, Brian, for you to – I'm not going to rattle them all off here – there's a lot of various
proof points associated with a dramatic increase in Capital One's – the customer satisfaction, go to the App Store and
look at their ratings on the App Store, between the digital experience, the customer experience, go to our own website
and look at the ratings that – and reviews that people put up on our own account.
For a variety of reasons, one of which is our digital transformation, we have had a tremendous momentum with
customers that is pretty linked to the kind of exceptional growth that we have seen. Look in the auto business, I don't
know if you've seen some of the technology that we're employing in the auto business associated with Auto Navigator.
I would suggest you take a look at that, that's pretty interesting. I can never prove you to what the contributions of
delighted customers are on the growth front.

Secondly, on the marketing front, there is an obvious and dramatic transformation going on in marketing and how it
works and the growing role of digital marketing. Digital marketing itself has got the word digital in it. And it's about
digital capabilities. And in fact, information-based strategy, that has been an important contributor to Capital One's
success.
The other thing that's going on is you've seen what's happening with our efficiency ratio, which got worse before it got
better. But the important thing is that it's getting better by a lot. And when I started on this journey, I said that, look, I
want to make one thing clear. So many banks are saying in their public statements, we are going to self-fund our digital
investment. I've been saying to investors for years, and it's really five years, actually, this journey has been, not the
three that you necessarily referred to, but that over this journey, I said that I don't believe anyone can transform their
company and be competitive in the future by self-funding this transformation that is you got to pay now and get
benefits later.
I also said that the biggest motivator of our digital investment is not a cost objective. It really is a much better customer
experience. Building a way more dynamic, well-managed, fast, first to market, better controlled, all those other kind of
benefits that come with this. All of that said, it's very clear that we are increasingly reaping important sizable benefits
and efficiency as a result of years of digital investment, and the efficiency comes across distribution channels of retail,
call centers, operations, centers. The transformation in how we work as long-term benefits, many of which we've
started to realize. So the interesting thing is a journey that was never motivated to be, number one, for the sake of cost
savings. Something where it cost a lot, the costs were a lot higher than the benefits at the outset, those relative meters
are on their way to some significant change in position there. And so it is the efficiency ratio would be the final place
that I would point to.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question come from John Hecht with Jefferies.
<Q - John Hecht>: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And just one question. Going back a year, I think you
were having better-than-industry card growth. I think it was somewhat balanced between new accounts and line
extensions. You've now pulled back growth, and I'm wondering, has the composition of growth changed? Is it coming
more from one of those aspects or the other? And to the extent it's changing, what does that mean to the risk
characteristics going forward?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, John, so we had – if you dial all the way back, I may get my years slightly wrong
here, but I think around the 2012-2013 timeframe, we had what we called the brownout of line increases. And that was
driven by a new regulatory requirement that required you to obtain a customer's income before we could actually do a
line extension. And implementing a whole way to obtain that data and so on led to a brownout in our line increases
even as our originations were continuing at a reasonable level.
Then what happened is right around the time that we got the technology and the ability to address the regulatory
requirement, that also coincided with sort of the big growth opportunity at Capital One. It contributed to but also
coincided with so that we had a surge in line increases and then a surge in young customers who were also eligible for
line increases. So I flagged over the especially 2014-2015 time period that we were having a more than probably
normal level of line increases in the overall mix of our business.
Over the past – I'm getting my time frames, I'm only approximate here – but something I would argue around the
beginning of 2016, we got into pretty much an equilibrium between line increases and originations themselves. And we
have generally been in that equilibrium ever since. To your point and to an earlier point that I said, if anything, our dial
back's more on the line increase side than the origination side of late. So it is possible the mix between those two could
move to the other side of equilibrium. But I don't think these changes are big enough to call that out. But I think the
more important thing, which is what we called out in the 2014-2015 timeframe, that those were a little bit more than the

normal share of line increases.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And our last question from tonight is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thanks. Good evening. Nice quarter. The first question I have is – I guess really relates to
losses. And in the quarter, for the U.S. credit card business at 5.11%, that was a pretty substantial improvement in the
month of June, just based on the monthly reporting. Was there anything specific that impacted that June performance
and had something on the order of like close to a 50-basis-point improvement month-over-month?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Ken, no, nothing that jumps out at us. One thing that – well, certainly we're delighted to
see the 47-basis-point sequential quarter improvement in charge-offs, but we always caution, don't get too carried away
with any one month because in fact and to point in the opposite direction, you obviously noticed the delinquencies after
several months of going down actually went up a bit in the month. So they kind of went in the opposite direction. I
think we look at both of those. Look, we look very carefully at every month worth of data, but I think that we should all
just squint our eyes a bit and look at the bigger pattern and don't get too carried away with any one month of data.
The big point is we still expect the growth math effects measured in terms of year-over-year increase and delinquencies
and loss rates to moderate the rest of 2017, to have a small tail in 2018. And in fact, we were just talking about this
today that one of these quarters we're actually going to say good-bye to growth math in the sense it's not going to really
be newsworthy, and we're going to be back in rising and our numbers rising and falling with the dynamics of the
marketplace. But growth math quarters are numbered here before we retire it, which is a good thing. We look forward
to that retirement party.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: I'm sure. There was a somewhat small shift, but, one, if it continues, could be to have a
substantial impact on that growth math. But there's a slight shift in the [audio gap] (01:10:01) above 660 credit score
versus the below 660 credit scores. Is that something that is a specific strategy of Capital One to accelerate one versus
the other? Or is that just kind of a byproduct of what you'd discussed around trimming around the underwriting and so
forth? And if I could just make that a two-part question, you'd kind of answered Betsy's question around recoveries
differently, but have you seen a change in the charge-off debt prices that are in the market?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: On the charge-off debt prices, I do not have any recent – I haven't been in a conversation
associated with that and I think that I would have heard about it if something was newsworthy there. But don't rely on
me for a latest read on that. Let me talk about the subprime mix. So our subprime mix has been – first of all, our
strategy as a company is stay very steady over the years, and we've been going, as you know, right at the top of the
market and all the way through to the higher end of the subprime marketplace. And over the last couple of years,
basically during this growth surge, you have seen our subprime mix grow from – I'm doing this from memory, but
around 34% up to 37% last quarter and it dropped down to 36%.
First of all, I want to point out in the world of all the precision we all live by, these are rounded to the nearest integer,
and sometimes the story is nothing more than a rounding story. Obviously, when you go up several hundred basis
points, that there's a trend there, and what we've said is the opportunity that we have seen in the subprime marketplace,
the relative – and I'm now speaking in the years of 2014-2015, also the lower – a little bit lower competitive intensity
there, all of that contributed to subprime's share growing a little bit. The strategy is really the same. The number has
settled down a little bit. Cabela's is going to come along, and hopefully everything works out perfectly there. And it
comes in and that'll take a little bite out of the subprime mix as well.
But the big story is I think we see the opportunity to be across the board. You're probably right, a little bit more of our
trimming around the edges has been in the higher risk areas or higher loss areas, so that just brings the subprime thing
in just a little bit. But my main point is the more things change, the more they really stay the same.
