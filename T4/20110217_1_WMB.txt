Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Travis Campbell,
Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell, Investor Relations
Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call. As always, thank you for
the interest in our company. Initially, I would mention that on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a
number of things. First, a few slides that we'll be talking from this morning. Second, the data book that contains useful
information that we make available each quarter, and finally three press releases. First, the separation release that we
issued last evening, second the reported fourth quarter results, and third our year-end oil and gas reserves. Now the last
two were issued this morning.
In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO will review the few slides we have this morning. Be aware
though that as always, all of our business unit heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's
remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads the E&P Company; Rory Miller who recently took over the reins of
Midstream Company; and Phil Wright, who heads our Gas Pipelines. Also, you certainly saw the notice that Phil will
be taking another role in the company later this month and Randy Barnard is going to lead the Gas Pipelines and he is

with us as well. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO, is here as well.
As most of you are aware, yesterday we announced our plan to separate our E&P business through a partial IPO and a
subsequent spinoff of our remaining ownership interest. Alan will make brief remarks about this plan during his
comments, but because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting further or taking any questions on the
E&P separation during this call. I would direct your attention to the press release that went out yesterday.
At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements on slide number two and number three and the
disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide number four. Those are important and integral to the remarks so please
review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted
accounting principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation. With that, I'll turn it over to, Alan.
Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer
Great. Good morning and I'll start here on slide five. I'm certainly pleased you've joined us for our call this morning
and to hear about our strong finish to 2010, and an exciting future for Williams shareholders. Our management and
board have worked diligently over the last couple of months analyzing how to unlock shareholder value while
maintaining growth platforms for the future.
As Travis mentioned, we will not be able to provide details of the transactions or forward-looking perspectives of the
new E&P company. Despite this restriction, we have plenty of exciting information to share with you about WMB's
2010 performance and the growth drivers for the future.
I'm also pleased to inform you that we exceeded our earlier guidance range for earnings per share and we are raising
guidance for 2011/2012. And with that, I'll move on to slide six.
As we announced yesterday, our board has given us the green light to pursue the creation of a separate E&P company
starting with a partial IPO in the third quarter of 2011 and then a planned spinoff of the remaining interests to our
shareholders in 2012.
WMB would use the IPO proceeds to pay down corporate debt and we would expect to maintain investment grade
credit ratings at WMB and WPZ. I would refer you to the press releases from the three credit rating agencies that rate
our debt that came out shortly after our announcement yesterday if you would like to know their perspectives in more
detail.
This new structure enables WMB to initiate a high dividend strategy. We are announcing a 60% increase starting with
quarterly payout in June of 2011 going from $0.125 to $0.20 per quarter and we are targeting additional 10% to 15%
increase in June of 2012. Both of these actions are in direct response to hearing from our shareholders and gathering
thoughts over the last, actually, several years in terms of thinking about how we can increase shareholder value. So
we're pleased to be reporting this to you this morning.
WMB and WPZ will be focused on meeting the robust demand for new infrastructure that helps our customers and our
nation take advantage of North America's abundant natural resources. As you will see, we have a lot of new
infrastructure being built and plan to do just that.
Moving on to slide seven, our full year financial results were boosted by a very strong fourth quarter. Our adjusted net
income for the fourth quarter was up 60% over the same quarter in 2009. This drove our adjusted EPS from continuing
operations for 2010 to $1.28 per share and that is 36% higher than our 2009 level of $0.94.
As you know, our full-year GAAP was heavily impacted by non-cash impairment charges in the third quarter, and we
had significant costs related to the WPZ and WMZ merger and the related debt restructurings required for that
transaction.
For the year, we are ending up at a GAAP loss of $1.1 billion and on an adjusted basis net income was $760 million,
which was up 38% over the same number for 2009.

I won't spend much time here on the reserves, since we provide some great graphics here on the next couple of slides
that I'll explain the reserves with. And moving into slide eight, you can see here starting with the left-hand side, you
can see our yearend 2009 reserves and you can see the various adjustments that get us to our 2010 U.S. reserves, then
we add in the international reserves from Apco and then finally, you see the adjusted total reserves as we look at what it
would mean if we looked at a total of 7 years reserves to get to.
So, our net proved reserves held strong with a 107% reserve replacement ratio, but did not move up radically
predominantly due to the new SEC 5-year limit rule under which we reclassified about 250 Bcf of proved reserves to
probable in the Piceance due to reducing the pace of drilling in a lower price environment and no longer being able to
get to all previously amounts within 5 years.
This in no way means we can't or don't expect to get to those reserves, just reclassification under the SEC rules. If you
look at our net other additions and revisions, we added 528 Bcf through our drilling program in which we spent $984
million in the E&P development capital. So this equates to in 2010, a finding cost of $1.86.
We ended the year at 4.3 Tcf of domestic proved and adding additional international you can it raises that to 4.5 Tcf.
We've also identified an additional 353 Bcf of reserves that could be classified as proved if we could add, if we were
allowed to add 2 more years of development. In other words, 7 years of development instead of being limited to 5.
Under this alternative view of how we would have looked at things before the SEC 5-year rule was imposed, our
adjusted proved reserves would have grown to more than 4.8 Tcf.
Moving on to slide nine, you can see a big move here on our 3P reserves and moving from about 14.8 Tcf to just under
16 Tcf and this was driven predominantly by our undeveloped leasehold acquisitions in both the Marcellus Shale and
the Bakken oil play. And our drilling programs are now well diversified among some of the most economically
attractive plays in the country including the Marcellus Shale, the Bakken oil and the Piceance tight-sands done the
Williams way.
Moving on to 10, here as mentioned earlier, we had a 60% increase in adjusted net income for the quarter. In addition,
our teams worked tirelessly to close a stunning amount of transactions in the quarter as listed here.
We also saw our NGL production rebound tremendously in the fourth quarter after a difficult third quarter and this
represented a record for our WPZ operations. This was driven by the startup of our new Echo Springs plant, but was
partially offset by the sale of our Cameron Meadows plant in the fourth quarter of 2009.
As you can see, the two large acquisitions done by WPZ are large fee-based deals with literally no direct commodity
exposure. And as we've commented a lot in the past, we continue to try to take advantage when we see good fee-based
opportunities to continue to steady the incomes of our WPZ investment.
The scale that we brought to WPZ through our restructuring in the first quarter of 2010 enabled us to perform these
large transactions without straining our balance sheet. So, we really were able to really prove the value of our WPZ
transaction in a very large way in the fourth quarter of '10.
And speaking of that, moving on here to slide 11, the Bakken acquisition is a great example of the fruits that our WPZ
restructuring brought forth. The drawdown of the Piceance gathering system to WPZ enabled this exciting $925 million
acquisition. Nothing new on the slide, but we have now updated guidance to include it and other than the weather this
time of the year in North Dakota, we're very pleased about our large entry in the Bakken and Three Forks oil play in
North Dakota.
We closed the transaction on December 21st, and we have three rigs running there and certainly in the process of
getting our teams assembled and getting a lot of the great experience that we have around the organization zeroed in on
the opportunities in the Bakken.
Moving on to slide 12, a lot of exciting things going on here in the Marcellus and almost too much to mention, but I'll
take a stab at it here. Our Transco Gas Pipeline group announced recently that it has executed agreements with three
shippers that fully subscribed in Northeast supply link project on a long-term basis. These shippers included Hess,

Anadarko and Williams Gas Marketing.
The Northeast supply link project is a proposed expansion of the Transco Pipeline system that will provide about
250,000 dekatherms per day of incremental firm transportation capacity from Marcellus Shale supplies into Station 210
pooling point in New Jersey, and even all the way into existing New York City delivery points.
Williams expects to submit its FERC application by the end of the year and subject to FERC approval, the project
would be placed into service in November 2013. This is really exciting project for us, because it shows the way our
midstream business can work with the gas pipeline business. The largest customer commitment for this Transco project
is coming from midstream's 33-mile Springville lateral interconnect that is to be completed now in July of 2011.
The midstream efforts in both Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania are expected to enable the
gathering of 2 Bcf per day in 2013 and 2.75 Bcf per day in 2015. So, we're very excited to see the way things are
growing there in both the midstream area, gas pipes area and as well the E&P area.
The notes on the E&P, we continue to see improving well results. Our Clearfield County Alder Run wells are online at
2 million to 4 million cubic feet per day each, and we are in the process of completing a 3D seismic acquisition for
Susquehanna in Westmoreland Counties and the Centre and Clearfield County chutes will begin very quickly. Progress
towards building out the permit inventory, adding staff and vendors and contractors continue there as well.
Moving on to slide 13. Here we show our commodity price assumptions that support our earnings guidance. The big
shift was moving NYMEX natural gas midpoint down to $4.25 from $5 for 2011 and raising the midpoint for our WTI
crude oil from $87.50 to – up to $87.50 from $80. The gas is in line with the current forward strip and the crude oil is
slightly conservative to the strip as you all are probably aware.
In 2012, our NYMEX gas was lowered to $5 from $5.40 and WTI oil is going up from $82 to $89 in 2012. So those are
just the changes that we've made from the previous guidance. but those are just the changes that we have made from the
previous guidance and as well the WTI there remains conservative to the strip.
Of course the NGL margin moves up with these new assumptions despite embedding a much more conservative NGL
to crude relationship than we saw in 2010. The actual NGL to crude relationship came in at 55% in 2010 and our
midpoint here for 2011 is 53% and you can see rising up to 54% for 2012. Our belief, and if you follow the logic here,
our belief is that the NGL to crude relationships move inversely to crude to gas ratios. So as we're seeing a higher crude
to gas ratio in 2011, we are suggesting we should see a slip in the NGL to crude ratio. Despite that, we continue to
show very strong margins here in 2011.
Moving on to slide 14, that commodity assumptions then reflect a nice lift in our guidance as well along with the
Bakken acquisition. Our earnings per share reflects some tightening of the ranges in '11 and '12 and our midpoint is
being raised from $1.25 to $1.40 for 2011 and to $1.75 from $1.50 in 2012.
The segment profit also is tightening. We are also tightening the range for 2011 and a slight increase in the range in '12.
The segment profit, as you will see moved up by a little over 7% in 2011 and about 10% for 2012. The drivers of
course for these earnings raising and segment profit going up were acquisitions that were made in the fourth quarter
and higher NGL margins that are being partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
And you also would note, if you dig into the detail here, you will note that our 2011 and 2012 CapEx are raising. Part
of that is carryover from 2010 to '11 as well as increased growth opportunities in the WPZ Laurel Mountain and the
Piceance growth as well. So quite a bit of new capital coming there that will continue to fuel our growth.
Moving on to slide 15, impressive adjusted segment profit growth here from '10 to '12 of 35%. This segment profit
growth is made up of 31% in the other category and 79% in E&P and a 26% increase in WPZ. In fact our other
category is getting so big, it's just about to earn its stripes and get a real name. So you will see notes of that in our 10-K
release as well. But really very nice segment profit growth across the board for all three units here.
Moving on to slide 16, talking about we have here $4 billion in growth capital in '11 and '12 to spend. So that's just the
growth side CapEx. And we have many more projects as you'll see here in the next few slides beyond the guidance

period and many speculative projects that we have not build into guidance yet. Of course, our track record demonstrates
our ability to grow even faster than our guidance and we continue and are able to add on projects to the back end of our
CapEx for guidance.
Moving on to slide 17, much of the continued spending in guidance is growing our fee-based business here. You can
see within midstream in the Marcellus, and we continue to see a big opportunity, albeit more speculative in the
deepwater services as well. As you can see there on the left, you see where the Gulf Coast G&P gets larger as a
percentage of the overall mix. So a lot of great opportunity out there, tremendous demand for midstream infrastructure,
particularly in the upstream sector and we are excited about beginning to help service the petchem side as well as a lot
of changes are coming forward in the petchem side that are going to demand some infrastructure changes as well and
we are well positioned to help out with that.
Moving on to slide 18. Our opportunities in Canada and domestic olefins continue to impress. Relative low-cost natural
gas resources are creating great opportunities for the North American petchem space and we are very excited to be a
part of it. We are able to utilize our knowledge and access to the light-end NGLs both here in the U.S. and Canada and
very well positioned because we have $500 million of international cash at the end of the year that is sitting available to
invest. So we are not going to have to raise any financing to fuel some very substantial growth in Canada.
And you can see there the projects listed on here, the Boreal NGL pipeline, which is right in the midst of construction.
Remind you that constructing pipelines in Canada and that part of the country really does require winter construction
on the northern end because the ground needs to be frozen and we are right in the midst of construction there. The
ethane recovery project, we continue to be excited about that and that will add to our current services up there. That
will add our ability to extract ethane and ethylene from those resources up there. And then of course we remain very
confident in our ability to gain the other upgrader processing benefit and we have included that here in guidance as
well.
Moving on to the gas pipelines area, you can see here really the key message here is that there is about $1.3 billion of
inventory for growth projects but the real key message is that most of this $1.3 billion, the majority comes on either in
late 2012 or even beyond the guidance period, most of it even beyond the guidance period. So despite a nice increase
that we have got in our guidance, we have got a very nice group of projects here that will fuel our growth beyond the
guidance period.
Moving on here to slide 20 and in closing here, in the current we exceeded our EPS guidance. We plan to take dramatic
steps to unlock shareholder value. Our unmatched infrastructure and development talents provide a sound basis for an
increasing flow of dividends to our shareholders and in the forecast, we have very visible growth supporting a 37%
growth in guidance from 2010 to '12. And in the future a very strong case for continued growth beyond the guidance
period.
Over the long haul we have a track record of doing as what is right for our shareholders, employees and the
environment and we are very excited to continue this track record and we have a great future ahead of us that we're all
excited about being a part of. And with that I'll turn it over to, for questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Hey, good morning everybody and certainly congratulations. If I could ask a couple of questions.
The first, and I apologize if this was mentioned but I missed it. With respect to the higher CapEx and maybe first here
ask on the E&P side especially as we look at 2012, we're moving the midpoint up $300 million, $400 million or so.
What are the volumetric growth rates that we should be thinking about with that move up in CapEx? Does that have
any shift in say for instance the composition that has been discussed in the recent past, getting to 25% of oil revenues in

next few years, et cetera?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Well, Carl this is Ralph. The growth rate previously in the previous guidance I believe was like
3% for '11 and 7% for '12 and I think we are now at 9% for '11 and approximately 10% for '12. That's clearly an
increase in CapEx is primarily because of the new acquisition in the Bakken and we are as we mentioned, we expect
over the next handful of years and in the initial press release that we will be switching more from in 2010 from really
just a very negligible amount of our revenues were coming from oil to substantial more will be coming from the oil in
the future as a reflection of that. I think we said in the initial press release back then it was a within the next, by 2013 or
so, I thought we thought it would be like 25% oil revenue. So it's clearly the increase is, one is our production growth is
going up quite a bit the next couple of years because of the new asset and that's reflection of the capital and also a
reflection of the difference in mix we'll have from almost all gas to we're about 25% that coming from the oil and
liquids side.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Great and so Ralph, that 25% then is just correlating with the new growth rates.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Yes, the oil – yes exactly. It's just a function of, it correlates exactly with the growth rates are
higher than what we previously, in our previous guidance.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Perfect. Alan, if I could ask one other question on, as the other clearly is going to become more
important in several different ways. How – actually two questions here – I noticed we've had about $300 million before
this. You mentioned the additional processing that is coming in in Canada. When do we think we will see – is that just
the matter of getting that additional capacity online and then we'll see additional volumes flowing? Is that the
bottleneck or is it the fact that we also need to sign additional capacity contracts with off gas producers?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there is a little bit of the first and a lot of the
latter. The government of Alberta has been considering a subsidy for ethane recovery in the province and of course
that's got folks wondering and making sure that they are positioned if that does happen to take advantage of that and so
that's got things stymied a little bit at this point. And we are hoping to see an announcement on that in the not too
distant future. So we think that will unlock a little bit of a logjam that's existing up there right now.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: Okay but the fact that you guys have moved that into guidance I guess gives a pretty clear
confidence that you think additional contracts to process more of off gases coming.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. We are quite a ways along on that front but we
do not have signatures, that's correct.
<Q - Carl Kirst>: And lastly and I will jump back in queue. With respect to olefins as a whole, we've obviously got
some nice CapEx growth here in 2011, 2012. Trying to ask this in a way that doesn't touch on the restructuring. Is it
something where we might see that shift at all as we take an even longer term approach to 2013 and beyond, i.e. the
growth we see is more sort of near term? We do that and then go more into harvest mode or do you see enough
petrochemical related growth opportunities that the amount of CapEx we are seeing in the other sector right now this
$400 million, $500 million quite frankly could continue on for several years even beyond 2012?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think there is two ways to think about that. If
you think about it in Canada, again we've got a nice nest egg there coming from our international cash flows. We've got
a nice nest egg there to grow that business and as we reported we have $500 million of cash sitting there and we
continue to have very nice cash flows in addition to that in our Canadian business. And so we're pretty well positioned
there and of course we don't have any debt against those specific cash flows up there. So there's a lot of ways to fund
that Canadian growth without dipping into the current WMB free cash flows.
And so, but I would tell you that that could go on for quite some time. The ability to optimize around those oil sands up
there and those vast reserves could go on for quite some time. And we're extremely well positioned up there. I think
we're really at the tip of the iceberg in that business. In the U.S., much smaller piece of that obviously, but we do see a
lot of opportunities to help debottleneck the petchem space, not just our own but others in the U.S. But it certainly
wouldn't be as dramatic given what we know right now as the Canadian opportunities.

<Q - Carl Kirst>: Great. Thanks and congratulations again.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question will come from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: Thank you. Alan, a delicate question if I may. With the separation of the two businesses, it frees
up a lot of room for capital redeployment at WMB. So in the context of that background, would you mind commenting
on kind of the M&A prospects in the U.S. and Canada for midstream and pipeline businesses and companies?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think, I certainly think that we'll have our
eyes open for opportunities to aggressively grow the infrastructure side of the company based on our strategies. But I
also would tell you that we are going to remain very disciplined as we have in the past in terms of making sure that
those are accretive and make sense for our shareholders in the long run. So certainly we'd tell you that we've got our
eyes open to it, but we're going to remain very disciplined at the same time.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: Maybe if I ask it another way, would you be more or would you be prioritizing higher these kind
of opportunities than you were prior to the spinoff?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think we will have more currencies likely
than we've had previously, so to that degree, yes.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: I see. The 126 Bcfe add of reserves from acquisitions at E&P, I'm assuming that that is what the
existing amount of reserves that you bought, but doesn't reflect the potential of reserves that you think exist in the
Marcellus and the Bakken, correct?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Yes. This is Ralph, it is. It's really a reflection, we basically have booked a very small amount in
the Marcellus as we wait for a, primarily the pipeline, Laser Pipeline Susquehanna to come on. So that is about 20 of
that and then the remaining piece of that is the Bakken. We do, we have said publicly we believe each of those on a 3P
type basis areas have, each one has I believe the Bakken has about 1.1 Tcf. If you convert that into a gas equivalent
opportunity in the Marcellus is about 1.2 TCF of 3P. So we have a very small amount of that booked at this time.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: Great. So we should expect to see that increase relatively rapidly as you see infrastructure get
put into play, correct? Not necessarily the drilling but the infrastructure.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Well we never really comment on where it's going forward, but we bought a lot of probable and
possible reserves and we do expect to be very successful in that aspect.

We'll hear next from Citi's Faisel Khan.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of an idea of kind of, I know you
talked about this in your guidance a little bit, but if I look at your, the ethane, your ethane equity so your NGL equity
sales gallons kind of over the last year or so, they're up around 10% over last year and looks like that trajectory should
continue given the economic growth. But what, are there any bottlenecks in order to continue to grow that production?
Is there enough demand on the other end to kind of consume those barrels or is there something that we should be
worried about in the future as we kind of reach the maximum operating capacity in the chemical industry?
<A - Rory Miller>: This is Rory Miller. I'll take that question. I think on – there has been a lot of concern I think in the
marketplace about ethane. I think we're pretty bullish still near term and probably midterm that there is enough creep, if

you will, on the cracking capacity that the additional ethane will be soaked up. So we're pretty bullish on it. We think
we are in good shape through the end of the year, probably into next year as well. We'll just have to watch that closely.
But right now looking at the forward strip for instance, it looks like that market is backward dated and probably well
under our expectation of where we see ethane prices at the end of the year.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, got you. And then if I could also just understand the opportunity in the Gulf of Mexico for
you guys. I guess when you present the potential capital expenditure opportunities for midstream, one of the big parts
of your pie chart is what could happen in the Gulf of Mexico. And just recently we've seen you guys be a part of some
of the tendering from you for using your spar platform versus some other sort of competing technologies in the Gulf.
How big is that opportunity and when do you think we'll see some development take place on that front given your
activities there?
<A - Rory Miller>: Yes, there is a lot of pent-up demand right now. Obviously with the moratorium, the whole space
out there has been on hold, but people have been working projects. There are a lot of projects that need to get back
underway. And the BOEM I think has flagged that that they do intend to get people back to work. We are starting to
see signs of that. So I think throughout the course of 2011, we're going to see a substantial improvement in terms of
producers being able to get back out and get active. What that means to our GulfStar product I think is very positive.
We do have discussions going on right now with opportunities to deploy that. Again we don't have anything to
announce yet. But we are optimistic and I would say looking forward, there's a significant backlog of opportunities we
see on the horizon that we think are going to come into the marketplace over the next say 18 months as people get back
to work in the Gulf.
So we see that as an opportunity; probably on a 100% basis, which may not be the way that we invest; we may bring on
partners for that business. But let's say a way to scale things up rather quickly. Most of those investments with the
pipeline interconnections are around $1 billion of investment each. So it is a way to move the needle.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, great and last question from me. What – now I was just looking for this in your prepared
materials. But what was the cash balance at the end of the year for you guys? And I suspect that was after the Bakken
transaction.
<A - Travis Campbell, Investor Relations>: Faisel, why don't you to hang on a second and we'll pull that up.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Don R. Chappel>: Precise about $800 million. That's largely an International cash balance, some WPZ cash and
bit of Williams cash.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, understood. Thank you.
<A - Don R. Chappel>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Thanks, if I can just ask about how you're thinking about the dividend. You have the raise,
obviously you announced it last night and that you're looking for a raise in next year. What, I mean how should we
think about a payout ratio going forward here?
<A - Don R. Chappel>: This is Don Chappel. Good morning. I think you've seen our WPZ guidance, and WPZ has
guided to a 6% to 10% increase in the distribution, the LP distribution. And of course, Williams will receive an even
bigger increase in distributions by virtue of the incentive distribution rights that we hold. So when we look at the cash
flows from WPZ that are expected to come up to Williams. And that is with a, I think, a healthy coverage ratio at WPZ,
again, I think you saw from our guidance at the midpoint of our guidance, the PZ coverage ratio is at about 1.2 times.

But then we take that into Williams, and that is the primary driver of the corporate dividend. And I think you can also
see from, if you run through the calculations, especially ex-E&P, we get to a coverage ratio at Williams as well. I don't
think we are prepared to speak to a coverage ratio but we do have some coverage there and the good news is here in
2010 we're putting some of that money back into E&P to grow the Bakken production. So we're drilling a bit beyond
our cash flows to get the Bakken started up. But beyond separation and the net excess cash flow is available for other
opportunities, including the dividend that we've spoken to.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: That's helpful. I guess kind of coming down, this similar question that was asked before. I mean
how much should we think about sort of a run rate CapEx that this other segment will need, whether it's growth capital,
maintenance capital, just thinking about corporate G&A. How does that all factor into, then, what cash you could
distribute out in a dividend?
<A - Don R. Chappel>: I would say right now we don't see any significant change in the corporate G&A. Obviously
as two separate companies we'll have some increases, and we'll also look to offset that with some simplification, if you
will.
In terms of the other segment, again, as Alan mentioned, we have about $500 million of international cash that is really
the seed money for a lot of the growth up in Canada. Beyond that, we expect to have some debt capacity in likely in
Canadian-denominated debt for the next phase of growth up there. And if we look at our credit metrics, over the next
several years, we should have some more debt capacity, particularly on those Canadian assets.
What that really remains, then, is the U.S. olefins business, and that is a fairly modestly sized business today, perhaps
some expansions. But I would say the maintenance capital requirements are pretty modest. And the growth capital
requirements, as you look at our forecast, in terms of our U.S. cash balance are very, very modest. I don't know if you
have any follow up on that.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, on slide 18 there we kind of show the domestic
olefins and it kind of gives you a picture for that and just as you look at that for instance you have to recognize that
that's spread over that 2011 to 2015 timeframe. So as Don said, even in the more speculative picture there, fairly
modest. Not that we wouldn't like to grow that frankly, but in terms of demand for it, this as we know it is fairly modest
at this point.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Got you. And if I could just ask one more, could you just give us a little more clarity in terms of,
you say you want to stay investment grade at the WMB level. Are there any metrics that we can lean on that you might
be targeting with that?
<A - Don R. Chappel>: I would say it tends to be in the kind of 3 to 4 times debt-to-EBITDA range and I think the
agencies' metrics in terms of guidelines to guide you. That's a pretty simple statement that I made but somewhere in
that zip code.
<Q - Ted Durbin>: Okay, okay that's it. That's it for me, thanks.
Operator
We'll hear next from Joe Allman of J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Yes, thank you, good morning everybody. In terms of the Canadian midstream and olefins
businesses, is it your plan to ultimately drop them down to WPZ?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We don't have any plans to do that at this point in
time and the growth trajectory remains very robust there with what we've got, quite a bit of growth here in the
foreseeable future domestically and so we don't see any reason to bring that complexity to our unitholders at this point.
<A - Don R. Chappel>: I think it remains an option that we have in the future and I think as Alan points out we have
so much growth right now. It's probably not a very good fit for the MLP plus the international tax issues related to it

make it something that's more of a long term possibility versus anything in the very near term.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Okay, that's excellent. And then in terms of your decision to IPO and then spin the E&P
business versus just spinning it, could you give us the background behind that decision?
<A - Don R. Chappel>: I would say that again given the rules, the SEC rules, there's very little we can say about the
transaction. I would just point you to the press release. And we did have a desire to raise some IPO proceeds at the
Williams level in order to pay down some debt and continue to have a very strong credit rating at Williams. And I think
you've seen the notes from the ratings agencies, and that's the plan.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Okay, all right. Thanks. And then a question on cash taxes. What are you thinking about going
forward in terms for cash taxes for E&P and then for the post-spin WMB?
<A - Don R. Chappel>: Wish we could talk about it, but again with the securities laws, I really can't speak to that, but
alls I can say is stay tuned.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Okay. I got one I think I can get through. So this is for Ralph. Ralph, in terms of the first few
Bakken wells, what kind of AFEs are you looking at for those first few?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: We're still staying in what we gave as the guidance at the time, which is a $7.5 million to $8.5
million range. But what we are seeing is now that we've taken over operations on the drilling side and we are still in the
process of taking over operations on the completion and just the normal field operations, our first few wells that we
have drilled are down into the lower 30 day range. Previous owner was more in the 40 to 50 day range. So we expect to
be in that $7.5 million to $8.5 million as we put in our guidance. And we are pleased with what we have as Alan
mentioned, the early on in this winter there has been some obviously some pretty severe winters and completion delays
but on the drilling side, we're very pleased at this time and hope to have our completions caught up at some point this
year.

We'll move next to Jonathan Lefebvre with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Thanks, good morning guys and congratulations. On the, I just wanted to jump back to the
distributions and I was wondering if there is any tax shield that we should be thinking about as you receive the
distributions from WPZ. Just trying to understand the dynamics there a little better.
<A - Don R. Chappel>: Jonathan, Williams pays tax on WPZ's earnings, our proportionate share of WPZ earnings
regardless of the distribution. So from a tax standpoint, we file a consolidated tax return and it really kind of looks
through the structure. So that really didn't change Williams' tax position relative to WPZ business earnings didn't
change. So, I think we've said that you can probably look at the distribution to ballpark the taxes and apply something
like a 30% rate on the distribution and get into the right ZIP code in terms of what the effective tax rate is on those
earnings.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Perfect, thanks. And then on the IPO, I know it's very sensitive, but should we expect any
tax leakage from that?
<A - Don R. Chappel>: Very sensitive. Again, I wish we could talk about it, but we can't.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Okay. And then I just wanted to follow up on the MLP question. I know you answered
about the Canadian assets not fitting into the MLP structure today. But I was just wondering, what about Geismar?
Would that – I know it's – could fit, but just wondering if you think that at some point you might look to put that at
WPZ?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well as I'm sure you are aware, that income is not
qualified income from an MLP standpoint. However given the size of WPZ and the scale that it's growing to, that

doesn't mean that we couldn't at some point. And so but at this point again we've got enough growth potential out there.
We don't see a need to put that in at this time and so and bring that risk to bear for us from a tax standpoint.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Fair enough. And then just lastly, I know you have plenty of capacity to increase the
dividend here, and just wondering how you maybe weigh that against the opportunity to do some share repurchases and
how we should be thinking about that going forward.
<A - Don R. Chappel>: I would say that we think the dividend is very highly valued. Obviously, we think our stock is
something that is also attractive. So we will continue to look at the options there. I would say that right now, our bias is
toward dividend. We think the market really appreciates a dividend growth being kind of a long-term cash flow stream.
But we will continue to look at all the options. Thanks for the question.
<Q - Jonathan Lefebvre>: Okay. And then just finally, for Ralph, on the – I noticed the mention of the Niobrara is
under review. I was just wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit of color around that and what your intentions
are there and maybe this I assume is the gas Niobrara?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Yes, basically, what we're doing at this point is, it is gas Niobrara, and that's in the Piceance
basin. We have some opportunities that we've mentioned previously that we're looking to, just in our normal acreage
that we have, to test some of the Niobrara and the Piceance.

We'll move next to Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Hi. Congratulations on the development evolution of the business and also on a good quarter. Two
quick questions. Alan, you commented during the call already and also I believe back in November during some of
your investor meetings that you would certainly like to grow the U.S. olefins business particularly to the degree it could
service and offtaker and reduce some of the risk for ethane price volatility from PZ. And but you kind of mentioned
today that you don't necessarily see a lot of demand there even though plastics pricing is going up worldwide and there
continues to be the ethane advantage versus alternative feedstock. Can you comment on that and the ability to drive
down that coverage ratio that Don referred to at 1.2 times and then I have a quick question for Ralph.
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, great. Craig, thank you for the question
actually because it gives me an opportunity to clarify that. When I spoke to demand, I wasn't speaking really to lack of
demand on the petchem side because, as you know, ethylene derivative products like polyethylene are very advantaged
here in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world that primarily uses naphtha to produce that product. And so as we have
continued low natural gas prices here, we continue have a lot of opportunity in that regard. So and we are very excited
about that space.
I would just say that we are also seeing a lot of interest by the petchem space in moving upstream as well and so there
may be a way to reduce risk to our portfolio and leave people that are more in the business of – ethylene-derivative
business and exports of those products doing their expertise and us doing the upstream and perhaps in a way that
partners with those parties and reduces our risk. So that's why the capital isn't real large in that space right now, is
there's perhaps some partnering opportunities that give us visibility all the way through the polyethylene, for instance,
but doesn't require us to put up a tremendous amount of capital in that space.
<Q - Craig Shere>: And do you see the derisking at PZ coming from long-term contracts that are less variable-based,
more fixed, or simply linked more to a percentage of oil that can be hedged?

<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Either one, and both of those avenues are being
pursued. So, I would say probably more likely for longer term deals it would be something tied to crude oil.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Understood. Ralph two quick questions, I don't know if you'll answer the second one. But on the
first one it looks like if I understood your answer to Carl's question, and I'm doing the math right on slide 11 with how
much you will be spending on the Bakken, it looks like your CapEx for gas has not come down much, even though the
gas strip is somewhat meaningfully lower than what was assumed in the third quarter guidance, which I think was $5 at
the time. And the production guidance in 2011 doesn't seem to show much decline on the gas expectation.
So the first question is, can you comment about your thinking and plans in terms of gassy CapEx investment relative to
changes in commodity prices? And the second question is whether as a part of the broader family or on your own, I just
wonder how much credit the Street gives you for the 69% ownership in Apco and what you can do to kind of get that
story out there?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: On the first side, we are basically holding this rig count we talked about for the gas side in
November, which is about 11 rigs in the Piceance and 3 in the Marcellus Shale growing this year to approximately 6
probably at the end of that year in the Marcellus. We did drop 3 rigs from the Barnett, we're down to the 1, so we have
cut, changed that around somewhat.
We still think in those areas we're drilling in, which is primarily the Piceance and the Marcellus on the gas side, we feel
very good about our returns there, so we are comfortable with that. And going forward obviously as we get our hands
more and more around the Bakken side of the world to the extent we can and build our inventory, permitting, get our
staff up there, we will probably look to, when the time is right, to shift those resources from the gassy side to the oily
side. So we have, at the November call, you might recall that we did drop about 10 rigs from what we had previously
thought we would be doing on the gas side. So we've already taken a pretty big cut at that.
As for Apco, we continue to have a number of successes in Apco that you've seen in the past. And we will just be able
to talk about that somewhat when we go through the process. But you have seen that we have some slides out there
now that talk about the concessions we have, both in Argentina and the new concessions in Colombia. And that is just
something we will be able to talk about when we get through this process.
<Q - Craig Shere>: Great, thank you.
Operator
We'll move on to Kevin Smith of Raymond James.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on the quarter. In the past, I guess you guys have
talked about the communication flow being a consolidated company having all these, the different aspects and how
you're able to jointly develop projects and the synergies from that. I don't know if we're getting too sensitive but how
do you see communication flow past the break up?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll take that. Now first of all certainly has
been between, particularly between Midstream and E&P, lot of opportunities for Midstream to kind of be ahead and as
well for Midstream to help the E&P group get fair value for their liquids as well. And so on both fronts I think there has
been benefit there. So I wouldn't deny that. I would certainly through the IPO process, and as long as it's a controlled
subsidiary, there is no reason that we would lose that. But ultimately in the spin, we will have to work hard to maintain
the good relationships and that's certainly our goal as a management team right now is to maintain a good relationship
and continue to build and enjoy that to the degree we can legally.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Fair enough. Are there any gathering contracts or anything that will have to be kind of split out, or
is all that stuff already separate?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Because we have WPZ holding most of our
domestic midstream business, most of that is squared away pretty well, So not any major deals at all. There will be a

little bit to clean up here and there. But for the most part, it's taken care of because we already had the separate WPZ
entity.
<Q - Kevin Smith>: Okay. And then one last question. When do you think you will be able to talk about the Bakken
wells that you're drilling now?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: This is Ralph. We probably will have, I would guess in our next call some more update on that.
We closed the deal December 21st, have just now, as I mentioned, taken over the drilling side and we have our staff in
place. We have been blessed in the new Marcellus team and also the new Bakken team that we've been able to pull
from resources in the Piceance, the Powder and the Barnett and bring a lot of expertise to each of those teams. So we
are in the game right now and I would guess that we will start giving some updates at the next call.
And everything we have seen so far is what we thought would be. So we are very pleased with that. The only thing we
have as Alan mentioned and I've mentioned, we have a little bit of a completion backlog as I think most of the industry
does up there. But with our relationships with our vendors and nationwide we think we will be able to overcome that
delay.

We will move next to Holly Stewart of Howard Weil.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Good morning guys. Just really one quick one for Ralph and Ralph, you've done several
acquisitions here to sort of right-size the E&P business as we would say. Will you be looking to high grade that
business?
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: We always will look to high grade the business. We have, as we're speaking right now, we do
have our Arkoma positions for sale, if you will. But going forward, Holly, as we look at anything, we'll always look to
make sure our portfolio is bringing the returns we want and handle that as we move forward in the process. But we
always want to make sure our portfolio is contributing.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: And you've dropped – I guess you just mentioned you dropped 2 rigs up in the Barnett. So
what's – I mean, is that just related to pricing right now, the economics, or I mean, I know you guys have had some
permitting issues. Just trying to think about the value of the newco E&P here going forward.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: It's really just a function of there have been some delays on the facilities side and we have better
places to – because of that we've had better places to take our capital right now.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. Great, thanks guys.
<A - Ralph A. Hill>: Thank you.

We have time for one more question. That question will come from Lasan Johong of RBC Capital. And Lasan your line
is open.
<Q - Lasan Johong>: Thank you for taking the question, I apologize. Just as a last question, on the separation, can we
assume or is it a good policy for us to assume that WPZ would enter into additional midstream and pipeline contracts
with new E&P in the Marcellus and the Bakken prior to the actual spin?
<A - Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I really don't think we would be able to
comment on that. But I would just say that in a business as usual, where it makes sense for both parties and
economically, we would continue to drive those kind of values for the corporation.
