Thanks, Loren, and welcome, everyone from frigid Houston to our 2010 year-end conference call. Earlier today, we
announced fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $440 million or $1.05 per share on revenues of $3.17 billion. Additionally,
we announced earnings of $1.67 billion on revenues of $12.16 billion for the entire year. Clay will expand on these
numbers in a moment, but we are very pleased with the results and they exhibit our ability over the past couple of years
to navigate a very difficult market with dexterity and nimbleness.
Additionally, we announced new capital order intake of $1.41 billion for our second consecutive quarter of a greater
than one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. This order intake reflects the industry need for the highly technical solutions we
provide. Our backlog ended the quarter at $5.01 billion, and we will expand during this call on the order outlook that
we see for the next couple of quarters.
I want to thank all of our employees worldwide for the tremendous efforts they have put forth this year to achieve these
results. Their hard work and dedication has been unequaled by anyone in the industry. At this time, I'd like to turn the
call over to Clay to give you more color on the numbers that I've just talked about.
Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President
Thanks, Pete. National Oilwell Varco posted excellent results in the fourth quarter, earning $440 million or $1.05 per
fully diluted share on $3.2 billion in revenue. Operating profit was $624 million for the fourth quarter on a GAAP
basis. Excluding transaction, devaluation and voluntary retirement charges from all periods, fourth-quarter operating
profit of $625 million was up from $598 million in the third quarter and up from $622 million in the fourth quarter of
last year.
Sequential operating flow through of leverage was 17% on the 5% increase in sales, lower than is typical due to items
that I'll speak to in the operations discussions. Operating margins for the fourth quarter of 19.7% were generally in line
with both the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
For the full year 2010, the company earned $1.667 billion or $3.98 per fully diluted share compared to $1.469 billion or
$3.52 per fully diluted share in 2009 on a GAAP basis. Excluding transaction impairment, voluntary retirement and
restructuring charges, 2010 earnings were $4.09 per diluted share, up 4% from the $3.95 per diluted share earned in
2009 due principally to a lower tax rate in 2010.
Revenues were $12.2 billion in 2010, down 4% from the $12.7 billion in revenues posted in 2009. Operating profit for
the full year 2010 excluding transaction devaluation, voluntary retirement and restructuring charges, was $2.465 billion
down $84 million from 2009 representing 15% decremental operating leverage and excluding unusual charges from
both years.
Full year results for 2010 highlight the cyclical diversification of NOV's portfolio of early and late-cycle businesses.
Our early cycle businesses, Distribution Services and Petroleum Services & Supplies, rebounded with a North
American rig count this year and posted 15% and 12% year-over-year sales gains respectively. National Oilwell
Varco's later-cycle Rig Technology group carried a strong backlog into the downturn two years ago, which permitted it
to actually grow in 2009, but it came in 14% lower year over year in 2010.
The net consolidated result was a modest 4% decline in revenues and 3% decline in operating profit excluding charges
in 2010 as compared to 2009. For 16 straight quarters, since the beginning of 2007, excluding unusual charges, NOV
has exceeded $500 million in operating profit and 19% operating margins, a remarkable run within a volatile market
that is instructive of NOV's full-cycle diversity.
We are well positioned for the New Year, and we see many signs of encouragement as we enter 2011. Over the last few
quarters, we've discussed blossoming interest in building new offshore rigs and the recent announcements made this
trend more visible to the financial community. Our fourth- quarter orders for Rig Technology reflect two new drill
ships and several new jack-up packages along with orders in our new FPSO business, APL, which we closed in
December.

Importantly, I will again note that we book new contracts into our backlog only when they are signed and funded, so
our orders for the fourth quarter do not yet fully reflect the magnitude of business we expect to gain on the resurgence
in new build activity. Bookings in the first few weeks of 2011 have been accelerating, and we expect orders for the first
quarter of 2011 to be strong.
New contract additions of $1.408 billion, offset by $1.271 billion in revenue out of backlog, drove our backlog for
capital equipment in our Rig Technology group 3% higher sequentially to slightly more than $5 billion at December
31, 2010.
Orders destined for offshore markets totaled 86% and land 14%. International orders account for 86% of the mix and
domestic 14% as well. Scheduled outflow as backlog of orders in the backlog, at year end is expected to be
approximately $4 billion in 2011 and $1 billion in 2012.
Rising demand for new rigs of many types reflect the growing realization among oil companies that newer, more
capable rigs offer better efficiency, safety and reliability. This is an evolutionary process, for which the seeds were
planted several years ago by a handful of entrepreneurial drilling contractors building newer, better rigs and a few
foresighted E&P customers willing to try them. Together, they endured a few start-up bugs, retrained crews to run these
new machines and ultimately began to reap the benefits embodied in the technology in these sophisticated rigs. This
evolution proceeds through a series of small victories; a challenging extended reach well here, a redevelopment and
infill program there, that end up saving the E&P customer money.
One at a time, the evolution wins over a company man, a drilling engineer, a drilling superintendent, a drilling
department, an entire oil company. Enthusiasm spreads and diffuses slowly but steadily as skepticism retreats, and rig
day rates begin to reflect the new reality. The now well documented bifurcation in day rates for rigs, new rigs
commanding higher day rates than old rigs, offers a real measurement of market preference for this new technology.
This is not a new phenomenon. The drilling industry retooled and replaced rigs many times in its past, moving from
cable-tool rigs to steam-powered rotary rigs, to diesel mechanical rigs, to DC electric rigs through the 20th century.
Each successive evolution was catalyzed by slowly diffusing realization by E&P customers that newer technology
offered greater efficiencies and safety, and each required 20 to 30 years to fully complete, roughly tracking the
expected economic life of a rig.
The fact that oil and gas increasingly becomes more difficult to find contributes to these evolutionary cycles. New
technologies like deviated well pads, hydraulic stimulation, horizontal drilling, extended reach drilling, deepwater
development, sub-salt opportunities, Arctic development require increasingly sophisticated drilling tools. When
needed, the industry builds out entire new drilling tool kits to respond to new opportunities, like when it launched
offshore development out of sight of land with new offshore rigs beginning in 1947 with Kerr-McGee Rig 16. The
industry proceeded to order 542 jack-ups over the next 35 years, averaging about 15 a year, as it honed and optimized
offshore drilling practices on the Continental Shelf.
Similarly, today we believe that the build-out of a new drilling tool kit for deepwater development is well underway. Its
target is the roughly 2/3 of the planet covered by deepwater, which can only be drilled with a deepwater floating rig.
The normal progression of the oil business starts with exploration and if successful development drilling and
production to monetize the discoveries. And within the deepwater, so far so good. 182 discoveries have been
announced in the last 10 years in water depths of 4,500 feet or more, with 1/3 coming in just the last two years.
This appears to us to paint a convincing picture of rising deepwater drilling needs, as the industry shifts to drilling
intensive development, which should also drive demand for FPSOs where we have been busy strengthening our
offering with our APL acquisition last quarter.
The industry entered this century with a very old rig fleet, with perhaps 7,000 land and offshore rigs around the globe,
and with very little investment through the preceding 20 years. The fleet operated day to day by cannibalizing the
overhang of stacked rigs, in essence replacing capital consumed in the drilling process from the excess of idle rigs
available. This is an important concept for NOV. From a financial perspective between about 1983 and 2005, the
industry appeared able to execute its critical task of drilling year in and year out without having to spend real cash to

replace its capital assets.
While depreciation is a non-cash cost in the short run, if drillers want to remain in the drilling business in the long run,
they absolutely must replace their assets, which does cost cash. Drilling consumes a rig. Depreciation is the imperfect
financial measurement of that consumption.
Excess rigs ran out in 2005. Depreciation once again became a real cash cost for drillers, and new rig building began in
earnest and NOV's fortunes improved. We believe this turning point signaled that rig building got back into a broad,
normal retooling and replacement macro cycle. Things went great until late 2008 when the financial crisis hit, and
credit evaporated and commodity prices turned down. I think you all probably remember that.
Nevertheless, we believe the macro cycle remains intact and merely took a breather as credit dried up, and now it's
resumed in earnest. Our conviction in the macro cycle wasn't shaken by the downturn. Quite the contrary. Oil above
$100 a barrel in today's weak economic climate underscores the need to drill more. With nearly 3/4 of the jack-up fleet,
over half the floater fleet and the vast majority of land rigs around the world more than 25 years old, how does the
world grow production over the next 20 years, 30 years, without building a bunch of rigs?
The sharp resurgence in orders we are seeing is characterized generally by more established offshore participants
placing orders, many in view of their very old fleets. This has been catalyzed by a combination of three factors. First,
day rates have remained strong for newer, more sophisticated rigs, where utilizations are running 90% or more,
compared to 70% or less for older rigs. Second, shipyards in Asia are hungry and seeking to replenish their depleted
backlogs and, therefore, offering lower prices for hulls.
This, together with lower pricing from us and other suppliers, have reduced the all-in cost of offshore rigs 15% to 20%.
Better day rates and lower investments lead to good financial returns on these projects.
Lastly, the shipyards have offered easy payment terms; 20% down and 80% at delivery. I'll stress that NOV has not
joined in. We remain steadfast in our progress payment requirements, which helped us avoid project cancellations
during the downturn. And with regard to our pricing, we have been able to reduce our costs through the deflationary
downturn. So we expect to continue to post good margins on the new incremental work.
Our Land Rig business turned down somewhat in the fourth quarter, surprisingly, after steadily rising in the second and
third quarter of 2010, but we believe this is a momentary pause. Demand for land rigs in the Middle East, Iraq in
particular, and the Far East have been strong for the first few weeks of 2011. Interestingly, we see North American
drillers anxious to develop quasi-proprietary rig designs which they can brand as their own, incorporating components
from other suppliers or supplying certain owner-furnished equipment or performing their own rig-ups, which can and
does lead to inefficiencies in the manufacturing process and, ultimately higher costs.
In contrast, many international drillers, particularly those engaged in IPM work in remote locations where problems are
usually more difficult to remedy, want, out of the box, NOV solutions. Downtime costs in these operations is
exacerbated when the driller also has numerous other completion crews and equipment and capital waiting on the well
to TD. NOV's fourth quarter also saw very strong demand for well intervention and stimulation equipment like
blenders, frac equipment and coiled tubing units for the blistering hot North American pressure pumping market.
Quoted deliveries are beginning to stretch out partly because we find it surprisingly difficult to source components like
trailers, truck chassis, cranes and transmissions in a timely manner. Additionally, the market seems to continue to move
towards larger-diameter coiled tubing solutions. Across all our products, we are hearing rumblings of higher steel and
alloy costs within the past few weeks, but we generally place purchase orders soon after we receive signed contracts to
hedge against cost inflation, and in certain higher volume products we purchase to forecast to stay ahead of the cost
curve.
We were pleased to see Petrobras open the long-awaited tenders for deepwater rigs during the fourth quarter and set up
a holding company to move forward with purchasing of rigs following its successful capital raise in September. The
energy they've exhibited around these new rigs continues to point towards a forthcoming large order, probably in the
first half of 2011, for the first tranche of rigs. But this remains subject to a final decision by Petrobras and could see

further delays.
We believe NOV is well-positioned to execute these projects, and we have been laying preparations for in-country
content for the past two years. Interesting to note that the range of bids, from $664 million to $824 million per drill
ship, came in considerably lower than predicted by nay-sayers. This will be a challenging project for all involved, but
we are certainly up to the challenge.
Interest in shale plays continued to drive North American activity in the fourth quarter, and we share the general
concern about a looming gas bubble in the U.S. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the very high level of interest in
shale technology coming from NOCs and IOCs that want to take it to new continents. Unconventional shale production
in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East offer the potential to turn into new incremental sources of demand
for new rig, directional drilling and pressure pumping equipment.
As I mentioned, we closed APL late in the quarter so it produced essentially no contribution to the year's P&L.
Strategically, this is a terrific addition for us, adding turret technology to NOV's cranes, mooring, riser pool and hose
reel systems that we can offer as an integrated package into FPSOs that can now exceed over $100 million. We expect
the business to add a couple of hundred million in revenue annually, but initially margins will be low until we are able
to complete our integration over the coming year. Quotation activity began rising early last year after essentially
nothing in 2009 and appears to be building steadily. We are delighted to welcome the APL employees to the NOV
team.
Like many, we are watching the events in Egypt closely and have evacuated most of our expats and foreign nationals
except for a few safe on offshore rigs. Last year, Egypt accounted for $47 million in revenues for NOV. We don't yet
know what the financial impact of events will be in the first quarter.
Finally, I want to thank, like Pete, NOV's terrific employees for producing such a strong result this year. We move into
the new year with a sterling reputation for executing well for our customers delivering great service, products and
technologies to keep the oil business humming around the globe. This is entirely due to the dedication and
professionalism they exhibit daily. Thank you. You are the best in the world.
Now let me turn to our segment operating results. National Oilwell Varco's Rig Technology segment generated
revenues of $1.757 billion in the fourth quarter, up 6% sequentially and down 11% compared to the fourth quarter of
2009. Operating profit was $501 million yielding operating margins for the group of 28.5%, a decline of 60 basis points
from the third quarter,10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009. Incremental operating leverage, or flow-through,
was 20% from the third quarter sales gain of $107 million and decremental leverage, or flow-through, was 30% from
the fourth quarter of 2009 on the $220 million revenue decline.
We typically expect incremental leverage for the segment to run 30% to 35%, but this quarter saw smaller sequential
contribution due mostly to higher levels of incentive compensation accruals at year end, higher receivables reserves and
project cost accruals and a higher mix of lower margin land drilling and stimulation equipment sales leading to 20%
sequential flow-through. Non-backlog revenue declined 1% sequentially due to lower sales of small capital equipment
that doesn't qualify to run through the backlog. After-market sales rose slightly from the third quarter to the fourth of
2010.
Overall, revenue out of backlog improved 10% in the fourth quarter, but revenues from higher-margin, large offshore
projects declined 9% sequentially, which was more than offset by gains in Land Rig revenues and other capital items.
This mix shift contributed to modestly lower margins for the segment in Q4 and will likely continue to cause margins
to move down over the next few quarters. Generally, the higher operating margins seen in the first half of 2010,
peaking above 30%, reflect projects sold at exceptionally high pricing in 2007 and 2008 being executed in a much
lower cost, deflationary environment in early 2010.
As the mix of this high-margin work has moved down the past two quarters, margins have followed. Within the past
several weeks, however, we have begun to achieve modest pricing leverage, again, in certain products; les bon temps
rouler. For the full year, Rig Technology generated $7 billion in revenues and $2.1 billion in operating profit, or 29.7%,
compared to $8.1 billion in revenue, $2.3 billion in operating profit and 28.3% operating margins in 2009.

Year-over-year decremental flow-through was held to only 19% as operating margins improved on a lower revenue
base, due to favorable cost variances year over year, steady ascension of the learning curve and continued outstanding
execution of the backlog. The Rig Technology group commissioned nine new offshore rigs during the fourth quarter,
bringing our total to 32 for the year and over 100 offshore rigs since 2005.
Looking in at the first quarter of 2011, we expect Rig Technology revenues to decline in the mid-single-digit percent
range sequentially and post modestly lower operating margins in the mid-to-high 20% range.
The Petroleum Services & Supply segment generated total sales of $1.137 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010,
representing a 4% sequential increase from the third quarter and a 21% increase from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Operating profit was $170 million, up $6 million from the third quarter and operating margins were roughly flat at
15%.
Year-over-year incrementals were 31% on the $201 million revenue improvement, excluding charges, in line with
expectations. But fourth quarter sequential operating leverage, or flow-through, was lower than expected at 13%. This
was due to a variety of factors, including start-up costs in new operations in the Middle East and Brazil, mix changes
within tubular services as domestic pipe mills and processors slowed, offset by gains in other lower margin pipe
services, higher costs in Latin America across a couple of product lines, lower solids control margins and additional
incentive compensation accruals within certain business lines within the segment. Additionally, sales of higher-margin
drill pipe and coiled tubing products declined sequentially, following strong third quarter results for both, another
adverse mix shift.
Modest sequential revenue growth was evenly spread across most major areas, albeit with mix shifts from product to
product. Brazil, Russia and the Middle East posted some of the largest sequential gains, along with good sequential
improvement in the U.S. centered in the liquids-rich shale plays, like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford.
Downhole Tools posted strong sequential growth on higher sales in the Eastern Hemisphere Canada and U.S. shales,
with drilling motors and borehole enlargement tools in particularly high demand.
Drill pipe orders slowed slightly this quarter, as dwindling budgets and holidays slowed increase late in the year, but
the first few weeks of 2011 have seen orders pick back up. Drill pipe margins improved in the fourth quarter due to a
lower mix of Chinese pipe sales. The mix of 4-inch XT drill pipe continues to rise, as the industry appears to be
adopting this as the standard for horizontal shale drilling. Generally most products throughout PS&S have begun to
face rising steel costs but are also implementing price increases to offset.
For the full year 2010, Petroleum Services & Supply segment generated $4.2 billion in revenue, up from $3.7 billion in
2009, $585 million in operating profit, up from $453 million in 2009 and operating margins of 14%, up from 12.1% in
2009. Year-over-year operating leverage, or flow-through, was 30%. Looking into the first quarter of 2011, we expect
Petroleum Services & Supply segment sales to grow in the low single-digit percent range sequentially and post
improved operating margins in the mid to high teens.
Turning to Distribution Services, fourth quarter sales in the segment were roughly flat with the third quarter at $423
million, but operating profit improved nicely to $30 million or 7.1% of sales. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009,
sales increased 28% and operating margins nearly tripled due to an exceptionally strong flow-through of 24% on the
year-over-year sales gains. Typical flow-through for the group runs at about 10% or so, so we are pleased with the
strong incremental and resulting margins for the group.
The fourth quarter saw sales into the BP clean-up effort on the Gulf Coast move down about $23 million sequentially,
but this was offset by improvements in international operations, mono industrial sales in Europe and artificial lift sales.
The Caspian region also posted a nice pick-up due to a small acquisition in Kazakhstan. Canada improved nicely
sequentially in the Cardium and Bakken shales, as did the U.S. Bakken across the border. Across North America, the
group continued to sell consumables into new land rigs going into service. The group continued to expand its presence
in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas with two new DSCs.

For the full year, Distribution Services segment posted sales of $1.546 billion, up 15% compared to $1.350 billion
posted in 2009. Operating profit was $78 million for 2010, up from $50 million in 2009, and margins were 5%
compared to 3.7% for 2009. Year-over-year flow-through, or operating leverage, was a solid 14% for the group. For the
first quarter of 2011, we expect Distribution Services revenues to come in about flat with the fourth quarter of 2010 at
comparable margins.
Turning to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter income statement, SG&A increased $24 million due to
higher incentive compensation accruals, tax consulting costs and higher bad debt accruals. SG&A as a percent of sales
was 11.8% in the fourth quarter, up from 11.6% in the third quarter. Transaction and restructuring costs were $1
million, down slightly from the third quarter. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine joint venture was $14 million, up
from $8 million in the third quarter due to non-recurring third-quarter maintenance and improved profitability on higher
green tube and OCTG sales. We expect similar profitability in the first quarter of 2011.
Other expense improved $16 million sequentially, due to the non-recurrence of FX losses posted in the third quarter.
FX loss within this line was only about $1 million for the quarter. The tax rate for the fourth quarter is 30%, up slightly
from Q3, and for the full year the tax rate was 30.8%, substantially better than the 33.3% posted in 2009. We expect the
tax rate for 2011 to be in the range of 31%.
Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental schedule, was $76 million in the fourth quarter, up $6
million from the third quarter, due mostly to higher legal expenses associated with acquisitions, tax consulting costs
and incentive compensation accruals. Depreciation and amortization was $129 million, up $2 million from the third
quarter. EBITDA, excluding transaction and restructuring charges, was up $54 million sequentially to $768 million, or
24.2% of sales, and totaled $3.07 billion for the year, up slightly from 2009.
National Oilwell Varco's December 31, 2010 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $3.5
billion or 27.5% of annualized sales, down $248 million from the third quarter, due primarily to higher and billings in
excess of costs and lower inventory. Total customer financing on projects in the form of pre-payments and billings in
excess of costs, less costs in excess of billings, was $25 million at December 31, representing a sequential improvement
of $151 million.
Cash flow from operations was $807 million for the fourth quarter, up $354 million sequentially, and totaled $1.5
billion for the full year. CapEx increased $30 million to $92 million in the fourth quarter, bringing full year CapEx to
$232 million. We expect CapEx in 2011 to move up into the $450 million range as we pursue a number of expansion
opportunities launched last year.
Free cash flow, equaling cash flow from operations less CapEx, was $1.3 billion in 2010 before acquisitions and
dividends. Cash spent on acquisitions totaled $556 million and dividends paid to our shareholders totaled $172 million
during 2010. Finally, National Oilwell Varco's cash balance was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010.
Now let me turn it back to Pete.
Merrill A. (Pete) Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Clay. Listen, I just want to make a couple more brief comments about what's going on, we think, around the
world and first off let me hit the driving forces again.
Clay mentioned technology and the advances in technology, and one of the things that I've been talking to a lot of
people about is the differential between chronological age and technological age. And I think many times we kind of
take a look at a rig maybe only being 20 years old, but when you look at that on a technological age aspect it's a lot
older because of the advances we're making. It's very similar to Moore's Law when you take a look at this in IT and
you're doing the same sort of thing with rigs.
I would offer the difference in a rig from 1980 to 1990 was de minimis, whereas the difference in a rig from 2000 to
2010's large. It's huge. And I think that's one of the things that's driving the bifurcation of the rig market. And we also

think that's what's going to continue to increase the demand for the deepwater rigs that we're building, the jack-ups that
we're building and also the land rigs that we're building. So we think there's a very bright future out there for this.
The second driving force that I talk about all the time is shales and if you take a look at this – and the neat thing right
now is that you're seeing the transfer of rigs from the gas shales to the oily shales. You know, you take a look at the
Bakken, the Niobrara, the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash, the Monterey shale in California now, these are starting to pull
rigs out of the gas market. But I think everybody has been waiting for the gas market to get to town, but because of
these oils now, they're able to pull these in there so the rig count's staying fairly decent. So I think they're going to
continue to be there.
Also, CNOOC just announced another investment, I think, this week in the Niobrara. And CNOOC's doing this, again,
to get ownership, I believe, of some of the gas here, but also to learn. And a little data point I will talk about here is that
we have sold, in recent weeks, a lot of top drives into China. Now top drives in China have been a very good market for
us for the last 10 years. However, there's been a little flurry of activity here recently, which would indicate that they're
getting those rigs set up to be able to drill shale-type wells into China as they learn this.
So I think it's, again, a small indicator, but I think it's there and so we're excited about the aspect of shales. Poland,
there's been a lot of leasing activity there recently, and I think recently Total announced some things in Argentina. So I
think you're starting to see the expansion of shales worldwide. It's going to take a little while. It's going to be slow, but I
think as that builds up over time, that's going to play very well for us.
On the international front today, as Clay mentioned, North Africa's a little dicey right now. There are some things that
we think we're getting ready to pop in Algeria and other places, but I think it's going to be more of a wait-and-see
attitude at this time. The other parts of the Middle East though, especially Kuwait, Oman and Iraq, look to be very
positive. So we think there'll be some good things that'll be happening there, both on a land rig basis and some of the
shipyards in the Middle East, especially in the UAE, are starting to heat up again. I think as the shipyards get filled in
Korea and Singapore, those shipyards are going to come on and I think that'll lead to some more incremental business
for us.
West Africa continues to be a good area. I think it's really going to be a positive area for FPSOs. As you take a look at
Latin America, it's a little bit of a mixed bag; places like Colombia, Argentina and of course, Brazil, are very positive.
Mexico's somewhat iffy, and then, of course, Venezuela is, I think, as you've probably heard about on a lot of calls, just
not a very positive place for anybody at this point in time. But I think you'll see some positives in Latin America and
Brazil. It's going to be both – they're starting to pick up a little bit even onshore. So I think that's going to be some very
positive areas for us.
Let me just reiterate one thing Clay said, and that's on the backlog. We would tell you announcements don't equal
orders. We're very strict in what goes in our backlog, and even though we know we're going to be successful on some
things, we don't put it in the backlog until we have a contract and some money. So I think we're very positive about
what's going on right now, but, again, announcements don't necessarily equal orders. So it's always tough to balance
that out. But we see a lot of good things happening.
And I will also mention that we've talked about coiled tubing an awful lot. And I think coiled tubing is finally here.
You take a look at it. It's had a lot of promise, but I think there's some really promising developments, especially in the
shale. Our coiled tubing business up in Fort Worth is doing wonderfully. We're expanding our coiled tubing
manufacturing line here in Houston. We're going to add a fifth line, and I'm very excited about the prospects for coiled
tubing.
One final thing I want to talk about is over the last couple of years, the markets have been pretty tough. I think we've
weathered it very, very well. But one of the things that we've done is we've made sure that we took advantage of the
timeframe in which we could do some different things. And just as an example, we're building two new fiberglass pipe
plants overseas. We've got three coating plants going up; these are state-of-the-art, going to allow us to optimize. We've
taken our logistics chain on Grant Prideco pipe, and we've been able to compress that so we can become much more
flexible in hitting our customers' needs. We've expanded our repair and maintenance facilities in our Rig Solutions

group.
So we've been spending money and incurring some cost in anticipation of being able to accelerate out of a downturn
when things start improving. And I think we're positioned well to be able to do that. So I like what we're seeing today.
I think our results speak for themselves, but I like the backlog starting to build again and I think things look pretty
decent over the next year or two for what we're doing.
So given that, John, I'd like to turn it over to any questions that our listeners might have.
Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill
Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Herbert>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Herbert>: Pete, back to the broader narrative here with regard to what Clay described persuasively here
as the resumption of the macro retooling and replacement cycle and then your added observation in terms of differences
between chronological and technological age.
And I guess with regard to comparing this recent blossoming, if you will, or this resumption, if you will, with regard to
the new construction cycle versus what prevailed '05 versus '08 when, you know, 100 odd floaters were ordered. What
are some of the key prominent differences with regard to this next wave versus what prevailed last time, and why don't
we start with regard to your market share and how that may have changed?
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Well, as you probably know, Bill, visiting with me many times, we don't talk about
market share. We just like where we are in the market.
<Q - William Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: And we'll do very, very well. I'm not overly concerned about that. To the first part of
your question, though, let me tell you, I think one of the big changes right now, and you hit it right when you said this
is a resumption of the cycle. I think some people said we're in a new cycle, but quite frankly I think this is just a
resumption of a cycle that ended abruptly with some of the problems that occurred in late '08, with Bear Stearns and
Lehman in the like so...
<Q - William Herbert>: Right.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: I think this is a continuation of what started then. What you're seeing today, I think,
are two things that are pretty interesting. First off, this is being led by the established drilling contractors. You're
talking about the big boys that are getting in there and coming in and buying stuff. And I think last time it was a little
bit more, I wouldn't say speculators, but more of the non-traditional customers were the ones that started it back in '05,
'06. I think that's a big difference. I think the positive there is that, with the established guys doing it, I think you'll also
see some of the non-traditional folks come back in.
The second one that I think is pretty critical is that there is the understanding now to let the shipyards build it. And
you're seeing very – it's almost a turnkey type situation with the shipyard and what's there, whether you're Hyundai or
Samsung or whomever you're quoting 550, 600, 620, whatever the price might be.
<Q - William Herbert>: Yeah.

<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: And then it's incumbent upon them to work with us to get the rig built. And if you take
a look at the history that you go back to '06, '07, '08, the rigs that were built like that came out on time, on budget. And
they came out very, very good. So I think those two elements are interacting in there today, and I think you'll see the
contractors go in there and say, yep, build this thing, deliver it and let's go. Those are the two major elements, I think,
that are different.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. And Bill, can I add a third to
that? I would say, too, that the out-of-the-box standard proven rig designs are the way to go.
<Q - William Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: The projects that got into trouble
were from owners that tried to be too clever with regards to saving a little money here or rearranging something there
or insourcing from a less-proven supplier. So I think, hopefully, the industry generally, I think, has learned that the way
to go is to let the shipyards, to let the drilling equipment providers who do this for a living execute on that on standard
proven rig designs and stay away from the more exotic schemes.
<Q - William Herbert>: Okay. And secondly, how long do you think the current floater construction cost window, up
about $600 million for a high-end drill ship, stays open?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: I think it's going to start moving up,
Bill. As I mentioned, we're starting to see steel prices move. There's been a lot of ink spilled here in the last month or
two on commodity prices around the globe, particularly developing economy's seeing some inflation. The current
window of discounting on offshore rigs, I think, has been helped by lower steel prices. It's been helped by favorable FX
moves and really a pretty deflationary environment for the past two years, and it appears to us that that's going to be
going the other way here soon. So I can't tell you precisely, but for customers listening, we'd say order now.
<Q - William Herbert>: Okay. Lastly from me, with regard to shipyard capacity, how much headroom is left? And
with regard to the name brand shipyards, Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, et cetera, if you were to order a new rig today,
the delivery date would be when? So how much running room do we have, and how long before – what's the lead time
with regard to getting a rig today?
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: I think, Bill, that there's still head room, and I think they're talking – as you take a look
at this, what's going on in these shipyards today, when we started this back in '05, '06, it was like three, three-and-a-half
years.
Today, they're quoting a lot of these in two, two-and-a-half years. Now the reason they can do that, though, is because
of the experiences that we've gained over the last four or five years. I mean, we've really become efficient. We've been
able to cut a lot of manhours out of this. And so I think you'll see a little bit more rapid throughput.
<Q - William Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: At some point in time, you'll hit some inefficiencies and that'll change that. But still, I
think when you look at the Korean shipyards, Samsung, Hyundai, these guys are big and they know what they're doing.
They probably don't have as many tankers as they had back in '06, '07, '08 when they were taking those orders. So I
think there's still good head room, and so I think there's still some promising potential out there.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: We also think that the payment
terms are probably going to become a little bit tougher; that the easy payments terms that I referenced in my
comments...
<Q - William Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: ...Are likely to pass and we're
probably going to see the shipyards become a little bit more demanding on the payment here pretty soon.
<Q - William Herbert>: Yeah. Thanks very much guys.

Operator
Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Just wanted to, on the PSS front, could you talk a little bit about, you mentioned some things on
drill pipe. You mentioned in the past about the consumption of drill pipe given what's going on in shales and obviously
the premium content for the deepwater. So I just wondered if you'd give us a tad more color on what you see on drill
pipe order trends, what kind of mix we're talking about and are we at a point here where you can say we're close to an
inflection on drill pipe demand?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. I think we are. The last few
quarters, we've seen orders rising book-to-bill through most of 2010, north of one. As I mentioned, though, Q4 dipped a
little below that and revenues came down a little bit. We think that was a holiday slowdown. People had used up their
2010 budgets, and so we think that was a temporary thing and the month of January seemed to indicate that, as well,
because it came back better in January. So that's what's going on with the recent orders.
Generally, 2010 was characterized by much smaller drill pipe purchases for smaller diameter in size drill pipe
purchases for land rigs, specifically for the shales. And we've talked in the past about four-inch drill pipe with XT
premium connections which is our offering into that market becoming standardized for the shales. And that's kind of a
new size, weight and grade of drill pipe that works the best in the style of drilling that's underway. So we saw a lot of
customers scrambling to get that kind of pipe.
What cycled down in 2010 was the sale of large diameter, very sophisticated premium strings for these floaters. There
was a bunch of ordering that happened in late '08 and through 2009 for the new builds. That slowed this year; however,
there's now over 100 rigs out there that have not yet ordered pipe and so we think that the outlook for that is pretty
good for 2011. That's important for us because that's a little higher margin pipe for us and higher dollar per foot pipe
for us; considerably higher dollar per foot pipe for us. And so we think we're pretty well situated.
But the usage trend that you're talking about was something we find fascinating. The old rule of thumb – you go back
20 years ago, people used to think in terms of drill pipe lasting five years under normal circumstances. And today,
we're hearing from operators that's it more like two-and-a-half or three years. And it's a combination of things.
First, the wells are a lot tougher. That drill pipe's being bent around a 90-degree angle. It's being rotated on its side. Just
the wear and tear, because of the complexity of well paths, is wearing out drill pipe faster. Secondly, if you think about
the implications for drill pipe usage coming out of more efficient rigs that can move more quickly, that pipe is spending
fewer days on a truck being moved between wells and more days actually in the hole drilling each year than it would
have been under these old rigs that are out there.
So as these new rigs come on, they're actually spending a lot more time in the hole, making holes, and so that's helping
speed up the consumption of drill pipe. So we're seeing our thesis buying Grant Prideco in 2008 was that drill pipe is
becoming much more of a consumable, and actually it's probably even beating what we expected back then in terms of
the rates of consumption.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And if you can, as you take a look at 2011 and your varying product lines within the PSS group,
on a relative basis, which one do you think has the most opportunity to get net pricing increases in 2011? Which one or

two do you think has the best leverage? Which one or two has the least leverage?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yes. Coiled tubing certainly has
been in high demand, as Pete mentioned. Again, drill pipe coming on from the offshore, again, looks pretty good. I'll
say, broadly, most of our products and services within PS&S reported just starting to get a little bit of pricing leverage
in the fourth quarter. And it's 1% here and 2% there, so it's not much yet, but starting to stick.
We're also – the inflation we talked about in steel, we're seeing that in labor and a few other things and I think that's
well known by our customers. And so I think we're just now starting to get a little traction on pricing leverage. So we
think we might be able to make some gains there in the coming quarters.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: And I'd add, Kurt, that Downhole Tools, we've got a lot of new products coming out
and I think as you talk about these shale wells, when you're talking about hole openers and different types of bits and
motors, even wall staters, things like that, I think we'll get some leverage there that's just associated with the increase in
technology that we see in these areas. So we continue to push, as a company, on the envelope in all of our areas on new
product development, and I think that in itself enhances your pricing capability.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And if I may, just on the FPSO side, you said you got – sounds like a good year of
integration to work through before you start to see some of the improvement in the margins. So what kind of an
improvement would you expect to see, say, exit 2011, from where you are now, and could you give us some additional
color on some of the challenges you're facing?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. The business came in at – it's
a great business: large installed base, over 50 turrets around the world in service, great intellectual property, a bunch of
terrific engineers who really know what they're doing. They typically outsourced most of their fabrication, and a big
part of our business plan now is to insource that into existing NOV facilities.
So for instance, in Korea where we have a large assembly capability that we acquired a couple of years ago and is busy
next door to the shipyards, we can also put the APL turret offering into that network. A lot of the suppliers to the
business are suppliers that we also use, and so I think we'll have some leverage there. But generally, I think this
business is pretty similar to other Norwegian very technical engineering-oriented businesses that we've acquired in the
past, that tended to outsource, and so this is, for us, a pretty well-worn path in terms of how to get the profitability up.
But it does take some time, and so we're not expecting a – it is – we do expect it to be modestly accretive to earnings in
2011, and that should improve quarter by quarter as we get these improvements, these integration improvements
layered in.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Thanks, Kurt.

<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Morning, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Morning, Marshall.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Morning, Marshall.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: We've had a bunch of new build announcements, obviously, the last few months. Clay, I
think you mentioned you had, in this last quarter, a couple of deepwater and a handful of jack-ups. Without getting too
specific, can you give us some sense of what percent of those that have been announced, say, over the last quarter or so,

have actually been awarded?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Pretty – it's small.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: That's what I would assume, but I just want to get, you know...
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yes.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: 10%, maybe?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Man, I don't want to quantify it.
We'll – suffice to say you've seen a bunch of announcements, a lot more rigs out there, and I think NOV's reputation for
being able to execute well on these things is positioning us very, very well as the cycle resumes.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: And what happens, Marshall, on the process to give you a little bit of an indicator, if
somebody announces it, and they may have an LOI with the shipyard, and what happens is we negotiate many times
with both the contractor and the shipyard and we really don't put it into our book until we've signed the final contract,
in most cases the way it's going right now, with the shipyard, in some cases with the customer directly. But that's one of
the reasons there's a little bit of a time gap. So when you see something that says an LOI, the chances are real good that
they're still in the negotiating process with the shipyard, and so that's really the process that's going on.
There's a lot of it out there that we know we're going to get, but as we've told you throughout the years, we're real strict
on the backlog and we don't – I think the history of what happened, if you go back to '08, we had $12 billion and
everybody was worried about our backlog getting canceled and it didn't get canceled, a very small portion of it. And I
think that's because of the strictness that we have on putting stuff in that backlog. So there's a pretty good time gap
between the announcement and the order.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: So if I say of the ones we've seen lately just a fairly small portion of those seen any, have
been awarded at this stage.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: They weren't awarded as of 31 December 2010. Yeah.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Got you.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Yeah.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Got you.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: We're a month into this and there's some things that have happened in the past month,
but that's, this is, this counts off 2010.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Okay. Clay, you mentioned the financing. We know that the shipyards have been offering
pretty attractive financing terms. How much of this new order cycle we've seen really surge in the last two months is
that financing, and are we just bringing forward what might have evolved over a two-year period just because the
financing's easy?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: I think so, Marshall. I haven't run
particularly detailed numbers but have had seen some other analyses of the intrinsic economics of building rigs right
now. I think the returns are decent, the old historical rule of thumb, is 15% rates of return on these investments and I
think we're at that or better. I think the financing is the icing on the cake that probably just makes it a little easier for
customers to move forward.
I'll add, too, I think behind the financing that's being offered in a lot of these places is a lot of government export
agency trade financing that's out there. The export agencies that we work very closely with around the globe really
stepped up when the credit markets turned down two years ago to try to catalyze some work and keep credit flowing,
and so what you're seeing now is the effect of that.

<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Okay. And just to clarify last thing here, you mentioned pricing, of course, from the peak has
come down 15% to 25% depending on what you're looking at.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Did you participate in that price reduction pro rata, or is that more the shipyards and the steel
in percentage terms?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: They're down a little more than us.
We are down, but nevertheless our margins are pretty good and what's helping our margins is the fact that we've seen
the costs come down. And it's a combination of deflation that we've talked about, but also just the learning curve
effects, as Pete mentioned earlier. We've been able to take a lot of hours out of the things that we do, the lessons that
you learn. Our folks are really good at capturing those and putting them to work on the next version of the rig. And so
those two things have let us whittle our costs down, and with the downturn of the market the last two years, we've
shared some of that with our customers.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Great, thank you.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: You bet.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Thank you, Marshall.
Operator
Our next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz from Weeden. Please go ahead.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Thanks very much. I'm going to try one more time, you mentioned that there's 100 rigs out
there that haven't ordered pipe. Is the number of rigs that haven't ordered drilling packages half of that?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Good try. So that's the – you know
they order pipe late in the process and they'll tend to order pipe – if you go back to 2008, our drill pipe business was
very, very busy, backlog was very big and we were quoting a little later deliveries. And our customers were aware of
that, so they tended to get in the queue a little earlier.
So a lot of that pipe flowed out in 2009. Well, in 2009 and 2010 our drill pipe business slowed down. So they know
they've got a little more time before they move forward with that. But, you know, things are heating up and so that's
why we think 2011, we'll see more of those folks show up and place orders for pipe for those offshore rigs.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Okay. But you know the question is really about the drilling packages?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Oh, was it?
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: I thought you were interested in pipe, Geoff.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: All right. You know you talked about the pricing. I think you said that pricing leverage is
coming back into the Rig Tech product lines. Is that correct?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yes.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Okay. So we're seeing a turning point. When you factor all the dynamics that you're seeing
into it, and you did say you expect Rig Tech margins to move lower, are we thinking in the vicinity of the 50, 60 basis
points range on a sequential basis?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. We've been talking about
margins moving lower for some time. We've seen this coming.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Right.

<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: And you've seen it last two
quarters, and, again, our guidance guides it down through the high 20s down into the mid 20s, sequentially, we've sort
of guided along that glide path.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Right, which, well, seems a little bit more conservative than your actual performance.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. We've, well, again what
we've been pleasantly surprised is the continued really good execution by our folks [inaudible] and quarter by quarter.
So internally we've been surprised at how well they've been able to take advantage of the downturn in the economy and
lower costs and done a really good job putting up better margins than we expected.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Okay. And clarification. You did close the APL acquisition in the quarter? Where did their
backlog go?
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: It's included in our $1.4 billion.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Can you give us a little breakout on that?
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Yes. Geoff, we're still parsing through it because we had to make some determinations
on some risk analysis associated with it because the backlog wasn't quite developed the same way as our rules are. But
I would tell you probably about $100 million, right in that vicinity.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yes.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: So about $100 million of the $1.4 billion orders?
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Right.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Okay. So that – bringing their backlog in, you just treat it as new orders?
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Yes, but we're not going to get in there and break the backlog down into little pieces.
So that – but that's, again, there's still some parsing we have to do on that, and as we look at some orders, we're liable to
deduct a little bit more there. It just depends. But it's not anything that's overly material.
<Q - Geoff B. Kieburtz>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Merrill A. (Pete) Miller>: Okay.
<A - Clay C. Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Thank you.
Operator
That will be the last question. I'll now turn it back to you, Mr. Miller, for your closing remarks.
Merrill A. (Pete) Miller

first quarter of 2011. Thank you very much.
