O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List, and good morning to all participants. We appreciate your time and interest in today's discussion of
Regions' first quarter 2011 results and the progress we're making in a number of key areas, all of which are contributing
towards restoring Regions to sustainable profitability. I'll begin by covering highlights and business results and David
will provide additional details on the financials a little later.
Regions reported first quarter earnings of $0.01 per fully diluted share or $17 million, marking the second consecutive
quarter of profitability. While still elevated, credit-related costs, which include our provision, OREO expense and
losses on held for sale, declined to the lowest level in almost two years. On an after-tax basis, these combined costs
were an estimated $0.26 per share. Additionally, we had $0.04 per share benefit from security gains. Core business
performance continues to improve, with adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue up 16% year-over-year.
Sequentially, expenses adjusted to exclude prior quarter's debt extinguishment loss dropped 4%. The net interest
margin rose seven basis points. Average commercial and industrial loans outstanding grew 4%. Average low cost
deposits increased 1% and our regulatory capital ratios improved incrementally. From an earnings perspective, we're
clearly not performing at a level that we want or need to be but we are making continuous progress.
The pace of economic recovery is slow, especially in our southeastern markets, but our focus on core business and
customers is paying off. We're gaining share of market, adding new customers and expanding existing relationships.
According to a recent report issued by Temkin Group, Regions ranked as a top bank in customer experience and as one
of the top companies in America for customer service across all industries. We also received national awards from
Greenwich & Associates for overall client satisfaction in middle market and for relationship management performance
in the company's small business lending. We are clearly starting to distinguish Regions as one of the most
customer-friendly banks in the industry. And at the same time, we're improving productivity and efficiency and taking
steps to expediently and prudently deal with credit challenges still present in our more stressed portfolios.
Turning to Slide 2, we're especially encouraged with first quarter's sharply lower net loan charge-offs and provision,
since improvement in credit quality and related costs is a primary key to restoring Regions to sustainable profitability.
Net charge-offs and provision dropped $200 million or 29% linked quarter. Our provision covered net charge-offs, and
although it is likely to remain elevated, it is expected to trend down throughout 2011. As credit quality metrics continue
to improve, we'll continue to evaluate reserve levels and be very disciplined in our reserve methodology process.
Gross non-performing loan inflows were down for a second consecutive quarter, or over $200 million less than in the
fourth quarter. Delinquencies fell for a fifth consecutive quarter and criticized and classified loans declined.
Non-performing assets steady fourth to first quarter, reflecting less sales activity and fewer pay-downs. Again this
quarter, the mix of problem loan inflows was increasingly income producing commercial real estate which has a lower
potential loss severity and based on the cash flows, has the potential for restructure. Also we continue to be very
disciplined and cautious in our credit quality reviews, causing us to classify a number of credits as non-performing
when we see signs of weakness, even though these customers may be current and paying as agreed.
In the first quarter, we further enhanced our balance sheet position. We were able to grow commercial and industrial
loans for the third consecutive quarter as average balances grew 4%. We remain diligent in improving our deposit cost
and continue to positively shift our deposit mix with average time deposits declining to 24% of total deposits down
from 30% a year ago.
We ended the quarter strong as well with low cost deposits, which improved $1.9 billion or 3%, driving deposit costs
down another five basis points to an overall 59 basis points on total customer deposits. And we have achieved a total
company funding cost of 86 basis points including all debt.

Growing fee-based revenue in our business is critical. It's a component of our strategy to restore and grow normalized
earnings. Given regulatory and legislative changes, it's not been an easy task but we believe that our focus on
customers, service, a broad array of product offerings, and increasing emphasis on appropriate cross-sells gives us an
opportunity. First quarter is typically challenging for fee-based revenues. Nonetheless, we were able to grow adjusted
non-interest revenues approximately 4% year-over-year.
Additionally, in spite of seasonal factors and regulatory rule changes, we were able to maintain reasonably steady
service charge income for the first quarter. While these rule changes will continue to present a challenge to growing
service charge fee income, we're proactively developing and implementing strategies to mitigate the negative impact. In
fact, over the last three quarters, we have migrated all free checking accounts to fee eligible accounts. Specifically
regarding the Durbin amendment, we are hopeful that the candid dialogue between regulators, legislators, merchants
and banks result in a reasonable and prudent delay of the implementation of this amendment and allows proper debate
and comprehensive analysis.
By delaying the implementation, it will give all interested parties more time to analyze pricing and consequences of the
proposal. We are hopeful that the outcome will be more rational than the plan currently proposed, one that not only
takes into account bank entities actual costs of delivering debit cards including fraud, but also the potential unintended
negative consequences to the individual consumer on debit card availability and participation in the banking system.
In the unfortunate event that a reasonable and prudent delay does not occur, we have developed actions to respond to a
July 21st implementation that helps us mitigate the financial impact of these required changes. Given the extremely
short timeframe for implementation, it will be challenging to effectively communicate the changes to our customers
and our associates, but we know our customers and our markets very well, and we remain confident that over time, we
can make the necessary changes to protect our business.
Our planned business adjustments not only include changes to fee schedules, but also include new product innovation
and a very disciplined approach to improving productivity and efficiency. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in
the first quarter, given seasonal hikes in payroll taxes. Our goal is keep full year non-interest expenses, core expenses,
somewhat below 2010's level, while continuing to make necessary investments in business and technology.
Turning to Slide 3, we are seeing promising improvement in quality loan demand as total loan production amounted to
$13.3 billion for the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Our business services loan production for the first quarter totaled
$11.1 billion, which was a 17% increase over first quarter of 2010. We are seeing especially strong middle market,
commercial and industrial loan production as loan outstandings have now grown for nine consecutive months. Notably,
up 65% of the markets we operate grew commercial loans in the first quarter. Both new client acquisition and line
utilization are driving the growth.
Commercial industrial line utilization rose to 41.7% this quarter, up from year end 2010's 40.3%, which is the highest
since September 2009. However, line utilization still remains well below our historical rates, which typically posted in
the high 40% range. Our overall commercial sales pipelines remain strong, given expectations for a continued U.S.
economic recovery, commercial and industrial outstandings should continue to grow throughout 2011, albeit possibly at
a slower pace than we're currently experiencing.
Branch small business loan production, while still a relatively small component, is also strong, benefiting from our
increased focus on this channel. On the consumer front, although pay downs continue to outweigh new production as
consumers continue to de-leverage, we are seeing signs of an improving loan production. Consumer loan production for
the first quarter was higher year-over-year with the largest components, mortgage and home equity, up 13% and 12%
respectively. Also, we are experiencing higher origination volume in our indirect auto portfolio as production rose to
$255 million this quarter.
We have now signed up over 800 auto dealerships and expect this number to reach 1,200 by the end of the year. But
keep in mind that our focus is on profitable growth, not volume. We will remain disciplined both in risk taking and
pricing. At the same time, we're working hard to grow profitable quality loans outstanding, we are still actively
de-risking our most stressful portfolio segments. For example, investor commercial real estate loans were reduced

another $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Our de-risking strategy and customer de-leveraging suggests that our overall
outstanding loan portfolio balances will remain under pressure for the remainder of this year.
Near term, our lending revenues will be under pressure, but our efforts to improve pricing and production of new loans
is working to offset the impact of de-risking and de-leveraging. We continue to positively shift loan and funding mix as
well as improve loan spreads and deposit costs in order to minimize the negative effect of lower earning asset levels on
this year's net interest income.
On a final point regarding the recent comprehensive capital analysis and review, I want to reiterate that Regions did not
propose any immediate capital actions. The company's position of repaying the government's TARP investment in a
prudent and patient manner on shareholder friendly terms remains unchanged. Our return to sustainable profitability
and demonstrating improvement in asset quality are key conditions that will enable reasonable repayment. As our core
business continues to improve, we believe this will bode well for us in our eventual capital actions.
Now David is going to provide you with financial details and I'll – I will return with some closing comments. David?
David J. Turner
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our first quarter 2011 results on
Slide 4. First quarter results generally matched our expectations, as efforts to improve credit quality, reposition the
balance sheet and curb operating expenses continued to pay off. EPS was $0.01 per share and net income available to
common shareholders amounted to $17 million.
Pre-tax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, totaled $539 million. However, on an adjusted basis, PPNR was $460
million, which included some net adjustments such as security gains, which is detailed in the Appendix. Adjusted
PPNR was up $63 million or 16% year-over-year and flat linked quarter despite seasonal factors, such as day count.
Within PPNR, net interest income declined 2% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonality. However, year-over-year,
net interest income rose 4% and the resulting net interest margin expanded to 3.07%.
Non-interest revenue totaled $843 million, while adjusted non-interest revenues were $764 million. This was 4% below
the fourth quarter, which benefited from Morgan Keegan's strong revenues, particularly investment banking. However,
as Grayson mentioned, first quarter adjusted non-interest revenues were higher than a year ago by 4% or $30 million.
Non-interest expenses were 8% lower than the prior quarter, and on an adjusted basis, demonstrated significant
improvement dropping $44 million or 4% fourth to first quarter, favorably impacted by a decline in legal and
professional fees as well as credit related expenses.
Let's now take a more detailed look at our credit results beginning with non-performing loan inflows. As shown on
Slide 5, inflow of non-performing loans continued to moderate, declining $217 million to $730 million or 23% less
than fourth quarter. On the chart on the left, as indicated in blue, the biggest decline in inflows was in our land, condo
and single family portfolio, which decreased $168 million or 64% linked quarter. This portfolio, which now totals only
$2.8 billion, down from $5 billion a year ago, had historically been the biggest driver of our inflows.
Income-producing commercial real estate continues to contribute to our non-performing loan inflows, accounting for
31% of first quarter's migration compared to 29% in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that income-producing
commercial real estate credits generally provide greater cash flows, and therefore, may result in restructuring
opportunities, and in our experience, have less ultimate loss potential. A substantial portion of our non-performing
loans continues to be current and paying as agreed. Notably, 38% of our March 31 total business service
non-performing loans were current and paying as agreed. Up slightly from the fourth quarter, but 10 percentage points
higher than a year ago.
Turning to Slide 6, non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined $73 million. This quarter, we sold
fewer non-performing assets or $219 million compared to $405 million in the fourth quarter. At this point in the cycle,
analyzing real estate values, we believe that loan restructurings will become more economical than loan sales. The
graph to the right shows that delinquencies dropped for the fourth straight quarter. Additionally, criticized and

classified problem loans declined for the fifth consecutive quarter and were down approximately $700 million from
fourth quarter's level. These two asset quality indicators serve as important measures in estimating future inflows of
problem loans and support our expectations for continued improvement in non-performing loan migrations going
forward.
Moving on to Slide 7. Net charge-offs declined to $481 million or an annualized 2.37% of average loans, the lowest
level in over two years. As our loan loss provision [audio break] (19:11) charge-offs and with the decline in
non-performing loans, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loan ratio increased from 101% to 103% at March
31st. Declines in non-performing loans gross inflows and non-performing loan balances will be key determinants of our
future quarterly provision needs.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 8 breaks down this quarter's change in loans and loan yields. Average loans declined
2% with investor real estate portfolio de-risking efforts offsetting strong middle market commercial industrial growth.
Aggregate loan yield declined three basis points to 4.31%. This decline was driven by interest rate hedges that matured
during the first quarter. Excluding these hedges, our loan yield would have been slightly higher as we remained very
disciplined when pricing new loans being sure that we are appropriately paid for the risks we are taking.
We continue to see strength in our middle market commercial industrial loan portfolio, with average and ending loans
up 4% and 3% linked quarter respectively. Demand is broad based from both an industry and market standpoint. Our
customers' increasing investment in capital expenditures and M&A activities are driving much of our commercial
growth.
In addition, we are also beginning to see customers increase inventory investments primarily due to rising commodity
prices. Total commercial and industrial commitments rose $700 million linked quarter to $27 billion at March 31st.
Our commercial industrial line utilization rates are just over 41%, which is well below our historical norm. In fact, 25%
of our business service customers with a commitment have zero outstanding balances.
We continue to make progress in de-risking our investor real estate portfolio with ending outstandings declining
another $1.1 billion in the first quarter, to $14.8 billion. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced this portfolio almost
$6 billion, including a 60% decline in construction. Reducing our investor real estate portfolio to no more than 100% of
the bank's total regulatory capital or approximately $14 billion has been top priority. Additionally, going forward we
will continue to assess the appropriateness of this target.
As noted on Slide 9, ending and average deposits were up 2% and 1% respectively driven by strong low cost deposit
growth. Over the past 12 months, average low cost deposits have risen 6% compared to a 23% drop in time deposits.
This positive mix shift continued in the first quarter producing another five basis point decline in our overall deposit
costs to 59 basis points. Our shift in funding mix to low cost deposits is also favorably impacting total funding costs,
which declined five basis points to 86 basis points.
Turning to Slide 10. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined $14 million linked quarter or 2% primarily due to
fewer days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. However, net interest income was up 4% over the same
period in the prior year.
Additionally, the first quarter net interest margin improved seven basis points to 3.07% and was attributable to slower
prepayments resulting in lower premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio, lower deposit costs
and reduced average cash balances at the Federal Reserve. We continue to re-price our CDs at market rates, and in the
second quarter, we have an additional $3.6 billion of CDs maturing that carry an average rate of 2.16%.
While excess liquidity remains a drag on the margin, the effect is gradually diminishing. Excess liquidity negatively
impacted the margin 10 basis points this quarter down from fourth quarter's 11 basis points. In addition, non-accrual
interest reversals and non-performing asset balances reduced first quarter's margin 16 basis points.
During the first quarter, we executed sales of $2.4 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities resulting in $82 million
of security gains, the proceeds of which were re-invested in similar securities, with slightly longer duration. Barring
unexpected movement in interest rates, we expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable for the balance of this

year.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue on Slide 11. Total non-interest revenue amounted to $843 million
for the quarter, and on an adjusted basis, totaled $764 million compared to an adjusted basis of $795 million in the
fourth quarter. Adjustments in the first quarter primarily included $82 million of security gains, and in the fourth
quarter, included $333 million of security gains, $26 million of loan sale gains and $59 million of leveraged lease
termination gains, all of which is detailed in the Appendix.
Although adjusted non-interest revenues grew 4% year-over-year, they were down linked quarter primarily due to a
14% drop in brokerage and investment banking revenue, as well as seasonal adjustments for day count. As you may
recall, Morgan Keegan's fourth quarter revenues benefited from several sizable investment banking transactions. In
spite of seasonal challenges and regulatory changes, service charges were down only slightly linked quarter. Our
customer focus and superior service quality are continuing to produce strong debit card volume and excellent fee-based
account growth.
Depending on ultimate regulatory changes related to interchange fees and implementation timing, we face fee income
challenges in 2011. However, we have developed mitigation strategies to rationalize our business under the proposed
rule changes. For instance, we began migrating accounts from free to fee eligible last May and now all of our checking
accounts are fee eligible. Also our quality accounts, which is we define as a checking account that has at least ten
customer transactions and/or $500 in average balances per month, increased 2.2% this quarter, when compared to the
same period a year ago. And we continue to see a record level of penetration with our new checking account customers,
who are electing to have a debit card 90% of the time.
Although mortgage originations were down on a linked quarter basis, resulting in a $6 million decline in mortgage
income, they remain strong compared to historical standards and were 13% higher compared to the same period a year
ago.
Turning to Slide 12, first quarter expenses were down despite the seasonal jump in payroll costs. Total non-interest
expense was $1.167 billion for the quarter, or 8% lower than the prior quarter. Excluding adjustments in the fourth
quarter as detailed in our Appendix, adjusted non-interest expenses dropped 4% linked quarter. This was driven by
declines in credit-related expenses, such as other real estate expense, which declined 36% to $39 million. Also
contributing to this decline were professional and legal fees, which were down $11 million or 12%.
Nonetheless, credit-related expenses remain significant accounting for 6% of first quarter adjusted non-interest
expenses. Over time, we expect these expenses which have been approximating $300 million to $400 million annually,
to subside. We remain focused on strengthening our core franchise through productivity and efficiency initiatives. As
the chart on the bottom illustrates, we have reduced our head count by over 3,000 positions or 10% in the last two
years. We will continue to rationalize our franchise constraining expense growth without sacrificing investment
opportunities.
Slide 13 provides a snapshot of our healthy capital ratios and favorable liquidity position. Tier 1 Common is 7.9% and
our Tier 1 ratio stands at 12.5%. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company is solid as we have a bank
loan-to-deposit ratio of 84.4% and cash at the parent company is above our policy minimums of maintaining a
sufficient level of funding to meet projected cash needs which includes all debt service, dividends and maturities for the
next two years. Overall, this quarter's results provide solid evidence that our actions are moving us toward our goal of
sustainable profitability.
Now let me turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David. In summary, we are making progress and showing signs of improvement through solid core
business performance, which included growth in commercial loans, continued improvement in low cost deposits and
margin expansion. We will be persistent in further improving productivity and efficiency and even though credit costs

remain elevated, we are committed to expediently and prudently dealing with our lagging credit challenges.
I will end by emphasizing that our strategy for restoring Regions to sustainable profitability is working. Recovery and
rebuilding take time but with each quarter that passes we are making progress. We believe that by keeping focused on
the customers and our business fundamentals that Regions franchise has the markets, the customers, the associates, the
talent and products to, over time, generate attractive high quality returns for our shareholders.

Thank you, Grayson. We'd like to ask that in the question-and-answer session, that you please limit your questions to

hour timeframe allotted for the call. Thank you, in advance, for your cooperation.
Operator, let's open it up for questions, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question is on the resi-mortgage TDRs. Barb, I was wondering if you
could give us an update on how the re-default rate is trending and whether or not you're getting more new requests or
you're reaching out more to your customers to restructure some of the firsts.
<A - Barb Godin>: Thanks, Erika. Yes, we are continuing to reach out to customers. And our recidivism rate is
actually running at 20%, so a little bit down from what it was last quarter but still holding within that 20% to 22% that
we've reported for all prior quarters. We still have a very active customer assistance program. Also making sure we're
going out and also reappraising the book.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: And my follow-up question is, David, on your comment that loan restructuring is now more
economically attractive than loan sales, should we expect your TDR bucket to continue to increase but sort of the NPL
decline and the associated charge-off would be the same? I guess restructuring in AB fashion gets you to recover more
or retain more than if you had sold it in the secondary market as a note? Or am I reading that correctly?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think the – what I'm saying is we expect that restructurings generally result in better
economics for us because you're not having to pay for the liquidity that you're provided when you sell a loan. So as a
result of restructurings if we continue down that path, you should see increases in TDRs as a result, but the charge-offs,
we would expect to be mitigated to some degree versus a straight up sale. We would do an AB note restructure as you
mentioned, and continue to have economics with the whole credit versus selling it. So that provides better opportunity
for us to have a recovery, and we realize we also continue to have the credit risk associated with that note. So we're
careful on the restructurings, and we'll do that when we think the overall economics are in our best interest.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Thank you.

<A - David J. Turner>: On a core basis.
<Q - Brian Foran>: And then I guess looking further out, I mean, post the AmSouth Regions deal, it seems like at
some point expenses would get down to like $1 billion a quarter. And I realize that a lot of time has passed since then
and there are some investments that are required and everything like that, but I mean how should we think about the
long term expense basis? Is there an opportunity at some point to kind of realize the efficiencies that were pent up in
the merger?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I mean, Brian, to your point, we've recognized a lot of those efficiencies, but given the
cycle that we're in, we do believe there's more savings there. We've mentioned that we're incurring in a $300 million to
$400 million per year with just credit-related expenses right now that we believe will go away as credit continues to
improve. We do have further efficiencies as we think about rationalizing our markets and rationalizing our business that
we can continue to execute on when the time is right to do things like that. So you can see our number in the first
quarter on an adjusted basis was $1.167 billion and you can affect that for roughly $75 million to $100 million just with
credit-related expenses. So we do have efficiencies on top of that to come.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, and we are still driving efficiencies throughout our business. We're down another
250 positions from a head count perspective in the first quarter over fourth quarter, and we're continuing to achieve
quite a bit of efficiencies across a number of discretionary spending categories and we'll continue to do that going
forward.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: We are hearing though about some price competition...
<A - M. List Underwood>: Hey, Matt, Matt, start over.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We missed the first part of your question. It was not coming through.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Sure. Is this is better?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. Just overall the C&I loans have been growing nicely in the past I think it's three
quarters but we are hearing about some price competition out there in that area. And I'm just wondering what kind of
spreads that you're seeing in the C&I bucket and how that compares to a few quarters ago?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I mean there's no doubt that there are in the Commercial and Industrial space, there
are certain segments in that, have clearly become more competitive. I would tell you that when you look at it in terms
of spreads and yields, we still are seeing an improved level of spreads and yields on our new production on
Commercial and Industrial over and above what we were getting. It has gotten more competitive. You do hear of
transactions that would indicate that there's a lot of spread and yield compression on some of these new transactions,
but I would tell you that when you hear those anecdotally, but when we dig into the data, and we really analyze what

we're putting on the books, we're still very pleased that we are getting compensated for the risks we're taking and are
pleased with the spreads and yields that we're able to achieve.
<A - David J. Turner>: I would also add that when we think about the footprint that we operate in, and really focus on
service quality in the relationships that we're building with our customers, that relationship allows you to not just sell
on price. We don't want to be a volume price institution. We want to be providing proper service, fair price – we want
the relationship, because we want the total customer, not just the loan. And we're able to – we think we're able to
maintain the spreads that we need even though there's stronger competition out there. The Commercial middle market
small business really provides an opportunity to really work through the relationship and get paid appropriately.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. We can obviously see some of that in the average loan yields overall which have
been stable even though the loan mix has been de-risking here so that makes sense. And then just my follow-up
question. If we look at the NPA reconciliation table, the resolutions and return to accruals came down a bit versus the
last couple of quarters. I'm wondering if there's some seasonality there or is it just there were a couple of good quarters
there in 3Q.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I'll ask Barb to answer that directly. But there is some timing issues that fall into that
regard. As we've started working on restructurings with some of our business customers, that in this particular quarter,
we had less of those that were seasoned to a point to return to accrual than prior quarters. Barb?
<A - Barb Godin>: Yeah, in addition to that, third and fourth quarters are normally our seasonal highs as you properly
already pointed out. For restructures, re-accruals, we wait on not just financial statements, we typically don't get most
of our audited financial statements in until sometime late in the first quarter, into the second quarter again then
providing an opportunity for the restructures in the third and fourth quarter. And then some good news is that several
accounts that we were planning to actually re-accrue, actually paid us off in full. So again I'll take that tradeoff as well.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: It seems like that we're starting to put some numbers out there to help us gauge around what
normalized earnings would look like with the credit costs and the provisioning. I was trying to kind of step-wise from
what you were saying to try to get to maybe where you're kind of guiding us in a range. If I take the earnings this
quarter and back out the security gains, that puts us at about a $0.03 loss. You then go through the credit cost of $0.26
so that puts us at about a $0.23 profit or about $0.92 a year. And then, in addition to that we can add about $0.15 if we
improved our margin about 25 basis points from where we're at. So that would put us somewhere around $1.07 or at
least north of $1. David, how are you thinking about that? What are your – you're kind of giving us some clues. I just
wanted to try to cobble them together in your overall thought process?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, the cobble was right. No, we are trying to give you – obviously we're not going to give
you earnings guidance but we're going to give you bits and pieces. It's still obviously a very fragile economy. You can
kind of look at our PPNR over time and see where you ought to be able to – if you stay at that level, can actually get
pretty close to where our – you think our projected PPNR will be.
And the story for us in terms of ultimate profitability is what the credit looks like. We certainly are making progress on
migration, early and late stage delinquencies and those trends and potential problems. All those are trending better and
we're feeling better about credit. We still have a robust reserve and strong coverage of non-performers so we're

adequately reserved there. And I think just as our charge-offs continue to improve, then you can start – that's the key as
to what will that look like in a "normalized world" and when will it be normal?
So I think we've given you some tidbits. Your math you were going through is reasonable but we are going to stop
short of giving specific guidance.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then my one follow-up will be, when you're talking about credit costs and the $0.26 per
share, and that includes loan loss provisioning, are you putting that to a normalized level? Or are you just backing out
all provision?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah. We're backing out this – what happened to this quarter, backing it all out.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: So that would not be a normalized level, but would be all of the provisioning that you had this
quarter?

Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore Partners.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - M. List Underwood>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Can you talk to us at all about what the potential problem loan number was for the quarter? I
know you just indicated that it was trending better, but do you have that amount? And then also how that may convey
into your outlook for NPAs here, just given the decline in inflows this quarter?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I'll start and let Barb finish up with the other part. Our potential problem loan number
that was in our annual report was about $800 million. And then you saw our migration of $730 million during the
quarter. We are actually in the process of pulling that potential problem loan together. It will be in our first quarter
10-Q which we expect to file the first week in May. So we don't have that number yet, but in terms of trends and NPAs,
Barb?
<A - Barb Godin>: Yeah. What we would look at is, for example, our 90 day plus. As you can see, the 90 day plus
number was down, our criticized number was down, our classified number was down. I would anticipate that our
potential problem loan number will likely follow that same trend. But again, we don't have those numbers pulled
together yet. But all of the signs we're seeing are that it's a little more positive than what we've seen previously.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And then my follow-up is, that being said, can you talk to us about your thought process
around when you can start to see the ability to under-provide here and release some reserves? I know you had
mentioned before you'd need to some sustainability in terms of credit trends. It looks like we're starting to see that here,
so could we expect some under-provisioning materializing next quarter?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we haven't mentioned specific quarters in terms of when that would happen. What we've
tried to do is give you the things we looked at that we think are the biggest drivers. And that obviously is our
non-performing loan migration and then our resulting non-performing loan balances. And those are key influences on
our methodology. We have been and will continue to be prudent with regards to how we establish the reserve and we
will follow that methodology, and when it indicates we can provide less in our charge-offs, we'll do so. But we are
going be cautious and prudent with regards to what we ultimately do.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Craig.
<A - M. List Underwood>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Just really a follow-up to Matt's second question on the NPL resolutions. It looks like –
well, really slow resolutions kind of drove the lack of improvement in NPL balances this quarter, and it sounds like
from your kind of answer that the 1Q run-rate was fairly clean, so what I'm wondering is, how do you expect NPLs
over the next quarter to decline? Is it really from lower inflows? Because if we don't get higher resolutions at this point,
it will be tough for balances to decline.
<A - Barb Godin>: Well, we actually do anticipate resolutions to go up. What we think is that they were seasonal,
number one, and number two, as Grayson had mentioned, there's a six month seasoning period for any that we have
gone ahead and restructured before we can actually put them back to performing status. So we see all of that. As we
look at our pipeline, we see some opportunities that are existing in there right now for us.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And I'll – to add to that, if you look at the release, we actually sold this time roughly $219
million in problem assets. And off from $405 million last quarter. We're being much more disciplined around the
economics of those sales. First quarter appeared a little seasonally low for where we would have anticipated coming in.
We're going to continue that disposition strategy, but we're going to balance it as David said and Barb have said, with
more focus on restructuring, but we're going to continue to dispose. And we do think that there were a number of
seasonal factors that drove our non-performing assets and non-performing loans to not come down more than they did
this quarter. And we would anticipate an improvement in that going forward.
<A - Barb Godin>: Just one follow-up from myself is that in some of our normal loan sales we have some what we
call re-trading that happened at the end of the quarter where we had some of the buyers come back and want to talk
about terms and structures. And we decided to step away from some of those conversations and have those
conversations again this quarter instead of just going ahead and executing at potentially a lower price or a poorer loan
structure than we otherwise would have done last quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, and the other thing, you can't see it in numbers but the number of notes that we sold,
the number of properties that we sold this quarter was actually more than we sold in the fourth quarter because as we
have been on this disposition strategy for some time, we're getting down to smaller and smaller dollar value assets. And
they still take roughly the same amount of time regardless of the dollar value, but we actually moved more properties
this quarter than last.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Got it. And then just a follow-up, given kind of two quarters here of profitability, and given
your expectation of NPA balances to decline then, I'm wondering how does this change kind of your expectation for
TARP repayment?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, it really doesn't change. We are clearly focused on making sure we sustain our
profitability, and that we show a clear turn in credit. We believe that that's the appropriate thing for us to do, and we're
going to let the results speak for themselves but our strategy really has not changed at this juncture.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi. How are you? I was wondering, I heard your comments just about the fact that loans
continue to be net pressure on loans, but I'm just wondering with the – there hasn't really been a change in the delta on
the loan shrinkage side. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how low can low go? Meaning, do you
have an understanding of where do you think the bottom will be before that C&I growth and the stabilization of some
of the runoffs levels out?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Ken, this is David. I'll tell you in kind of global terms what we've been saying is we
expect that total loan balances to drift down a little bit in the first half of the year, have a little bit of recovery in the
second half such that we come close to finishing about where we started. So I think what we're going to do is we're
going to continue to de-risk on the investor real estate. That has slowed somewhat. Last year I think our average was
about $1.5 billion a quarter. This past quarter we're about $1.1 billion. So we see that decline slowing somewhat, and
we have had growth in C&I for nine months. We'll see some seasonality and slowness in the first part of the year here
and it will finish stronger in the second half. So all that is predicated on where the economy goes. So that's our best
guess on total loan balances right now.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Because in our internal forecast we've still got a fairly modest economic growth factor that
we're looking at, and so when we're making internal projections on loan growth, we're being prudent and conservative
in that regard. Where we're trying to judge on total outstanding loans, we're trying to judge really three issues. Is, one,
how much new production on both the business and consumer side will we be able to generate? Those numbers are
encouraging. Our production numbers are up substantially across every line of business. We're also trying to judge just
exactly what the pace of decline on the investor commercial real estate portfolio will be. We've made several
projections. As David said it has slowed, but we still are reducing the size of that portfolio substantially and has
exceeded our earlier expectations for where we would be today.
We are still seeing – the third issue is consumer de-leveraging. When the consumer stops de-leveraging or slows down
that de-leveraging process, then we'll start to see some decent growth on the consumer loan side of our business, and
we are introducing new products and will be over the next several months to try to grow that consumer side of our
business. And as we said before, we really would like to get to sort of a 50/50 mix between business and consumer
loans on our balance sheet.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Got you. And then, Grayson, you just hit on part of my follow-up, which is within the CRE
business understanding the 100% of equity limitation that you mentioned earlier, first of all, I guess are you seeing any
gross loan opportunities start to percolate in the CRE side? And is that 100% limit any type of major limit on your
ability to kind of reengage in the CRE market?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No. I think that several months ago we came out with an internal goal of reducing that
portfolio to no more than 100% of risk based capital, and we'll achieve that this year, and feel pretty confident in where
we'll be. Quite frankly, we have the other concern. Our concern is that while we are seeing some opportunities in the
investor commercial real estate space, they're very limited. And we're not seeing new production opportunities rebound
with any materiality. And if they don't, then we'll see that portfolio decline below that $14 billion mark, which is not a
problem. And as David said in his comments, we continue to reassess just exactly what our targeted outstandings in
that business should be going forward.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<Q - Scott Valentin>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regard to the tangible common equity
level, it slipped just a tad below 6%, and was curious on I guess your comfort level there and whether there's any type
of decision to consciously grow that level back up?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I mean from a capital standpoint, obviously we're impacted by the realized gain or loss
changes as a result of the 10-year moving around. We really focus and run our business looking at Tier 1 Common as
the predominant capital measure. We're at 7.9 there. We dipped just below six on the tangible side, but we don't see
anything that causes us concern, that makes us want to believe we need to go raise capital outside of a TARP
repayment. That's been our consistent theme throughout the quarters when we receive that question and it's true today.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay. And just a follow-up question, if I may. On the securities portfolio, I think it grew pretty
substantially this quarter from the fourth quarter. And I think you also referenced the fact that duration increased a little
bit. Just curious if you can give us color around what's happening with the securities portfolio?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we obviously when you don't have a tremendous amount of growth in the loan
portfolio, you have to put the cash somewhere so we're in the securities book. It's higher than we want it to be. We have
a very safe investment portfolio. We take very little credit risk there. We primarily have used that for liquidity. But we
will – you can't just look at duration of the investment portfolio. You really have to look at the construct of our entire
balance sheet. So, we're very cognizant of the duration and the risk that is embedded within that with risk of a rising
rate environment and when we see the opportune time, we'll reposition and put those to work, securities to work
differently. So I think right now, we think it's the right answer. But we are looking very closely at it and as
opportunities arise, we'll make different decisions.

Your next question comes from Greg Ketron of Citigroup.
<Q - Greg Ketron>: Good morning.
<A - M. List Underwood>: Good morning.
<Q - Greg Ketron>: A couple of questions. One, on mortgage income. It looks like your mortgage income held up
better than what we've been seeing across the industry which has been down anywhere from 30% to 40%. Maybe just
some color on why your mortgage income levels held up better?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, when you look at the mortgages, no doubt we're starting to see a drop in application
volume, which is typical to see this time of year as a seasonal issue. But we actually saw mortgage bookings ahead of
where we were last year. We are seeing a shift to where – from refinancings to new home purchase. Refinancings
dropped this particular quarter just over 50%, 51%, I believe was the exact number, and that's down substantially from
where it was at last quarter.
We are not, as rates have increased, we're not seeing the kind of application volume we were seeing, but in the first
quarter, we had strong results really for work that we had established late in the fourth quarter. And we are gaining
share on a number of competitors in our market. And I think this next quarter's really going to tell the story because I
mean typically the second and third quarter are your biggest quarters for mortgage origination. And we're really going
to find out what that market's going to do in the next quarter or so. Encouraged by where we're at but concerned with a
declining level of application volume.
<A - David J. Turner>: Greg, this is David. I think that it may be that some of the fears have repurchases and the
losses associated with a repurchase in that mortgage income line item. We actually account for that in our NIE and that
number's pretty small for us. We hadn't gotten caught up in the issue that others have had. So imagine repurchase losses

credit expenses. If you were to normalize that number, what level would that be longer term?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, I think that if you look at a large percentage of that $300 million or $400 million ought
to go away in time, and the question is when. So you can – it won't be every dollar for dollar but it will be a substantial
majority of that number we think in time will go away.
<Q - Greg Ketron>: Okay. So it could approach close to zero or something pretty insignificant?

Your next question comes from Chris Gamaitoni of Compass.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: Thanks for taking my call. On the REO side, could you give us a little more color around
how expenses REO expenses decreased quarter-over-quarter given the fallen home price HPIs, increased foreclosure
time lines and general amount of disturbance in the foreclosure industry?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think that I'll let Barb follow up but from an expense standpoint, there's really two
components that drive that expense. One is just your normal operations, taxes and property maintenance and those
kinds of things, which is a smaller piece of that total and the others are valuation declines. And so we think when we
take charges because we foreclosed something that growth that's running through our charge-off number. So what you
see there are any subsequent valuation changes, and we've seen those valuation, depending on what market you're in,
we see some of the valuations starting to stabilize, others are not. And that's why you see the number we have at $39
million. But Barb, anything you want to add?
<A - Barb Godin>: No, my follow-up would be if you look again to last quarter it was $61 million and compare that to
$39 million this quarter, that in and of itself was primarily made up of the difference of the valuation charges. Property
preservation expenses have stayed relatively flat on the properties we have, and again, as you said foreclosure time
lines are extended. They're still running somewhere around that 20 month, 22 month mark in Florida. And again, that
leads into our numbers as you've seen.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: And what's your policy to re-evaluate those assets while they're in REO again?
<A - Barb Godin>: We do it on a six month basis.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: And they're just kind of...
<A - David J. Turner>: We do that on a six month basis but if we evaluate property and there's one next door to it,
then we will use that particular appraisal as an indicator of valuation of the other properties. So it's a little misleading
just to say six months because we – it's incumbent upon us to get the mark right every quarter.
<Q - Chris Gamaitoni>: Okay. And then kind of in the same breath as REO, do you participate in any of the REO
exchange programs that were outlined by the OCC in their March 24th letter?
<A - Barb Godin>: No, we don't.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah. If you look at it, really as I mentioned a moment ago, it's a combination of increased
line utilization, which has been an encouraging sign as we saw a little bit of our Commercial and Industrial customers
starting to access those lines. We had initially thought that they would access their liquidity that they're keeping with us
in depository accounts before they started accessing the lines. It appears that's not happening, that they're accessing the
lines and holding the liquidity. When you look at the products that – when you look at the reasons why that, as we said
earlier, you're seeing some capital expenditure activity that had been put off for quite some time and now they're at the
juncture that they are spending again for capital projects. In addition, we're seeing quite a bit of M&A activity where
they're using the opportunity to acquire assets and competitors in what has turned out to be a slow recovery
environment. I'd also mention that we've got a number of specialty industries that continue to show strength. We've
mentioned them in the past.
I would say the strongest of that group right now is in the energy sector, but we also are seeing strength in
transportation, and healthcare has been sort of a solid performer for us all along. It continues to perform. And those are
the segments that predominantly we're seeing the opportunities in.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then as – on the credit side for C&I and CRE, alike obviously a big step function
down on your NCOs this quarter. Just wanted to understand on the CRE side, was that related to any specific lumpiness
in the prior quarters? Are you now at a run rate to continue to improve from here? Or do you see that there's still some
lumpy exposures in there that could drive that number to be volatile?
<A - Barb Godin>: There's still going be some lumpy exposures. Certainly a lot less volatility – a lot less product
relative to the outstanding balances. What we did see is that the land, single family and condo, that they contributed to
the in migration – it fell pretty dramatically between quarters. It's going to bounce around a little bit as we come out of
this as one can expect. But we do, again, see some volatility in those numbers.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Good morning. Thanks, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: It's still morning here.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: I wanted to ask about you about – the regulatory DTA looks like a small amount, $40
million was disallowed this quarter. I'm wondering if it was just driven by a lower forecast of earnings or it hit some

sort of limitation.
<A - David J. Turner>: It was primarily driven by the fact – if you look at the gross number, it was up $80 million. So
$40 million of that we counted in capital and $40 million of it was disallowed just based on the math. So it really wasn't
a dramatic change. We also went over a year so there's some impact to the tax credits that we have in terms of how the
math works on the allowance calculation. But really look at the gross, going up $80 million, and half of that going into
the calculation as being the big driver.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And so I guess if – with that answer, I suppose there's
no – there's no read-through to potential of GAAP DTA change there?
<A - David J. Turner>: Right. There's no issue from our perspective in terms of realization from a GAAP basis.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
