Thomas Rogers
Thank you, Natalia. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. In a moment, John will take you through the fixed
income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards he'll be happy
to take your questions.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our [ph] SEC
(1:07) filings, including without limitation, the risk factors section of our 2016 form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to John.

John C. Gerspach
Hey, thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover a number of topics. First, I'll briefly discuss
our second quarter and first half 2017 results. Second, I'll cover the recent balance sheet trends, notably growth in cash,
loans, and deposits. Third, I'll review our issuance program and provide updated issuance guidance for 2017. And
finally, I'll discuss our liquidity and capital position, which remains among the strongest in the industry.
For reference, slide 3 summarizes our second quarter and first half 2017 results. In the second quarter of 2017, we
reported net income of $3.9 billion. For the first half, we reported net income of $8 billion and achieved an efficiency
ratio of 58% as well as an RoTCE of 9.7%, excluding the impact of the disallowed DTA.
On slide 4, we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars. On this basis, our
balance sheet increased by approximately 4% from the prior-year period. As we will discuss in greater detail in a
moment, we saw healthy loan growth in both our Consumer and Institutional businesses. And we increased cash as we
built the liquidity necessary to support our resolution planning. However, we expect to reduce our cash balances over
time as we optimize the balance sheet.
Slide 5 presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars. Total Citigroup loans increased 3%
year over year and 5% in aggregate across our Consumer and Institutional businesses.
In our Consumer business, average loans grew 8% year over year, driven by 12% growth in North America. This
included a 25% increase in branded cards, driven primarily by the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest
organic growth.
International consumer loans increased 1% year over year, as growth of 7% in Mexico was partially offset by a 1%
decline in Asia, as we continued to optimize our portfolio in that region.
On the Institutional side, loans grew 3% year over year, driven by growth in lending in our Private Banking segment.
Corporate lending declined 1%, as we saw a lower level of episodic borrowing needs compared to the prior-year
period.
Sequentially, we saw good growth as we supported core business activity among our global subsidiary clients. TTS
loans increased 4%, driven by growth in EMEA and Asia. At the same time, our loans included in Corp/Other declined
by 36%, as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
On slide 6, we show credit quality trends in our GCB and ICG loan portfolios. In GCB, NCL rates improved in every
region this quarter. And in ICG, total non-accrual loans declined to 64 basis points of total loans, with improvement in
every region during the quarter.
Turning to slide 7, we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars. Total deposits
increased 3% from the prior-year period, as we saw strong customer engagement across all major businesses and
regions.
Now let me highlight our Parent Benchmark Issuance program, starting on slide 8. Year to date, including the $6 billion
we issued earlier this week, we have issued a total of $18 billion of parent-level benchmark debt, including over $17
billion of senior and roughly $1 billion of subordinated debt. While this week's issuance consisted of all callable
structures, we will continue to evaluate the economics of all structures, including bullets, and expect to issue a mix of
structures as well as tenors and currencies going forward.
On slide 9, let me cover our issuance and redemption expectations. In 2017, we continue to expect gross issuance of
approximately $25 billion of parent-level senior and subordinated debt, including the roughly $18 billion we have
issued year to date. $8 billion of debt matured so far this year out of a total of $15 billion expected for the full year. We
expect buybacks in the range of $2 billion of benchmark debt in 2017, including the roughly $1 billion we have
repurchased thus far. This combination of new issuance, maturities, and redemptions would result in net issuance of
benchmark debt of approximately $8 billion this year.

In 2017, we now expect approximately $20 billion of bank-level issuance, including the roughly $15 billion of credit
card securitizations and bank notes we have issued so far. We have increased our bank issuance plans in order to
lengthen the tenor of our funding and expect a commensurate decline in our short-term borrowings.
On slide 10, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the second quarter, our total
long-term debt increased to $225 billion, primarily due to credit card securitizations as well as benchmark issuances at
both the bank and parent. And the weighted average maturity of our TLAC-eligible debt increased to 7.8 years.
Turning to slide 11, we update our TLAC requirements and ratios. As of the second quarter, we reached a long-term
debt ratio of 4.7% of total leveraged exposure, relative to our requirement of 4.5%, and achieved a $4 billion surplus, a
$1 billion increase from last quarter. While our binding constraint under the TLAC rules has changed from the
long-term debt requirement as a percentage of our risk weighted assets to the long term debt requirement as a
percentage of total leveraged exposure, we remain in line with our expectations for compliance and do not expect this
change to impact our future issuances.
As we've noted previously, now that we have reached compliance, we are working towards establishing an appropriate
buffer. While still preliminary, we currently believe a reasonable buffer would be in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion
based on current balance sheet expectations.
On slide 12, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading-related
revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corp/Other. Total net interest revenue was roughly flat
year-over-year in constant dollars at $11.2 billion, as growth in core accrual revenue was offset by the wind down of
legacy assets as well as lower trading-related net interest revenue.
Core accrual net interest revenue of $10 billion was up 7%, or over $600 million from last year, driven by the addition
of the Costco portfolio, organic volume growth, and the impact of rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our
FDIC assessment and higher long-term debt.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenue grew by over $200 million this quarter, reflecting day count, the impact of
the March rate increase, and loan growth. However, we still saw a decline in the core accrual net interest margin to 344
basis points, reflecting higher cash balances.
On slide 13, we update our LCR metrics and drivers. Our average LCR was 125% in the second quarter, up from the
first quarter, as an increase in average HQLA, driven primarily by the increase in cash related to our resolution
planning, was only partially offset by an increase in net outflows. As we noted previously, we believe we have built
adequate liquidity to meet our resolution plan requirements and will look to optimize our cash balances, and therefore
our LCR, going forward.
Turning to slide 14, let me summarize our regulatory capital position, which, as we discussed, remains among the
strongest in the industry. During the quarter, our CET1 and total capital ratios increased to 13% and 16.9%
respectively, driven mostly by earnings and partially offset by $2.2 billion of common share repurchases and dividends.
And our Supplementary Leverage Ratios were 7.2% and 6.6% for Citigroup and Citibank, respectively.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize several key points. First, we earned $8 billion of net income in the first half
of 2017, achieved an efficiency ratio of 58%, and generated an RoTCE of 9.7%, excluding the impact of disallowed
DTA.
Second, we continued to maintain a strong regulatory compliant balance sheet. We achieved a long-term debt ratio of
4.7% of total leverage exposure, or a $4 billion surplus, under the TLAC rule. We maintained a highly liquid balance
sheet with an average LCR of 125% and an estimated NSFR of greater than 100%. And we reported a CET1 capital
ratio of 13% and an SLR of 7.2%. Finally, we continued to maintain and further diversify our funding base.
And with that, I'll be happy to answer your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Monteleone with Barclays.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Hey. Good morning, John.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: So you guys released the living will plan a couple weeks ago, which had a lot of
incremental information, which has been useful. There's been a lot of liquidity prepositioned across the organization
now. Can you talk a little bit about that versus LCR and how you think about liquidity and binding constraints in this
new world, and how you maybe see LCR coming down over time as you optimize?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I would say, and I think it comes across a little bit probably through the remarks, that
we would look at resolution planning right now as being the binding constraint. And that's just because as we approach
resolution planning and we take a look at where we need to preposition the liquidity, we've built a lot of liquidity over
the last six months. You can see it in our cash balances just going up. I think our cash balance year over year is up
something like $36 billion. And $26 billion of that build happened in the first six months of the year.
So it's definitely – as we're comparing for the resolution plan, and now that we've got it in place, now it's a matter of
taking a look and seeing, okay, now what can we do to further optimize the liquidity and where we have it? And what
do we learn as far as structuring businesses?
So we'll approach all of those things. But we've got the liquidity there. And that's why I think the next move then is
more of an optimization move and a continuing build of liquidity.
Yeah. And to get back to your LCR question, quite frankly, LCR, NSFR, those are not our binding constraints right
now. And it's more everything is moving, at least for us, more in relation to how we're structured for resolution
planning purposes than for LCR or NSFR purposes.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it. And it's still a little early days in terms of trying to quantify some of that, it sounds.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. Yeah. I'd say so. I wouldn't want to give you a target right now to say, here's where
we think that we're going to come down. Because, one, we've just finalized that plan. So we've just submitted the plan.
I certainly would like to get feedback and make sure that the plan that we've submitted is as good as we think it is. And
then we'll react from there.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's not that dissimilar from how we've really reacted to almost every regulatory rule that's
been put out there over the course of the last six years, seven years. We make sure that we get into compliance with that
rule as quickly as possible. And then we approach optimization.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it. And then question on the support agreement and the prepositioning of assets in this.
People kind of think about what risks could potentially come out of that. I assume that as the parent is down-streaming
to three inter-company loans down to the Citicorp IHC, that the kind of interest rate and maturity dates are similar to
the end securities that are issued, just to ensure proper flow of liquidity back up to the parent, in addition to some of the
other mechanisms that are in place? Is that the right way to think about how those inter-company loans work?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The term I would use is that the terms match.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay. Perfect. And then one security question. So post CCAR it seems like we often get
questions around the old legacy grandfathered trust preferred securities, [ph] the Citi ends (17:16). I think they've been
callable for a few years now, so you've had the opportunity to put and to redeem them. And it hasn't happened yet.
So seems like the view then is that it's economically attractive to leave those outstanding. And I think there's some
capital and returns reasons that justify that. But I think there seems to be, from time to time, confusion in the market.

Can you talk a little bit about why, to date at least, that security has been viewed as something that is economically
attractive to leave outstanding?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I hate to get into speaking about redemption plans for a specific security. But I'll have
to give it to you on this one. This one does seem to get a lot of attention. So I'll go off my usual script by saying I don't
address individual securities, and I'll go down that path.
I think it's – again it's been fairly well written about the fact that if we were to redeem this, we would take a large hit to
our P&L. And that's just the way that the bookkeeping has worked on that security. And I've seen estimates in the high
[ph] 800s (18:35), and that's a very valid estimate to have.
So you're quite right. The decision to redeem that security is largely an economic one. Is it worth taking a large loss to
redeem that particular security with its particular coupon? And I would never say never on things like that. I've learned
that over time. But you'd have to find a situation where taking a loss of that size would then mesh in with our stated
goals of growing RoTCE over the next couple of years. So...
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Great. Thanks, John. I appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Scott Cavanagh with APG.
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for holding the call as always. Very much appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, our pleasure, Scott.
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: So I just wanted to delve further into Brian's question on the living will. Is there anything we
should be taking from the FSB guidelines on internal TLAC and how the liquidity might be redistributed?
And then secondly, if we think about potential easing of regulations on some of the ratios, how do we think about
issuance? Specifically, this LTD bucket going forward, and how you would react to that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: On the first one, there's nothing in the FSB requirements that we find to be something on top
of what we've already built into our plan. All right? So we think that the plan that we have is a good plan of record
based upon everything that's out there now. And then as I said, we'll wait to get feedback from the Fed and the FDIC
after they've had a chance to go through the thousands of pages that we've given them.
As far as how future regulatory changes could impact and changes in ratios could impact issuance plans, I can't answer
that question, because I don't know what's going to change. And I don't mean to dodge the question. It's just that there's
so many different things that are out there that could possibly happen that it would really be hard for me to give you a
responsible answer to kind of an open-ended question like that.
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: Okay. No, I can appreciate that. On a different topic, there were some actions taken by another
large trustee regarding callable securities, RMBS securities. And they took notable legal reserve expenses that was kind
of unprecedented move. How are you guys thinking about this as far as the RMBS book of business and how you want
to proceed going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We certainly don't comment on matters of either current or proposed litigation. Any
commentary we make will be in the 10-Q. So I'm not going to go any further with that right now.
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: I appreciate that. And last from me, could you just kind of give us an update on your plans for
Brexit and where you are at this point?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, we've – certainly have announced today, I think that the press picked it up a little bit
earlier, that we will be looking to establish a broker-dealer in Frankfurt, which sort of would be the completion of our

plans. We will be doing our banking business across the EU out of the bank sub that we have in Dublin. So our banking
business will be conducted out of there.
And you may recall that's something that we set up a couple of years ago, not necessarily in anticipation of Brexit, but
just in normal good legal entity governance work. And we decided on Dublin. And it turned out to be a very fortuitous
decision to have made.
So basically the banking across the eurozone will be done out of Dublin. And then we will have the broker-dealer set
up in Frankfurt. But exactly how we will use that broker-dealer is still of course open to exactly what the terms of the
Brexit will be. What will the terms of that exit be? How will that be negotiated?
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No problem.

Your next question is from the line of Kevin Maloney with BlackRock.
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Hey. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi.
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Just a question or two. On C&I lending, it seems to have slowed. And I was wondering if you
could give us some insights on whether it's demand led or supply led? And whether six turns guidelines that potentially
could be overturned, does that mean anything to you guys?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So the two questions are separate. So I just want – I mean...
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Yeah. They are.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Let me handle – yeah. Okay. The answer to the second question is we are not primarily
focused on growing leverage lending as a business. We provide leverage lending. We do that for our clients that need
that capability, but it's not a particular area of focus for us.
One of the things that I think that we've benefited from over the course of the last seven years to nine years has been
that we have really been a client-focused company as opposed to a product led company. And so we really focus on the
needs of our clients. And our clients have a relatively – our client segment has a relatively low need for that type of
product. So we're comfortable where the rules are now. If the rules changed, it wouldn't change for us unless somehow
that changed the business needs of our clients.
As far as your comment on C&I loans, for our purposes we have definitely seen a reduction in the episodic loans year
over year. I tried to mention that in our prepared comments. But we actually saw good growth in our corporate clients,
both in the TTS and trade loans as well as in the more traditional C&I lending during the quarter.
So on a sequential basis we had fairly good growth in our loan book. And we saw a lot of demand for working capital
type loans in those clients that we serve.
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Just one last question. On Asia, you mentioned that you're remixing the
business. And I think you've talked before about moving away from mortgages and more toward credit cards. And I
was wondering, with Korea being such a large part of the Consumer business, how has that morphed? Meaning, has
there been much change in Korea? And how quickly you think you'll make that mix change overall?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, we've been – yeah. I mean it's not something that you flip a switch and you just get
out of mortgages. And we will never completely get out of mortgages. We just – again we're not emphasizing
mortgages as a standalone product. If we've got clients that need a mortgage, if there's a customer that as part of their
borrowing needs requires a mortgage, and it makes sense from a relationship point of view, we will certainly satisfy

that need.
But we're just not looking to grow the mortgage portfolio as a standalone product. Much more focused on trying to
grow not just credit cards but also personal installment loans. So that's really where our focus is.
And with Korea. Korea's actually been doing quite well. I'm sure you've seen in the press the next round of
repositioning that we're doing with that franchise as we try to make it look more like the franchises that we have
elsewhere in Asia. And also responding to the fact that consumer banking is becoming less brick and mortar and much
more about your digital, your mobile capabilities. We see that in the Korea marketplace. And quite frankly, we just
don't need the number of branches that we have to satisfy the needs of our target clients.
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Okay. Thanks. That's all I have.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No problem. Okay.

Your next question is from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just a couple.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Always a pleasure, Robert, always a pleasure.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Thanks. Just a couple; one on card and a two-parter on margins. First on card, in the
prior and the call from last week, you had said that given the lower collections rate, the full year NCL rate is going to
go up to 460 basis points. Could you talk about reasons for the lower collections rate? And just talk more in generally
about developments in the card landscape; is this more of a normalization or is it a deterioration? And does this feed
back into your profitability targets for the product?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, Robert, thanks. So with cards, one thing I just want to correct. The 460 [basis points]
guidance that we gave was very specific to the retail services portfolio.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So our branded cards portfolio, we had been giving guidance of 280 basis points as far as a
full year NCL rate. And that is where we still are with branded cards.
So and you saw a nice decline quarter-on-quarter in the NCL rate in branded cards, which actually then supports, I
think nicely, our view of that NCL rate averaging out for the year, something in the range of 280 basis points. And by
saying something in the range of 280 basis points, I'm not giving new guidance. 280 basis points – I know everybody
looks at every word. So 280 basis points is our guidance for branded cards.
Retail services, what I was trying to convey in the call last week, and I think what the questions got around to, is what
we're seeing in retail services does not appear to be a credit underwriting issue. In other words, what we're not seeing
was we're not seeing an increase in the flow rate, that initial delinquency flow rate, from current to being past due.
Those flow rates have held constant in that business for the last two-plus years.
So if it was a credit underwriting concern, something that you would think it kind of goes along with the end of a cycle
or whatever, you'd see it by seeing an increase in your current delinquency rate, that movement from current to the first
bucket.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Where we're seeing it is that once a borrower misses two or more payments, at that point our
ability to get them back to current is not as efficient as it was in years past. There's been a slippage there.

And so the flow rate from, say, the 60 [day] bucket to the 90 [day] bucket, is increasing. It has increased. And that's
why we tend to look at it as being more of a collections issue. Techniques that we've employed in the past are just not
having that same effect.
Now, obviously, we've changed some of those techniques in order to be in compliance with a lot of the new guidance
that has come out over the course of the last few years from the various agencies. We've actually employed that same
guidance in the branded cards business, but we're not seeing that.
So it could be because in branded cards, we're dealing with larger average balances. And, therefore, our customers are
more protective of their FICO score and their performance. And, therefore, there's more of an interest on their part to
work with us in order to bring them back to current.
Whereas, retail services, those are traditionally smaller balance receivables. And still most of them are very
store-specific. About a third of our portfolio is general purpose cards. But about two-thirds of the portfolio, therefore, is
really just store-specific.
And, as I said, we're moderating techniques. We're trying new things. We're trying to find out how people, individuals,
prefer to be contacted. I think I mentioned on the call last week, we've doubled our text rate just in the last couple of
months.
So we're trying to reach them however is most efficient for us and for them in an effort to try to stem this tide. We've
seen some improvement, but it's just not as fast as we had originally hoped.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Second question around the margin and a
two-parter; first, we saw one trust bank yesterday have a real outflow of noninterest bearing deposits. Your experience
is year-over-year down about 10%, not as much in the past quarter. How are you looking at how that's going to develop
over the next few quarters? How is that going to impact your margin, number one?
And then two, I know in the prior call, you said that your outlook on the margin is not necessarily rate dependent. And
you're not baking in a lot of rate increases, one this year.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: But which part of the curve is most impactful for you? I think a lot has been written – or
a lot of people look at long rates, but is it 2s [years], 5s [years]? 3s [years], 5s [years]? 1s [year], 3s [years]? What
should we be looking at when we look at the possible implications for your margin going forward? And I realize that
can change from time-to-time.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. Yeah. No. In our case, it really shouldn't from – just to try to start – I'm going to try to
start at the end and work back to where you started. And if I leave something out, Robert, let me know.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So definitely we are focused at the short end of the curve. And you can see that in the IRE
disclosures that we put out there. When it comes to U.S. rates, virtually 90% of our exposure is on the short end of the
curve. And so that's where we live, and that's where we're impacted. So the long end, obviously it's helpful, but it's not
a big part of our story.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: And you're calling that five years and in? Or three years and in? Or right around the
three-year point? Just to narrow it down.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Right around three years and in. But we could also say two years and in. I mean it's in.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right?
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's in. Quite frankly, the most impactful rate for us is really the overnight rate, I mean if you
really wanted to look at it. It's – so if you're thinking one year and in, that's where most of our exposure – most of our
impact would be. And then it goes out from there. But so you can start with three years and in, but really focus on the
one year and in.
Some of the other questions that you had, let's talk about deposits. You talked about deposit outflows, and you
referenced some drops that we've had. If you look, we certainly have had a shift in our interest bearing versus
noninterest bearing deposits in the U.S. I think if you look at our U.S. deposits overall, they're about flat year over year.
But within there we've had a roughly – I think it's $15 billion shift from noninterest bearing into interest bearing. And
most of that has occurred in our Treasury and Trade Solutions business. So it's on the institutional side of the house.
Slightly more than half of that change was a deliberate replacement on our part of noninterest bearing deposits, moving
them from noninterest bearing deposits into interest bearing deposits that had a higher liquidity value.
So as we try to manage our deposit profile, noninterest bearing and interest bearing is one way of looking at it. But we
put all of that through an LCR lens. How much liquidity value do I have in the deposits? And I may be very willing to
pay for a deposit through interest that has a higher liquidity value than one that has minimal liquidity value but is free.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: What really matters, what's the utility value of that deposit. And then the remainder of that
shift is the impact that you have over time of institutional clients reacting to the increase in interest rates by redirecting
a portion of their deposits into interest bearing accounts. And all of that is consistent with higher deposit betas that we
have modeled going forward.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: So in terms of NIM impact, when I look at this type of flow versus you had mentioned
larger cash – keeping larger cash balances and eventually optimizing them for the next couple quarters. Would it be this
or the optimization of the cash balances that would have more of an impact on the NIM?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's going be the cash balances, because that certainly has had much more of an impact as
we've built up that $26 billion of cash over the course of the last six months. That's been the single largest driver. So I
would anticipate cash being the bigger impact.
But as I said, I wouldn't – don't look for something really near term there in the third quarter. Because to the extent that
we start to make any big optimization moves in cash, it's probably going to wait until after we get some of the feedback
on the resolution plan.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: This is all very helpful. And as always, thanks for doing the call. Greatly appreciate it.

<Q - Arnold Shoichi Kakuda>: Hi, John. Thanks for the call once again.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Arnold.
<Q - Arnold Shoichi Kakuda>: It's really helpful. Hi. So as credit analysts, I like how you now have a higher capital
ratio target than a peer with a higher G-SIB surcharge. So if I go back to your – what you mentioned in 1Q. And I think
you mentioned that the 11.5% higher end target was based on the Fed potentially incorporating the stress capital buffer
into the...

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah.
<Q - Arnold Shoichi Kakuda>: ...CCAR process. So my question is since last quarter, have you gained more
conviction on the probabilities of the stress capital buffer being incorporated into CCAR? Or is it something else that
made you kind of up your target?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, I – do I have more conviction? I don't think that we've changed our target in the last
quarter. We've always talked about having a target somewhere between 11% and 11.5%. And quite frankly, if you
know Mike Corbat and I, you know that if we say 11% to 11.5% we're going to live with the more conservative end of
that target.
So I just view it as being, we just kind of settled on the fact that it's 11.5%. I mean we're at 13% right now. So let's set
our sights on trying to optimize down to 11.5%. And then if there is some new thing out there or some reason why we
should go down lower or maybe even go a little higher, we'll adjust it then.
But certainly when you look at the CET1 ratio that we're currently living at, at 13%, I think it's almost a distinction
without a difference to say we're targeting at 11.5% or we're targeting at 11%. Good God, we are well above whatever
one of those targets are.
But all kidding aside, the 11.5%, again, when we look at that – and we'll talk a little bit more about this at Investor Day
next Tuesday. But what you'll see is that that 11.5% includes 100 basis point management buffer and an estimated SCB
of 3%. So we think that there's room within that 3% SCB as well, because if you take a look at the last round of CCAR
results, the way we think that you'd calculate that SCB would be certainly a number below the 3%. But rather than try
to be very precise, we just round it up to the 3%.
So sorry for the rambling response. Have I touched upon any answer that you find to be connected to your original
question?
<Q - Arnold Shoichi Kakuda>: No, this is great. And thanks for the Investor Day preview. And then you talked about
the excess capital. And it seems like your payout approval for this year is above 100%. So is it fair to say that maybe
your capital ratios have largely peaked?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I believe that they have. I believe that they have. So again we'll have a little bit more to say
about that on Tuesday.
<Q - Arnold Shoichi Kakuda>: Okay. Great. And then it seems like your assets have grown. But yet your RWAs have
kind of been on the decline. So is that likely to change going forward now that you've mostly wound down or sold the
legacy Citi Holding (sic) [Citi Holdings] assets?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I think you've seen the – certainly the growth in the standardized RWA that matches
the balance sheet growth. And that if you notice, it's the standardized RWA that at least in this quarter has now become
our binding constraint. So right now for us, it's CET1 measured on standardized RWA, rather than CET1 measured on
advanced approached RWA that's the relevant ratio.
<Q - Arnold Shoichi Kakuda>: Got it. That's it for me. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Kehoe with GSAM.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Hi. Good morning. Just two questions. The first one, so going back to the discussion on
cards. The ROA targets both in branded cards and retail cards, they are – there's no change there, despite the more
difficulties in recoveries?

Bloomberg Estimates - Sales
Current Quarter: 17715.267
Current Year: 71241.550
Page 11 of 15
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So when you look at the – from a retail services point of view, we've said that we expect to
have 250 basis points of ROA in that product going forward. And so that – we haven't changed that guidance at all.
When it comes to the branded cards, I think on Tuesday we'll give you some new guidance there. And I'll preview it a
little bit for now. When we look at branded cards, the Costco portfolio continues to surprise to the upside. Purchase
sales, number of accounts, balances, usage out of store, revenues, ROA, all are actually higher than what was built into
our business case. And we believe that this outperformance is going to continue.
Now while this will result in even higher levels of revenue and net income in future years, it does mean that our U.S.
branded cards portfolio is likely to have a higher mix of co-brand ANR than we had previously modeled. So the change
in mix, coupled with a reduced estimate of the net interest spread as our U.S. interest rate outlook now is also higher
and steeper, that's caused us to lower our target ROA for the U.S. branded cards portfolio down to 215 basis points.
And we had previously modeled 225 [basis points], but now just given that slightly higher mix of co-brand and a higher
and steeper interest rate environment, it's going to take it down to like 215 [basis points].
The good news is that higher and steeper interest rate outlook is going to benefit the retail business. So higher and
steeper interest rates, a bit of a headwind for branded cards but a tailwind for our U.S. retail bank.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Okay. And just the last – the second question I had was in terms of the issuance for – at
the bank level in terms of bank notes and securitizations, it was $20 billion versus $15 billion in the first quarter. Is that
more bank notes or is it more securitizations?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's going to be a mix. And again it's $15 billion the first half, not the first quarter, first half.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Sure.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But that's okay. I just wanted to make sure that we had it right on the transcript. And the $5
billion, that's going be a mix.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question is from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Thank you, John, for hosting the call.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Always our pleasure.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: And for the color regarding the IHC structure as well as deposits. Just following up on Robert's
question, roughly two-thirds of Citi's deposits are corporate. And out of that, TTS makes up the biggest chunk. How
should we look at the stickiness of that deposit base, generally speaking?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, generally speaking, it's a very sticky deposit base. Because, again, when we're focused
on growing the deposit business, it's really linked to owning the operating accounts for our large multinational
corporate clients. So since it really is focused on their working capital accounts, it tends to be extremely sticky.
Now, there's going to be some element of that deposit base that will move up and down, just based upon whether it's
changes in rates or changes in various things. But, for the most part, it's an incredibly sticky deposit base.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Thank you for that. And then, given how flat the yield curve is and also the tightness of the sub
senior spread differential, any thoughts on kind of preloading up on subordinated debt or extending maturities?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. I wouldn't look there. Again, we've laid out for you what our issuance program is. We
don't try to necessarily market time things. We've given you the targets that we've got for subordinated debt, as far as

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Hima. How are you?
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Oh. I'm so sorry, John. I'm good. I'm traveling so been having issues with the line. Apologize.
But thanks a lot for the call as usual. Fixed income investors definitely appreciate all the disclosures. Most of my
specific questions have been answered. I'm just going to ask a more high-level question here – a couple questions here.
So on the earnings call, Mike said he expects the Treasury report changes as early as the fourth quarter. So can you
elaborate on the positive and negative effects of maybe changes to SLR, LCR, and TLAC on Citigroup, since they don't
require congressional action and then could be done easily?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, when Mike – he did say that he hopes. But as I've always said, hope is not a plan. And
what we've got right now is a series of proposals. There's no assurance that even if those proposals are implemented,
that they're going be implemented exactly as they are contained in the Treasury report. And so, therefore, it's a little
hard for me to give you specific guidance as to how each one of those things could impact us.
Obviously from an SLR point of view, if cash, for instance, or Treasury securities was taken out of the leveraged asset
denominator, that would be beneficial. That could add as much as 100 basis points to our SLR. So that's pretty easy.
LCR, again, our binding constraint right now on liquidity is really resolution planning, not the LCR. So I really
wouldn't look to changes in LCR as being impactful for us at this point in time.
And TLAC, again, hard to say, because I just don't know how they would implement everything that they've laid out
and how they would think about how each would interact with the other.
So I'll just leave it with I'll give you something specific on SLR and stay away from specific guidance on the other
ones.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Great. That's great. And then switching gears to the health care reform and the potential tax
reform in the U.S., based on your conversations at the Capitol Hill and with the administration, do you see a chance for
the tax reform passing this year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: There's always a chance. I'd say that it's going be tight because there just isn't a lot of time
left. But if the administration wants to get something done this year, that seems to be where they will now put their
focus. So there's clearly a chance.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Okay. That's very helpful. So to sum up, maybe there is a chance for tax reform and then
maybe there is a chance for the Treasury report this year?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. I would – again some of the things that we need – don't forget, Treasury, in particular,
is understaffed right now. And we still have three open seats on the Fed. And as some of my colleagues always remind
me, when it comes to D.C., personnel is policy. And so without having the personnel in place, it's sometimes hard to
actually enact the policies.

Your next question is from the line of James Strecker with Wells Fargo.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: I will add my thanks to you both for hosting the call. We really do appreciate it. And I'm
going to have to go back to Brian's question on the [ph] ends (54:06).
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Oh.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: As much as I know you're going to hate that, John. But as you said it is a popular topic with
investors out there.
So if I just go back to your comments. And I think about the associated quarterly interest expense you pay on the [ph]
ends (54:20), which is increasing with LIBOR moving higher. And then if I think about the roughly $880 million of
common equity associated with that security on the balance sheet, and I try to square that with your drive to improve
profitability over time. Just doing some back of the envelope math, it seems like it could add 50 bps of RoTCE on an
ongoing basis, after you take that one quarter hit to redeem it, which you know all of us are going to graciously call a
one-time non-core hit.
Is there something I'm missing from the outside? Especially for a security that gets no TLAC credit. If we think about
where your Tier 1 position is versus your stated target, it's hopefully above that. I mean is there some accounting? Is
there some other reason that we're missing from the outside? Just any more color there. Because it just doesn't seem to
jive with your stated target to improve profitability.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, when you – it's not just a question of calling it and then saying, all work is done. We'd
have to call it and replace it. So I'm not quite sure in your 50 basis point calculation that you've made an estimate for
the replacement cost associated with the funding.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: And that...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So in...
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Sorry.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Go ahead. I mean so that is clearly a variable there. And plus, it does – it will have longer
termed improvements. But it's – the payback on a move like that is rather long, rather long. You're talking about as I
said – as you said, an $880 million-ish immediate hit against a multiyear payback.
And those are things that we evaluate. Which is also though the reason why in response to Brian, I said I'll never say
never. Because I don't want to leave you with the impression that there is under no set of circumstances would we ever

[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning & Company.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Yes. Good morning, John.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: I wanted to also mirror my compliments. Citi does set the standard, in my opinion, in terms of
frequency and content of these calls. So thank you once again.
Couple of questions. A number of the questions I had have already been addressed. But do you have an opinion on the
periodic discussion that we still see coming from the Republicans that they may seek to eliminate OLA under a budget
reconciliation as we go further into the year?
And secondly, I don't want to get complacent about the good conditions in the U.S. housing market. But I do want to
ask you what your view is presently of the conditions that you're seeing in the U.S. housing market? And are you
seeing any cracks or any excesses which might have begun to concern you?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. Let's start at the tail end of that. From a housing market point of view, again we don't
really have a large mortgage business. So it isn't something where it's a big area of focus for us.
Obviously we do have the capability to offer mortgages to our retail customers when they need it for their own
financing. But we don't have a separate mortgage business anymore. We decided that that wasn't the right strategic
move for us. It just wasn't a scale – a business that we could develop scale in. So unfortunately, it's just not a business
that means a lot to us right now.
But again we're very comfortable with where we are with it. We're not seeing any big breaks, but I can't give you a
national view. All right?
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And then from when it comes to OLA, obviously there's going be a – that's going to be
covered in one of the separate Treasury reports that comes out in the fall. So I don't think that you're going to see much
in the way of changes or a lot of serious discussions about OLA, at least until the Treasury has had a chance to give
their views in the report. So we'll see.
But we – and certainly we will be hopeful that even if people want to move – and the bankruptcy code, changes to the
bankruptcy code, make the bankruptcy code more usable for large institutions, those things are fine. But we still think
that OLA is an important – the Title II is – the overall Title II is still an important element of resolution planning going
forward.
