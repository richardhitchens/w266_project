Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Chris. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In a few minutes, Steve Chazen will provide details on our
financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010. But first, I want to mention some key developments of the
last week and of the past quarter that we believe are significant to continuing Oxy's success in 2010 and beyond.
Last week, we announced that the government of Abu Dhabi selected Oxy to participate in the development of the Shah
gas field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East. Oxy will hold a 40% participating interest in a 30 year
contract with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, holding the remaining 60%. We're indeed pleased that the
Abu Dhabi government has chosen Oxy to participate with them in this major project. This is another important step in
the implementation of our growth strategy in the Middle East and in our relationship with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
You will recall when in 2007 Oxy submitted a bid on the Shah project and was not selected. However development of
the field under the agreement announced last week provides an exciting opportunity to create value for the people of
Abu Dhabi and of course for Oxy stockholders. We expect it to provide similar returns to Oxy as our traditional Middle
East properties.
Working in close partnership with ADNOC we will apply our expertise in this technically challenging project to
develop high sulfur content reservoirs within the Shah field. Project is anticipated to produce approximately 500
million cubic feet per day of sales gas, providing net to Oxy in the range of 200 million cubic feet a day.
In addition, the project is expected to produce about 50,000 barrels per day of condensate and natural gas liquids which
we expect to yield in the range of 20,000 barrels per day net to Oxy. ADNOC is already in the process of developing
the field and the majority of its drilling and procurements and construction contracts have already been awarded.
Production from the field is scheduled to begin in 2014. Capital expenditures for the entire project are estimated to be
in the range of $10 billion, with Oxy's share proportional to the ownership.
Another key development for Oxy, and very exciting, which we announced last month, was a strategic adjustment we
have made to our asset base in order to improve the company's performance and profitability. We are selling our oil and
gas operation in Argentina, which have not performed to our expectations, to a subsidiary of Sinopec and expect after
tax proceeds to be about $2.5 billion.
We have made acquisitions in new producing areas for Oxy, North Dakota and south Texas which we believe have
solid potential for growth. We expect the combination of these transactions to immediately improve our earnings,
return on capital employed and free cash flow.
The North Dakota acquisition has already closed and we anticipate the Argentina and south Texas transactions to close
by the end of this quarter. Two years ago, we went into North Dakota with a modest amount of acreage in the oil rich
Bakken and Three Forks formation of the Williston Basin. Now we have expanded our position in the area to over
200,000 acres by purchasing about 180,000 net contiguous acres from a private seller for about $1.4 billion. We expect
to grow our production in the Williston Basin from these properties to about 30,000 BOE per day over the next five
years.
The south Texas acquisition from Shell for about $1.8 billion, gives us properties which have over 320 billion cubic
feet of gas equivalent in proven developed reservoirs and are liquid rich with a solid inventory of drilling opportunities.
Oxy is already a major producer in Texas and these south Texas assets further expand our footprint in the state.
We anticipate the new U.S. assets immediately yield reasonable earnings and produce good free cash flow even at
current gas prices. As gas prices improve in the future and we optimize overall area opportunities, these properties will
fit well with our overall presence, performance and continued growth in the United States.

The U.S. acquisitions together with those we made in the third quarter of last year will replace our production from
Argentina with better profits, return on capital employed and free cash flow. And as evidence of our confidence in
Oxy's performance with the addition of our new U.S. assets, Oxy's Board of Directors has announced its intention to
increase our common share dividend rate by 21%, to an annual rate of $1.84, effective with the April 15th payment.
This will mark Oxy's 10th dividend increase since 2002, bringing the compounded annual growth rate over the period
to 15.6%.
In 2011, we will maintain our focus on delivering value to our shareholders and partners, as we continue improving our
asset base, while growing production and reserves.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to report on Oxy's financial performance during the past quarter and full
year.
Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer
Thank you, Ray. Core income was $1.3 billion or $1.58 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year compared to
$1.1 billion or $1.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.49 per
diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $938 million or $1.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of
2009.
As required by accounting rules, Argentina has been classified as a discontinued operation. Therefore Argentina's
results have been excluded from continuing operations net of tax for all periods, what this means is everything about
Argentina has collapsed into a single line. Details of Argentina's operating results for the years 2008 and '09 and by
quarters in 2010 are included in the investor relations supplemental schedules. Argentina has not been profitable for the
last four years.
The 2010 fourth quarter also included after tax non-core charges of $175 million for impairments predominantly of gas
properties in the Rockies and $80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carry forwards. The fourth quarter 2010
core income included $110 million higher pre-tax expense compared to the third quarter, or $70 million after tax or
$0.09 per diluted share from equity related compensation programs mostly due to the effect of the steep rise in the
company's stock during the final quarter.
Here's the segment breakdown for the fourth quarter: Oil and Gas segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were
$1.7 billion, realized crude oil prices increased 11.5% in 2010 but domestic natural gas prices declined 5.5% from the
fourth quarter of 2009. Production volumes for the fourth quarter of 2010 were 750,000 BOE a day, a 5% increase
compared to the 717,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter production of 753,000 per day was
slightly higher than third quarter's production of 751,000 BOE per day.
Fourth quarter volumes compared to the third quarter were negatively impacted by 10,000 BOE a day from the effects
of our production sharing contract, 6,000 BOE a day due to strikes in Argentina and inclement weather in December
which impacted our California production. In California, oil production was higher by 2,000 barrels a day in the fourth
quarter compared with the third quarter and was offset by 1,000 barrels a day decline resulting from higher oil prices
affecting the production sharing contracts at our THUMS operation and by 3,000 barrels a day of lower natural gas
liquids volume resulting from lower gas production.
Excluding Argentina, worldwide Oil and Gas production for the fourth quarter was 714,000 BOE a day. The third
quarter production would have been 716,000 BOE a day if Argentina were excluded. The fourth quarter sales volume
were 751,000 BOE a day. Sales volume is different from production volumes due mainly to fourth quarter lifting in
Argentina which slipped from the third quarter partially offset by Iraq production which will be sold in 2011 and a
lifting in Colombia which was sold in beginning of this year. Exploration expense is $54 million in the quarter.
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $111 million and in line with our earlier guidance.
Midstream segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $210 million, compared to $163 million in the third
quarter of 2010 and $81 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in earnings was mainly due to higher

trading and marketing income. Worldwide effective tax rate was 38% for the fourth quarter.
Now let me turn to Oxy's performance during the last year. Core income was $4.7 billion or $5.72 per diluted share for
the 12 months of this year, compared to $3.2 billion or $3.92 per diluted share for the full year of 2009.
Net income was $4.5 billion or $5.50 per diluted share for the 12 months of 2010 compared with $2.9 billion or $3.58
per diluted share for the same period of 2009. Income for the 12 months of 2009 included – 2010 included $134 million
of charges net of tax and 2009 included $277 million net of tax. The items noted on the schedule reconcile our net
income to core results.
Oil and Gas cash production costs which exclude production and property taxes were $10.19 a barrel for 2010,
excluding Argentina. Last year's 12 months costs were $8.95 a barrel on the same basis.
The year-over-year increase reflects $0.32 a barrel in higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense 100% of injected
CO2 beginning this year and higher field support operations, workover and maintenance costs. Taxes other than on
income $1.83 a barrel for 2010 compared to $1.67 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product
prices, reflect the effect of higher crude oil and gas prices in 2010.
Capital spending for the fourth quarter was about $1.4 billion and $3.9 billion for the 12 months excluding Argentina.
Capital expenditures by segment were 80% Oil and Gas, 13% in Midstream and the remainder in chemicals.
Cash flow from operations for the 12 months of 2010 was $9.1 billion excluding Argentina. We used $3.9 billion of the
company's cash employee to fund capital expenditures, $4.7 billion on acquisitions and $225 million on foreign
contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $8.8 billion. We issued $2.6 billion of debt in the fourth quarter.
We also used $1.2 billion to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt. Argentina's net cash flow for the year was a
negative $125 million after spending $415 million for capital expenditures and contract extension payments. These and
other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion at
December 31st. Free cash flow from continuing operations after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition
activity and debt retirements was about $4.3 billion.
Our acquisition costs in the fourth quarter were $3.1 billion which included the previous announced purchases of Oil
and Gas bolt-on properties mainly in the Permian. We expect to close the purchase of several additional properties and
the sale of Argentina in the first quarter of 2011. During the year we spent $4.1 billion on Oil and Gas acquisitions of
which about 50% was on unproved properties.
On a preliminary basis our 2010 reserve replacement ratio was about 150%. Approximately one-third of the current
year reserve adds came from acquisitions. We will provide additional details regarding reserves as soon as the
information is available.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 12 months of 2010 were 812.5 million and the weighted average
diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 14% at the end of the year. Our
2010 return on equity was 14.7%, the return on capital employed of 13.2%.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, our first quarter 2011 production will be impacted by the following factors:
First, we will no longer report Argentina production. Second, the timing of completion of the new acquisitions, while
the acquisition of the Oil and Gas properties in North Dakota closed at year-end, the acquisition of the south Texas
properties has yet to close.
We have a planned one month maintenance and production shut down in Elk Hills and Dolphin. The impact of the Elk
Hills shut down which will only impact natural gas and liquids production will be about 8,000 BOE a day for the first
quarter of 2011. The impact of the Dolphin shut down will be about 5,000 BOE a day for the quarter.
We expect the first quarter Oil and Gas production volumes to be between 740,000 and 750,000 BOE a day and fourth
quarter average prices of $85 for WTI. We expect sales volumes to be around 725,000 BOE a day. A $5 increase in
WTI would reduce our daily volumes by about 5,500 BOE a day.

Once we know the first quarter's results and timing and the initial production rates on transfer from the pending
acquisitions we can provide an accurate full year production guidance. Production growth will resume in the second
quarter. We reasonably expect by at least the second half of the year production would be similar to the run rate we
showed you in last May's Investor Presentation adjusted for oil price changes.
With regard to current prices, at the current market prices a dollar per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly
earnings before income taxes by about $41 million. The average fourth quarter WTI price was $85.17 per barrel. A
swing of $0.50 per million BTU's in domestic prices has a $36 million impact on quarterly earnings before income
taxes. This is a significant increase in gas price sensitivities from what we have told you in the past. The current
NYMEX gas price is around $4.50 per MCF.
Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $85 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration
programs.
The Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the first quarter of about $125 million. We expect margins
and volumes to continue to improve as the economy strengthens. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the
first quarter of 2011 to be about 40%. Our fourth quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our Investor
Relations supplements.
For all of 2011, we expect capital spending for the total year to be about $6.1 billion, compared to the 2010 total of
$3.9 billion. Both amounts exclude Argentina and the Shah field development project. Occidental's share of the Shah
field development capital will total about $4 billion over the next several years.
Our 2011 capital is close to our fourth quarter annualized run rate of $5.5 billion and in line with the five year capital
program we gave you in the May investor presentation plus the capital that was deferred from 2010. The breakdown of
the 2010 and 2011 capital by area and segment is included in the supplemental schedules.
Our Oil and Gas DD&A expense for 2011 should be approximately $11.75 per BOE. Depreciation for the other two
segments should be about $500 million.
In California, we have about 520 geologically viable so-called de-risked shale drilling locations in California excluding
traditional Elk Hills. Of these locations about 250 are outside both of the Elk Hills proper and the Kern County
Discovery Area. During 2011, based on a conservative view of the permitting process, we expect to drill a total of 107
shale wells outside of Elk Hills proper. As additional permits become available the level of drilling activity would pick
up during the year.
We will also drill 28 exploration wells in California in 2011. About 50% of these will be for conventional exploration.
We expect the exploration activity will at a minimum create more unconventional drilling locations. Copies of our
press release and our supplemental schedules are available on our website or on the SEC system.
We're now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering
<Q - Dave Heikkinen>: Good morning, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Dave Heikkinen>: As we think about the industry and then your operations we can qualitatively get some
thoughts around primary potential in the Permian, also kind of the development potential and exploration potential in
California, but trying to quantify that has been difficult given current disclosure, particularly versus some of the smaller
peers that we do follow. Can you talk about how you think about both operationally and then – that asset operationally,

and also how you think about how and what your disclosure process will be heading forward?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: If we take the two U.S. assets, start with the
Permian which in some ways is easiest, I think last year we gave you a notion of how much additional was recoverable
with the CO2 flooding process. The drilling in the smaller opportunities, there's a fair amount of potential there, but it's
sort of hard for us to quantify in a meaningful way. We're not going to provide individual well data like some
companies do. So I think the potential in the Permian is very sizable. But we did provide last year how much additional
CO2 flooding potential we thought there was, and we think that's probably a fairly conservative outlook.
As we switch to California, as the shale drilling program accelerates this year, it will be fairly obvious, we think, what
the potential there is. We've got I think, I said 500 shale locations. We don't think that the description of them is
materially different from what we gave you in May, that is, roughly how much the recoverable per well is, the initial
rates and the costs. So I think we have at least 500. That's a very small percentage of our acreage.
So I think the potential there will become pretty obvious as the year progresses, we start getting permits and start
getting our production up. The permitting process in California is fairly complicated once we leave the main field area,
so it may take a little longer than I would like for sure. But I think it will be pretty obvious when you look at production
going forward, and I think you'll see some pretty decent results as the year progresses.
<Q - Dave Heikkinen>: And then I do think about the Permian kind of operationally kind of core competencies and
skill sets required to run a large CO2 flood versus running a larger primary program. Can you talk about how you
operationally run that? And then any details around activity more on the primary side as far as are you accelerating
activity with the increased CapEx on more of the primary smaller opportunities there or...?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Almost all the increase is in primary drilling. The
numbers we're showing you as a percentage you can multiply the percentage out. Almost all the increase is on primary
drilling. The capital in the CO2 program is very modest because almost all capital is just CO2. I mean, these are fields
that are just increasing basically their flood size so that the increase is overwhelmingly in what you would describe as
primary drilling. We have a lot of acreage available. Several of the area – we've acquired some new areas or additional
areas next to what we had.
I think you'll see a pretty sizable impact of that as the year progresses, but it is overwhelmed really by the size of the
CO2 flooding opportunity, which is in billions of barrels as opposed to hundreds of millions of barrels.
<Q - Dave Heikkinen>: And then just kind of bigger picture and not trying to replace you, but have had the question
about secession planning and thoughts at Oxy. Can you talk about at the board level and what the thoughts are around
management and anything?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I think we'd let the Chairman of the Board
discuss the board a little.
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: What is your specific question?
<Q - Dave Heikkinen>: Basically as you go through the transition, people ask who's behind Steve, and just want to
understand kind of the board level thoughts there.
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Steve will take over as CEO at the May meeting
of this year. I will continue as Executive Chairman, and we do have other people behind Steve, but let's have Steve's
take over first, and we can also be looking at replacements. We have a bench, but we think we can execute our plans
with our current manpower.
<Q - Dave Heikkinen>: Got you. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Steve, can you just help me a bit with some of the volume outlook that you gave me and the effect
of California? I think that you said you're expecting volumes to be around 740,000 to 750,000 in Q1 and 725,000 of
sales -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Right.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: – but obviously that would be negatively impacted by the loss of Argentina?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: No, that's – we've already done that.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay, so that's all out.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Right.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Then what you said was – I think what you said was by second half you would expect volume –
second half of 2011 you would expect volumes to be back in line with the volume outlook presented at the May
Analyst Meeting, which the top line on that was like 837,000 but then there was a base CAGR of 6%. Should we think
of it like a percentage line? Or how should we work that out?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I don't – it's hard to say. The variance is built
because of our demonstrated inability to predict all that well. So somewhere in that range. But I think that run rate
adjusted for the price. You've got to take out the oil price change. So that was – last year was done at $75. So you got to
adjust the production down for the product price, so you should look for a run rate in the back half of the year for the
company that looks like that. Argentina was 40 some thousand a day in that, or 48,000 or something like that, but we
basically replaced that with the other stuff.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: So the net difference is zero, let's say. And then -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: The net difference is around zero, except for the
noise in the first quarter of the handoff.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: But then essentially what we're looking for is allowing for the change in price around a 6%
growth rate being achieved by the second half of the year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I think that's right.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. Great. That clarifies it. Sorry I was getting a bit tangled up there.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah. Argentina is out of the numbers I've given
and the new acquisitions are in it and roughly speaking they're a push once everybody's – you've got a full quarter.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yeah, got you. And then on the -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: First quarter is a little noisy, second quarter may
be a little noisy, but by the back – by the second – last two quarters we should be back in line at that rate.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Great. And then just on slide seven at a very kind of simplistic level if I look at your Oil and Gas
segment earnings, they're down from Q4 '09 to Q4 '10 despite a, whatever it is, $10 increase in the oil price and with
increased volume. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there and some of the -?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I think the two major factors, one, some of this
employee expense got rolled into that and second, it's not really operating costs and stuff. Second is the mix. The mix is
a little gassier.

Your next question comes from the line Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Arjun Murti>: Steve, just to follow up on the California shale comments you made, I think you said about 107
wells outside of Elk Hills proper in the shale. How many rigs do you need to do that? Do you have them? And where
do you stand on completion crews and the fracture stimulation side of things? Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: We'll let Bill answer that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yeah. Hello, Arjun. Good morning. We are planning to run about 12 rigs drilling
exclusively shale wells, and that's in all of California, not just on Elk Hills proper.
<Q - Arjun Murti>: And do you have the 12 now or you still need to procure some?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: No, we have the 12 right now.
<Q - Arjun Murti>: And how about completion crews?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Well you know, a lot of these shale completions are acidized as opposed to fracturing, and
we're in pretty good shape on our acid.
<Q - Arjun Murti>: Got it. So this is a situation where as you drill the wells the production should show up as you
drill the wells?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes. We shouldn't have a large inventory of wells waiting on completion due to a
shortage of services.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: We're running along pretty well right now.
Tracking the first three weeks of the month we're right on. We gave you a number here for number of wells drilled. The
locations are permitted and the rigs are in place and the completion crews are in place. Unlikely – except for a
rainstorm or something like that, it's unlikely that there'll be – there's much downside to this.
<Q - Arjun Murti>: Right. And in the Analyst Meeting you gave a range of 400,000 to 700,000 BOEs per well. If you
take 500,000 Bs a well, times 100 wells, that's a half a billion barrels a year of opportunity. From a reserve booking
standpoint is that how we should think about it? Or is there some lag because you've got to see production over time?
And that's obviously just one year's drilling.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: No, I think what you – the way you should look
at it is that once you start a development program, and you drill a few wells, the rest are pretty much by analogy. You
don't get enormous variation on average. So in theory, you could book a lot of PUDs. We tend to be light on PUDs. I
think this past year we're about 25% PUDs as a company.
<Q - Arjun Murti>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: So booking a lot of PUDs is not something we do
an enormous amount of but we do book PUDs because a lot of these are very similar to each other so the statistical
approach gives you a pretty conservative result. We are working on – our costs are coming down as repeatability and
the completion techniques are improving so I'm pretty optimistic that we'll do pretty good but as far as the booking
goes, we'll book on a pretty conservative basis but we are booking some PUDs.

<Q - Arjun Murti>: And then the last question on California, I mean, it looks like at least relative to the 520, a decent
number is within the Kern County Discovery Area as a shale opportunity. Is that all still within that broad range of
economics you provided at the Analyst Meeting? Or is the Kern County Discovery -?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yes.

Your next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI Group.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: In E&P, the growth outlook clearly appears to be improving with the new ventures but Steve,
my question regards the potential for return enhancement between better performance on the base, some of the
divestitures that I think Ray talked about and/or investment in some of the new ventures that were discussed. I mean,
how do you envision normalized returns changing over the next several years related to some of these mechanisms?
And which do you consider to be the most important for better returns?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: We'll start with the fact, of course Argentina
which I said hadn't made any money in four years. So without a lot of effort, I can improve returns.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Right.
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: 40,000 barrels a day making no profit.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: So I think that's – that was a fairly easy thing for
us to compute.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Sure.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: The rest of the – the only drag on the base I think,
the rest of the base ought to be improving. A little higher gas prices, doesn't need a lot and a more aggressive California
outcome should generate very high returns on invested capital. And as that accelerates, we should be doing pretty good.
Same thing in the Permian, the CO2, remember CO2 didn't really cost any additional capital.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: And so the returns ought to improve there, and
that's really a big number. The only downside is we're going to invest the money in the Shah field.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: And so that investment will show up as
investment, and no production for four years so it will be a drag, but I think the rest of it will easily overcome that.

Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Hi, gentlemen. Good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So a couple of things I guess. I'm afraid, the first one on California. Steve, you did mention this
in one of your answers to the other questions, but just to be clear, I mean, the 520 locations that you've de-risked so far,
approximately what are we talking about in terms of de-risked acreage on your 1.6 million acres?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: It wouldn't be material.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So less than 10%?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Oh, for sure.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. So you take your rig count up, you treble it by the looks of things from the start to the end
of 2010. Where do you think that trajectory gets to? I mean are you still building rigs not just in California but across
the lower 48? Can you just give some sense in this higher oil price environment, which I'm guessing you didn't plan for
how that might play into your opportunity set in terms of activity levels?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: On California, I think that once we get real clarity
on the permitting, this thing will accelerate rapidly. There's no reason, except right around the Kern County Discovery
Area why we can't put more rigs to work. We just don't have the permits to drill the wells.
And so once we get clarity on that, in the back half of the year, it would be a fairly sizable increase in the rig count. In
the Permian, I think we're doing okay. We may – as the production starts to build and we get more confidence in some
of these smaller primary wells, we'll probably build that up by a couple more rigs. So the answer to your question is as
the year progresses if it does what we hope, the number of rigs will continue to build, so we would expect as we exit
this year to be at a – a year from now to be at a much higher rig rate than we are now. I can't tell you exactly when
because California, we're still pretty much constrained by the permitting process.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. So I'm trying to reconcile the two, Steve, I'm sorry to labor the point. But – so basically
we've got 12 rigs running, I think is what Bill said before, in 520 locations. So let's assume you double the rig count in
California. I mean how much running room do you really believe that you have there in terms of the shale drilling
program?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I – the 520 is a small percentage of the total that
we actually have. If you count our contingent locations and those sorts of things, right now we're triple this or
something.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Great. And I guess the final one from me is just going back on the production guidance.
The numbers you gave in May were high due north of 800,000 barrels a day as an average for this year, netting out
Argentina, adding back the acquisitions. Could you just help us a little bit with – if what you're trying to tell us with
your guidance for the second half, what would you ideally be looking at in terms of an exit rate, if you like, for the end
of 2011? If that's a number you could provide?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I don't really think of it that way. So I think the
simplest way to look at it is to say that the exit rate for this year will easily lead to next year's – the following year's
numbers, the 2012 numbers we've given you.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: So the 2012 guidance is still good?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: That's right. So until we – we may have to redo it
a little bit and raise it but other than that, if you just look at the 2012 guidance, take out – assume the Argentina and the
acquisitions are a wash just for this purpose, when you get through I think your – so your run rate as you enter sort of
December next year will lead you to the following year's numbers we've given you.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Adjusted for oil prices?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Adjusted for oil prices right. I can't – hopefully
they continue to go up so that'd be all right.

Your next question comes from Philip Dodge of Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Good morning, thanks. It looks like your U.S. gas production increased quarter-to-quarter in the
fourth quarter even though California was down. So if that's correct, can you fill us in on where some of the increases
were taking place?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: We'll let Bill answer that while he's looking for
the – at his tables here. I could guess, but we'll let Bill answer it for real.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: One of the things to point to again is increased primary drilling in the Permian. As you
know, a big part of our program in the Permian on a primary basis is in the Wolfberry, and you get a lot of associated
gas production with those Wolfberry barrels. You also, in terms of California shales, about 60% of the production on a
typical shale well is going to be gas, and those are the two primary areas where we're focusing on in terms of primary
development.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Okay. And then next, could you bring us up to date on the expansion of the processing capacity in
the Discovery Area or in Kern River, both -?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: The plant's been ordered, and we would expect it
to be on the first quarter of next year.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Okay. So no change?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: No change.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Then finally as a detail, in Iraq, can you give us the gross production number for Zubair that goes
along with the 11,000 barrels a day net?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I can't.
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We expect the exit rate for Iraq in 2011, the exit rate, to
be over 300,000 barrels a day.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Okay. And then we just relate your ownership to that number and we're pretty far along?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, it's hard to – it's more complicated than you
might think.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Can you say how much of that would be cost recovery oil?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: The cost recovery percentage is 50% of the

<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The base was 180,000 barrels a day.

Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Of the 107 shale wells outside of Elk Hills that you guys plan to drill, are those all vertical wells or
is any horizontal wells planned in that program?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Bill can answer that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yeah. These are predominantly going to be vertical wells, although we do have a few
horizontals tossed in. But predominantly they're going to be verticals.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay then as you step out into these other areas, is there sufficient infrastructure to move these
volumes to market?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: That's why we're assuring that as we go.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay. So you're building the infrastructure out as you go along in this program?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Or attaching to existing infrastructure. That's part
of the process of making sure these are the numbers we can deliver.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, got you. And then on the permitting side, when you file a permit, how long does it take to –
you file a permit outside traditional areas where you've been drilling before, how long does it take to get that drilling
permit once you've filed?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: That's a more complicated question than you
probably want the answer to. It depends. You have to file a permit for your facilities and a permit to drill the well if
you're outside a field.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: And so it varies based on the Air Quality Board
and those sorts of people. It's been running right now significantly longer than historical but that's probably because
we're given them so many more permits to look at but it just depends. It's very, very difficult to give a rule of thumb
because it just depends. But you do have – you can think of it as two separate permitting processes, one for the facilities
which would include a tank battery would be used this facility.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay. Got you.
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: On a positive note, the new Governor of California and
his administration really want to focus on accelerating job creation, and they do understand that if they speed up our

permitting program, as well as other things they could do, this could lead to new jobs. So they are focused on trying to
be helpful, but as Steve said, it's not something you push a button it happens. Many of these permits have been applied
for already and others would be continuing to be applied for, but there is an interest in Sacramento to speed up the
permitting process. We'll see what happens but at least the intention is very much by the governor and his staff to be
helpful.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Is there a manpower issue in the permitting process in these offices?
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, it's just paying attention. I mean, look, you're
dealing with the government and the State of California, and I think as the governor and his people direct a speedup in
some of this I think we'll get some results.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then one then last question on the Shah gas project, will the
CapEx kind of be ratable over the next four years? Or is it going to – will we see more up front or more towards the
back end?
<A - Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: More towards the back end of the four years.

conventional, how much unconventional, since you're getting the Bakken shales and all that?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Bakken is going to be small in the total. We show
you, I think, in the slide there the small percentage for that and the rest is California, maybe half of California, maybe a
little more than half.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay. What are you seeing -?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: A lot of the drilling on Elk Hills is shale wells,
which is why we've excluded it from this.

areas you're working in? Or is everything pretty much manageable for you?

current cost pressure.

Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS Herold.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Yeah, a quick question just on the macro, natural gas and Ruby pipeline. Is that on schedule to
still start up in the spring? And what's your view of its effect on your overall gas price in California?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: We don't – we market our own gas here in
California, and so we – California gas prices have been strong recently, above NYMEX. I think California gas prices
will stay fairly strong.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. And regarding the unconventional development program, is most of that on your already
vast – it's already on your vast acreage position. So I'm trying to assess what political risk might be. Is it just less
because you're not going out and leasing new areas so the State Lands Commission can't come in and really tell you
want to do? They might – offshore maybe that's more of a risk, but onshore. I'm just wondering if you can give me a
global statement regarding political risk of development of the unconventional resource base?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I don't think it's – most of the acreage is in parts
of the state which are away from the coast and in areas that are basically oil and gas producing areas. So it's not really a
particularly great risk where we operate. If you're talking about the frac fluids and stuff, we don't think that's an issue
where we are.
