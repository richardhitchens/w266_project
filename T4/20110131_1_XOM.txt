MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today's call is
being recorded.
At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010. We will refer to the slides that
are available through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on slide two.
Moving to slide three, we have provided an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. The global
economy appears to be stabilizing, with signs of modest growth in the United States and Europe and continued strong
growth in the developing world, mainly in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. While crude oil prices remain
well above levels of a year ago, natural gas prices have shown only a moderate increase relative to 2009. Downstream
and chemical margins have improved relative to 2009. However, some chemical margins have weakened recently as a
result of new industry capacity coming online.

Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results, as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2010 earnings,
excluding special items, were $9.3 billion, an increase of $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings per
share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $1.85, up $0.58 from a year ago.
The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2011.
CapEx in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, up $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to the
addition of XTO. We continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for
crude oil, natural gas, and finished products.
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 43%.
Moving now to the full-year results as shown on slide five, ExxonMobil's full-year 2010 earnings were $30.5 billion,
up $11.2 billion from 2009. ExxonMobil's full-year 2010 earnings, excluding special items, were also $30.5 billion, up
$11 billion from 2009, which included a charge of $140 million for interest related to the Valdez litigation.
Earnings per share for the year, excluding special items, were $6.22, up $2.21 from 2009. The corporation distributed
$19.7 billion to shareholders in 2010 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total,
$11.2 billion was distributed to purchase shares.
CapEx in 2010 was $32.2 billion, up $5.1 billion from 2009, mainly due to the addition of XTO and continued progress
on our world-class project portfolio, including the Kearl Oil Sands project.
Our cash generation remains very strong, with $51.7 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of
2010, our cash balance was $8.5 billion and debt was $15 billion, which reflects the impact of retiring $7.3 billion of
XTO debt.
We will now provide a review of segmented earnings, starting on slide six. ExxonMobil earnings increased $3.2 billion
from the fourth quarter of 2009, with strong results across all business lines. Upstream earnings increased $1.7 billion,
while downstream earnings improved by $1.3 billion, and chemical earnings grew by $350 million. Corporate and
financing expenses were about $450 million during the quarter, up $190 million versus the fourth quarter of 2009, due
mainly to financing activities.
As shown on slide seven, ExxonMobil earnings increased $1.9 billion from the third quarter of 2010, mainly due to
higher earnings in the upstream, partly offset by slightly lower chemical earnings.
Looking now at the full-year comparison on slide eight, ExxonMobil's full-year 2010 earnings, excluding special items,
were $30.5 billion, up $11 billion from 2009, reflecting strong results in each of our businesses. Upstream earnings
increased $7 billion, while downstream and chemical earnings were up $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.
Corporate and financing expenses, excluding special items, for the full year in 2010 were $2.1 billion, up $340 million
from 2009, due mainly to a tax charge related to the U.S. healthcare legislation and financing activities. The average
quarterly corporate and financing expense in 2010 was $530 million, consistent with our continued guidance of $500
million to $700 million per quarter.
Moving next to the upstream results and beginning on slide nine, ExxonMobil continues to make excellent progress on
its global portfolio of high quality liquids projects. Our recent startup at Odoptu performed extremely well during the
quarter, averaging more than 50,000 barrels per day of liquids production. We also recently set a new world record for
extended reach drilling on the Odoptu OP-11 well. Employing ExxonMobil's proprietary drilling capabilities, this well
reached a total measured depth of 12,345 meters, or over 7.5 miles, with a horizontal reach of 11,475 meters, and was
completed in only 60 days.
In addition, we sanctioned the Arkutun-Dagi project. This project will be developed via a new concrete gravity-based
structure, which will be located 25 kilometers offshore and will be tied into the existing onshore processing facility.
The development will require approximately 45 wells, and is anticipated to have peak production of 90,000 barrels per

day gross. Startup of the Arkutun-Dagi project is anticipated in 2014.
In Iraq, we have awarded contracts for drilling, well workovers, maintenance services, and early project activity. Our
production is ramping up as a result of production optimization, well work, and facility tie-ins. There is currently one
drilling rig operating, and mobilization of additional rigs is progressing. We are also working with the South Oil
Company to form a new field operating division, which will manage the planning, surveillance, and day-to-day
activities of petroleum operations in the field.
In Canada, ExxonMobil continues to make strong progress at our Kearl Oil Sands project, which is on schedule for a
year-end 2012 startup.
Turning now to our gas portfolio on slide 10, in Papua New Guinea project execution is underway, including
infrastructure development. Contractors for the major work sites have been mobilized, and we are currently
commencing pipe-lay operations. The pipeline will be approximately 450 miles long, including both the onshore and
offshore sections. The pipeline route traverses some extremely challenging terrain on its path from the Southern
Highlands to the LNG facility located near Port Moresby.
Earlier this month, we signed a joint venture agreement with Qatar Petroleum to progress the Barzan project. This
project is expected to supply 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, beginning in 2014. The Barzan project will be
located in Ras Laffan Industrial City, and will be operated by RasGas Company Limited. The project will produce and
process gas from Qatar's North field, supplying natural gas to local industry in Qatar and associated hydrocarbon
liquids to local and international markets.
During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced the completion of an expansion to the carbon dioxide capture plant at our
LaBarge facility in Wyoming. The expansion has increased the amount of CO2 captured by the plant for third-party use
by 50%. On any one day, the facility is now capable of capturing a CO2 volume equivalent to the emissions of more
than 1.5 million cars.
Turning now to our North American unconventional portfolio on slide 11, we have approximately 70 rigs working
across the United States' unconventional plays. These rigs are selectively deployed to the highest priority locations
from our large drilling inventory of over 20,000 wells. For example, in the Fayetteville, strong drilling results have
doubled gross operated production between the beginning and end of 2010. In the Haynesville, gross operated
production has quadrupled over the same period
During the quarter, we acquired Petrohawk Energy's Fayetteville shale assets, which include 150,000 net acres and 95
million cubic feet per day of net production. This represents an attractive addition to XTO's existing position in the
Fayetteville play, which now comprises approximately 550,000 net acres.
In the Haynesville, we are progressing our joint venture with Encana across our 108,000 gross acre joint venture area.
In both the Encana joint venture and legacy XTO acreage, we are also drilling and testing the prospective Bossier
reservoir in selected wells.
We also continue to increase activity in our liquids-rich opportunities in the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays. During
2010, we drilled 15 wells in the Eagle Ford, with five wells drilled in the fourth quarter. In the Bakken, we drilled an
additional 19 wells during the fourth quarter, bringing the total wells drilled in 2010 to 63.
We are also continuing to expand our acreage position in other key North American unconventional plays. For
example, in Canada, we added approximately 18,000 net acres adjacent to our core area at Horn River.
Turning now to unconventional activities outside of North America on slide 12, we are actively evaluating our captured
unconventional opportunities in Europe, Indonesia, and Argentina, while also continuing to pursue other global
opportunities. In Germany, we completed drilling our first coal bed methane well in the Lower Saxony area. In
mid-November, we moved the drilling rig to a second location, which is also targeting coal bed methane. The data
recovered from these and other planned wells will be used to assess the coal bed methane resource potential in the
region.

In Indonesia, we hold prospective coal bed methane acreage in the Barito Basin totaling approximately 290,000 net
acres. We plan to conduct pilot tests to evaluate the viability of Indonesia coal bed methane as a gas resource, and
expect to initiate exploration drilling in February of this year.
In Argentina, ExxonMobil and YPF acquired two blocks in the third Neuquen tender round, covering approximately
48,000 net acres. In 2010, we captured a total of 132,000 acres in the Neuquen Basin, and look forward to the
opportunity to work with our partner to evaluate the potential of this acreage to produce unconventional natural gas.
Next, I would like to give you an exploration update on slide 13. Starting with our active program in the Gulf of
Mexico, evaluation of the Hadrian North oil discovery is ongoing, and we plan to drill the Hadrian-5 well as soon as
the permits are granted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. We have submitted all the required permit
applications.
The Deepwater Champion drill ship is currently being mobilized to Turkey, and is on track to arrive in the March-April
timeframe. We will utilize the Deepwater Champion for our drilling campaign in the Black Sea, which will include
wells in both Turkey and Romania.
We have also recently entered into an agreement with Rosneft regarding joint development of oil and gas resources off
the Russian coast of the Black Sea.
We continue to have success in our established exploration program. We drilled a successful well in the Cepu block in
Indonesia and plan to drill another well this year. We also participated in a successful well near the Jansz field offshore
Western Australia. This is the fifth gas discovery in this area in which we have participated during the last 18 months.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 14, upstream earnings in the fourth
quarter were $7.5 billion, up $1.7 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009. Stronger worldwide realizations resulted in an
increase in earnings of $1.4 billion, as crude oil realizations increased $10.84 per barrel, and gas realizations increased
$0.29 per Kcf. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $560 million, driven mainly by project startups in Qatar.
Other items, primarily higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, decreased earnings by
$240 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $16.37.
Moving now to slide 15, oil equivalent volumes increased 19% from the fourth quarter of last year, as a result of the
addition of XTO and strong project performance in Qatar.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 16, versus the third quarter of 2010, upstream earnings
increased by $2 billion, with stronger global realizations resulting in an additional $1.2 billion in earnings, as crude oil
realizations increased $9.81 per barrel, and gas realizations increased $0.71 per Kcf. Higher volumes increased
earnings by $870 million, as a result of higher seasonal gas demand in Europe, and strong Qatar project volume
performance.
Moving to slide 17, oil equivalent volumes increased almost 12% from the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to
stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe.
Turning now to the full-year comparison, and starting on slide 18, upstream earnings were $24.1 billion in 2010, an
increase of $7 billion from 2009. Higher global realizations, primarily liquids, led to an increase in earnings of $6.5
billion. Higher volumes, mainly from Qatar projects, added another $1.2 billion to earnings. All other items, including
unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and higher operating expenses, decreased earnings by $690 million.
Moving now to slide 19, volumes grew by 13%, or 515,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, compared to 2009.
Excluding the addition of XTO, volumes increased a robust 6%, or 250,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, due to strong
project performance in Qatar, and strong operational results across our global upstream portfolio. For further data on
regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.
Moving now to the downstream and starting on slide 20, during the quarter, we continued to demonstrate our
commitment to maintaining best-in-class operations. Recently, our Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands marked two
significant milestones. First, the site marked 50 years of operation. And second, it achieved four years without a single

lost time incident, sustaining an impressive safety performance trend. The site also continues to achieve industry
leading energy efficiency performance, consistently placing in the first quartile in the Solomon benchmark studies.
Rotterdam continues to be an important hub in the global refining and petrochemical industry, and ExxonMobil has
contributed to the economic success of this uniquely positioned international port within Europe.
As shown on slide 21, our Lubricants business was selected as the preferred supplier of engine oil products for Nissan
North America. As a result, Nissan and Infiniti dealers in the United States will recommend Mobil branded engine oil
products for all dealer-based vehicle service and will have access to ExxonMobil sales and marketing support.
ExxonMobil is a market leader in synthetic oils, and our global brands continue to grow in this high value sector of the
market. Technology leadership, supply reliability, and customer trust underpin the commercial success of our brands.
Turning now to the downstream operating results, starting on slide 22, downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were
$1.2 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher industry refining margins were the main
contributor, increasing earnings by more than $1.2 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $10 million,
while other factors improved earnings by $130 million, primarily due to lower operating expenses.
Moving to slide 23, sequentially, fourth quarter downstream earnings decreased by $10 million. Favorable margin
factors increased earnings by $220 million, while volume and mix effects had a positive contribution of $30 million.
Other factors decreased earnings by $260 million, including unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher
maintenance activity.
The full-year comparison for the downstream is shown on slide 24. Downstream full-year 2010 earnings were $3.6
billion, up $1.8 billion from 2009. Higher margins increased earnings by $1.2 billion, reflecting stronger industry
refining margins. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $420 million due to positive mix effects and benefits
from our refining optimization activities. Other effects increased earnings a total of $210 million, mainly due to lower
operating expense.
Turning now to our chemical business and starting on slide 25, ExxonMobil Chemical completed two projects in the
fourth quarter of 2010 that support the demand growth of butyl polymers, one of our key specialty businesses.
ExxonMobil Chemical has a long history of developing premium butyl polymers used in tire inner-liners that help keep
tiers properly inflated. Our products add value through enhanced performance in areas, such as energy efficiency,
longer product life, and greenhouse gas emission reduction.
In Kawasaki, Japan, our joint venture, Japan Butyl Company, has implemented new proprietary process technology.
The conventional butyl reaction occurs at cryogenic temperatures. But ExxonMobil has developed new technology that
allows the reaction to occur at warmer temperatures, saving significant energy and capital investment. In November,
this new technology was awarded the Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award in recognition of its innovation. Leveraging
this new technology, the Kawasaki site capacity was increased by more than 20%.
During the planned fourth quarter 2010 down time at our butyl plant in Fawley in the U.K., we upgraded critical
equipment to help ensure reliable supply to our customers. The completion of these two projects in Japan, and the U.K.
demonstrates ExxonMobil's commitment to help meet the growing demand for butyl rubber.
In addition to the butyl projects, we initiated a 10% capacity expansion at one of our flagship hydrocarbon fluids plant,
located in Antwerp, Belgium. This expansion will strengthen our supply reliability of high performance fluids using
applications, such as water treatment, and is expected to be completed later this year.
We also continue to progress one of the largest projects ever executed by ExxonMobil, with the world-scale expansion
of our chemical site in Singapore. These projects demonstrate our commitment to support growing chemical customer
demand while leveraging our advantaged feedstock, products, and technology.
Turning now to the Chemical operating results, starting on slide 26, fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $1.1 billion,
up $350 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved margins across our portfolio of commodity and specialty
products added $380 million, while volume and mix and other effects decreased earnings by $30 million.

Moving to slide 27, sequentially, fourth quarter chemical earnings decreased by $160 million. Margin effects decreased
earnings by $110 million, primarily reflecting higher feedstock costs. Volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $30
million, driven by seasonally lower volumes. Other effects decreased earnings $20 million.
On slide 28, we show the full-year comparison for Chemical results. 2010 earnings were a record
$4.9 billion, more than double 2009. Substantially stronger margins increased earnings by $2 billion, while volume and
mix effects added $380 million. Other effects improved earnings by $200 million, primarily due to the absence of
hurricane costs from 2009.
Overall, the financial and operating results achieved in 2010 were a clear demonstration of the competitive strengths of
our chemical company. As chemical demand began to recover from the economic downturn, we leveraged our
advantaged feedstock, reliable operations, and unique product portfolio to deliver these record results.
Moving to slide 29, while we manage our downstream and chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture
benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Both businesses delivered strong results in
2010 with combined earnings of $8.5 billion, up $4.4 billion from 2009, reflecting our competitive advantages, and the
strength of our business model.
Moving to slide 30, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full-year financial and operating performance were strong, and
reflect the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. We maintain a
continuous focus on operational excellence and improving upon our industry leading safety performance. We are
continuing with the disciplined execution of our long-term investment plan. And we are moving forward on the
flawless integration of XTO's world-class organization into our existing portfolio of high quality assets. As we continue
to deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains
well-positioned to maximize shareholder value.
Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First, in mid-February we will be releasing our 2010 reserves
performance data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our analyst meeting this year will take place at the
New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 9th. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9 AM
Eastern, 8 AM Central time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is
open.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Hi. Good morning, David, great results this morning. I guess maybe just thinking about the
XTO, we're a few months more into it. What is surprising you, and particularly on the liquids side if you could give us
some details on, say, current production in Bakken and Eagle Ford, and the potential medium term outlook for your
liquids production elsewhere across the Lower 48 portfolio?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Ed, first of all, thank you for your
initial comment. And as you would guess, we are very pleased with how the results turned out in the fourth quarter and
of course, the full year 2010. In addition to the financial and operating results that I mentioned, I would like to point out
that once again we had an excellent year in the areas that really underpin our strong financial and operating results. We
had record safety performance. We continued our overall focus on risk management and environmental performance,
and generally across the portfolio had a very good year.
If we look specifically at XTO, I don't know if I'd call it a surprise, but I can tell you that the integration has gone very,
very well. We're very pleased with the way the organizations have come together and have been able to seamlessly

integrate all the strengths that XTO brought to the merger in addition to being able to quickly utilize some of the
technology advantages that ExxonMobil had in order to begin to deliver the type of results that we were expecting in
terms of improving production, as well as lowering OpEx.
Attrition has remained low. Activity has increased over the year, as you've seen and as I've mentioned in my script. We
have had a number of increases in the areas that I mentioned in my text with the 70 rigs we have running. And there's
been some particular focus in making sure we have equipment in the highest priority wells, in particular, in the Bakken
and Eagle Ford. So, all in all, we are very pleased with the integration, and how things are going. And I'll also tell you
that we will discuss XTO, and the integration at length in our analyst meeting in March, and we look forward to your
participation in that.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: And then maybe one follow-on, specifically just in the cash flow in Q4, can you just say
what the working capital contribution was of that $13 billion? And obviously, your CapEx was up to $10 billion in 4Q.
Normally, you do spend a lot more money in Q4, but what should we expect in terms of with the project sanctions
CapEx for 2011?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Let's talk about the cash flow first,
and then take a look at CapEx. If we look at our cash flow from operations fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the
same quarter last year, of course, it's really driven by the higher earnings that we saw, and the depreciation and $1.3
billion in asset sales, and that really makes up the bulk of it. The working capital effects were basically negligible, very
little.
If we look at CapEx in the fourth quarter, it was a strong quarter, fairly typical of what we see in the fourth quarter of
most years. We generally see a little higher activity, including, of course, partner billings and that sort of thing, but it
really reflects the ongoing spending in our projects. And we'll give you an update for the full year at the March analyst
meeting, but it would not be appropriate to take the fourth quarter rate and multiply that by four for 2011. And again,
we will give you a fulsome update of our CapEx outlook in March.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure thing, thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Good, thanks. I've just got a couple of things. On the Barzan project, can you just talk a little bit
about – how does that compare to what you already have in Qatar? Are these locally priced contracts? And can you
give an idea of what the condensate yield would be so we can figure out what that means for the company in 2014?
And then I have a follow-up.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, Doug, yes. That gas will be
priced into the local market. And as you would expect, that price is certainly going to be less than what LNG trades for
on a global basis. But then the investment to produce and deliver that gas, of course, is less.
As far as what the condensate yield is going to be, I don't think it's going to be way different than other projects, but it's
really too early for me to quote an exact number on that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, great stuff. My follow- up is more of a housekeeping question on the results. Obviously,
you've had – I think you said $1.3 billion on your previous commentary. I thought it was $1.7 billion in the release of
asset sales on cash flow. Anyways, nevertheless, what I'm looking for is what is the actual contribution to net income

from gains on asset sales and foreign exchange? Just give us an idea what the actual underlying clean number was. And
if possible, I know you might be reluctant to do this, but can you give us an idea what the contribution was from XTO
in the quarter? That would be great.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, let me, first of all, hit the
absolute asset sales cash generation, just so that we're all clear on that. The absolute value of asset sales in the fourth
quarter was $1.7 billion, and that was an increase from the same quarter of last year of about $1.3 billion.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: If you look at total asset sales across
the company in the fourth quarter, the earnings impact of those things, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 was
minimal, around a couple hundred million dollars. We have an ongoing program, as you know, but there was really
nothing substantial in the fourth quarter in total different from the prior year's quarter.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So the proceeds, David, in the fourth quarter, the $1.7 billion, that was from pre-announced
sales, and that just happened to complete in the fourth quarter? Is that how I should think about it?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, that's from the sales that closed
in the fourth quarter; and for example, would not include the Canada sale that we announced, but hasn't closed yet.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Would you be care to give us the XTO contribution?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: The XTO earnings contribution or the
XTO cash flow contribution?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: The earnings contribution, if you have it.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes. As you'll see in the 10-K that
we'll publish, the fourth quarter total earnings were $120 million, and for the full year about $259 million.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Perfect. Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure thing. Thank you, Doug.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Fine. Could I just – I hope you won't count this as a question, but could you give us the volumes
associated with XTO as well, and I guess just make clear whether that includes the Fayetteville stuff that you bought.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Are you interested in the full
year or the fourth quarter in particular?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes, just the comparable stuff for what you just told Doug on earnings. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. The total volumes on an OEB
basis were about 520,000, okay?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: And in the third quarter, they were
about 498,000, so we're up quarter on quarter.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: Got you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: And that included a minimal bit from
the acquisitions, but it's really all XTO.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Great, David. Thank you, and then if I can have just a couple more on volumes. Firstly on Iraq, I
think I've read that you were producing about 255,000 barrels a day at West Qurna. And if I remember rightly, your
base production level is 244,000. You want to get to 268,000 to get to 10% above your base level and hit commercial
production.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Right.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Can you confirm that I'm firstly right on the 255,000; and secondly, give us an estimate of how
long it will take you to hit that 268,000?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, you're correct on your numbers,
by and large, Paul. And we would expect to hit that 268,000 by the end of the first half of this year.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: 1H, and then how much would you expect the total full-year contribution to be? How much more
growth do you think you'll get in '11 over '10?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: I don't know. Paul, I don't have that
number. It may be a little too early to tell until we can see where we are at the end of the first half and achieve what
we're trying to do there. But I will tell you, as I mentioned, we're on track. Plans are progressing well. And I'll tell you,
we're very pleased with how things are going, and we're looking forward to continuing on the plan we are, mobilizing
the rigs that we've got contracted out, and really just continuing the progress that we've been making.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Is there anything to add on the water? The water I think is called the Common Seawater Supply
Facility.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: As we mentioned, I think, in the past,
we're leading the concept selection study. And of course, what we're trying to do is really provide the seawater that's
needed to all the southern Iraqi oil fields for the pressure there. We're currently evaluating the study results and
thinking about what the best way is to proceed, what that timeline might be, and how to go about doing it. But don't
have anything more specific than that today. We're still really looking at it and trying to understand what's in front of
us, and how we go about looking at it.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Great, thanks, David. And if I could have a final one on volumes would be Qatar. I was just
wondering what your exit rate was relative to your, I guess, nameplate capacity there, and how much therefore, growth
we could expect to see delivering in 2011 again. And that will be my last one. Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. If I step back, I'll say in general
all of the facilities that we have started up in Qatar exited the year at capacity. I'll tell you the run rates, and the uptime
have just been phenomenal since those projects have started up. And so we exited the year – basically, you can think
about us being at full capacity. And therefore, in terms of a run rate, I think we're pretty much spot on.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes, and therefore, the capacity will stay approximately the same in 2011?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: I think, by and large, you would
expect it to be generally about the same.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: That's helpful, David. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: It might be up just a little bit, but I
think generally about the same.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thanks, David.

And our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Thank you. Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: I want to ask a couple questions on your unconventional natural gas portfolio, starting with the
Horn River. My understanding is that other operators in the Horn River area have reported reasonably high levels of
CO2 and H2S in the gas stream, and that has slowed down their drilling in this particular winter campaign. Can you
talk about the gas quality that you're encountering, and then also confirm when you would expect significant pipeline
capacity to be in place to allow you to actually move those volumes to market?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, Jason. As you know, Horn River
is a key focus area in our global unconventional portfolio, in particular, in North America. We do have continued active
drilling underway in our wells. We're testing those, both our wells, as well as wells we have in the joint venture. I'll tell
you those wells are performing well, and they successfully verified the presence of multiple productive reservoir areas
on our leaseholds. Without giving totals, we're seeing average test rates of anywhere from 0.5 million to 1.5 million
cubic feet a day from a single frac, so we're happy with that.
In terms of your question on CO2 and H2S, I'll tell you while we're continuing our evaluation on that, I really don't
have any information, and couldn't comment on that specific question.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Okay, that's fine. And just a quick follow-up before I ask my second question. That's per frac
stage that you're getting 0.5 million to 1.5 million, and you would theoretically be looking at something on the order of
10 to 12 frac stages there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, that would be about right, maybe
a little more than that.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Okay, great. And second question, I believe one of your executives was quoted as saying that
North Rhine-Westphalia would have about 2,100 billion cubic meters of gas potential. I appreciate that you talked
about drilling a couple of CBM wells in Germany over the course of the quarter. But given that type of a resource base,
when would you expect to really start ramping up drilling activity and putting 10 to 15 to 20 rigs into the field?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: As we come off of what has been a
very successful 2009 and 2010 program, whereas we talked about before, we've been testing wells both in the shale
plays, as well as now in the coal bed methane, and those are going very well. As we look into 2011, we are going to be
continuing with our drilling program, again, both CBM and shale gas. We are still evaluating the wells that we've been
drilling, and we're in the early evaluation stages. It's like the U.S. unconventional of several years ago.
What I can tell you is we did drill our first two coal bed methane wells last year. We're taking a look at those, and then
we'll really be determining what the exact drilling plan is going into this year, but we would expect that to ramp up a
little bit. And in fact, we're getting ready to spud a well on the western side of the Lower Saxony acreage here in the
first quarter, so progressing right along, what you'd expect in an evaluation stage of a very large resource potential. And
hopefully, as the year progresses and we have more well results, we'll be able to give a little better outlook on what to
expect in terms of timing and activity.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: That's great. Thank you, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.

And your next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: First on the Barzan project, I guess there's maybe a little bit of confusion with respect to your
working interest in the project. Your F&O from last year says 10%. I've seen references to 7% in the trades. Could you
clarify what that is; and my assumption that it's a production-sharing contract, is that accurate? And I also have a
follow-up.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Let me start with the first part
on our working interest. I can confirm that it is 7%. As we go forward with the project, in terms of what type of fiscal
arrangement we have, we're still finalizing those agreements, and I really don't have any comments in terms of their
specificity at this point.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, David. My follow-up relates in general to Iraq, and how you're accounting for it both in
terms of production, as well as earnings. And I was hoping you might be able to tie your response in that regard to what
looks to me to be an unusual price/spend variance on slide 17 of your presentation, where price/spend factors versus the
third quarter increased volumes by 39,000 a day, if I'm interpreting it correctly. Is there an Iraq element to this, or
exactly what's driving that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, Mark. I'd be happy to hit both of
those. Let me start with the second one first, if we're looking at sequential volumes between the fourth quarter, and
third quarter. The price and spend impact you saw there of 39,000 barrels a day, that was really generally attributable to
much higher activity across a number of countries. We saw a much higher level of spending, and again, just across
West Africa, and a number of other places, but nothing out of the ordinary.
If we back up and talk about your Iraq question, we have not booked any significant production or earnings or any of
that sort of stuff yet this year. Obviously, that will come on later in the year when we hit our improved production
target. And then as that progresses, we'll be able to get more information on that. But I can tell you in 2010, there just
wasn't really anything to talk about it.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay, David. Thank you very much.

<Q - Paul Cheng>: Very good, thank you. Dave, talking about Iraq, given the service contract, from an accounting

<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay. So, should we assume that you did book reserve related to Iraq in 2010?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Excuse me, Paul. Would you repeat
that? Did you say we de-booked?
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Right, did you book reserve related to Iraq in 2010? Could we assume that you have reserved
booking in 2010 related to Iraq?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: We'll be giving an update on our
reserves performance here in a couple of weeks, and I really wouldn't want to get out ahead of that release on either in
total or in any specific country.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay, that's fine. On XTO, David, you're saying the total production in fourth quarter is 520,000
BOE per day.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Can you break out for us what is between the liquid, and the gas side?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Liquids production was 87 kBD,
and then gas production was about 2.6 MCFD.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay. And the $120 million, the net income you're talking about for XTO, I assume that is net of
hedging – or before hedging, I should say?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, yes. Let's remember the
discussion we had last quarter. There is some hedging that goes into earnings and some that just goes into cash flow.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: And as you'll see, if I break the $120
million up, it's about $84 million associated with the derivative impact in earnings, and about $36 million in the base.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: The $120 million is the net income you report, right?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, in our earnings, yes.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Right. And what's the $84 million then? That is the mark-to-market loss, or that is the realized
hedging gain that you referred to?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: No, if you think about when we
completed the acquisition, and we had to mark-to-market all of the hedges at the time.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: What flows to earnings after that – of
course, the original booking is based on the strip. What flows to earnings after that is gains that you make on those
hedges as gas prices drop. And so it's that piece that then flows to earnings. And we saw that in the third quarter, and
then again on the fourth quarter.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay. So, if I look at it without hedging the impact at all, then the earning is $36 million only?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, that would be the answer for the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay. All right, and a final one for me, any update for Poland?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. I'd be happy to give you an
update where we are in Poland. As you know, we have a lot of acreage there. And we've been analyzing that, running
seismic, and doing things really to get ready for a drilling campaign. We do expect, as we head into this year, we're

going to have a couple of wells. In fact, we spud our first well in December. And we would expect to have a couple of
those completed this year, and really give us an opportunity to get an early look at that. But I stress an early look,
because we're just at the beginning stages of evaluating what we have in Poland. But as part of our global
unconventional resource portfolio, this is certainly one that we're excited to move forward and get the evaluation of that
resource underway.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Do you have a total number of wells you target in Poland for this year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: The total number of wells, as we look
across 2011, I don't have a total outlook for you other than I know we're going to drill the first two. We'll see how those
go, what we learn. And then later on in the year, we can probably give you a full-year outlook.

<Q - Faisel Khan>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Faisel. How are you?
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, a question on the accounting side here. Your effective tax rate dropped sequentially from
the third quarter of '10 to the fourth quarter of '10. I was wondering, how much of that is a function of the mix of
earnings coming from, I guess, lower tax jurisdictions versus end-of-the-year effects?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: That's an excellent question. And I
can tell you it's basically all due to just a mix of both the businesses between the upstream, downstream, and chemical.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: As well as the mix in geographies, but
that's really it in a nutshell.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay, understood. And on the U.S. Chemical side, it looks like prime product sales dropped pretty
precipitously from the third quarter of '10 to the fourth quarter of '10. I'm just wondering what's driving that large
drop-off in sales?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: It's really the impact of a major
turnaround we have going on at Beaumont.
<Q - Faisel Khan>: Okay. Would you say that had a major impact on the earnings number for the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: It didn't have a major impact. It's part
of the volume effect. But the biggest impact we saw quarter on quarter was the rapid rise in feedstock costs that really
outpaced price increases as we went through the quarter.

<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Blake.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: A question for you on Brazil; I was hoping maybe you could give us a status update: A, if
you could confirm the recent dry hole there; and B, elaborate on any future plans?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Let me step back just a second
and give you an update in general on Brazil. The well that we completed in the fourth quarter, the Sabia well, did
encounter non-commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, so it was expensed in the fourth quarter.
As we look across the block, we are continuing to analyze data from all three wells that we drilled in the block. As you
would guess, a block that size, and those three wells in different locations and complexities, there's a lot to look at, and
analyze with our co-venturers. But we're going to take some time, review all of that information, and then determine
the next steps for our evaluation plan for the block. So, we've got a lot of information, and there's a lot of analysis to do.
And as we progress, what we're going to do next, we'll provide that update in subsequent quarters.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Great. Okay, thank you. And my second question was on the Gulf of Mexico. I was just
curious if you have any experience to-date with permitting, what the status is on the well containment system, and if
that's being embraced by the BOEM?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, let me start first with the
drilling. The most important well we have is the Hadrian-5 well. You might recall that was an appraisal well on our oil
discovery up in Keathley Canyon. We were just about to start that well when the – commence operations when the
moratorium started. I can tell you that a revised permit application has been submitted to the BOEM, and we're
awaiting on their approvals. We feel like we've submitted all the information that's required, and we are anxiously
awaiting those permits to be approved so that we can get after that well.
When we talk about the marine well containment system, we continue to make really good progress on the overall – the
larger project that we talked about. We also have – we're continuing on the interim on expanded containment systems
that we can have available literally very soon. I think the interim system; everybody can look forward to that being
available here very quickly; and then the larger one that we've talked about before, a little later on. So, good progress
being made there, and we look forward to getting both of those done, and getting on with drilling.

whether it's too early to know.

Indonesia, of course, this was a big year for us with the progress we're making in Cepu, the wells that we successfully
drilled here last year, so that's progressing.

You did note Natuna. Yes, there has been progress in there. In December, we signed a heads of agreement with
Pertamina. And that framework's going to provide is a framework for negotiation of a new production sharing
agreement with the government. And we look forward to progressing those discussions, and getting a mutually
agreeable terms for development sometime later this year. So, we would expect that to progress further.
Now, as we look at Natuna in terms of the ultimate disposition of the gas, or how we're going to get that gas to market,
obviously, as you would guess, we're looking at how we're going to maximize the value of that resource. But I'll tell

<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: – commodity, and the specialty
business. The commodity business did exactly what you would expect when you have an ability to leverage your
feedstock advantage. And in the specialty business, we saw nice volume increases in there and with the margins that we
have. And then if we look at the full-year basis for those, I think the commodity piece of that was the bulk of the year,
certainly the bulk of the year-to-year increase. I can tell you that. I don't have any absolute values here in front of me,
but it drove the bulk of the year-to-year change.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Right. Thanks a lot, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.

And your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Thanks for taking my question, guys. First on PNG/LNG, we've seen a lot of comments
about cost escalations, labor shortages in Australia. And of course, recognizing that it's not quite the same scenario in
PNG, I was wondering if you have any comments on how that might be affecting your PNG project.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, I'd be happy to give you an
update on the PNG project. It is underway, as I mentioned in my script. We've got infrastructure development
underway. We've got a lot of work going on with our contractors. It is progressing right along. But I would tell you that
we really haven't seen any impact on the PNG project from the items you noted. We're on track for a 2014 startup.
Security, of course, is a very big focus area for us. And I know occasionally in the press you read about security items,
but those are being managed with a very comprehensive risk management program in-country. So, like any project,
large complicated project, there are things that happen from time to time, but nothing out of the ordinary. And we
remain on track to start up that project on schedule.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on Hadrian-5. Once you get the permit, if, and when
that happens, what kind of completion time do you guys expect?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: I don't know exactly what type of – or
how long the completion time is expected. I do know that once we get the permit, we're going to be able to get after it
and get the well underway. And I would expect it would be typical of any Gulf of Mexico well in that depth of water,
but nothing out of the ordinary.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: All right, thanks very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.

And our next question comes from John Herrlin with Société Générale. Your line is open.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Yes, thank you, three quick ones. David, you mentioned unconventional activities both in North
America and abroad. Could you give us a sense of what spending will be like on unconventional in 2011 versus 2010?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: I don't have an outlook for you yet for
2011. We will talk about that, of course, as part of our CapEx outlook in the analyst meeting in March. So, I'll just have
to ask for you to wait until then, and we're going to give a pretty fulsome outlook on that business. It will be an active
year, but the actual CapEx, we're going to have it in a few weeks.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay, next one. With XTO, could you give us a sense of what kind of completion optimization
success that you've had? Were you able to increase drilling times, reduce frac costs, that sort of thing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: I can tell you – of course, it's still a
little early. We're only six months into this. I can tell you that we've been able to take some ExxonMobil technology
and apply it to some of the wells that are being drilled and do some crossover of that. We have seen some success in
that regard; but again, the specifics of which I think we'll save for, again, a more fulsome discussion at the analyst
meeting in March. We'll talk a lot about the integration, and the progress we're making. But rest assured, we are
transferring technology. We're transferring best practices back and forth. And again, we will talk more about that in
March.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay, last one from me, David. What were your net capitalized costs at the end of the year
upstream?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: If you're talking about the total capital
deployed in the business?
<Q - John Herrlin>: No, your net capitalized cost in 2009 was about $85 billion. I was wondering where you ended up
last year.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: We don't have the segmentation yet
for the businesses.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay.
<Q - John Herrlin>: That's fine.

And our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Hi, David. Would you mind if I asked you a question about your energy outlook?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure, that would be just fine.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. What's obvious from that is your more bullish view of natural gas demand versus coal,
compared to other commentators. I'm just wondering if you could just characterize Exxon's view of natural gas versus

coal, how it differs to other people, and what's driving the numbers, which you're coming up with here.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure. Of course, the primary growth
in the usage of natural gas is going to be in power generation. And I think if you've seen our energy outlook, you see
the growth in that. One of the fundamental reasons for the numbers that we have tabled, of course, is an assumption on
cost of carbon. However, form that might come would certainly drive some conversion of coal to gas.
I think one of the other things that we have out there, as you see the economy ramp up and as you see the demand for
power generation to ramp up, certainly the source of electricity generation that can be brought on the quickest,
particularly here in the U.S., is fueled by natural gas. So, if you're looking short term, increased industrial demand,
increased need for power generation electricity. And then longer term as we go out and look at the dynamics, the
assumption that there will be some cost of carbon included, and as you know, natural gas has 60% less GHG emissions
than a typical coal-fired plant does, and so you'll have an inherent competitive advantage.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. Thanks for that, and can I ask a question on the results?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Sure.
<Q - Iain Reid>: In European gas, are you seeing further pressures from your customers for your oil and gas to try and
renegotiate some of the contracts to try to reduce the oil linkage and to focus more on spot?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Certainly, if you look at the European
gas market this year, it has been a good year; very robust demand, particularly in the fourth quarter. Prices have held up
well, and it has been a good market.
I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to comment on specific commercial discussions or commercial agreements that are
underway other than saying that the strategy we've implied in Europe, which is both to supply with indigenously
produced gas on the continent, as well as the ability to bring cargos of LNG out of Qatar into the U.K. And into the
Adriatic and benefit from a nice, strong spot market, all of that business, as we look across the year and particularly in
the latter half, has been very successful. But I wouldn't attribute that to any one contract that we have in place or
comment about what's going on with those other than to say diversified portfolio, diversified contract mix, divertible
cargos. That strategy has been very healthy for us this year.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Sorry, you just mentioned divertible cargos. Is it possible to say what quantity of diverts you
managed in the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: I don't have a specific number for the
quarter. I think if you think about in general, we've said the cargos coming out of Qatar in total, about two-thirds of
them run out in long-term contracts. And the balance are spot, and those are divertible, which is how the big picture
looks there. And again, we benefited very well from that here in the year.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you.

And your next question comes from Jacques Rousseau from RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Jacques Rousseau>: Good morning, just a quick question on asset sales. I guess in the quarter, you said about
$1.7 billion of asset sales, which I think was about the same amount as you had sold through the first three quarters. So,
my question is in prior years, you seem to have sold more in higher commodity price environments. Is that something
we should look forward to in the next couple of years assuming oil and such stays around where it is?
<A - David S. Rosenthal, Secretary and Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, that's an excellent question. I
have to tell you, though, the pace of our asset management program is not driven by swings in commodity prices and

margins. We have a fairly robust ongoing program, and it's very disciplined in its approach. And we don't have any
specific targets year by year or business by business.
What you do see, though, and have seen very strongly this past year is a program where it sounds simple, but if some
assets of ours are worth more to others than they are to us, we're happy to sell them. And that's irrespective – you can
do that in a low price or margin environment. You can do that in a high price environment. But it's really just an
ongoing disciplined program, and I wouldn't have an outlook for 2011. We'll just progress the year like we did last year
and see what opportunities are presented.
