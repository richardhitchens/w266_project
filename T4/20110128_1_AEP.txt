Thanks Chuck, and let me join in the welcoming all of you here as we look at 2010 and share a bit of 2011 with you.
We're quite pleased with the way that things ended in 2010 by almost any measure that we look at: the overall earnings
of $3.03, north of our midpoint $3 range that we spoke of as the year went on. And as you'll remember we tightened
our ranges throughout the year. Tremendous rate success as we shared with you as the year progressed and a good
foundation for the rate activities in 2011 and beyond.
Overall the returns on equity for the AEP System were 10.75% collectively. We think that is an extremely strong
number. As you know, we had two dividend increases for a total of 12% of an increase. As we go in the total
shareholder return was 8.7%, something that we were very pleased with. And lastly and very importantly 2010 was
another year where AEP did not experience any fatalities. So we're quite pleased in every way that we measure 2010.
When we look at 2011 as you know, we've shared with in October our earnings forecast of somewhere between $3 and
$3.20. We feel comfortable about our opportunity to perform at that level. We clearly have demonstrated and will
continue to demonstrate our ability not only to manage O&M but also to manage the capital spending on our system.
We will continue to put equity capital to work in those jurisdictions where we feel more comfortable with the rate
treatment and the rate process and continue obviously to make those investments necessary to make sure that reliability
and customer satisfaction continues to be strong and growing.
Our regulatory plan, which we've shared with you for 2011, has a total stack of required rate increases of some $235
million to-date. $162 million of that is already built in to the rates that we're recovering effective on January 1. We do
have a settlement in West Virginia that we hope to be approved in the not too distant future. That will add another $45
million, and leave us about $28 million short of the total goal that we have for calendar year 2011. And we have a
number of current rate proceedings and others that we will file as the year progresses to fill up that last piece, so we feel
comfortable about our rate plan as we have before.
Not dissimilar from almost every year at American Electric Power, Ohio and Ohio rate proceedings will take center
stage as 2011 unfolds. As many of you know from yesterday's press releases we filed our ESP plan and we'll talk about
that in a few moments. It obviously is the center stage activity for us and it will be affected by new commissioners
being appointed. But as we've done before we feel comfortable that we will find a way to manage ourselves through the
events in Ohio here as they pertain not only to ESP but to the 2010 SEET review which will go on as you all remember
through calendar year 2011.
A couple of important policy update discussions, let me spend a few moments. I think you're all very aware of what the
Edison Electric Institute and many people call the EPA train wreck, it's a series of orders and rules that will come out of
the EPA as the year progresses that will have an effect on the generation fleet throughout the country. I know that most
people focus on the effects on coal-based generation but many of them will touch on gas-based generation going
forward, as well quite honestly when you think of the water requirements of the nuclear fleet.
We feel comfortable about where we are in the process of trying to put comments in not only on behalf of EEI but on
behalf of our company through the business roundtable and other places where AEP plays in that space. We are
encouraged by the comments of President Obama not only with his executive order before the State of the Union
speech but by comments he made there. We are somewhat heartened to see that Bill Daley coming in as Chief of Staff
may put a business balance on the activities that go forward in the regulatory arena, particularly at the EPA.
I think it's essential however; that everyone understands it has never been American Electric Power's desire nor anyone
else in the utility space to undo the Clean Air Act. What we've been asking for and what we've been seeking and what
we think we'll accomplish is in a reasonable timeline to go forward with continuing to improve the quality of air and
the production of electricity from a very important segment of the base load generation fleet in the United States. We
continue to feel, particularly at AEP, that we can manage our way through those challenges and come through 2011 and
beyond with a very solid base load generation fleet, obviously at very acceptable prices for our customers as we go.
Those activities will unfold; as one might expect there are court challenges as you know to many of these undertakings,
and again we will be in the middle of that dialog both regulatorily and ultimately in the courts if need be.

On the transmission front, we're convinced that the FERC continues to address the issues that are important to all of us
who intend to put capital to work in the transmission side of our business. As you know, at AEP we have relatively
aggressive plans in that space. We're very pleased with what we see at SPP. We're a little less than satisfied with the
overall progress in the PJM but we do believe that projects, particularly PATH, that we'll do a great deal for removing
some of the congestion and higher prices in the far eastern zones of the PJM are projects that need to be done and in
fact, will go forward and will be done.
We, like everyone else, watch for the order that will be issued in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the FERC.
We're expecting it to happen sometime in the first quarter. And we're encouraged by comments that we hear from
commissioners from time to time. We believe that everyone understands a more robust transmission grid can allow for
not only the inclusion of renewable power throughout the country but a balancing of the amount of base load
generation that might need to be added to the system.
Let me move on to the next couple of pages and talk a bit more granularly about our filing for the ESP. If you look at
page four, you'll see the large red boxes at the top and really they're directed at the overarching policy issues that we
were trying to touch. The first two, investment in Ohio, obviously and jobs in Ohio are very important to the
government and to the newly elected governor, a very aggressive approach toward creating a more robust economy in
Ohio and one that's going to demand ultimately that generation continue to be online and that additional generation be
built and brought online. As you know that's somewhat problematic in Ohio and it's an interesting challenge that we'll
all face. But we think that not only investment in the state and the jobs that that would create are things that the
Republican House and Senate and the Republican Governor will be strongly in favor of as we go.
The last box on the far right really is directed toward what we hear from our customers. I would be surely wrong if I
told you that our customers are happy at the cost of electricity. I am not sure they'd happy even if it were free, but the
fact of the matter is they are very, very concerned about energy security because they too see the U.S. economy and the
world economy improving and in that improvement they all know that they're going have to put more product into the
market. To do that they want to make sure that there's adequate and price sensitive energy available to them.
So when we look at the overall balance that we tried to put into the Electric Security Plan for the next 29 months,
beginning in 2012, it's really directed toward those issues: investment in Ohio, jobs in Ohio, and energy security for our
customers.
If you actually look at the bottom half of the slide, you will see again some of the approaches that were built in. And I
know that many of you will spend a great deal of your weekend digging through the ESP and coming to your own
conclusions. We have predicated the filing itself on the utilities being merged because by 2012 we believe that to be the
case. We, as you know, have made a merger filing in Ohio. It's not been contested by most or really hardly any noise
about that. So we'd expect that that will come to the fore without any difficulties.
We have also included what we think is a very appropriate rate redesign issue. Like so many states before there is what
we call in our vernacular rate skewing. One of the costs to serve customers is not always the cost that's allocated to the
customer class. Typically, residentials have been given some relief in that regard. Industrial's also given some relief in
that regard, and commercial customers paying more than the cost of service to serve them. We have tried to address
that issue particularly in the G rate and the rate designs that we put in place in ESP. We think that they very much
mirror what one might see in the marketplace and we think that that makes sense.
The 29-month window may seem odd because we did a 36 window before and people were thinking 24, 36. But we did
that for the purposes of syncing up with the May cycle for the PJM and we think again, that makes a tremendous
amount of sense.
Many of our large volume customers are interested in long-term commitments; and to provide them with an
opportunity to do that we have created the alternate long-term option. Customers who are willing to sign up for a
five-year window of supply from American Electric Power can receive for that commitment a discount to the rates that
are filed in the ESP and we expect that that will be a very usable tool for many of our price sensitive large volume
industrial customers.

And the next two boxes talk to the things that we talked about before: the Ohio Growth Fund is our dedicated money to
the activities that Governor Kasich has been very vocal about, which is to see to it that Ohio is open for business. We
want to join in the Governor's endeavor in that activity and do what we can to see to it that we bring new jobs to Ohio,
new economic activity to Ohio as well as expanded activity in our current customer base.
We obviously are in need of filing a distribution case. We've not had one since the 1990s and we made our notice of
that filing yesterday, that addresses itself to a $93 million overall rate increase in the distribution side of the rates that
we charge our customers. Like all rate activities, it will process through its normal cycle. It should be done by the end
of 2011 and effective in 2012. And it may be $93 million increase, it may be something different from that but it will
be a classic typical case.
If you look at page 5, it really is a summary of the many things that I've already spoken about. We think that the ESP
finds a reasonable balance between the approaches that we have to take. A very small increase in 2012 of 1.4%, an
aggregate increase in 2013 of 2.7%, that's in the G rate itself, the base rate of the ESP. We have a number of provisions
for riders to make adjustments to expenses incurred on behalf of the customers and of course, it does not include any of
the impact of whatever will come from the distribution rate case as we go forward. We have tried to cover every
activity that we can think of as the ESP would go forward during that 29-month period. And to that end, we believe that
plug-in electrics will play greatly in that period of time. We'll continue to work on our gridSMART activities in Ohio
where we've gotten great support from the commission. We're convinced that the economic development activities that
we're dedicating ourselves to will make sense to the jobs Ohio creation and now will be a stand-alone entity rather than
subset of the government here in Ohio.
We do have a POLR provision, it's a bit different from the one that we had in the approved three-year cycle that we're
in the midst of now. And, of course, we think it's only reasonable to recover cost of generating facilities that need to be
upgraded to comply with federal legislation as well as generating facilities that may well be retired because it doesn't
make sense to put that capital to work.
All-in- all, we think we've touched all of the bases that are required and obviously Brian and I look forward to whatever
questions you might have about the ESP filing and with that I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you Mike, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning we will review some detail on the quarterly
and annual financial numbers, take a look of load trends, review some 2011 earnings drivers and business initiatives
and then get on to your questions as quickly as possible as Mike said.
Turning to slide six you'll see that for ongoing earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010, the company earned $179 million
or $0.38 per share compared to $238 million or $0.50 per share for the same period in 2009. Highlights for the
quarter-on-quarter comparison include: the significantly excess earnings test or SEET refund at Columbus Southern
Power Company accounted for negative $0.06 per share or $43 million. This is the amount ordered for refund from
CSPC proceeding for the year 2009 by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
Non-utility earnings net accounted for negative $0.07 per share or $37 million and reflected the buyout of the fleet
lease and a contribution to the AEP foundation. Other utility operations net accounted for negative $0.18 per share or
$88 million and is primarily attributed to higher taxes and the absence of the accidental outage insurance from the Cook
Unit 1 turbine outage. The company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 was higher than the prior year
period.
Additional highlights comparing favorably to last year's fourth quarter include retail margins which improved $0.02 per
share or $18 million and were primarily associated with increased industrial usage. Weather accounted for positive
$0.04 per share or $26 million for the quarter and rate changes accounted for positive $0.07 per share or $51 million.
Operations and maintenance expense accounted for positive $0.08 per share or $63 million net of off-sets due primarily
to our cost savings initiatives instituted in 2010 and lower storm restoration expenses quarter-on-quarter.

Turning to slide seven, you will see that for ongoing earnings for the full-year of 2010, the company earned $1.451
billion or $3.03 per share compared to $1.362 billion or $2.97 per share in 2009. This represents a year-on-year gain in
ongoing earnings of $89 million or $0.06 per share. Highlights for the year-on-year comparison include non-utility
operations net, which was negative $0.05 per share or $19 million for the same reason cited for the quarterly
comparison, offset by some favorable tax adjustments in the third quarter of 2010. The SEET effect was the same for
the year as for the quarter and negative $0.06 per share or $43 million.
Firm wholesale margin was negative $0.10 per share or $74 million compared to the year prior and reflects the loss of
two wholesale customers. Share count effect was negative $0.14 per share reflecting weighted average shares
outstanding of 479 million in 2010 versus 459 million shares outstanding in 2009.
Other utility operations net accounted for negative $0.52 per share or $238 million and primarily reflects the absence of
the Cook accidental outage insurance, higher other taxes, higher depreciation and a higher effective tax rate.
Positive on annual ongoing comparisons to last year were retail margins, which accounted for $0.07 per share, or $48
million, reflecting economic recovery mostly in the industrial class, off-system sales net of sharing were up $0.08 per
share or $53 million versus 2009. Although margins on trading and marketing were down 28%, physical sales volumes
were up 30% and physical margins were up 80% versus 2009 as around the clock pricing at the AEP gen hub was up
13% on the year.
Operations and maintenance expenses were down in 2010 resulting in a positive variance of $0.14 per share or $97
million. This is a result of our cost-saving initiatives last year as well as lower storm expense. For ongoing earnings
weather was positive $0.32 per share or $229 million compared to 2009. The summer was hot and the winter was cold
and that can be a good thing for an electric utility. For the AEP system cooling-degree days were 58% above 2009 as it
was hot across the breadth of our system and heating-degree days were up 9% above 2009 levels and were up
throughout our system with the exception of Texas. Rate changes were positive $0.32 per share or $222 million net of
offsets.
Turning to slide 8, we will look at the quarterly and annual as well as forecasted weather normalized load trends. On
the top left hand panel of the slide, you'll see that residential normalized sales were relatively flat for the year, up 0.6%,
and for 2011 we're forecasting an increase of 1.9% year-on-year, eight tenths of which we expect to come from the
acquisition of the Valley Electric Membership Cooperative in our SWEPCO service territory. The top right hand panel
of the slide you'll see that commercialized, normalized sales were relatively flat but were down 0.3% for the quarter
and 0.4% for the year. We're forecasting a modest recovery of 0.7% in 2011. In the bottom left hand panel you will see
that industrial sales, which were the hardest hit customer class in 2009, had the strongest rebound in 2010.
For fourth quarter of 2010, industrial sales rebounded fully 7% versus 2009 and the annual recovery was in line with
our forecast of 5.3%. We will provide some additional color on the industrial recovery on the next slide. Next year
we're forecasting continued recovery in that area of 1.9%. In the bottom right hand side of the slide you'll see that total
normalized retail sales recovered 1.9% for the quarter and 1.1% for the year. Next year we're forecasting a recovery of
1.7%.
AEP's customer counts, another relative measure of our strength, remained steady throughout the year at about 5.2
million. Residential and commercial classes were up a small amount and were offset to some degree by modest
decreases in the industrial class. These trends held true across the breadth of the AEP system.
Turning to slide nine, you will see that some detail for the five sectors that comprised 60% of our industrial gigawatt
hour sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. You'll note that all five sectors marked quarterly in annual load increases led
by primary metals, which was up 15.5% on the quarter and 6.5% on the year. The recovery was widespread across our
industries and across our service territories. In fact, all of our top 10 industrial sectors notched positive load
improvements for the quarter and the year. Our largest customer, Ormet Aluminum of Hannibal, Ohio, has announced
plans to return to full load next month. AEPs largest operating unit, AEP Ohio, is proud that its economic development
contract with Ormet allowed it to continue operating through the economic downturn and AEP Ohio's competitive rates
for electricity are enabling Ormet's return to full load. This is good news not only for AEP and Ormet but for the people

and the economy of Eastern Ohio as well where Ormet's increased business has them putting over 100 people back to
work.
Now that we've discussed our 2010 results, let's turn to slide 10 and look at our 2011 outlook. As Mike mentioned, our
ongoing earnings guidance for 2011 is $3 to $3.20 per share. Key earnings drivers for 2011 are on the left-hand side of
the page. As noted on slide eight, we are forecasting a modest load recovery of 1.7%, representing an additional $0.10
per share over 2010. This recovery is anticipated to come from all customer classes with residential and industrial
improving 1.9% and the commercial class recovering 0.7%. Additionally, as Mike said, we anticipate an incremental
$0.32 per share from rate changes representing $235 million. Of the total needed, as Mike said, we already have
secured $162 million or 69%; an additional 17% is the subject of a currently filed rate adjustment and the remainder
will come through multiple jurisdictions across AEP System.
As a company, we continue our record of finding constructive rate outcomes in our 11 states and in front of the FERC.
As you all know, in 2010 we demonstrated particular focus on O&M and capital discipline. This will continue in 2011.
Our current O&M forecast for the year represents a $34 million decrease net of off-sets. This indicates that we are
seeing the benefits from our cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2010 and includes managers at the company
offsetting annual escalating items such as employee costs.
As we detailed in our Analyst Meeting in October, we anticipate customer switching at Ohio, primarily in the
commercial class at Columbus and Southern Power and we estimate this will result in incremental load loss in 2011 of
14% of Columbus and Southern's total load, representing $53 million year-on-year '10 to '11. To put this in perspective,
the forecasted loss of load represents only 6% of AEP Ohio's retail load and only 1.5% of total AEP system load.
And it's come to our attention that a PUCO website noted shopping levels at CSP of 12% at the end of September. This
data is not at all consistent with our numbers on switching percentages and we're currently working with Commission
staff to resolve the discrepancy. As a percentage of total CSP load the year-end number was much closer to our
forecasted switch rate of 3% and our forecast of an incremental 14% by year-end 2011 is still reasonable. We have both
competitive retail and regulatory responses to customer switching and will continue both throughout the year.
Also related to AEP Ohio is the 2010 Significantly Excessive Earnings Test, or SEET filing. Based on our analysis of
the 2009 results and the PUCO's methodology as outlined in the 2009 SEET order received this month, neither Ohio
company – Ohio Power Company or Columbus Southern – had significantly excess earnings in 2010 and we do not
believe a refund will be required for that year.
Lastly related to 2011 earnings, we anticipate a slight decline in off-system sales. While we expect physical volumes to
increase due to reduced planed and forced outages, prices remain flat to down relative to 2010. In this low priced
environment, trading and marketing margins will remain under pressure.
All that being said, we don't see anything on the horizon at this point to move off-system sales outside of the $250
million to $300 million range for 2011. Looking at the right hand side of the page and looking at other business
initiatives we're working on in 2011, we are pleased to report that we have three operating Transcos: one in Ohio,
Oklahoma and Michigan that are actively investing capital. We have the opportunity to invest over $150 million in our
Transcos in 2011 and the transmission team is working hard doing just that. Additional Transco filings will be made
during 2011 in other of our operating jurisdictions and we're expecting an order on the settlement that we filed with the
FERC regarding the Transco rates for PJM and SPP.
As was the case leading up to our Analyst Meeting in October, the topic of our system interconnection agreement
continues to be on investors' minds. Based on discussions that we had with regulators in Virginia, Indiana and other
jurisdictions, we're exploring alternatives to the agreement.
On January 4th of this year APCo made a filing with the Virginia SCC that among other things detailed the pool
members' intent to terminate the interconnection agreement. The pool members have in fact provided notice of
termination to one another. They now have a framework and a three-year timeline within which to engage stakeholders
in determining the future of these generation pool. The result of this process might be modified or a different type of
pool might be established. There might be bilateral contracts or other commercial arrangements from surplus to deficit

members or each member of the pool might operate independently. The general parameters of that discussion and the
outcome will be a reasonable solution for all jurisdictions and it must not harm AEP financially.
Remember that AEP took this action of its own volition because we believe that modifications to the pool will be
beneficial to the member companies, their customers, and AEP. In fact most of our jurisdictions like the aspects of a
power pool and don't want to rely exclusively on the market for capacity and/or energy needs. Bonus depreciation
resulted in $230 million favorable cash flow impact to the company in 2010. Some of this benefit was used to reduce
risk by funding our pension plan and to facilitate our cost reduction initiatives. For 2011 through 2013, we expect
bonus depreciation to provide approximately 1.2 billion in cash flow benefits based on our current capital spending
plan.
At this point in time we have not yet allocated the additional cash flow for specific uses but anticipate using the
incremental cash flow to reinvest in the growth opportunities in our businesses, reduce risk and improve our balance
sheet, which brings me logically to the closing topic: capital allocation and how we think about making capital
investments.
As we discussed at the October Analyst Day we will continue to place incremental capital to work where we have the
highest return opportunity and where we can most efficiently convert the capital invested into earnings. That's why we

can be earned most efficiently. Pension funding and other risk reducing strategies will be considered just as they were
in 2010. Thank you for your time today and with that I'll turn it back over to the operator and we will take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator's Instruction] And our first question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Hi, good morning guys.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Dan.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: I'm confident there'll be lots of ESP questions, I am just going to ask one on the topic but when
you guys evaluated the division between the ESP and MRO and then the 29-month time horizon, how did you guys
settle at 29 in ESP in the sense that a lot of the things you're going to have to do, whether it be spending, restructuring
the power pool a lot of these projects have a much longer time horizon. How do you guys get comfortable that this deal
will set the right precedent to protect your exposure given the fact the ESP has changed on such an active base in the
last couple of sessions?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well when we looked at that we just
thought that trying to sync up with the actual capacity undertakings of the PJM was probably an important point for us
to take and so we don't see that as to exposing ourselves to a great amount of risk in that sense, Dan.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay, so you're comfortable with the idea that whatever policy gets put in place with this ESP will
stand as far as riders and pool mechanism and that sort of thing?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, don't forget as Brian said in his
comments, the pool mechanism is a three-year look and a process to come to some reasoned resolution. And it will
ultimately fit into that activity. Going forward probably past that timeline, if in fact we don't get to some reasoned
conclusion with the multiple states as we go forward, the notice to ourself is withdrawable and we'll just simply use the
pool the way we've used it historically. So, we don't see the two creating any additional risk that we need to be worried
about.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay, on the cash flow outlook for 2011, Brian can you just a little commentary on the Enron
estate payment, the $450 million, was that already accounted for from a cash outlay perspective or is that going to be

cash that goes out the door this year and be impactful either to net debt or a use of some of your bonus depreciation
proceeds?
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: All of that Dan. That's something
that's been on our radar screen that we've been planning for. And whether the amounts' $425 million or $450 million,
it's something that from a cash standpoint we've been planning for and certainly the bonus deprecation helps us in that
regard in terms of being able to fund that without having to issue incremental debt. So both plan for and bonus
depreciation helps us as well.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay and one last question, Mike can you just share your thoughts in kind of the industrial
recovery? The outlook you guys have for 2011 certainly off-trend from what we saw in 2010. Are your customers
seeing a kind of a constant fade in business? We're hearing for other folks looking for a second half recovery or what
gives you guys confidence in a notably lower growth rate in '11?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well when we look at that as you
know when we do our load forecasting we are usually very conservative in that regard because that's the whole
predicate of how we manage the ongoing business coming into a year. We don't get any signal from our customers that
they think there is a lull in the activity that they are seeing but we didn't want to build a really robust industrial increase
beyond what we saw in 2010, which as you know, was pretty substantial.
So when we look particularly at the metal melters and the LME prices we think not only is Ormet going to be robust for
the year but that essentially aluminum can solve some of their labor issues going forward, they will come back as well.
So we should see some uptick in that and that probably would be in the latter half of the year. But we feel pretty
comfortable about the increase that we've built in to the overall forecast of what we think industrial sales will be. If it's
upside obviously we'll gladly accept that Dan.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay great. Thank you, guys.

We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning guys, how are you?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good, good, thanks.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Couple of quick things, just the other income and deductions, it looks like you guys are now
forecasting something somewhat better than maybe at the EI. And I just want to try and get a sense as to what was
going on there, for 2011 that is?
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I don't have a lot of detail for
you on that. It's – the change on year-on-year is going from something like $154 million to $211 million and I don't
recall what we'd had there.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: It's about a $24 million – it's all right we could follow up later, I was just wondering if you guys
had an answer on that, just -
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We'll get the detail for you.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: No problem. The other thing is that the power pool change, how should we think about that in
terms of allocation of expenses among jurisdictions and any ideas about how it might change cost allocations or
something of the sort?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's exactly the way that we
see it, it's – at the end of the day to the point Brian made and I made earlier on, our approach here is to try to be
respectful of the request that was made of us by the Virginia Commission, something that we were contemplating doing
but it is in fact the reallocation of cost across the fleet and hopefully a zero-sum game. If we see that to be different
from that then we wouldn't go forward with the undertaking; we'd have the pool continue to work.
But you know, Paul, this was something that was created in the '50s and many of our jurisdictions would rather have a
direct line of sight to the generating capacity that they need for their own state needs and the growth that they see rather
than depending on the pool and the way that the pool works. Because as you know it can really flip around the amount
of cost that one state might pay versus other states based on the number load ratio calculations that are affected by
incredibly warm weather in one particular region within the pool versus cooler weather in another region. So we just
think it's time to make that adjustment.
However, I want to make certain because I know a lot of people have written about this that if this tends toward the
negative in that the states all believe that there's something more beneficial that they ought to get out of that changing
of the pool arrangement, we simply won't go forward with it. So no filings had been made in any jurisdiction that
would cause us to be concerned about that. This is an internal notice to the members of the pool that we may be moving
in a different direction.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, in terms of shopping, what do you think has caused the discrepancy between you and
PUCO in terms of the, it seems like a pretty substantial difference in shopping calculation. And just in general how
should we think about shopping exposure going forward, the ESP filing, and just maybe just in the whole context of a
new legislature, a new governor, is there any thought about revisiting SB 221 or I mean not just you; obviously we're
seeing some substantial – I mean actually more sort of substantial kind of activity with Duke and what they're dealing
with. I'm just wondering if there is any thought about perhaps going back to the state legislature to sort of maybe clarify
some of the stuff or, I don't know it just seems like it might be a big, long regulatory process?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So there are two parts to your
question, I'll have Brian address the first one and then I'll pick up on the latter part.
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Paul, we think there is an
apples-to-apples issue in regard to what numbers were reported on the PUCO website. We know what the numbers that
we reported are. And they, the PUCO staff took numbers from a number of different suppliers and the integrity of the
numbers and the periodicity of the numbers that were submitted to them are in question. So it's going back and trying to
make sure that the comparison of what's been shopped to what our base load denominator was are apples-to-apples
comparisons. And we don't think that's the case in the numbers that are on the website.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So on the second half of your
question as you know we're concerned about shopping in the marketplace. It really has everything to do with mostly
our commercial customer class that as I mentioned before has some rate skewing effect. We think that today the
competitive retail electric suppliers are getting a free ride on the capacity cost. We made a filing at the FERC to address
that. As you know, the FERC last week decided that they could not make a change because Ohio had in fact toward the
latter part of December created their own price forecast for the capacity charge. We think that that probably was
inadvertently low. We've addressed that issue both in the ESP and we will go forward and petition the FERC for
rehearing. And in fact they invited us to file a complaint if we thought that the PUCO's number was too low and we'll
do that as well. And we'll do that with respect toward the Commission. This is not a fight, this is just an approach.
But again going back to the numbers that Brian shared with you, this is 2800 gigawatt hours out of an output at
American Electric Power just south of 200,000 gigawatt hours a year. So, I don't want to minimize it because it's
important to us and as you know we've created AEP retail, they're having some great success in retaining as well as
gaining customer share in the other regions within Ohio and we'll continue to take that approach.

As I said, we've made a number of filings and a number of approaches both at FERC and throughout the ESP that we
think will address the rates skewing and put some fairness in the capacity charge that competitive retail suppliers need
to pay. And then with all of that in mind, trying retackle 221 with a new legislature and the new governor, it may or
may not be an appropriate way to go. I do think however in the near and longer term, Ohio is going to have to come to
the realization that generation will not be built in the state under the current construct.
And at the end of the day, Ohio, within maybe 24 months, will be a net importer of electricity and I know that our
operating companies in Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia would be happy to sell power into a
power short Ohio. I really don't think that that's in our best interest for the citizens and the businesses here in Ohio. And
I expect that the administration and the legislation will come around that realization soon enough. When you think
about the potential number of megawatt hours that could be taken off of the board because of the potential of EPA
going amok, it could have a very devastating effect on the price of power, particularly here in Ohio. So I expect that
that will get addressed, I don't know that going after a shopping fix is worth trying to tackle 221 again.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet.
Operator
We have a question from Bill Appicelli with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Bill.
<Q - William Appicelli>: Hi, good morning. Just had a question about the pool modification charge. How should we
look at this, the $35 million kind of threshold that you put in there for recovery potential cost increases that exceed that
number? Is that significant in terms of where the – if it's economic neutral in terms of the impact overall or how should
we think about that?
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Bill, it's not significant. It's a
placeholder that's in there to allow the company to absorb any downside before we start asking our customers to
participate in that. And it's like a number of these riders where we put them in, there's nothing anticipated to flow into
that at this point but we felt it was prudent while we were going in for this ESP filing to have a placeholder in there
should there be costs that need to be passed through, and felt it was prudent for the company to absorb some component
of that first before we asked our customers to participate.
<Q - William Appicelli>: Okay, thank you. And then on the shopping issue between what you expect to have realized
in 2010 and then your forecast of 14% in 2011, how much load would that leave at the C&I level that would have not
been shopped or what would the incremental exposure be I guess at year-end '11 based on your forecast?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, as Brian shared with you, it's
an overall 6% of the AEP Ohio load. So, it covers most of the class, but again if in fact the rate design activities that are
filed in the ESP when we get to 2012, I think you'll see a real drop-off in the number of shopping customers. They'll
still be there and still have the freedom to do that, but their economic advantage will be to stay on the AEP system as a
retail customer.
<Q - William Appicelli>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah, hi guys. Couple of questions, when Duke talks about shopping they have like a gross
shopping and a net, recorded net being kind of net of one customer that they take back on their retail side. Are your –
the 3% and going to 17%, is that gross or net?
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's gross on the utility side.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then also I assume you weren't expecting to get this capacity charge done in your
forecast for '11 on shopping, in terms of the one that you filed at FERC?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We did not build anything into our
numbers for '11 for that, that's accurate.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay, great. And then, I guess one other question just on that issue, I'm trying to understand
why the fact that they would want to use the PJM actual capacity charges which I think all the other utilities in Ohio are
using. Why that would not be reasonable for you?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, remember, we chose to go on
the cost of service calculation of capacity because of the generation fleet that we have available to us. And that served
our customers well in the past and we think it will serve our shareholders as well as our customers in the future. The
PJM number is just simply inappropriately low and it continues to go that way and look at the reaction that New Jersey
had to that activity. And I think you'll see other states go forward and do that. When you look in some of those out
years and that number gets down to $16, $17 a megawatt day that – you couldn't, there's not a power plant that you
could build or use anywhere in the world that has that kind of a cost structure. So, it just is totally illogical, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And just on the issue of Ohio being short potentially in a few years, is it – it seems like
west of you, there's a lot of excess, particularly in NI Hub market, seems like there's even more capacity coming in
there. Is that – that power can't get into Ohio?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I didn't mean to imply that Ohio
would be short and not available in the marketplace. What I meant to say and really the place that the administration
and the legislature will see is that if Ohio is in fact capacity short and you get down to the price – so let's just argue that
the rates go to $70 a megawatt hour because of a inability of base low generation to satisfy that. Adequate power will
flow into the marketplace but it won't flow in at $40 or $50, it will flow in at $60 or $65. And it just doesn't serve a
state like Ohio who is very aggressive in the economic development.
You'll remember the comments of Governor Daniels when he made it quite clean that Indiana never intended to be a
net importer of electricity; it needed – intended to be self sufficient and an exporter. And I think Ohio feels the same
way about its ability to attract new industrial load in particular.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, sure.

We have a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Yeah, Mike, what do you expect in the ESP filing to be the biggest areas of pushback or the
biggest topics that could become contentious from both interveners and staff at the PUC?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I expect that there will be some
pretty open discussion about the approach that we're taking to recovery of the current fuel and the deferred fuel but that
really is in keeping with orders that were issued in the existing ESP. I also expect that there will be a pretty good
comparison, Michael, of how is this ESP in aggregate better for the customers than an MRO approach. And from our

vantage point particularly again putting some reasonable capacity cost charges, we feel that we'll pass the MRO test.
So there will be some issue over the riders and the approaches that we've taken. There will be some issue over the
bypassable or non-bypassable features for two or three of the riders that we've put in. And we think those will all have
an opportunity to be thoroughly discussed. And obviously from our vantage point we think what we've done here is a
very balanced approach in that regard trying to do as I said at the very outset address the issue of adequate energy
supply for my customers as well as adequate energy supply to grow the resource base and continue to make
investments in Ohio.
The law itself is pretty clear about non-bypassability of environmental investments. It's pretty clear about
non-bypassability of new generation if you need to bring it for the basic requirements to feed the State of Ohio. So,
there'll be discussions about that. I am sure there will others who think that's totally unfair. But that's why the ESP was
created that the way it is. It encourages utilities like ours and others to file for that activity to build into it the subsets
that are necessary to have a meaningful opportunity not only for our customers to receive adequate energy at reasonable
prices but for our investors to be encouraged to continue to make capital investments in Ohio. Should we not get those
kinds of activities the clear message will be invest zero in Ohio going forward and put that capital to work in those
jurisdictions and as you know without the breadth of our footprint many places to put money to work at very reasonable
rates of return on equity.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Follow up different topic: at the FERC, do you think we're starting to see a little bit of mean
reversion from the FERC in terms of transmission policy? I mean if you look at some of the orders that have come out
whether it was the OT&E order, whether it was the PSE&G order where maybe CWIP wasn't fully granted or projects
weren't fully given 100% incentive rate making? Is it possible we're starting to see a little bit of a turn at the FERC right
now?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that's a fair way to look at it.
That's an exchange I'd make in a minute for cost allocation being appropriate and ultimately with the imminent domain
authority that's needed to build out that grid. One of the things that Chairman Wellinghoff has said and has said it very
clearly as have Commissioner Norris and others, there is fairness in some of the incentives to go forward but in return
you need to put new technology to work on the grid, you need to do a number of things that are really cost effective in
the near and long-term. So, it's an encouragement to be creative in that regard.
The returns on equity that our projects have received have almost always been predicated on the incredible intellectual
capacity of American Electric Power to make the grid better, to make it more efficient. When you add new – as you
heard me say many times if you look at the line loss calculations of our six-bundle 765 conductoring on our most recent
transmission add, it's less than 1% compared to a system average across the United States of 3 or 4%. So we believe we
earn those returns but I do think there is a reversion to the mean. But it isn't a big deal.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Mike.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You bet, Michael.

Your next question comes from Raymond Leung with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Hey, guys most of my question have been asked – or answered about the Ohio but could we
talk a little bit about financing plans, it looks like you guys show a net debt issuance number of $234 million, could you
provide a little more color on what the gross number is and what potential boxes that may need to issue. And if you
could also remind me what your strategy is with the April bank line maturity later this year?
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Raymond. As you know we'd
just been out recently with the PSO redemption that we just had. We have a few more senior notes that we need to do
as we go through the year. APCo, being a piece of that, that we anticipate doing later. We have a number of PCRBs to

do – a total of about over the course of the year, a little over $1 billion in total financing between the senior secured at
PSO and APCo and PCRBs that we're going to be issuing throughout the year. In terms of the bank facility are you
talking about the credit facility?
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Yes, there is a April, 2011 like $478 million or something like that that comes due.
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Right. So we're taking a hard look at
that and instead of reissuing that facility, we're looking at whether or not we do a club facility for that or whether or not
we do some bilaterals. And in fact we may not reissue all of that. A piece of that is associated with Ohio Power
Company, which is cash fat right now and we might just redeem that piece and bring it in. At the same time, we're
looking for the other pieces of that, which are APCo and I&M, how we might finance that. Right now it might not
make sense for us to do a facility like we have with the VRDN support for the LCs and really doing that as a bilateral
or club deal might make a lot more sense for us.
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Okay. And you didn't mention any parent issuances, with bonus depreciation does that sort a
change? I guess the last time I met with you guys, you indicated that you might issue debt at the parent again, does that
look like that's off the table now?
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, with the bonus depreciation,
that's much less likely.
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Okay. And last question, I don't think there's any big issues but the combination of Ohio
Power and Columbus Southern, any covenant issues, I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything, I don't think there
is anything with merging those two entities.

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Ali.
<A - Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Mike, the filing that you made in Ohio, could you give us some review of how much discussion was
going on with the staff, et cetera at the commission, all the different pieces. I mean there are lot of components to it.
Some of it, would that be considered a complete surprise for the commission and the staff or is this well expected? Can
you give us some sense of how much they were anticipating that this was coming?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we took a very aggressive
approach to this filing, Ali, because it obviously is very important for the next 29 months. We have met with our
industrial customers, with the – the folks at the Office of Consumer Counsel weren't too eager to meet but they were at
least made aware of the approaches that we intended to take. We had some very constructive meetings with
commission staff and the commissioners themselves although as you can well imagining they were very protective of
what they saw and what they heard. Our read on the body language, however, would tell you that there are no surprises
in this filing that they weren't well aware of.
Our industrial customers made some constructive comments. We tried to take those issues into concern as we went
forward. And again, I think we found a reasonable balance here. That's not to say that there won't be lot of lawyering

going on because as you know, you need to run that clock to get paid. So, there will be a lot of activity with the case
but it really is pretty fair, pretty balanced and we believe very firmly that it will come out at a reasonable place when
we're done.

predicated on a successful outcome of this filing?

over 2012 number as you know with the economy continuing to recover. We've been talking about a 4% to 6%
earnings range and off of the midpoint of our '11 number that's almost a 5% increase going to '12. And we feel that
that's very achievable. Quite honestly, we didn't build a great deal of upside from an ESP treatment into that number.
So, we think we've got plenty of room to be successful with that forecast when we look at 2012.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question, Mike, on a different topic, your read today on the post-election scenario
regarding the environmental legislation and potentially what sensitivity that has for your CapEx ramp? You laid out a
'12 CapEx number as well but just looking beyond that as these things are coming down the pike, what kind of
escalation should we be thinking of that $2.9 billion '12 CapEx for you guys?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So when we look at our going
forward strategy it will be a blend, depending on which way the EPA goes and quite honestly through the business
roundtable, AES and the EEI as well as our own activities, we think that this administration is taking a great deal of
note of the impact that this could have on a struggling economy yet. So we think that many of these requirements might
well be stretched out into a timeline that will fit our capital needs and our capital plans very comfortably.
I doubt that you'll see us get much above the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of capital investment in the '13, '14, '15 timeline
because quite honestly we just don't think there will be an absolute demand requirement to move in that direction
because of the potential effect it could have on the economy. And as you know, particularly for our fleet we've invested
a great deal of money historically and we think we can address many of the mercury needs and other requirements so
long as they are reasonable with the beneficial effect of SCRs and FGDs going forward.
So we don't see a scenario where we'll have any massive capital uptick going forward because again many of our, much
of our strategy that Nick and the team have shared with all of you go to the notion of retiring units rather than putting
capital work where it absolutely isn't necessary nor would it be to the customer's advantage. That's really one of the
reasons that we've begun the process of bringing the combined-cycle gas plant called Dresden online. We began
finishing the construction of that project about two weeks ago and plan to have that up and running about 2012.
So we feel as though we've got a very solid balanced plan toward that and we don't see any long-term, near-term capital
impact that would put Chuck and Brian in a box.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Nice job. Thank you.

And we'll take our final question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Good morning, Mike. Mike, you kind of alluded that you still see a train wreck but maybe it could
happen a little bit slower motion. Is that your latest thinking?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that's accurate.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: And kind of over what timeframe have you kind of come to that conclusion?

<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So, over the last probably before –
this was before the election. We were beginning to have some meaningful discussions with the EPA, we, the EI and of
course AEP being a principal part of that as well as legislators on both sides of the aisle in both the House and the
Senate. And we were getting the impression that with the economy beginning to show signs of life, no one was
interested in negative effects to that. Because of the role that we play at the business roundtable, we've also alerted
many of our larger customers of the effect – those we have the boiler impacts understand it but many of our other
customers aren't that aware of the effect that this could have on them. And I think corporate America has made it pretty
clear. So, over the last three or four months, we've become more and more determined that spreading that thing out
with a decade of commitment to it will make a big difference.
And then I must tell you, Paul, that Cancun I think was a game changer because people walked out of Cancun with the
final belief that China and India, although moving in the right direction had zero intention of going forward with any
major carbon play. Much of the EPA's organization, or direction is toward more traditional Clean Air Act events. And
as you know in every decade since the '60s their quality has continued to improve and that will happen here in the
2010s and that will happen through 2020s.
We've got a lot of time to adjust to these issues and that balanced reason going forward on that timeline gives us
comfort that the capital deployment will be well in line with our needs and our plans as I mentioned in the question that
Ali has asked us. So I would say over the last three or four months we're feeling much more comfortable that this will
be done in a very reasonable way.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: And just switching gears, when do you think we're going to see the composition of the Ohio
commissions stabilized?
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there is on February 3, there is
about 14 or 15 names that the nominating committee will discuss and they'll submit a list of three to four names to the
governor's office and he will make his selections. Whether he selects two people at that time or one and that person
being designated as chair is unknowable, and if they select one then the nominating group will get together and get
another list of resumes, winnow them down and make another recommendation to the governor.
So, I would expect sometime in the first quarter we'll have a full complement of five appointed commissioners with
terms that are understood and there'll be a learning curve, no question. But it is what it is. With the 11 jurisdictions and
commissioners and chairs changing frequently, it's something that we're very familiar with and something that we'll
react very constructively to.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Thank you very much.
<A - Michael G. Morris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, you bet.
