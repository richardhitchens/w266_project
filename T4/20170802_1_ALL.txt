MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Allstate Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions
will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go

Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release or
our investor supplement. We are recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And as
always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.
Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas Joseph Wilson
Well, good morning. Thank you, as always, for taking your time and investing with us and to understand the progress
we're making at Allstate.
So, let's begin on slide 2. Allstate delivered strong financial results in the second quarter. Net income was $550 million,
or $1.49 per share, in the second quarter of 2017 and that's in comparison to $242 million last year. Really reflects
improved auto insurance margins and strong investment results from our performance-based strategy.
Operating income per share was $1.38 in the quarter. The improvement in auto insurance profitability is the result of us
rapidly reacting to higher loss costs beginning in 2015, and it was aided by declining frequency in the first half of 2017.
Investment income on our $81 billion portfolio also increased from the prior year, as stable earnings from the quarter –
market-based fixed income portfolio was supplemented with higher results from the performance-based portfolio.
Operating income return-on-equity was 13.5%, as you can see at the bottom of the table, a significant improvement
over last year.
Let's go to slide 3, which shows our operating priorities for 2017. We made excellent progress on the five operating
priorities, but not all of this has yet impacted the reported financial results. The first goal is to better serve customers,
and we measure customer satisfaction by a Net Promoter Score and an increase from most of our businesses, although,
this has not yet led to higher policy retention. We do expect higher customer satisfaction to translate into higher
growth, particularly as insurance auto price increases moderate.
Allstate manages shareholder capital to deliver attractive returns, which requires us to achieve target economic returns
on capital. As you can see from our results, we are excelling in this priority. Auto insurance margins have improved,
reflecting a broad-based profit improvement plans initiated over two years ago. Profitability also benefited from lower
frequency of accidents, reflecting both our profit improvement plan and overall flattening in the market.
The recorded auto insurance combined ratio for all brands was 96.6 for the quarter and 95.8 for the Allstate brand. Auto
insurance combined ratios for the first six months of the year was 94.1, or 6.5 points below the prior year. The
difference was the primary driver – the primary driver of the difference was an increase and that led to over $700
million in underwriting profit difference between these first two quarters and the first two quarters of last year.
Now, homeowners insurance line was also profitable in the quarter, led by Allstate brand, which had a combined ratio
of 97.2, despite $650 million of catastrophe losses. The property-liability recorded combined ratio was 97.2 and the
underlying combined ratio was 85.5 in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, our underlying combined
ratio was 85.1. Assuming current loss trends continue, we expect to end 2017 at or below the low-end of our annual
outlook range of 87.89.
Allstate Financial operating income increased to $153 million, as the strategy to increase performance-based
investments to the annuity business generated good results. Long-term value creation also requires growth in the
customer base. The acquisition of SquareTrade in January has added over 31 million policies, and Steve will cover our
key priorities for SquareTrade in a few minutes. Allstate Benefits continues its 17-year track record of growth in
policies in force exceed 4 million. The Allstate brand is now accelerating the trusted advisor initiative to raise growth
by delivering a better value proposition to the local advice and branded product customer segments.
A large component of operating income is results from investment income, so, despite the continuation of historically
low interest rates, we've done quite well there, as well. The portfolio is proactively managed and is primarily a
high-quality fixed income portfolio, which generates predictable earnings with modest risk. The value of the

market-based portfolios increased this quarter due to a reduction in corporate bond yields and higher equity values. The
performance-based portfolio had a great quarter with strong growth in private equity and real estate earnings.
We focus on delivering current results, while investing for long-term growth. In addition to the trusted advisor
initiative, we have growth plans for Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade, Allstate Roadside, and Esurance. We're also
investing in building a connected-car platform at Arity, which has continued to enhance its capabilities in telematics,
data, analytics, and customer service.
Slide 4 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. As you can see from the box at the top,
we've delivered excellent returns, increased book value, maintained a conservative financial position, while increasing
shareholders' ownership in the company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. We returned $903 million to
shareholders through the first six months of the year. This includes repurchasing 7.9 million shares of our common
stock, or 2.1% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year.
Yesterday, we authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will begin following the completion of our
current $1.5 billion program. Our intention is to fund this new program through a combination of deployable capital,
operating cash flow, and a potential issuance of preferred shares.
Now, let me turn it back to John.
John Griek
Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows property-liability results by customer segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top,
net written premium was $8.3 billion, which was a 3% increase from the prior year, and the recorded combined ratio of
97.2, was 3.6 points better than the prior-year quarter. When we exclude catastrophes and prior-year reserve
re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the second quarter was 85.5, 3.1 points better than the prior-year
quarter.
The underlying combined ratio for the second quarter includes 0.6 points, or $52 million, of restructuring expenses,
primarily related to the expansion of QuickFoto Claim, our virtual estimating platform. This expansion resulted in
improved efficiencies and a closure of a number of claim drive-in offices.
As you know, our strategy is to provide different customer value propositions for the four consumer segments of the
property-liability market. The Allstate brand, in the lower-left, competes with the local advice and branded segment,
where the most prominent competitors are State Farm, Nationwide, and Farmers. Obviously, GEICO and Progressive
target these customers, as well, but do not offer the same value proposition provided by our 10,400 Allstate agencies.
This segment comprises 90% of our total premiums written. The underlying combined ratio is 84.4, with a favorable
prior-year comparison being driven by improving loss trends in auto insurance, which had a 92.8 underlying combined
ratio, five points below the prior year. Net written premium was 2.3% higher in the second quarter of 2017, compared
to the prior-year quarter, due to a 3.3% increase in auto.
Esurance, in the lower-right, serves customers who prefer a branded product, but are comfortable handling their own
insurance needs. GEICO and Progressive Direct have a larger share of this segment than their overall market share. We
continue to focus on improving the auto loss ratio, raising customer satisfaction, and rapidly growing homeowners
policies in force. The combination of these initiatives will support long-term growth.
The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improved slightly and was below 100 for the second consecutive
quarter. The homeowners business continues to grow rapidly with underlying profitability that reflects start-up costs.
The underlying combined ratio of 125 in the second quarter of 2017 was significantly better than the prior-year quarter,
as homeowners marketing spend was reduced.
Encompass, in the upper-left, competes for customers who want local advice, are less concerned about a branded
experience, and are served by independent agencies. We are making good progress in improving underlying margins,
but the business has gotten smaller as we exit unprofitable markets and raise prices. As we achieve rate adequacy, we

will initiate growth plans on a targeted basis in this segment.
Let's go to slide 6 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto insurance in more details. Starting with the top-left graph,
the recorded combined ratio for the second quarter was 95.8, which was 5.4 points below the prior-year quarter and
benefited from increased average earned premium, lower frequency, and favorable prior-year reserve re-estimates,
primarily related to injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 92.8 in the second quarter of 2017 improved by
5 points, compared to the second quarter of 2016, driven by a 5.7 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio.
The chart on the top-right shows the results of the broad-based profit improvement plan initiated in 2015. Annualized
average premium, shown by the blue line, increased 5.6% to $999 compared to the prior year, while underlying loss
and expense, shown by the red line, was nearly flat. This resulted in a favorable gap of $72 per policy, compared to the
mid-teens in the second quarter of 2015. While we continue to selectively file rate increases to keep pace with loss
trends, the overall magnitude of rates taken will moderate if the gap between the red and blue line is maintained.
Gross frequency trends for bodily injury and property damage coverages are shown on the bottom chart. Frequency
continued to show improvement across both coverages in the second quarter of 2017 and favorable trends were
geographically widespread. The lower frequency in 2017 reflects good weather in the first quarter, the benefits of the
auto insurance profit improvement plan, and moderating frequency trends across the industry.
Slide 7 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate branded auto insurance. As you can see from the
graph at the top, overall policy counts have flattened out on a sequential quarter basis. This reflects an increase in
new-issued applications and a steady renewal ratio. We are beginning to accelerate the components of the trusted
advisor initiative, while expanding Allstate branded distribution with the objective of increasing policies in force. This
should be supported by fewer required price increases now that auto margins have improved.
Slide 8 shows similar information for Allstate branded homeowners, which has had consistent profitability and is also
being positioned for growth.
Now, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, John. Let's go to slide 9 and our investment results. Overall investment results have been strong this year,
reflecting favorable market conditions and the asset allocation decision to increase performance-based investments,
which reflects a 10-year history of increasing commitments and building our capabilities. Today, we utilize third-party
managers, co-investments, create bistro partnerships, and our own direct investing, and have created a broad portfolio
of diversified investments.
Total return, in the upper-left graph, was 1.8% for the quarter, as our strategic positioning, coupled with favorable
market conditions, drove strong results across our diversified portfolio. Investment income, shown in the blue, has
consistently contributed approximately 1% of return per quarter, with stable earnings from our market-based portfolio
of primarily investment-grade fixed income investments. Total return varies, based on the portfolio of value at the end
of each quarter, as reflected by the valuation component shown in gray.
As you can see, the value of the portfolio increased in the second quarter, primarily due to lower corporate bond yields
and higher equity prices. The property-liability bond portfolio, which totals $32 billion, is concentrated in three to
five-year maturities. If interest rates rise, bond valuations will be negatively impacted; however, net investment income
will increase over time.
Net investment income in total and for the market-based and performance-based portfolios is shown in the upper-right
graph. Net investment income for the second quarter was $897 million, $135 million higher than the second quarter of
2016. This increase was driven primarily by performance-based investments income of $263 million. While
performance-based income is variable from quarter-to-quarter, long-term returns for Allstate have been attractive, as
shown by the bottom two graphs.

The quarterly impact of performance-based net income has averaged $155 million over the last 10 quarters, and is
largely driven by private equity and real-estate investments. The table beneath the chart on the bottom-left shows the
increase in carrying value of performance-based portfolio over time. The performance-based portfolio has generated
attractive long-term economic returns, as shown in the bottom-right. Internal rates of return are generally over 10%.
The recent downturn in the 10-year measure reflects high valuations just prior to the global financial crisis of 2008 and
2009.
Turning to slide 10, Allstate Financial had a substantial increase in profitability as a result of the performance-based
investment results. Premiums and contract charges totaled $591 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.8%
compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating income of $153 million increased by 27.5% over the prior-year quarter.
Life insurance net income of $60 million and operating income of $63 million were both $1 million below prior year,
as higher contract benefits and expenses were partially offset by higher premium and net investment income.
Allstate Benefits net and operating income, were both $25 million in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income, $4
million below the prior-year quarter, as higher revenue was more than offset by increased contract benefits and
investments in growth. Premiums and contract charges increased 7.2% compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily
related to growth in hospital indemnity, critical illness, short-term disability, and accident products.
Annuities operating income of $65 million in the quarter was an increase of $38 million, compared to the prior year,
reflecting the continued benefit of our performance-based investment strategy. You will remember, we increased the
amount of performance-based assets in this business to match the long-duration of liabilities. This should generate
increased shareholder value, but does require us to utilize more capital in the business and lowers interest income, both
of which depress short-term returns on capital.
Slide 11 provides detail on SquareTrade. Last quarter, we indicated additional disclosure would be provided regarding
this recently acquired business. SquareTrade has three primary objectives; first, to increase and broaden Allstate's
customer relationships. This will be accomplished through the existing model of selling through store-based and online
retailers, leveraging Allstate's other market-facing businesses and entering new markets, either from a product or
geographic perspective.
Second, SquareTrade has grown rapidly by utilizing innovative customer service approaches to re-invent a traditional
product offering, and it will continue to utilize this capability to enhance its competitive position. Third, as all of our
businesses seek to do, SquareTrade will also earn attractive returns on capital. We evaluate this by looking at long-term
cash flows. For high growth businesses, such as SquareTrade, we use shorter-term measures, such as operating profit,
to ensure we are on pace to meet our long-term objectives, but are willing to continue investing in growth, even if it
reduces near-term profitability.
Moving to second quarter results as shown on the bottom-half of the page. SquareTrade had solid growth, primarliy
through the U.S. retail channel with policies in force increasing by 1.4 million from the first quarter, to a total of 31.3
million, as shown on the graph in the bottom-left. Over the last 12 months, policies in force have grown by 28%.
Premiums written in the second quarter of $85 million, reflects a magnitude of product sales, while earned premium of
$70 million reflects the recognition of that premium over the approximate three-year average duration of coverage.
Underwriting loss totaled $22 million in the second quarter, reflecting $23 million of amortization of purchased
intangible assets related to the acquisition. Operating income, which excludes the amortization of purchased intangible
assets, was positive in the second quarter, totaling $1 million.
We also included a new non-GAAP measure this quarter, adjusted operating income, to provide a run-rate view of the
business. This factor excludes purchase accounting adjustments made to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at
their fair value. During the second quarter, we executed a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with our largest
third-party insurer. As a result, we reduced the premium paid to that third-party insurer, which will increase
underwriting income.
Additionally, Allstate assumed approximately $200 million in funds held in trust for potential future claim payments.
Investment income on these funds will be earned by SquareTrade. In conjunction with this agreement, claims and

claims expense benefited by a $6 million pre-tax favorable adjustment for the loss experience.
Slide 12 provides an overview of a new reporting structure, will expand our financial reporting segments from four to
seven. We plan to adopt the new reporting structure in the fourth quarter. This structure will provide enhanced
transparency and allow for an evaluation of our businesses grouped by like attributes. Allstate Protection will continue
to include the traditional property-liability businesses that address the four segments of the consumer property-liability
market: Allstate, Esurance, Encompass, and Answer Financial. A new service business segment will include operations
that have a larger portion of earnings from services, or generally have less underwriting risk. This is likely to include
SquareTrade, Arity, Allstate Roadside, Allstate Dealer Services. Allstate Financial will be split into three segments. As
you know, we have substantially reduced the breadth and size of Allstate Financial over the last decade.
Allstate Life sells life insurance to Allstate agencies in support of the trusted advisor strategy to broaden customer
relationships. This business earns a low-double-digit return. Allstate Benefits is a high-growth and mid-to-high-teens
return business. So, breaking its results out will highlight its value creation. Allstate Financial does not sell proprietary
annuities, given our view on economic returns. So, the Annuities is really a closed box of business. Returns are low, in
part, reflecting current low interest rates. In addition, as we discussed, the decision to maximize shareholder value by
increasing allocation to performance-based investments has had additional negative impact on near-term return on
capital. This new segmentation will have an impact on goodwill impairment testing and the aggregation of Allstate
Financial reserves for sufficiency testing. More information is available in the Form 10-Q and we will provide
additional details later this year.
Now, I'll ask Jonathan, to open the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your
question, please?
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Good morning. Thanks for the call. I just wanted to circle back. I've asked this of you
before, but now that you've had two quarters in a row where your underlying combined ratio is certainly trending better
than expected. I'm curious about your view of competitive positioning in the marketplace, especially when – I think
we've seen some anecdotal stories or situations where some of your peers have started to cut some pricing?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Greg, this is Tom. I'll start, and then Matt can jump in. First, we do think we were out
early and taking the price increases, that were necessary in auto insurance. And that has put us in a position to not have
– assuming these trends continue, we don't think we'll have to raise prices as much, which obviously helps, because
price is a large component of that, which we compete on. It's not the only thing we compete on, however, so, there's a
wide variety of ways in which we compete with other people.
The other part is, it largely depends what other companies do, and it's hard for – it's impossible for us to predict what
they'll do. So, some of the large mutuals, which have significant underwriting losses, may choose to stay there, and
then it will have – there really won't be any competitive window for us to grab more share from those specific
competitors. Some of our other competitors choose to subsidize, various states run losses there by having lower prices –
or higher margins than other states.
So, I would say we prefer to be on this end of the equation, having improved our profitability so we're in a balanced
position to grow. But I don't think you can automatically assume that because other people didn't follow us – or that
they will follow us, or that this is sort of open-to-buy and it's easy to take business away. Matt, you may have some
more specific comments.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. Thanks, Greg. It's Matt. First, it all varies, based upon geography. So, we'll start
there. On a countrywide basis, as I said last quarter, we feel good that we've essentially caught up the loss trends and

are now in a more reactive mode where we are monitoring loss trends and keeping pace with them. But that, of course,
has some variability state-by-state there; some states where we still have indications and we'll still need to take some
rate, and there are others where we are doing quite well and things have stabilized. Overall, we feel really good about
our competitive position.
In our business with our distribution model, one of the most important things for them is stability, and so, as we're
stable, as we maintain more normalized adjustments to rate and more inflationary rate adjustments, as we are able to
build multi-month and multi-year marketing plans and give them predictability, they're more willing to invest, they're
able to do long-term business plans, and we see increased quote activity and increased closing rates and as a result,
increased new business production.
So, we actually feel quite good about our competitive position. It's interesting that you point to rate reductions that
you've seen. We still see lots of our competitors with very large indications that are not yet taking all of their
indications in some states, and in others they are still taking double-digit rates. So, we're seeing it all over the board,
while we are, for the most part, very stable and taking modest rate increases, which we believe is very good for our
business model.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Thanks for that color. As a follow-up, with frequency, both BI and property, being
favorable for you in the last two quarters, I believe, is there anything going on in the environment that might lead us to
believe that that's going to continue?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Oh, boy, if I could predict the future, Greg, I'd be a very happy man and Tom would be
happier too. You know, what we've seen is a moderation in frequency in the first half of this year. As we closed out last
year, it was really unclear what frequency would look like. We were, as you know, monitoring miles driven,
monitoring the unemployment rate, monitoring gas prices, and monitoring all those things that fed into miles driven,
which fed into, in addition to distracted driving, fed into accident frequency. And we've seen some moderation there,
which has been good for our business these first two quarters. And we have no way really of projecting what it's going
to look like for the remainder of the year. We feel, as I said, good about the fact that it appears not to be making step
function changes. That is, it appears to be moving in a more normalized basis up and down, normal variability with
weather and things like that, which is much easier for us to react to and monitor and take appropriate rates for.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Great. Thank you for the answers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question, please?
<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Hi, good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. As you begin to transition to growth,
should we expect the underlying combined ratio to stay around these levels? Or should we start to see it rise a bit,
given, I don' know, maybe a new business penalty or less price action?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Sarah, thank you for the question and good morning. When we manage overall
profitability, we obviously look at the underlying combined ratio, and it's lower than we expected this year, obviously.
We also look at the reported combined ratio and factor in cats and everything else. And we kind of like where we're at.
Could it drift up? Sure. Frequency and severity typically bounce around by more than a percent a year, so, it could
move around. But, if you said do we have an objective to further reduce it from here, the answer would be no. Might it
go lower? It all depends what happens in the market, but we don't – we really try to prioritize and balance between
maintaining that combined ratio and growth. Obviously, when 2015 frequency and severity went up faster than we had
factored into our pricing, we had to prioritize profitability over growth. I would say we are back to a more normal
position today.
Matt, anything you want to add?

new business penalty and whether or not, as we begin growing, whether or not that could influence the combined ratio.
Certainly, the new business penalty is a fact of life that as you grow fast, the newer business is not yet tenured does
tend to have a higher loss ratio than the more tenured business.
One of the things, however, that mitigates against that is that, in our reaction to the frequency spike in the last two
years, we took very segmented rate actions and we took the segmented rate actions against those worst-performing
segments of the book. As a result, the quality of our book increased that led to more defections from the
worst-performing segments. It also led to us adding fewer new customers from those lower performing segments. So,
we believe that the new business penalty will be dampened as we add on, assuming that we maintain the same
high-quality we've been seeing lately. So, I don't expect that to be a significant drag.
The other thing I'd point out is that there's been some commentary about whether or not this will cause us to
dramatically increase marketing spend to stimulate growth, and really, the marketing spend is not the primary driver on
the growth right now, as we've discussed many, many times. Retention is actually a bigger influence for us than the
new business on our total items in force. And so, we are just as focused on trying to improve our retention within those
bounds of what we can control, since a lot of it is uncontrollable since it's based upon competitor actions. But, for those
things that we can influence, such as customer satisfaction, customer engagement, and stability of pricing, we're just as
focused on the retention component as we are on new business
<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Great. Thank you. That was helpful. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about your QuickFoto Claim and other claims initiatives? And how we should think about the potential for
savings there, as well as if there should be further restructuring costs? I think your LAE ratio is running around 11
points, would it be fair to say, maybe over time you could shave a couple of points off of that?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. It's Matt again. So, let me just start high first. So, we've talked about integrated
digital enterprise and emerging technologies. One of those areas that we are deploying it initially, and in quite some
force, is the claims area. We believe it's an area primed for it because there is some inefficiency in the way the model
operated. In the past, there was a lot of windshield time, there was a lot of dead time, unproductive time, as adjustors
drove around, driving to cars, driving to body shops for both initial estimates and supplements. And we looked at that
and realized that emerging technologies, data and analytics could rectify that and take some of the inefficiency out of
the system.
So, we began the digitization of the claims process. Last year, we launched a new immediate payment method, which
we call QuickCard Pay. QuickCard Pay is the fastest claim payment method in the P&C industry. We make payments
directly with debit cards within seconds. We've also been assessing roof damage from hail events utilizing drones, and
we've been doing that quite successfully for the last several quarters.
In the last quarter, we opened two digital operating centers. They handle auto claims on a countrywide basis by
estimating through photos. Approximately half right now of all drivable vehicles are currently being inspected through
our QuickFoto method of settlement. That has led to the shutdown of many of our drive-in claims centers. And it has
also led to a reduced need for field adjusters, since we took a lot of that inefficiency out of the system. We now have
our adjusters looking at enhanced photos, digital photos in the computers without having to drive to and from the sites.
We've also begun utilizing video chat technology to review supplemental damage with auto body shops. It's something
we call Virtual Assist. And the combination of all of those things has led to a dramatically more productive and more
efficient claims system. We've taken a cycle that used to take five to seven days in order to get eyes on a vehicle and
get an estimate out, we've done that now in hours and we are literally doing that in under 24 hours.
So, for supplements, instead of having to schedule an adjuster to come back out to a body shop and look at
supplemental damage, we now use the video chat technology same day and we move it along. Everybody is happy. The
customer gets their car back sooner, the body shop gets the car off their lift sooner and they take another car in, and we
are reducing rental car time and improving customer satisfaction. So, we do believe that the combination of these leads
to a more efficient system, it leads to obvious cost savings as we take inefficiency out of the system, and it leads to

greater customer satisfaction
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Sarah, this is Tom. So, I think you might have to go back and look at the ULAE. Your
numbers seemed high to me. I'm not sure how you're slicing it out, but you can get that from John if you need. Let me
pick up on Matt's Virtual Assist. So, that's really great technology and we're making it available to other insurance
companies. Basically, as Matt mentioned, it's FaceTime that combined with your claims system. And so, what it
enables you to do is not to have somebody drive out to a body shop to do a supplement and you can do it remotely. So,
this is available through Arity. So, if insurance companies want to use it, this is where we can use our market-leading
movement here, because we think we're ahead of other people in doing this because you don't have to go out and train a
bunch of body shops how to use this technology. We've already trained body shops on it and deployed. So, we're
making that available to other insurance companies. So, that's my commercial for Arity
<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Okay. And can you quantify the savings you've seen from these initiatives at all?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Here's what I would say is we're not going to quantify the exact savings. Obviously,
when we take a charge of $52 million, not all of it was related to the claims piece, some was related to restructuring in
the legal department, but, we obviously expect to earn that back in a relatively short period of time. And so, that's not
five years. That's not five days either, but – so, it's pretty substantial savings on an absolute dollar basis. When you look
at it on a percentage basis, it's obviously much smaller.
<Q - Sarah E. DeWitt>: Great, thank you.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: But we break all that number – we break out the restructuring piece by component in
the Q.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please?
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Thanks very much. The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio in auto, clearly, improved
year-over-year, although it was higher quarter-over-quarter. I'm just wondering if there's some seasonality that would
explain that, or if there's some other cause?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I wouldn't make anything of it, Jay. It bounces around it. You remember first quarter,
January and February, were much lower. So, it's really better to look at it versus the prior-year quarter because of
weather patterns.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: All right. I thought there was some seasonality there. Okay. And then on a bigger picture, has Allstate
given thought to purchasing increased catastrophe reinsurance protection on sort of the working layer catastrophes? It
seems that over the past, or the company is on track over the past two years to have around 8 points of catastrophe
losses. So, as reinsurance rates keep dropping, I'm wondering if there might be an opportunity there for increased risk
transfer?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'll make some general comments and then Steve, may want to jump in. So, first, we
look at reinsurance broadly, continuously, and have helped actually develop markets, whether that be cat bonds or
larger longer-term aggregates where we go out three plus years, which were never available before. So, we're always
active in the market and that's because we're obviously one of the biggest buyers in the market. So, people respond to
our request.
But it comes in a couple of different flavors. I think what you are suggesting is have we looked at using reinsurance to
moderate the annual impact of, what I'll call, non-large modeled events? So, hail, windstorm and stuff? So, having
lower level protection. We feel that we can handle that in the volatility – that volatility in our P&L. We look over the –
at the homeowners business, each of the rolling last 12 months, we've made over $1 billion a year. And it gets
expensive when you look there. When you go to the higher-end levels, just sort of 1 in 100-year events, it has obviously
the benefit of not having to have that volatility if, in fact, that event happens. But it also is a capital relief tool.

So, we don't mind paying a little higher price for that because to the extent we can earn a higher return on our equity
than the reinsurers need to, because of their portfolio diversification on our specific piece, we use it for that purpose.
But I would say we're always looking at different ways to do it. We're always trying to moderate the amount of capital
we have to put up and maximize the return we get on that capital.
Steve, anything you want to add?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: I think you did a pretty good job, Tom. The only couple of things I might add, we do look not
only at buying more, but how we structure the reinsurance. And so, we look at it annually. You know, it's kind of an
annual buy for Allstate in the early part of the year and for Florida, it's going to mid-part of the year. So, if you look,
particularly this year, we did buy a $200 million cover in the southeast, Florida in the southeast for auto, which kind of
filled in hole we thought we had, in terms of bringing the retention down a bit for that area.
So, we continue to look not only how you structure, but there's holes we think might be, if a storm were to hit, we
would focus on that and, as Tom said, really it looks at economics. And generally, what we've seen over the last
handful of years, it hasn't been economic for us, at that time, to buy more or to structure differently. But, we're entering
into what we consider our normal-type period in the fall here where we look at it, so, we'll look at again, given you are
correct, reinsurance rates have continued to move down.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Much appreciated, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please?
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Hi, good morning. As you guys talk about looking to grow in auto, and in some of your
comments you also did mention in home, can you just remind us about the bundling within your book, you know, those
that purchase both auto and home coverages? And how you expect, as you look to improve the retention in auto, how
you expect that to play out in home?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Matt will answer to the Allstate brand, and then Don will make a comment on
Esurance, because I think in one of the analyst write-ups last night there was a comment about Esurance. Does that
make sense, Matt?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. Elyse, it's Matt. So, let me talk about the Allstate brand. You know, the last couple
of years have hurt our bundling capabilities. We had bundled primarily with auto and another product, auto and home,
auto and life, auto and consumer household products, and with all the disruption in the auto business, it has influenced
and impacted the potential growth of the other businesses. We know that – we watch the home area specifically, and we
know that home is lagging auto because, not only because of the 12-month policy in home, but the different renewal
periods. And as a result, you tend to see a lag in the growth. So, when auto picks up, it tends to be a quarter or two
before home picks up. And so, we're still seeing some of the influence from that disruption in home, even though auto
has begun to stabilize and turn the other way.
Our expectation is fully that as this works its way through the system, and I remind you that a lot of rate was taken just
over 12 months ago, so it has now worked its way through the system. As things stabilize and as we hope retention
stabilizes and potentially improves, we expect to see our capacity for bundling to improve. We like that, obviously,
number one. We want to serve customers holistically. We think it's a 100% consistent with our trusted advisor strategy,
but it also helps leverage a single acquisition cost across multiple product lines, leading to a more efficient system and
a more efficient use of marketing funds. So, you should expect to see continued emphasis on the part of the Allstate
brand to increase the bundling, increase the number of products sold per household, and increasingly meet the needs of
our customers.
Don, do you want to talk about Esurance?

<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah. And first, much of what Matt said about the Allstate brand also applies to the Esurance
brand, and actually to other brands, as well, as you see across the industry, people – different companies have made the
attempt to bundle for their customers. Recall when we acquired Esurance six years ago, it was a monoline company.
So, they sold only auto insurance. At the time, we knew that there was an opportunity for us to use homeowners to get a
different kind of relationship with a customer and, in fact, even a different type of customer.
Now, we have – and by the way, we obviously know how to do homeowners as a corporation, and so we were able to
leverage the skills we had at Allstate as we built-out the Esurance capabilities. Esurance now has homeowners in 31
states. Bundling is very important to us, for the same reasons Matt talked about for Allstate. Our attach rates are going
up dramatically as we roll the product out and make it available to customers, and so, it will offer us an opportunity to
increase retention, build a different customer relationship, and really build the business.
Now, I want to temper those comments. There's only $20 million in net written premium here in the second quarter. So,
you have 69,000 policies. It's still a relatively small percentage of the book and there is still volatility in that number.
So, a few large losses will swing that loss ratio up dramatically, as it did in the second quarter. But we've done it for
strategic reasons. It's delivering everything we expect. I think it's a big opportunity for us to continue growing
Esurance.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay. Great. And then in terms of capital return, you mentioned the new $2 billion
buyback program and being financed with capital at hand and your earnings, how do you view M&A right now? I
mean, you just completed the SquareTrade deal, but any kind of high-level thoughts, how you think M&A is still part
of the equation as you think about capital return here?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, of course, first thing we do is look at managing overall capital and we would like
to invest in our existing businesses to the extent we can with just organic growth that obviously, leverages are skill
capabilities for higher returns. We do look at acquisitions and, as you mentioned, we bought SquareTrade to broaden
our product portfolio, broaden the distribution we have, and give us additional products available to sell-through the
trusted advisor initiative or through Esurance.
And so, if you look at the – then what we do after that is ergo, if we don't have additional use of the money, we should
return it to shareholders and help increase their relative ownership in the company. So, in the last three years we've
bought back 15% of the shares outstanding. So, your value should go up by 15%, just because we are returning capital
to shareholders. Over five years, we spent about a little over 25%. So, I would expect that same pattern to continue. If
we see something interesting, we'll buy it. And we paid a lot of money for SquareTrade, but we believe we can grow it
just as we did Esurance and Allstate Benefits.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you, and good morning. First question to follow-up on the digital claim processing technology.
I just wonder, how do you measure the accuracy using photos to settle the initial loss reserve versus using like adjusters
in person?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Hi, it's Matt. That's a good question. Obviously, when you initiate a massive change in a
process such as this, the quality is one of the most critical things. So, we did a lot of testing along the way. We still
have testing and we do both secondary reviews as well as reviews in person. So, we do selectively have people doing
on-site reviews. As I said, it's only about 50% of the drivable cars right now. So, we have a baseline to look at. And the
reality is the quality has been exceptional. Our supplements are slightly higher, but rather an insignificant amount. And
the overall quality is quite good. We are continuing to develop our ability to enhance the digital photos and get better
visibility into the damage. Obviously, as our adjustors get more familiar with how to use these photos and what angles
to request and how to change the lighting on it, we're able to pick up more and more information.

We're using some technology to actually help us learn from that and compare photos from similar autos and similar
types of accidents to help us baseline. So overall, the quality has been quite good, actually slightly better than we
expected, and the productivity and efficiency savings have been tremendous.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: And, Kai, on the reserves, remember these are relatively short tail. So, within 90 days
you know what it costs to fix a car. So, it cycles its way through in both businesses.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. That's great. By the way, how much do you spend on these sort of R&D investments? It's a part
of your expense ratio, right?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Yeah, I won't give you a number or a percentage. I would just tell you that we always
look at these things and, to the extent we invest heavily in research and development, whether that be the things we
talked about here or Arity or other things, and we believe we can handle it with the overall P&L. So, we do not
resource-constrain that. Capabilities and the ability to execute might constrain us, but it is not a money constraint.
<Q - Kai Pan>: My second question is on your, sort of like the changeup of the reporting structure. Is there any change
in the underlying operating structure? And how big do you think the service business will be coming a, sort of,
meaningful percentage overall, like a business of the company?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, Kai, the operating structure is sort of – it's – what we did really was try to align
this the way we allocate capital, and the way we think about our businesses, and to give you increased transparency.
We don't have a specific goal percentage of revenue or profit we want from any of those various businesses. But, let me
give you an example. If you go to Allstate Financial, even though we showed people many of the underlying numbers,
when Mary Jane manages that overall business, she doesn't just – people would look at the overall ROE and say, oh, it's
like 6% or 7% or 8%, depending on the quarter.
And the fact is that Allstate Benefits has great ROEs. Allstate Life has good ROEs, and it's dragged down by Annuities
business. And we felt like we just needed to show people in a different way. And even though some of this information
you could parse out and accumulate together by looking at the Q or the K or the investor supplement, this really
increases a transparency by bundling it together for you in a way that aligns with the way we think about and manage
the business
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Good morning, Allstate. I'm going to apologize in advance because this is going to get in the
weeds a little bit. But between Sarah and Kai's questions, I'm still having trouble understanding the expenses in
technology versus what's in the expense ratio and what's not. Can we talk a little about why the $52 million maybe
shows up in the expense ratio? Typically, you guys have like $10 million or so of expenses that are kind of other that
show up. How should we think about it going forward? And normally, just to understand, you guys are always
investing in the future. Why does this show up in the expense ratio and other stuff in the past has not?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Josh, let me be clear, it's not about technology expenses. This is about the cost for
severance for people who will no longer be required. So, that's over 500 people. And we have 937 drive-ins. Now, a lot
of those, over time, we structured to have month-to-month leases because we knew we were headed here. But we still
have some charges to take from shutting things down, getting leasehold improvements out. So, that's not really related
to the investment in it at all, it's really related to the shutting down of other stuff. But why does it show up in
underlying combined ratio is a question Matt and I have harangued Steve with for the last several weeks.
And restructuring charges have always been in there. So, I think you should expect it to continue to see them in there,
even though they, perhaps, are not as continuing as we would think in terms of underlying. So, I don't think you should

expect us to take a $52 million charge every quarter. That said, to the extent we need to take the charge, or any charge,
really, as you know, we manage this based on cash flow and economic returns, and if it rattles through the P&L, it
rattles through the P&L.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. That's perfect. I'm on the same page now. And then the limited partnerships, I mean,
I'm not going to get a great answer out of it, but they were phenomenal this quarter. Were there any specific gains taken
that were unusual? Or it was just a great quarter for mark-to-markets, how should we think about this going forward?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: John will give you that perspective.
<A - John Griek>: Yeah, thanks, Josh. This is John. It was a combination of factors. One, we have been building up
the book of business. You would expect that the return on that book of business would get larger. Two, favorable
markets did influence it. When you look at our performance-based assets, they do have a correlation of about 70% to
public markets. So, that was a factor. And then three, to answer your question specifically, there were a few
idiosyncratic properties that performed quite well, and credit to the team that sifts through, many, many opportunities,
narrows them down to the ones that make the most sense to this firm and invests in those.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: All right. Well, if you need some more co-investment, let me know. I got that – I'll try and --
<A - John Griek>: As long as you have good returns.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you.
<A - John Griek>: Jonathan, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question then comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question, please?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thank you for squeezing me in. One numbers question. On your net investment income,
page on 51, I'm going in the weeds, I apologize. Your fixed income yields are actually up year-over-year, despite the
fact you've shortened maturities. How have you been able to keep the yield on fixed incomes going up in a sort of low
interest rate world with shorter maturities?
<A - John Griek>: Yeah, hi, this is John again. As you would imagine, the combination of events can cause changes in
yields, not only where you are placed on the yield curve, but also what investments you buy in the market. So, part of
that is in response to increased holdings in securities, like high-yield and other higher-yielding securities. We also did,
and it should be noted, while it was a small move in the first quarter of this year, we did extend the duration of portfolio
by about a quarter of a year, and that impacted yields by about 20 basis points
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Gotcha. And one other quickie. On the preferred that you say you're going to issue to help
on the buyback, what's the motivation there? What roughly yield and magnitude are we talking?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: So, we are looking as part of the potential funding for our buyback. So I think...
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Right.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: ...currently, right now the market seems fairly attractive, it just kind of goes on cycles.
And so, we will look at that as part of that financing. Obviously, we don't have to do it because we have plenty of
capital and cash. But when opportunities we think are attractive are available, we want to take advantage of them.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Rough idea of the size and yield that you'd be paying, ballpark?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, the yields should be as low as possible, from our standpoint.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Great.

<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: But you saw a deal went out earlier this week at a couple of ticks over 5%. And when
you can issue perpetual equity that has a guaranteed 5% return and you can use that to buy back common, we think
that's a good trade on behalf of the shareholders. And, as you know, we've done $1.75 billion of it over the last – Steve?
– two or three years...
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Four years.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: ...four years, and we like the results of that. And so, there's more to do. You wouldn't
obviously do this for $100 million, it's not worth all the overall effort. So, we haven't sized it, but there's plenty of
opportunities for us to issue, given our brand name, our credit capacity, and our ability to pay them.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Thomas Joseph Wilson
So, let me close by, again thanking you all for participating. Overall, we made excellent progress on our five operating
priorities, most importantly, better serving the customers, achieving economic returns and capital, and proactively
managing our investments. We also are beginning to focus more on growing the customer base, and then are always
looking at building long-term growth platforms, whether that's investing in integrated digital enterprise, or new
initiatives like SquareTrade and Arity.
Looking forward, we're just going to stay focused on our 2017 priorities and be precise in the way we execute our
business, balancing both short and long-term initiatives. So, thank you all and we will see you next quarter.
