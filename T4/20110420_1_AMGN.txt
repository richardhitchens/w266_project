My name is Christian, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2011 Financial Results
Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question and
answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers' prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to
participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator

I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Okay. Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our first quarterly results
conference call.
We decided to have this call today, ahead of our business review meeting, so we can get our Q1 communications out of
the way and engage in a broader dialogue with you tomorrow about the longer-term outlook for our company. Our
business review meeting will begin at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning and will be held at the Mandarin Hotel. Because of

this upcoming meeting, we'll keep the duration of our Q1 conference call rather brief. I would suggest 30 minutes or so,
including questions and answers. I would also like to request that you limit your questions to topics relevant to the first
quarter, as we expect to address all other issues tomorrow.
Our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, will begin our prepared remarks with a few introductory comments. Our Chief
Financial Officer, Jon Peacock, will then walk you through aspects of our Q1 performance, followed by our President,
Bob Bradway, who will provide a brief commercial review. Our Head of R&D, Roger Perlmutter, will also provide a
brief R&D update.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. In summary, it says that through the course our
presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results could vary materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?
Kevin W. Sharer
Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and I look forward to being with many of you
tomorrow here in New York.
We are pleased with the progress of the business in the first quarter. XGEVA is off to a strong start. Prolia is making
good progress. And Enbrel and our Filgrastim franchise had a strong quarter. We also made very good progress on the
pipeline.
You will notice that operating expenses this quarter show a 13% increase compared to the first quarter of '10,
amounting to an increase of about $260 million. This increase is unusual for Amgen, which has been and remains
disciplined about having revenues lead expenses. I want to explain this difference. Jon will talk, as will Bob and Roger,
a bit more about it.
2011 is an investment year for Amgen, as we launch two new products in the United States and internationally and add
additional support for our emerging pipeline and as we transition three promising programs from Phase II to Phase III.
These new costs in support of Prolia and XGEVA and additional R&D support amount to approximately $130 million
of this expense increase.
Secondly, approximately $50 million of the expenses are triggered by the first quarterly payment of both the new
healthcare reform fee and the new Puerto Rico excise tax fee, neither of which was reflected in our Q1 '10 expenses.
Finally, approximately $60 million of these new costs reflect higher Enbrel profit share, triggered by strong first quarter
Enbrel sales and a one-time adjustment in expenses associated with our Kirin-Amgen partnership agreements. As I
mentioned, Jon and Rog will have more to say about this in a few minutes.
Our 2011 investments and the new expenses I have described are incorporated in our 2011 guidance. A number of you
have asked about Amgen's plans regarding payment of a dividend. We will cover Amgen's capital allocation plans,
including dividends, in detail at our investor meeting tomorrow. Jon?
Jonathan M. Peacock
Thanks, Kevin. So ahead of the broader review of the business tomorrow, I'll take a few minutes to walk through our
results for the quarter and reinforce some of the comments just made by Kevin. So if you turn to Page 5 of the
presentation deck, I'll walk through the P&L here with you.
So in summary, we grew revenues to $3.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of
2010. Bob will take you through the highlights on product sales later on the call. You'll also see that other revenues
grew in the quarter by $24 million. This was due to a couple of items. First, a milestone payment received from
Astellas for the filing of AMG 223 in Japan, and secondly, recoveries on AMG 827 development costs from our partner

Kirin-Amgen.
Also as highlighted by Kevin, operating costs increased by 13% in the quarter compared to last year. You'll recall that
we highlighted in our guidance for 2011 that R&D costs would be higher this year relative to 2010. As I'll outline
tomorrow, we expect to maintain our investment level in R&D at between 18% and 20% of sales. Quarter 1, 2010,
costs at 17.5% of sales benefited from some one-time true-ups on XGEVA clinical trial costs.
In the first quarter of 2011, we're investing in the full cost of the Phase III trials for AMG 386 and 479. And in addition,
we've accelerated the marketing authorization approvals for several of our marketed products in international markets.
As an indication of this, we've achieved 24 marketing authorization approvals over the most recent 12 months, two
times the number that we achieved in the prior period. So all of this contributed to an investment level of 19.4% of
sales in the first quarter.
Operating expenses were also reflected the full costs of launching Prolia and XGEVA, neither of which were approved
in the same period last year. In addition to these strategic investments in R&D and our launch products, which
amounted in total to around $130 million, we faced some new legislative costs, which in total, as Kevin mentioned,
amounted to just over $50 million. The new U.S. healthcare reform fee was incurred for the first time in the quarter and
amounted to $39 million. We also started to bear the costs of the new Puerto Rico excise tax. And this is accounted for
as an addition to our manufacturing costs. It's capitalized in inventory and expensed as the product is sold. In Q1, the
costs amounted to around $13 million.
The third category of cost increases in the quarter are related to partnership costs, which amounted to around $60
million in total. The biggest component of this was an increase in Enbrel profit share payments to Pfizer as a
consequence of the 9% reported growth for the product in the quarter. The balance primarily related to costs associated
with our Kirin-Amgen partnership.
Moving to net income. Net income was down 2%. And that benefited from some one-time gains realized from
rebalancing our investment portfolio during the quarter.
And then moving to the adjusted tax rates, you'll see that was 16.6%, compared to 20% in Q1 of last year. This lower
rate is primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax. Based on a
recent notice issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, we've assumed creditability of this excise tax on product
manufactured for the U.S. market. As a result, our adjusted tax rate is lower by the amount of the foreign tax credit,
while as outlined above, a significant proportion of the tax paid will be expensed in future periods when the product is
sold out of inventory.
On an annual basis, this will have a relatively small impact on our P&L, but the accounting treatment clearly drives
timing differences within quarters. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico tax, our adjusted tax rate would have been
20.9%. Adjusted earnings per share, at the bottom of the page, grew 3%. And this benefited from share repurchases
during 2010, and you'll note that average shares outstanding during the quarter were 5% lower compared to a year ago.
Moving to Slide 6 and turning to the balance sheet. Our net cash position continued to strengthen in the quarter. Cash
balances increased $1.3 billion compared to a year ago. In February, and as planned, we also retired a $2.5 billion
convertible bond and consequently we reduced our outstanding debt to $11.2 billion. So overall our net cash balances
were $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 2010. During the quarter on cash flows,
we generated $900 million in free cash flow. And we didn't repurchase shares during this quarter. I'll talk more about
our capital allocation plans tomorrow during the business review.
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that in summary we're reaffirming the guidance for 2011 that we communicated earlier
this year. The only exception to this is the adjusted tax rate, which we now expect to be in the range of 15% to 16%.
And again, this reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the newly enacted Puerto Rico excise tax.
Excluding the Puerto Rico impact, we still expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. And as
outlined earlier, this is a credit against the tax charge in cost of sales, and it shouldn't have a material impact on net
income or EPS for the year as a whole, even though there was some benefit during this quarter.

Let me hand over to Bob for a brief commercial review.
Robert A. Bradway
All right. Thank you, Jon. On Slide 9, I'll give you a summary of the global commercial performance for the first
quarter. In particular, I'll focus my comments just on a few key issues impacting our results, and we'll be providing
much more detail tomorrow.
As you can see, our global product sales grew by 3% versus the first quarter 2010. And this growth was driven
primarily by several factors. In the U.S., as we've already mentioned, Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered strong results,
with growth of 9% and 8% respectively. And that is driven primarily by a combination of price and unit demand.
In the U.S., Epogen sales were down by $88 million or 14% during the quarter. This decline was due to lower-dose
utilizations, driven by changes in the market arising from bundling. And I'll provide plenty of detail tomorrow on
bundling. But in general I wanted to note on this call that bundling is playing out pretty much as we expected when we
talked to you in January. And we continue to believe that we'll see a mid-teens percent dose decline in 2011, which will
be partially offset by patient populations growth and by price.
Aranesp sales were down 7% during the first quarter, with sales down 7% in the U.S. and 8% outside of the U.S. The
implementation of REMS, which was finalized in the first quarter here in the U.S., had some impact on sales. And in
Europe the trends were influenced by some erosion in price and units, although our market share remained stable
through the period internationally.
Our newer products including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia, and XGEVA, globally grew by $101 million or 34%
on the quarter, and I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our launched products, in particular Prolia and XGEVA, to
give you a bit more color on their performance in the quarter.
On Slide 10 I've included a graph showing the cumulative syringes sold in the U.S., and that's represented in green on
the slide. So as you can see in the U.S., growth is accelerating nicely. And to give you some sense of this, in 2010 it
took us six months to generate sales of the first 30,000 syringes. And in the U.S. in 2011, we've reached roughly that
same number of syringes in half the time, including growth in March of 60% over the level that we achieved in
February.
Looking at the business in the U.S., we estimate that about 20% of our Prolia patients were treatment naive, but
obviously presented with multiple risk factors. The primary care community continues to represent the bulk of
prescribing in the quarter; it was about two-thirds of the prescribing physicians, and they're generating about 60% of
the Prolia usage. And in the second half of the year, we expect retail access through Part D, returning patients, and the
commencement of our DTC promotion to serve as catalyst for Prolia in the launch, and I'll provide obviously much
more detail on that tomorrow.
Turning now to XGEVA on Slide 11. With revenues of $42 million in its first full quarter since launch, we're very
pleased with the broad uptake that we've seen so far. Looking at patients on XGEVA to date in oncology clinics,
two-thirds of our patients were previously treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate, primarily Zometa of course, and
the remaining one-third were new to treatment. Of these patients, about half of them were breast cancer patients,
followed by prostate and other solid tumors. The product is being used broadly in the oncology setting. With respect to
prostate, three-quarters of the XGEVA use has been provided in hospitals and oncology clinics, with the remaining
quarter in urology clinics, where we already have a very strong patient share of about 40%. The reimbursement
landscape for XGEVA is very favorable. On the Medicare front, all Medicare carriers have confirmed coverage on Part
B, and virtually all commercial lives have coverage, with the vast majority of commercial lives having no medical
benefit restriction. So we'll cover obviously the outlook for XGEVA in greater detail tomorrow.
Now, let me turn to Roger who'll give you a brief update you on R&D.

Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Bob. As Jon mentioned, R&D expenses in the quarter increased by 14%, reflecting investments in Prolia,
XGEVA, and Neulasta, as well as clinical trial expenses associated with the initiation of Phase III studies of AMG 386
and AMG 479. We've also invested in regulatory affairs and observational research as part of our commitment to
international expansion. Going forward, again as Jon mentioned, we're playing close attention to our expense trajectory,
and we've implemented a gated approach to investments that will ensure careful management of expenses in R&D.
I'll leave most of the discussion of our pipeline progression to tomorrow's business review. However, I will make a few
comments about our regulatory activities.
First, we continue to have productive scientific discussions with the FDA aimed at improving the labels for
erythropoietic-stimulating agents. Our goal is to ensure that the risks associated with targeting high hemoglobin values
in patients with chronic kidney disease are well articulated and placed in an appropriate context for patients not on
dialysis and for dialysis patients as well. We're making good progress.
The European regulatory review of XGEVA remains on track, as does the XGEVA review in other jurisdictions. As
previously announced, we've appealed to the CHMP for reconsideration of Vectibix used in combination with
chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancers that contain unmutated K-RAS genes. Review of this indication is
also proceeding in the United States.
During the first quarter, we announced that our Phase III study of Motesanib in the first-line treatment of
non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint of improvement in overall survival. Many
patients did, however, appear to benefit from the use of Motesanib in combination with traditional chemotherapy in this
trial. Additional analyses of this very large dataset are under way.
And finally, in the first quarter, we made very substantial progress in advancing our Phase II pipeline, including
AMGA 827 and AMG 785. I'll have a great deal more to stay about this at the business review tomorrow. Kevin?
Kevin W. Sharer
Okay. Thanks, everybody. We'd like now to take a few questions. So, Arvind, why don't you reiterate the process, and
we'll go from there.
Arvind K. Sood
Yes. Christian, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. And if you can just repeat the procedure for asking
questions, please?

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Oh, hey, guys. Hey, I had a question for Roger. Roger, you made some comments
about the FDA and trying to outline the risks of targeting high hemoglobin levels. Do you expect there to be a
modification of the current label language that recommends targeting 10 to 12 in dialysis patients?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Well, I think, Mark, what was very clear from FDA's article in the New England Journal,
for example, earlier this year, is they are anxious to get away from the idea of explicit hemoglobin ranges, and we are
as well. It is the case that achieved hemoglobin, of course, is actually correlated with favorable outcomes. People who

have good responses to ESAs and achieve high levels of hemoglobin actually do quite well. But targeting high
hemoglobin ranges is associated with more adverse effects. And real clarity on that point is needed in the label. We're
working carefully with the FDA to try and make sure we get that clarity. And of course that's true for patients in all
categories with chronic kidney disease.
Operator
Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Maybe a question for Bob on the ESA bundling side of the equation. We're looking at a pretty
steep quarter-on-quarter decline in sales from the outside. I know you say that things are on track from your
perspective, but what kind of visibility do you have into your customers? Or what are you seeing in the marketplace
that makes you believe that most of the impact is already behind us?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes. Thanks for the question, Eric. And obviously, I'll walk through this in some detail
tomorrow, because I know it's an important question for all of you to feel comfortable about. And our feedback from
the customers and from the data in the first quarter would suggest that this is playing out pretty much as we expected.
The largest impact so far arising from withholding doses in those patients whose hemoglobin levels were above 12.
And as regards the other important drivers, again, very much in line with what we've said to you previously. And so I'll
save much of the detail for tomorrow on this, Eric, but so far again, we feel comfortable that the dynamic of bundling
here in the U.S. is about what we expected.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Regarding Prolia, I wonder if you could tell us what
percentage of Prolia patients are seeing Prolia as a first-line medication in PMO and in those patients, whether or not
there's a predominance towards rheumatologists prescribing or GPs? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes. Happy to answer that question. Again, I'll give you a bit more perspective on this
tomorrow. But about 20% of the patients here in the U.S. are treatment-naive. It's higher in Europe, where it's about
50%, but 20% here. GPs are, again, the bulk of prescribing. As regards the split between GPs and specialists in terms of
putting treatment-naive patients on it, I don't have that data to hand. But GPs continue be about two-thirds of the
prescribing of Prolia.
Operator
Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron Werber>: Yes. How you doing? Thanks for taking my question. Just two questions on Aranesp in the
U.S. and O-US. Can you help us understand a little bit, what are you seeing on volume, especially O-US, in terms of
biogenetic risks? It looks like that franchise is still not quite stabilizing yet. So just thoughts there.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes. I'm not sure. I think the big move in the quarter was international. I'm not sure it's
biosimilars that are driving that, Yaron. I think what we see here in the U.S. obviously was a reflection of the REMS
being implemented in the first quarter. Internationally, our share remained stable. We saw some price impact. Most of
that was macroeconomic-related, and we clearly saw a decrease in the segment overall in Europe. It appears to be more
practice pattern related than a biosimilar specific issue. For the most part, the pricing discipline in biosimilars for the
ESAs franchise has been stable in Europe.

Our next question comes from Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thank you. XGEVA is off to a good start, and I want to ask you, do you think that if you had a
J-code, a permanent J-code, the sales would have been better than what you delivered this quarter?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: You're right. XGEVA's off to a strong start. We're pleased with the broad uptake of it by
hospitals, oncology clinics, and urologists. I think most of that community is comfortable, certainly the hospital and
clinics and oncologists, comfortable using temporary J-code. So it hasn't been an issue for us, for example, in the way
that it was associated with the early launch of Prolia.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, great. Thanks. A question back on the Epo label. Can you give us a better understanding
of timing? And when you talked about FDA sort of wanting to get away from ranges, do you think there could still be a
range in the label? Or they want to get rid of ranges completely out of the label? Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Michael, it's really hard for me to speculate on what the ultimate outcome will be or the
timing. We've had a lot of discussions with the agency. These are very good, I think very high quality scientific
discussions. It's tricky to get the language right. I'm hopeful that it won't take too much longer. I think there's a desire
on both sides to get the process done. But I really can't predict what the ultimate outcome will be. I know one of the
things for sure is that we have implemented Physician Labeling Rule language, PLR language, which will simplify the
label quite a bit and make it a lot more interpretable. I'm certainly pleased about that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the earlier one asked for
XGEVA. Can you talk a little bit about the adoption for XGEVA between prostate docs and urologists? And kind of
what you're hearing in the early feedback with respect to differentiation versus Zometa and any sort of metric that you
can give us early in the launch?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Thanks, Geoff. I know there's a lot of interest to hear more detail on XGEVA, and we'll
share that with you in great detail tomorrow. What I would say is that three-quarters of the prostate patients who are
receiving XGEVA are getting it from the hospital or the oncology clinics. The remaining quarter are getting it from
urologists. So overall, urology is still very – it's about 5% of sales of XGEVA in the first quarter. We have strong share
amongst those urologists who are treating bone mets. But there's clearly an opportunity for us to expand into a number
of urology clinics that aren't presently treating those patients. So that's a snapshot that I hope's helpful for you today.
But we'll go into plenty detail tomorrow.

Our next question comes from Joel Sendek with Lazard Capital Markets.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi, thanks a lot. Just a clarification on the guidance. Since the tax rate's going down but the
EPS guidance stays the same -

<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: – that means spend is going up. And you detailed what those spend changes are. I'm just
wondering what was different from when you originally issued your guidance?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: Yes, no. Just to clarify. The tax rate is going down because the creditability is reflected
in the tax rate. The tax charge is reflected in operating expenses. So over the course of the year, the tax charge that we
will see in operating expenses will broadly equate to the tax credit that we will see in the tax line. So the overall P&L
has not changed materially as a result of this, but sort of the geography of where the tax sits has changed. So it doesn't
imply higher expenses elsewhere on the P&L. It simply reflects that the Puerto Rico tax is reflected above the line and
the creditability below the line.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thanks for taking my question. Just had a question on XGEVA. And I'm sure you'll go into a
lot more detail tomorrow. But I was just hoping to get just maybe a bit of a preview. Just help us think about where the
drug is being used, breast cancer versus prostate cancer. I'm a bit surprised that there's not more prostate cancer usage
given the data we're seeing in that segment. I don't know what, if any, factors are leading to that sort of trend.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes. You can see some of the data on Slide 11, where I provided a breakdown of the use
so far. So 45% of the use is in breast cancer, 19% in prostate, and then 22% in other solid tumors, and 15% we just
don't have the data yet. So I think that that reflects the demographics of those tumors more than anything else. I
wouldn't read too much into why the prostate number's not larger at this point. I think oncologists treating bone mets
for prostate cancer sufferers have moved quickly to adopt XGEVA.

Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yes, thanks for the question. Just a quick clarification on Prolia. I guess I'm a little bit
confused why the U.S. sales number is so weak relative to the fourth quarter. Were there any inventory fluctuations in
the fourth quarter or first quarter that would explain the limited sequential growth?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes. There was some inventory stocking at year-end, Rachel, in respect to Prolia. And so
in January and the holiday period, we burned some of that off.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So can you give an update regarding Part D
reimbursement? What percentage of plans are reimbursing under Part D for Prolia?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: I'll take you through that in great detail tomorrow. As you know, this is the season for Part
D plan contracting. And so we'll give you a fresh update tomorrow as to where we are. We're pleased with the progress
but I'd rather step you through it in detail than answer it on this call.

Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question. Just quickly questions on the quarter, to focus
on the other things tomorrow. Could you update us on changes in channel inventory across the portfolio? A O-US
Prolia number, please? And, well, just to be really clear, tax rate's going to be lower but cost of goods is going to be
300 to 400 bips higher. Is that correct? Or is it somewhere else in the P&L? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Good. Why don't we start with – Jon, why don't you start with the P&L geography
question, and I'll pick up the other one.
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: So the equivalent charge is on the cost of sales line on the P&L. So you can expect to
see cost of sales higher by an equivalent amount over the course of the year. And the equivalent credit appearing in the
tax line. So that's the geography of it.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And in terms of wholesaler inventories, Geoff, we ended the quarter with all of the
products inside the normal range of wholesaler inventory levels and pretty much consistent where we were at the end of
the fourth quarter. And very little change versus the first quarter of 2010.

Our next question comes from John Newman with Citadel Securities.
<Q - John Newman>: My question's been answered. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Follow up. I greatly appreciate the commentary that both Roger and Jonathan had with regard to
trying to keep R&D costs under control and Jonathan's guidance of R&D for the year being 18%, 20% of the top line.
Could you give some similar commentary or guidance on SG&A as a percent of sales?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: I'm going to talk tomorrow in some detail about the operating plan that we've put in
place for both this year and subsequent years. And I think – let me talk about that in some more detail tomorrow. But I
think that the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for this year stands. And the area that I think we've
highlighted where costs would be higher this year was R&D. So I think [inaudible].
<A - Kevin W. Sharer>: I think, Eric, what we're trying to convey by our words and actions is sort of three big ideas.
One is purposeful investment. Second big idea is relentless drive for efficiency. Third big idea is wise use of capital,
which means beat our cost of capital in investments and don't get seduced by just accounting benefits. So we're going to
hammer those themes tomorrow, and I hope they're clear and persuasive, because that's how we're trying to operate the
place. We've probably got time for one more question, and then we'll adjourn for a good night's sleep for tomorrow.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Christian, are you there?

Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.

here.
<A - Kevin W. Sharer>: Go for it.

<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: But I think you've got $2.2 billion left of your current share repurchase program, but you didn't
purchase any shares in this quarter. Is there any reason for that?
<A - Jonathan M. Peacock>: I'm going to talk about that in detail tomorrow, Ravi, in terms of how we plan to allocate
capital going forward both on the remainder of this year and in future years. So you'll get quite specific guidance from
me on that tomorrow.
Arvind K. Sood
So clearly we are going to address a lot of these issues tomorrow. Let me thank you for your participation this
afternoon. And we look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning at 8.
