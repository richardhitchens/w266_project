MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. And welcome to the Xerox Corporation Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted
by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Larry Zimmerman, Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the
web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other
recording and rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.
[Operator Instructions] During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain
forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future
financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting
over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Before we review our results, let me take a moment to comment on
another set of news of the day, Larry Zimmerman's retirement and the appointment of Luca Maestri as our new CFO.
To be candid, this is a bittersweet moment for me and for many of us at Xerox. It's not easy thinking of Xerox without
Larry. And it's impossible to thank him enough for all he's done.
In his nine years as our Chief Financial Officer, he has made contributions that far exceed the role that any CFO plays.
He is truly respected, not only for his exceptional financial management but also as a trusted business partner. Larry
retires at the top of his game, after helping us create a financially strong and growing global enterprise with a
sustainable and successful future.
In building this solid foundation, he's paved the way for his successor. For that, we are grateful and we are fortunate.
Next month, Larry hands the CFO role to Luca Maestri. Luca brings to Xerox two decades of international experience
and a successful track record of leading large finance operations. Through his most recent position as CFO of Nokia

Siemens Networks and his 20 years in financial and operational leadership roles with General Motors, Luca's
experience extends across several geographies and sales channels. And his expertise reflects a balance between
disciplined financial management and business expansion. They are skills that complement the strength of our
leadership team and the experience our company can benefit from in these transformative times.
So while Larry will stay with us as Vice Chairman through April 1, and he knows I'll be counting on his counsel during
that time, this is his last official earnings release. Luca is here with us today to observe, but he doesn't officially join the
company until February 16. And while the CFO is changing, certain things always remain the same. First and foremost,
delivering value for our shareholders through consistent revenue growth, disciplined cost controls, and strong operating
cash.
We did just that in Q4. So let's move on to our results. You'll hear from Larry in a bit to cover our financials, and then
Larry and I will both take your questions.
We'll get started on slide 3. We closed the year strong with steady revenue growth and excellent cash generation,
reflecting the strength of our business model and the benefits of our expanded technology and service offerings. For
this quarter, we're still reporting not only GAAP earnings but also adjusted EPS. We're also reporting on a pro forma
basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results.
Our fourth quarter pro forma revenue was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency. We delivered Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.29,
on track with our guidance and bringing us to $0.94 for the full year. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.12 per share.
This includes restructuring and intangibles.
We took a restructuring charge of $273 million in the quarter, a bit more than we initially planned. And we shared with
you – as we shared with you last quarter, the restructuring gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can continue
improving operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth. So where there was a restructuring
opportunity in Q4, we pursued it.
Cash from operations was $1.3 billion, contributing to a very strong $2.7 billion in full year operating cash and free
cash flow of $2.2 billion. With that, we also reduced debt by $1.9 billion from the time of the ACS acquisition last
February. Cost and expense management continues to be an operational strength of ours, leading to a Q4 operating
margin of 10.4%, a year-over-year improvement of 1 point.
So, a good quarter and a solid way to end the year. And let's turn to slide 4. As you see here, our revenue remains
almost equally split between technology and services. This gives us a steady mix of annuity that comes from both
segments. It's always worth repeating that in technology we generate recurring revenue from service and supplies. And
multi-year outsourcing contracts are the source of strong annuity from our services business.
Total revenue of nearly $6 billion was up 42%. And on a pro forma basis, it was up 3% in constant currency. Annuity
revenue on a pro forma basis was up 3%. Equipment sales were up 6%, a growth rate that is more in line with
normalized levels, considering that the economy began slowly improving in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full
year, we grew equipment sales 10% in constant currency, reflecting strong demand for our new products and expanded
global coverage, both of which positioned us extraordinarily well as the economy improved and businesses started to
invest back in technology.
During the year we launched 21 products with an emphasis on broadening our color portfolio for both production and
office markets. As a result, we made more progress in growing color pages, an important contributor to our annuity
stream.
Slide 5 shows some of the key metrics in this area, where we saw solid sequential year-over-year progress. In our
technology business, we monitor page growth and machines in the field, or MIF. More MIF leads to more pages. More
pages generate more revenue from supplies and technical service, both of which flow through to our annuity stream.
For Q4, we saw continued growth in MIF supported by a 6% increase in installs of Xerox equipment. And through our
innovation and leadership in color printing, we continue to drive an increase in share in MIF and in pages.

Total revenue grew 6% in the quarter, 8% for the full year. Big contributors to this growth rates are the Xerox Color
800 and 1000 series and the ColorQube family of multifunctional systems, which uses our proprietary solid ink
technology. With solid ink, we're able to significantly lower the cost of color printing, making it a more viable option
for businesses of all size. That's why we're growing our line of ColorQube systems, scaling our solid ink investments to
make color printing as affordable as black and white.
And we did see a pick-up in usage trends during Q4, meaning improvements in digital pages and color page growth. As
color continues to replace black and white printing in office and production environments, color pages grew 11% on a
year-over-year basis. We saw this as a good sign, helping to offset declines in black and white pages.
We stated before that more transactional pages are logically moving offline, like bill statements, and more of the
marketing focused pages are moving to color. So our strategy remains the same. We're focusing our investments on
creating more color pages through affordable office color printing and more advanced digital production printing.
In the services side of our business, signings were $3.6 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we grew signings 13%.
And it represents some very large wins. From Louisiana, where we were awarded a contract to upgrade and
significantly expand the state's customer service center for their Department of Children and Family Services, to
Zurich, where we won a multimillion dollar deal to convert the city's bus fares into electronic payment systems
managed by ACS. Our growth in services was driven by an 11% increase in revenue from our BPO offerings and 5%
revenue growth from IT outsourcing, solid results that reflect our competitively advantaged portfolio as well as the
progress that we're making on cross-selling with ACS and expanding our relationships with global accounts.
Our efforts in this area led to a 23% increase in our total pipeline, strong opportunity that we are aggressively pursuing
for 2011 signings. In 2010, our total revenue was $21.6 billion, more than 80% of this is in annuity revenue. By
combining our strength in services and the sale of more Xerox technology, we're fueling this annuity stream, which
positions us well for more growth this year and for the long term. And it's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry.
Larry?
Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. As Ursula commented, we are pleased with fourth quarter results, as well as
total 2010. We exceeded the commitments we made in October of 2009 at the time of the ACS acquisition
announcement. Our 2011 guidance will also exceed those commitments.
This was a year of returning to revenue growth, expanding operating margin and earnings, coupled with really good
balance sheet performance. We strengthened our hand significantly with the ACS acquisition, which is performing at a
very high level. We also strengthened our business model with significant restructuring to align our business for the
future. We believe we can build on these achievements going forward and deliver significant shareholder returns.
Now let's go to slide 6, our technology segment. Technology revenue was flat and up 1% at constant currency and
represents $2.8 billion, or 48% of our business with a segment margin of 11.7%. Overall good performance with good
installs and equipment growth at more sustainable levels, given a tougher prior year compare. Post sale metrics
improved with sequential page growth beyond normal seasonal levels, a good sign for future quarters.
Supplies revenue was flat year-over-year at constant currency as fourth quarter 2009 revenue benefited from improving
supplies inventories.
Strong operating margin despite currency and mixed impact in gross margin. Entry and midrange and high-end all saw
a continued strong growth in Color fueled by our strong Color portfolio. In 2010 we launched a number of Qube
products, including in the high-end, the Color Press 800/1000 which continued to extremely well, driving production
color demand in an otherwise pressured graphic arts environment.
In mid-range, we recently launched multiple products that have leadership quality, productivity, and price value. In
2011, we will continue to enhance our mid-range color portfolio.

And in entry, we just launched the ColorQube 8570/8870, which refreshes our popular solid ink desktop platform. And
we have more planned for solid ink in 2011 as we build on this proprietary technology.
With revenue growth of 3% at constant currency for the year and a segment margin over 10%, the technology segment
showed solid performance in 2010, which we expect will continue into 2011. Next slide.
The services segment is comprised of three lines of business, business process outsourcing, document outsourcing, and
information technology outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 54% business process outsourcing, 33%
document outsourcing, and 13% IT outsourcing. On a pro forma basis, total revenue improved and grew 6% at constant
currency, driven by BPO, which was up 11% and ITO, which was up 5%.
BPO growth was solid across all areas and reflected good new business ramp as well as increased volumes in areas
such as healthcare payer, and customer care. ITO growth of 5% was driven by new business. We expect continued
positive contributions from ITO, given new contract ramping and a strong pipeline.
Document outsourcing was flat at constant currency and benefited from underlying improvement in page volumes and
exhibited strong signings of $1 billion. Operating margin of 12% is up half a point and reflects higher revenues,
effective portfolio management, as well as savings from restructuring and synergies.
Indicators for future revenues remain positive. New business signings were at their second highest level going back to
2007 and grew approximately 10% year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. Total signings of $3.6 billion grew
13%, driven by BPO and document outsourcing. On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by
23%, including synergies.
With a synergy pipeline of over $5 billion, we are pleased with our ability to generate new opportunities for our
services offerings. So positive results in both technology and services segments.
Slide eight. Revenue growth was 3% at constant currency for the fourth quarter and full year, good growth or
improvement in all parts of our business. Full year gross profit margin of 34.4% is above the midpoint of our 33% to
35% business model range. This was accomplished while absorbing the negative impact on cost caused by the
strengthening of the Japanese yen to the dollar and yen, about a $45 million headwind in the fourth quarter and $60
million in the full year.
Using current rates for 2011, we would expect about a $50 million negative effect, which is more weighted towards the
first half. With approximately half of our business in services, our focus is on operating margin expansion. Our
operating income on a pro forma basis grew $69 million in Q4 and $271 million for the year. This drove a full year
margin of 9.6%, which is a one-point improvement over 2009.
We finished the year with adjusted EPS in fourth quarter of $0.29, high-end of our range, and $0.94 for this year. We
continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and for actual reporting in order
to give you transparency into the fundamentals of the business. As a reminder, 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis
exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition related costs, including direct
transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs, and any discrete, unusual items.
We had $273 million of restructuring in Q4, $83 million above our third quarter estimate. The restructuring supports
certain – exiting certain businesses and accelerating the shifts in our business model to more indirect channels,
optimizing infrastructure and services and centralizing support functions, achievement of cost synergies such as
continued outsourcing to ACS of some back office functions. The restructuring from 2010 will save us approximately
$270 million in 2011 and more than offsets currency and cost headwinds going forward, as well as investments in the
business.
In 2011, we do not anticipate any further significant restructuring and plan for adjusted earnings to exclude only
amortization of intangibles and any discrete, unusual items. Next slide.
We had a strong cash flow from operations in Q4 of $1.3 billion, and $2.7 billion for full year, about $100 million
above our $2.6 billion guidance. It was driven by earnings in very good working capital performance, $685 million

fourth quarter and $348 million full year source of cash. CapEx was $519 million full year resulting in $2.2 billion free
cash flow, $200 million above our $2 billion guidance.
Debt decreased $889 million in fourth quarter and $1.9 billion since the ACS acquisition last February. This
performance positions us well to deliver $1 billion to $1.2 billion of available cash in the second half of 2011.
One last point. With the strong activity growth this year, our finance receivables and equipment on operating lease
grew and were a $235 million use of cash in fourth quarter and $159 million use for the full year. This is important, as
it is not an actual use of cash because we leveraged these assets seven to one. So in an environment of financial asset
growth, core cash flow, cash from ops before financial assets, is more relevant.
In 2011, we expect the financial assets to grow driven by equipment activity and revenue growth, as well as from an
expansion of leasing activities to support global imaging. As a result, we will focus on core cash flow, and core cash
flow less CapEx is our free cash flow measurement.
Next slide. Slide 10 expands on our guidance for 2011. We remain on track to reduce debt by midyear to $8 billion,
which will put us at a steady state leverage ratio of approximately 2.3 on total debt and 0.6 on core. Achieving this
leverage will allow us to have $1 billion to $1.2 billion of available cash in 2011, and $2 billion by 2012 to return to
shareholders. We remain committed to using over 70% of this towards share repurchase, beginning in the second half
of 2011.
To achieve our $1 billion to $1.2 billion of available cash in 2011, we will need to generate $2.8 billion of core cash
flow and $2.2 billion of free core cash flow. Within cash flow, there are a few points I'd like to make relative to the
individual lines. Earnings are expected to grow by 15% and drive cash flow. Pension funding will be higher as we
account for a lower discount rate and a requirement to move to quarterly contributions. We estimate contributions of
approximately $500 million in 2011. Looking beyond 2011, we expect contributions to reduce approximately to $350
million in 2012 and then below $300 million going forward.
Lastly, we are planning for working capital to be a use of cash as we continue to see revenue growth. The positive
results on revenue in 2011 for both technology and services, positions us to achieve 3% to 5% revenue growth in 2011.
We are also confident that our actions on costs, coupled with our revenue growth, can drive a point improvement in
operating margin. Our EPS guidance is $1.05 to $1.10.
So in summary, I can retire with confidence in the future of Xerox. First, I have utmost respect for Ursula and the
senior management team. Second, we have an incredibly strong strategy that will sustain Xerox for the long term.
Third, we have an advantaged market position in technology and services. And finally, we benefit from a business
model that will deliver earnings expansion and cash generation.
So, it's the right time for me to retire, and it's the right time for Luca to step in, bringing to Xerox extensive global
experience and a complementary set of operation and financial skills. My thanks to the investment community for your
interest and investment in Xerox. I am confident you will continue to be rewarded.
And now back to Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you, Larry. We started 2010 with the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services. It transformed our
company into the world's leading enterprise for business process and document management. And we close the year
with results that reflect the benefits of our expanded services and competitive technology, as well as the strength of our
business model.
In 2010, we grew adjusted earnings, increased revenue, improved operating margins, and generated $2.7 billion in
operating cash. We delivered on our commitments across the board, and by doing so, we generated greater value for
shareholders. We have momentum. I have every expectation that we will build on it in 2011. We start the new year as
one company with our total Xerox performance reflecting the combined strengths of our technology and services

businesses.
For our customers, that means relying on one reliable source for the back office support that gives them more freedom
to focus on their core business, their real business. Our 2011 priorities keep us on track to expand earnings and continue
building shareholder value. We won't compromise our leadership position in document technology. Through
investments in innovation and expanded distribution, we'll increase install activity and equipment sales with a focus on
driving more color pages that help boost our annuity stream.
We'll continue to grow our services business by leveraging our brand, our global scale, innovation, and world-class
delivery platforms to win multimillion-dollar deals for business process, IT, and document outsourcing. We remain
diligent in our cost and expense management, capturing key cost synergies from the acquisition and driving efficiencies
through the enterprise.
Generating significant cash flow remains paramount to how we run our business. This year we expect $1 billion to $1.2
billion in available cash, and while reducing debt, delivering dividends, and buying back stock.
I am confident we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the skilled leadership team, and the disciplined
focus on execution to build on our progress in 2010. And I expect a strong start to 2011. So for the first quarter, our
expectations are for adjusted earnings of $0.20 to $0.22 per share and full year adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today. And let's open it up to questions for Larry and me.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yeah, good morning. Larry, obviously, congrats on your next endeavors, and we'll miss you. Two
main questions today, and I'm going to address this to Ursula, but obviously Larry and maybe even Luca can chime in.
But the number one thing is and you mentioned it, is you know, how's – with Larry leaving, Larry obviously
shepherded a major buyback program six, seven years ago that was very good to shareholders for a few years. And we
know how Larry feels about buybacks, and I think there were – there's some concerns that with the change, whether
there's any change to that philosophy on returning cash to shareholders. So, Ursula, can – now that it's going to be
yours and Luca's, if you can talk about timing of the buyback and pace and your philosophy and whether anything can
change with Larry not being there, that would be appreciated.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So thanks, Ben, for the question. I think it's an
appropriate question to start this session with. Larry's commitment to share buyback is Xerox's commitment to share
buyback and mine as well. So, while Larry is phenomenal – we'll all miss him and love him, the good news is that he
acts and speaks on behalf of our company, on behalf of a strategy that the corporation has put in place, that I lead, and
that I am committed to. So, he wasn't out on a limb all by himself.
And we will continue on the strategy that we laid out. Services and technology, generating cash, using that cash to buy
back shares, doing that as – in the timing that we have always spoken about, which is in the middle of this year, none of
that has changed. None of that has deviated at all. Delivering the results, buying back the shares, paying back our debt,
buying back the shares, and using cash for acquisitions as well. So net-net, change is always hard. This one is
particularly hard. But you should not be concerned, and our shareholders should not be concerned about a change in
strategy because Larry's leaving.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Right. And that's your 70% or 75% of available cash was going to be for buyback and -.

<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct. That's right, 70% to 75% of
available cash for a share buyback starting in the second half of 2011. And as I said, that's the mantra and the march
that we will be on.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Okay. Then I'd say the other one is that with the quarter, you know, we've gone through all the
numbers with the revenues in line with the Street and the EPS. In terms of the guidance, there's obviously, you'd never
given quarterly guidance before for 2011. But obviously, Ursula, you know it's a penny or two below the Street. Is it
just because of the timing of these currency hits and – in terms of smoothing it out? And how do you see like the
earnings, you know, playing out by quarter for the year?
Is there nothing to read into with the 1Q guide? Is it just a progression of gross margin throughout the year? And if you
can just talk about the distribution of earnings throughout the year, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll let Larry start on the answer on that, and then
I'll jump in.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I think – first of all, I think
the consensus on the Street is $0.22. So we're at $0.20 to $0.22. And I think the first quarter is consistent with our
making a whole year and our guidance for the full year. I think it just recognizes the headwind of transaction currency.
Transaction currency, if you look at it quarter-by-quarter, it has a big effect. And we're saying that it's about – if the
rates stay where they are now, it's about a $50 million effect in 2011. And a good portion of that, more than half we
say, so I don't know, $30 million for argument's sake here, is what's going to hit you in the first quarter.
The restructuring that we did in the fourth quarter to try and take – to offset any kind of headwinds that we have
obviously doesn't have that kind of magnitude effect in the first quarter. So you have a little bit of mismatch there. And
I think that does put a little pressure on gross profit margin in the first quarter. However, it really doesn't take away
from the full year performance because we've positioned our business model here to deliver.
So, I think it's consistent. I think it's right on. There's no hidden messages there and I think we'll definitely hit or exceed
our guidance.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I just want – let me pull it together a little bit.
Exactly what Larry said, but with an overriding statement that if you look at our – the two sides of our business, our
technology and our services side, and you look at the fourth quarter. Look at all of 2010, the progression through the
quarters, the fourth quarter, and what we're outlooking for 2011, you will see continued progress along the strategy,
expanding distribution, growing our technology line, growing our machines in the field, our color – our pages, our
color pages. That's the plan here, and that's what's coming out. That's what's happening.
And I think in the first quarter we recognize, we have recognized that currency throughout 2010 had a negative impact
on us, and it will continue – our outlook is that it'll continue through 2011. And the first quarter just recognizes the fact
that a lot of that will happen at the beginning of the year, not at the end of the year. There's no other message here
except for that. And we're taking the restructuring to make sure that we're in line and able to perform.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: All right. Well, thanks. And Larry, it's been nice working with you. And I guess, maybe I outlasted
you. I remember the days so well.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: You might be a little younger than

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Hi. And I'd just like to echo Ben's comments, Larry, on congratulations and we will definitely
miss you.
My first question is with regard to the services business. If you can talk just a little bit about essentially what you're
seeing with the $5 billion pipeline – or I guess it was $3.5 billion, $2.5 billion last quarter. So, in terms of the revenue
synergies, how are things closing? What type of deals are you doing? Just any more color you can give us on sort of
how the revenues are working on that side.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So first of all, let me start at the higher level. We're
really pleased with the three lines of business that we have in services. We saw a good quarter across the board,
excellent signings in both business process and IT outsourcing, but also a very, very good signings quarter in document
outsourcing. I think it's important to see the distribution and we're seeing it. It's good. And we believe that that is
caused almost solely by the fact that we have these two very strong companies together now as one, and we're able to
leverage that.
I'm going to skip to – a little bit farther ahead. In the future, we're going to kind of stop talking about synergy as
distinctly as we do because we're finding that we're putting a lot of work into trying to distinguish what's a synergy
signing and what's not. And all we're looking at – well, all I'm looking at now is whether the revenue is growing. If the
revenue is growing, the signings in total are growing, and the pipeline is growing, then I am pleased. It turned out for
this quarter, all three of those things are happening. On a trailing 12-month basis, signings are up, new business
signings are up, which is extremely good, and the pipeline is growing. And the synergies are over $5 billion.
I think I've kind of wrapped it all around. We see excellent, excellent uptake. This acquisition is doing what we thought
it would do, a little bit – even a little bit faster. We signed 50 deals in 2010, which was more than we had even planned.
Interestingly enough, those deals have revenues a little bit lower than we thought. We thought we'd get fewer deals at
bigger revenue. But what we're doing is getting a lot more deals at slightly less revenue, and we'll be able to get into
those accounts and then grow our position in those accounts, in this whole penetrate and then radiate strategy that we
have. So we're very pleased with the signings in quarter four, the new business in particular. We're very pleased with
the fillet of business and all of the metrics are tending in the right direction.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay. Great. And then, can you talk – whether it's, Ursula, you or Larry, about the gross
margins? I mean clearly, currency was a big impact during the quarter, a couple of pennies, and going forward. But can
you talk maybe more about the underlying trends? What's – what are the puts and takes we should think about in terms
of the gross margin? You know, the restructuring charges that you took and the movements you made, sort of how,
again, I guess this flows through more toward the second half of the year. But just any more color you can give us on
how you're thinking about gross margin.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I would say, first of all,
Shannon, that with the content of our services business, this really becomes an operating margin story, and it's not as
much – I'm not saying we wouldn't look at gross profit margin, obviously, we would. But it's an operating margin story,
and it's a question of whether you can expand margins here or not, which we're confident we can. I mean we obviously
did it all year, and we expect to have another point next year.
So, we are doing all the things here that expand operating margin. And within that, we're trying to just do a balance of
gross profit margin. Gross profit margin, since the currency changed in 2008, is over a $200 million cost increase, if
you want to look at it as just cost. And I think if you look at the gross profit margins, the Xerox team has done a great
job of offsetting that and maintaining our gross profit margin within the 33% to 35% range. Now, in this fourth quarter,

we probably had, I think it was $45 million of – so it's like seven tenths of a point or something, effect of transaction
currency. And you know, we offset it on other lines so that the operating margin still improved a point.
And again, as we look at 2011, we're expecting about a $50 million hit. Maybe the currencies will help us. And if they
do, then we'll report that back. But right now it looks like a negative headwind of $50 million, $30 million of which is
in the first quarter. But we're still committed to be in the 33% to 35% range. And more importantly, we're committed to
increase the operating margin by a point.
So gross profit margin varies, but we have our act together to make sure that we deliver the earnings associated with
that.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Great. And then just one last question, Larry, since we still have you for this call. I'm just
curious, if you look back over the last year, I'd be curious just to sort of – what the biggest surprises, both positive and
negative, have been for you and just sort of, if you can, you know, position us in your thoughts as you sort of leave the
company. I think your perspective would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks, Shannon. Well, I think my
– I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but I am really, really thrilled that ACS acquisition has fit so well into our company.
They are performing well. They love being part of our company. We love having them. Our management team is
unbelievably excited about the way we can address customers in the marketplace now, with all – I mean, literally all the
infrastructure needs, BPO, ITO, document outsourcing, technology better than anybody else's. And you know, I kind of
drank the water here. We all know that.
But that's the best thing. And you know, we put together these numbers sort of predicting the future, back in the
summer before we announced ACS. And you know, we were trying to be fair. We weren't trying to be real conservative
or anything. And we actually blew the doors off of all of them. We did really well.
So, I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but I am really happy. And that's why it turns out this is a good point because it's done
so well. You know, the currencies, I think, are something that, at least I prayed to the currency gods, that we would get
a break here and the yen would weaken to the dollar and the euro. That's a recurring dream. And maybe one day it will
happen. Things tend to go one way against you and then, you know, when you least expect it, they go the other way.
I think the currency has been hard work, but again, I think we hit the numbers on it. So I'm just proud to be part of the
team here who delivered on what we said, and I think the numbers going forward are going to be – the investment
community is going to like them.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would just add one thing, even though you didn't
ask me and I'm not leaving, but I'll throw it in anyway.
So I agree with Larry totally. I mean, ACS, we had great aspirations and dreams about it, and it's coming through well.
How we're working together, how we're dealing with customers, that's all good. Interestingly enough, global imaging,
which is one that is now just part of us, had a phenomenal year again. We managed that operation like we thought we
should, like we said we should, and we're doing it and they're delivering.
We had – so there's a lot of parts of the business that are doing well. Our developing markets operations has picked up
quite a bit. So, I think that we're moving the company along in a balanced, in a strong, balanced way. I think that's the
way that I would – that's something that actually pleased me the most in 2010. Even though you didn't ask me.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Well, thank you for that. And, Larry, don't drive your wife too crazy.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: No, I won't.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Take care.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: She might be listening.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hello, Rich?
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Yeah. Can you hear me?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We can.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. And, Larry, I'll miss you as well.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you, Rich.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: The – I wanted to ask about cost synergy realization in the fourth quarter as well as your
outlook for 2011. Your targets were $100 million to $150 million for cost synergies related to ACS in 2010, and I think
$140 million from the restructuring. I'd just like to get -- Ursula, your assessment of how you did versus those targets,
and/or Larry. And then what we should expect in terms of additional cost savings, both from the restructuring actions
that you're announcing today as well as ACS merger synergies going into 2011 and 2012, if you're willing to go out
that far.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, yeah, let me hit the synergies, and then I'll
turn it over to Larry.
The cost synergies for 2010, we had – we're well within the range that we had predicted that we would be in. We said
$100 million to $150 million, and we are solidly there. We are across the board pleased with how we've performed. As
Larry said, we laid this thing out such a long time ago, I can't even remember the buckets anymore. But we delivered
across the board. I obviously can remember the buckets, Rich, but we delivered across the board and we – and
delivered over $100 million.
In 2011, we expect to get in the range of about $120 million or more, and well on the path to get to the $375 million
that we said we'd get to in year three. So the way that you should think about the cost synergies from the acquisition are
that we are knocking them down on a year-by-year basis with very little risk, like no risk, that we will miss any of
them. So strong performance there in the categories that we said that we wanted them to be in.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I think on a restructuring
basis for 2010 we had said about $140 million of pre tax savings and that's about the number we got. And that's how we
got operating margin improvement in the face of pressure on gross profit margin. So I think we're, you know, we did
good things there. And then because we added restructuring, additional restructuring in the fourth quarter, our
expectation is to get about $270 million of, again, pre tax savings. And you know, that's the headwinds again from any
pressure on gross profit margin and the currency, which I said a couple of times, was $50 million.
So these restructuring are targeted to places that will help us on all lines of our income statement, and they're delivering
the way we expected, and they're helping us get our results in the face of some tough currency situations.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It also allows us to invest, reinvest – I mean, we –
reinvesting in our people in 2010 and then continuing in 2011. We had a fairly significant investment in marketing in
the new brand campaign. And we need to be able to do that to make these investments to grow the company. And that's
one of the reasons why synergies and restructuring, both of those two things together and the savings that come from
that are so important to us.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask maybe a little more specific question on that. It
looks like, given your 3% to 5% revenue growth guidance and assuming that gross margins don't go up next year

because of mix in currency, that operating expense dollars actually need to be down pretty nicely year-over-year in
order to achieve 100 basis point improvement in operating margins. And I just wanted to confirm that that is indeed
what you think you can achieve next year.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't think there's a big minus
effect. I think, you know, with the revenue growth and if you can maintain gross profit margin, if the gross profit
margin goes down, it's a different subject. But you grow revenue, you maintain gross profit margin, we will be able to
expand.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Expand the services business, yeah.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I think that [inaudible] Rich.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Okay. All right. Well, thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi, guys. I actually have a reconciliation question. Number one, normally gross margins are up
a little bit, anywhere from 20 to 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4. Secondly, as I look at the last conference call, as we
talked about Q4, there really wasn't a significant discussion surrounding gross margins. And then third, as I look at the
yen, U.S. dollar rate, most of the variance happened prior to, call it, September to October. From mid-October the yen,
Euro has actually been within a more normalized trading range. It certainly had some volatility, but nowhere near
where the volatility occurred before the prior, call it, nine months.
So, I'm just trying to understand putting all that together, gross margins were actually flat sequentially from Q3 to Q4.
How do I reconcile all those data points? Because it looks like gross margin frankly was a little bit disappointing. And
I'm not sure I can really fully explain it with the yen, dollar exchange rate.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think it's a couple of things,
Keith. First of all, I don't think the seasonality of gross profit margin is the same when you add ACS into our business.
We did have a pretty good bump in the fourth quarter, you know, Xerox without ACS. I think, when you add ACS in in
the services business, the gross profit margin story is different on a seasonality basis.
And secondly, I think that currency definitely, I mean, we know the arithmetic by when we got the cost by what the
rates were year-to-year. And so, it definitely cost us almost a point, seven tenths, I said. So there's pretty good accuracy
on that as far as the reconciliation. And the rest of it's associated with you have a services business with a much lower
gross profit margin on average than the company, that had BPO grow 11% and ITO grow 5%. And so, you know, you
just do the arithmetic of the average of that, and that lowers the gross profit margin.
But they have the same businesses have a higher operating margin, and therefore, again, arithmetic, you get growth
there.
So I'm sure Jim's staff here can give you a detailed -
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Well, let me follow up then, Larry, if I could. If – could you, to follow from Rich's question,
could you be more specific in how – what numbers you're thinking about, say, for Q1 and then also implicit in '11, how
we should be thinking about the range of gross margin, including the FX impact? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, we're expecting the gross
profit margin to be between 33% and 35%.

<Q - Keith Bachman>: Yeah, sorry. I understand that. I was hoping to get a little more specific, particularly on Q1.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, if you can tell me all the
revenue mixes of the products, I can give you an exact answer. But our commitment is $0.20 to $0.22, $1.05 to $1.10,
gross profit margin between 33% and 35%, and an improvement of one point on operating margin.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right. And the first quarter – the first half we
believe to be a little more pressured than the second half because the currency impacts are more in the first half than the
second. But I do believe it's important, as Larry said, we actually for the fourth quarter of 2010, your premise was not
exactly accurate, and the staff will take you through that. First quarter of 2011 and the first half of 2011, we're going to
fight to make sure that we can hold the total operating – the operating margin will increase for sure, but to hold the
gross margin at 33% to 35% range, and I'm confident we'll be able to do that.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Okay. Thanks very much, Ursula. You got some good call-outs last night on the TV at the
presidential election. So it looked good. Thanks very much for all the answers.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you. You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks, guys. I guess I'll just echo the sentiment, Larry. Definitely will miss working with
you and miss your sense of humor. I guess, does this mean you have plenty of time to fire that RV up to do that
roadshow we've talking about.
I guess – question, I guess, just on sort of tone of business both in services and maybe coming in hardware too. Have
you noticed the tone, I guess, amongst your BPO customers and their willingness to look at spending, I guess, you
know, incremental dollars a little bit more than they had as we had moved through 2010? I guess I'll just leave it there,
and then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that from the BPO – from the
services side, I think that the tone is improving, and – positive and improving. I think it shows up in our metrics. It
shows up in signings, but more importantly in the pipeline and how the pipeline is growing for us across the board,
including document outsourcing, by the way, which had a phenomenal fourth quarter signings rate, which was kind of a
record for us. But I think that what customers are saying, large enterprise customers, government, midsized customers
as well, is that they understand the value proposition of this services bundle that we offer and that we've kind of proven
to them with examples from different industries that we show to them that we can actually pull it off, and they need to
help in managing their infrastructure and reducing their costs.
And it's showing up in our signings in our pipeline numbers. So it's a positive trend that we're seeing.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. So this is sort of, I guess, a cyclical aspect to it, just kind of a recovery aspect, but just
in general you feel that the tone has picked up as well.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that there is, obviously, some of the
tone improvement is a little bit of a recovery in the economy, but I think independent of that, even before the economy
was recovering, we saw that services grew better faster than technology, and we're continuing to see that. So
independent of a recovery, I think that we'll see that this business continues to be attractive from a client perspective,
attractive line of business for us to get engaged with them on.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. I appreciate that, Ursula. I guess, just going over to the traditional Xerox business, a lot
of the install momentum was still really good this quarter again. I guess, could you just comment on what you're seeing,
other than sort of the new product cycles, as being the driver of that? Do you see maybe a little bit more secular
strength embedded in the installs as we've moved through the year then, I don't know, then maybe you may have

expected as we entered the fall?
And then just on the supply side, I think there was comments related to document outsourcing. But would just like to
get your thoughts on general supplies, trends, and I guess what you're seeing out there from customers on supplies.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the first part of the question was on what
I'm seeing from a technology standpoint, and secular strength, weaknesses, et cetera. And I think that, I mean the things
that we know were happening are continuing to happen. That is that color is a significantly more attractive investment
line from our customers' perspective than black and white. That at the high end of black and white, while there's still a
large business there, that business is under pressure from a growth perspective because many pages, especially in the
transaction portion of the business, are moving away from being printed and being viewed, et cetera.
Those trends have not changed – color strength, high-end, black and white transactional printing under pressure. We
invest our money to make sure that we can actually capitalize on that strength. We invested both in technology, in
color, but also very importantly in distribution.
We just brushed over our global imaging a minute ago, but they had a phenomenal quarter and year, actually as well,
and that actually bodes well for us. We've expanded distribution in Europe as well. So we're seeing across the board –
in the areas that we would expect growth to happen, we're seeing across the board growth. The lower end of our
portfolio, as we expand distribution to serve those customers, color as we continue to invest in both distribution and
technology.
Geographically, I think we're seeing positive news from all geographies, kind of safe to say. We were seeing it in DMO
for – from the beginning of the year. We're seeing Europe being, as we would expect, so no significant bad news in
Europe, actually pretty managed performance there, and we saw an uptick in the fourth quarter in the U.S. So from a
geographic standpoint, that's how it it's going. And from a line of business standpoint, government is strong, large
enterprise is improving, and small to medium business is the strongest.
I think I answered all of the questions.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: You did a great job, Ursula. I appreciate it. Maybe I'll lob one last one in for Larry. So I get to
ask him at least one last question here.
Larry, given the sort of the yen headwinds and all these kind of – all the conversation around the push and the pulls on
the gross margin, does it have you guys try a little bit more to see what you can do in terms of collaboration with Fuji
Xerox to maybe push some more R&D their way? Is there anything you guys can do in areas like that to sort of offload
some OpEx?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I'll take it, Ananda. The answer is not to
offload OpEx only. I mean that's not the way that we approach it. But the fundamental question is a good one, which is
we have an arrangement with Fuji Xerox, and we work continuously. And this year no different than any other year,
this quarter no different than any other quarter, just try to optimize the investments that Fuji Xerox and Xerox make so
that we minimize duplication, so that we can drive cost competitiveness, so that we can actually work a significantly
more efficient business model between the two of us.
So the fact of the matter is that we will continue to push that vector there. We'll drive them on cost competitiveness, big
focus for us, synergies, or any kind of collaboration we can have in R&D, big focus for us, as well. And if – there is
obviously more to be gotten there. It's not perfect. So we're working it. Yeah, next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.

What's the key driver of that 4% to 7% target? Is that growth in existing contracts or new contracts coming onto the

business model?
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll say – I'll take it, and then Larry can chime in.
It's both. So, new from the BPO and ITO side for sure. And growth in existing contracts, usage started to improve in
the fourth quarter in our document outsourcing services line. And that trend is a good trend from the revenue
perspective. So it's both from signing new deals and from improving usage on the deals that we already have.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: So when I look at gross margins in the services business, that was a little light versus my
expectation, and it's been down the past couple of quarters. Is that declining gross margin trend going to continue as
you layer on these new contracts? Is that a headwind to the gross margin line, and are you restructuring below that in
order to meet the operating margin targets?
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: No. I think again the way we were
approaching this in total is from an operating margin standpoint because there are some things that you find in the
services business that the focus isn't the same on a gross profit margin as it is in a technology business where you're
selling a piece of hardware. So again, I think our expectation is not declines in gross profit margin. We're thinking
gross profit margins will stay where they are, and we're thinking within any particular quarter, they're between 33% and
35% depending on a lot of variables, you know, not the least of which is the mix of the business, the mix of the
products, the mix of the geography, how much services business.
So, you know, other than calling out the pressure caused by the currency, you know, just year-to-year comparisons, that
has the biggest quarterly effects. And when we have it, it takes it down more than you would expect. And when we
don't have it, you know, we're back to a higher range like you saw at the beginning of 2010.
So, you know, again, every line you have to be cost competitive here, and we're working on currency as a cost issue. So
if it's up $200 million since the end strengthened big time in the fourth quarter of 2008, we're just plowing ahead like
this is a cost problem. But we think it's all manageable within this 33% to 35%, and again, one point of operating
margin improvement.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And one – just one point to add is that our
operating margin big focus, as you know, and historically we had a gross margin focus, we still do, on our technology
business. But we don't really report – we don't report gross margin on a services business. So there's no way to really
actually answer the question accurately that you answered, Chris, I'm sorry. But operating margin integrated for the
business and historically we looked at gross margin for the technology business.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Okay. Thank you very much. Larry, best of luck in retirement.
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you, Chris.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Ireland with JMP Securities.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: I was wondering, one of the fastest growing areas you've identified in the BPO business is
around healthcare, and I was just wondering if the current uncertainty around the government's plans has had any
impact in your forecast for that area.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Not really. We obviously pay a lot of attention to
this. And actually, not only by watching from afar, but engaging with the government where appropriate and when
appropriate and formulating a path forward for them on health, IM, or any kind of automation or information

automation of the healthcare system.
So, we haven't really seen an impact from a business perspective. We haven't really seen – we haven't seen an impact
from the business – a business perspective based on the uncertainty. There are certain things that we count on
happening. I mean we count on people needing access to health care. We count on the fact that the information
infrastructure that we currently have in this country and lots of other countries as well, is inefficient and ineffective and
needs to be improved. It doesn't matter who is in what office, that – those two facts are for sure and known. And that's
what we – that's what we're riding. We're riding this wave of the need for fundamental improvement, and all of the
debates actually don't include a debate around this, around those two points.
So we're seeing good news from the focus on healthcare.
<Q - Douglas Ireland>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Yes, thank you. Good Morning. And Larry, best wishes. You did a hell of a job over the past
decade helping Anne, Ursula and team turn around Xerox.
Two quick questions here, really quickly. I want to get a sense more on the gross margins. And a lot has been discussed
as far as FX. I just – I guess I can't really understand or investors can't really understand how come currency continues
to be an issue with you given your hedging, consistent hedging. Is there really a cost issue or a structural issue we need
to be aware of as well? And then the second question is more around the revenue profile. If the services, the synergies
really take off, should we start to anticipate gross margins maybe being at the low end or maybe even being below the
low end of the 33% to 35% range but actually op margins holding steady because of the mix?
<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. So on the currency and
hedging, the fact of the matter, for Xerox or any company, when the currency changes, notwithstanding hedging,
hedging is a very short-term idea that protects you against changes. So there's an exchange rate. You have a normal
pattern of buying 25% of your forecast, 50% of your forecast. So it's a got a very short-lived protection. The fact that a
currency changes significantly, 30%, takes your costs up. That's what it does.
And as soon as you start hedging after the fact of that, you can protect your balance sheet so you don't have to pay in a
different exchange rate than you put it on your books for. But the hedging doesn't protect Xerox or anybody. It's just a
short-term kind of balancing of it.
So, when you look at exchange rate changes, I mean those changes have to be comprehended as cost impacts, and you
have to take significant cost actions or expense actions, which we've done in the business, to offset them. And as I said,
that – it's about a $200 million cost hit.
So, and – you know, we can spread that by quarter. We've looked at it over and over again. And that's really been the
impact. And if you look at the pattern of gross profit margins, we've done a good job, if I don't say so myself, of
managing within, even with taking a $200 million cost hit, which is – it is profound because if you ever get a break the
other way here, it's going to roll to the bottom line.
So, that's just a fact. I mean, you can ask any CFO in any company who has to deal with changing exchange rates on a
transaction cost basis, I think you'll get the same answer. And I'm sorry, what was the -
<A - Ursula M. Burns, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The revenue mix, the gross profit margin given the
fact that we may actually grow in services faster.

<A - Lawrence A. Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I mean, I think that's the story
of operating margin because you're growing the business that has a lower, much lower gross profit margin than the
technology business, and you're growing it much faster. And so that puts pressure on your gross profit margin, which,
by the way, we don't just accept. We try to offset it. However, they have a higher operating margin. And so when you
get down to the operating margin line, you actually get helped by it. And it drives profit and it expands earnings.
So, you know, the model works here. I think we just again, I think it's important to look at gross profit margin. I'm not
saying it isn't. But I think you have to put it in the context of a business that's 50% services, higher operating margin,
lower gross profit margin, and you know, when you show that kind of expansion in margins, it's pretty damn good.
