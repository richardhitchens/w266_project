William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to take a minute before getting into the details of the fourth quarter
and the full year results to welcome Todd Ernst, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of you may
already know Todd from his time in the investment community. We look forward to having him here as part of the
Raytheon team in Waltham. Welcome, Todd.
Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you. Thanks, Bill.
William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Now, turning to our results, Raytheon delivered strong operating performance in 2010. This is a result of our
focus on program execution and productivity initiatives driven by Six Sigma and operational improvements. Adjusted
earnings were up 15% for the year and operating cash flow was once again very strong.
As you know, 2010 had some headwinds, including program delays, a continuing resolution, and a difficult economic
environment. Our strategies prepared us well for this. By leveraging our innovative technology, cost competitiveness,
solid program execution and strong customer alignment, we had one of the highest competitive win rates in the
company's history.
Notably, competitive wins included Small Diameter Bomb, GPS-OCX, AMDR, STARS, among others. These wins
position us well for future competitions. For example, SDB, our Small Diameter Bomb, where our sensor technology
was a key discriminator, which positions us well as we compete for next generation missile programs.
On the classified side, our sales increased in 2010 by 13%, driven by NCS and SAS. Our contract research and
development, or CRAD bookings, were also up in 2010 by 28% while sales on these programs increased by 13%. This
provides much of the funding for the next generation of Raytheon technologies and keeps us at the cutting edge of
technology development in areas directly aligned with our customers' needs.
As always, we remain focused on creating long-term value for our customers and our shareholders. To that end,
Raytheon announced at the end of the fourth quarter that the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Applied
Signal Technology. AST brings world-class technologies and their talent complements Raytheon's strong, intelligent
surveillance and reconnaissance solutions. This combination of strengths along with our complementary cultures of
innovation will provide capabilities to address our customers' current and future challenges while creating value for our
shareholders.
In addition to announcing our agreement with AST, we completed three acquisitions in 2010. These acquisitions,
coupled with our sixth consecutive year of dividend increases, our share repurchase program, and discretionary pension
contribution underscore our balanced approach to capital deployment.
Three weeks ago, Secretary Gates further outlined his plan to adjust DOD spending priorities within a challenging
fiscal environment. From a Raytheon perspective, there were some puts and takes within his plan. But on balance, our
portfolio of capabilities align very well with DOD's vision of the future. We remain confident that our strategy is the
right one, and will yield strong long-term growth opportunities for our core strategic areas. We are also reassured that
DOD remains committed to preserving investment and modernization.
Let me take a moment to discuss the international environment, which remains a key area of growth for the company.
In 2010, 23% of our sales were to international customers. And our international's revenues grew by 10%. This growth

is driven by the breadth and depth of Raytheon's portfolio of products that align well with our customers' needs to be
able to address important threats. These threats have not changed.
Many of you heard me discuss the difficulty in pegging the timing of international and domestic awards, and in 2010,
we had a few opportunities move into 2011. But we remain confident that the ultimate awards are not a matter of if, but
when.
Our strong operating performance stands in contrast to the challenging environment that unfolded in 2010. Congestion
in domestic and international acquisition cycle slowed growth and impacted bookings. The continuing resolution was
also a factor, and could also be the case in 2011.
It's too early to tell exactly what the length will be. That said, our organization rose to the challenge, and through strong
execution, delivered outstanding bottom line results. In 2011, we will continue to drive operations to greater levels of
efficiency. While we expect that there will continue to be delays in the acquisition cycle during the early part of the
year, we anticipate this easing as the year progresses.
Before I close my remarks, I want to spend a few moments on the company's other accomplishments in 2010. We
continue to position ourselves as best in class with regard to environmental and safety programs. For example, in 2005,
we reduced our absolute energy consumption, since 2005 we reduced our absolute energy consumption at the company
by 12%. To that end, we received the EPA Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award for the third year in a row. And we
continue to make progress on our goal of an injury-free work place, while achieving the lowest injury rate – employee
injury rate in our industry.
Lastly, I'm very proud of our new partnership with the Wounded Warrior Project. Together with Cisco, we're funding a
program that helps facilitate the ability of wounded service men and women to successfully re-enter the workplace with
new skills for the IT and cyber security markets. We are proud of those who serve every day to protect our way of life,
and are excited to fund this new effort to support our wounded warriors.
When I reflect on these accomplishments I see a company that excels at everything it sets out to do. That's good for our
customers, it's good for our shareholders, and it's good for our employees.
With that, I'd like to recognize the efforts of the entire Raytheon team for staying focused and delivering value in 2010.
I thank them for all their hard work, and we look forward to the future.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and
full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2011. And after that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our
website.
Okay, if everyone would please move to page three. Strong operational performance across the company drove our
margin, EPS, and operating cash flow results during the quarter. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the
full year. Our fourth quarter-adjusted EPS of $1.57 was up 20%, and for the full year it was $5.58, up 15%, primarily
the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
We also generated strong operating cash flow of just under $900 million for the quarter, and about $1.9 billion for the
year, after making a fourth quarter $750 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans. Additionally during the
fourth quarter, the company repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the
year-to-date repurchases to 29 million shares for about $1.5 billion.

As we discussed on the last earnings call, during the fourth quarter 2010, the company issued $2 billion in long-term
debt, and retired $678 million in debt maturing in '12 and '13. As a result of these transactions, the company extended
the term of its debt structure at lower interest rates. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net
debt of near zero.
And finally in December, we announced an agreement to acquire Applied Signal Technology, Inc. This transaction is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2011, and will become part of our Space and Airborne Systems business. I'll
address 2011 guidance in just a moment.
If you'd move to page four, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full-year results. We had
bookings of $6 billion in the quarter and $24.4 billion for the full-year, resulting in a backlog of $34.6 billion. 27% of
our total bookings during the quarter and 18% of our total bookings for the year were from international customers.
Both bookings and backlog were affected by the timing of domestic and international awards primarily at IDS and to a
lesser extend at NCS. We now see these awards coming in during the first half of the year.
Here are some of the highlights for the fourth quarter. IDS booked $131 million to supply Patriot Missiles to Kuwait,
$120 million to provide logistics support for the Missile Defense Agency, and $112 million on the competitive Air &
Missile Defense Radar program for the U.S Navy. IIS booked $167 million to provide ISR support to the U.S. Air
Force and $281 million on a number of classified contracts. Missile Systems booked $546 million for the production of
Paveway for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and $247 million for the production of Tomahawk missiles for the U.S
Navy.
NCS booked $180 million on the competitive standard terminal automation replacement system program for the FAA
and DOD, and $190 million on two site and surveillance systems programs for the U.S Army and an international
customer. SAS booked $374 million for the production of AESA radars for the U.S Navy and an international customer
at $192 million on a number of classified contracts.
Technical Services booked $91 million on domestic training programs and $47 million on foreign training programs in
support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities.
Now if you'd move to page five. Fourth quarter sales grew by 3% to $6.9 billion. Comparing to our prior guidance,
sales came in slightly below the low-end primarily due to the continuing resolution of the previously discussed award
delays and our improved results from the company's ongoing cost reduction efforts.
Looking at the businesses, Integrated Defense Systems net sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter. The change was
primarily due to lower sales on Zumwalt and on two joint Battlefield Sensor programs, primarily offset by higher sales
on international Patriot programs. It's probably worth mentioning that the Zumwalt program was recertified and now
has a revised funding profile for the three ships committed to by the U. S Navy.
Intelligence and Information Systems net sales were $820 million in the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by
higher volume on GPS OCX, a command and control system for GPS satellites.
Missile Systems net sales were $1.6 billion, up 11% in the quarter, driven by higher volume on the Paveway, SM3, and
AMRAAM programs. And Network Centric Systems net sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 4%. The increase in
sales was primarily driven by higher sales on an international classified program.
Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, driven by growth in their classified
business. Technical Services had fourth quarter 2010 net sales of $964 million, up 9%. The sales growth at TS was
driven by both domestic and foreign training programs.
Moving ahead to page six, we delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin
was up 60 basis points in both Q4 and for the full year. As we've said in the past, we continually focus on cost control
and productivity improvements. The positive swing in adjusted operating margin speaks directly to these efforts.
Looking at the business margins, IDS had solid results in the quarter, primarily driven by strong operational
performance. IIS margins increased by 40 basis points, largely due to improved program performance. Missiles margin

was in line with last year at 10.9%. NCS margin in the quarter was up 170 basis points. This was primarily due to
improved performance across a broad range of programs. SAS margin in the quarter was down 100 basis points, driven
by the timing of program improvements earlier in the year. For the year, SAS margins were up about 10 basis points.
And finally Technical Services margin was up 210 basis points in the quarter, the result of operational improvements
on programs at or nearing completion. When you compare our fourth quarter results to our prior guidance, five of the
six businesses performed better than the high end of the range that we had provided.
We continued – we saw continued improvements from cost initiatives that I spoke to earlier and on prior earnings calls.
That said, it's important to note that these savings get passed back to the customer on our cost type programs and on
new businesses. We continue to execute on our productivity initiatives and focus on Six Sigma efficiency
improvements to further enhance performance.
Turning now to page seven, adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter 2010 was $1.57, up 20%. The increase was driven by
operational improvements and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases.
Turning to page eight. Our full year adjusted EPS was $5.58 versus $4.87 in 2009, an increase of 15%, again primarily
due to operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
The company generated strong operating cash flow of $1.9 billion in 2010 after the discretionary $750 million cash
contributions to the pension plans. Our focus on working capital management and overall cash conversion efficiency
combined with lower cash tax payments were the primary drivers.
If you now move to page nine, let me discuss our 2011 guidance. We see sales in the range of between $25.5 billion
and $26.3 billion. As for pension, we now see FAS/CAS pension expense of $367 million. This is an improvement over
our earlier projections. The change is primarily driven by the discount rate environment, and importantly, our positive
assets returns in 2010, which were up over 11% for the full year. Our end of year discount rate was 5.75%.
Next, we expect net interest expense to be between $155 million and $165 million, higher than in 2010 due to the new
debt that we issued in last year's fourth quarter. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between 353
million and 359 million on a full year basis. As for our effective tax rate, we see this coming in at approximately
30.5%. In 2010, our effective tax rate was 24.2%. If you adjust for the Q3 tax related benefit and the impact of the U.K.
Border Agency termination adjustment, it would have been 30.8%.
In 2011, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.83 to $4.98. We see our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.50 to
$5.65. Our operating cash flow guidance is between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. And finally, with respect to return on
invested capital, I do want to point out that we have revised the definition of ROIC to better reflect operational
performance. The calculation now fully neutralizes the impact on the invested capital base of the company's pension
liability and funding. For 2011, we expect ROIC to be between 13.4% and 13.9%, which reflects the new calculation.
Continuing on to page 10, I'll briefly comment on our outlook by business. From a sales perspective, we see growth in
most of our businesses. As we experienced in late 2010, IDS will be impacted by the timing of international awards as
well as the revised funding profile on the Zumwalt program, which I spoke about a moment ago. This impact is
expected to be approximately $300 million to $400 million for the full year. We expect to continue to deliver strong
margins by our disciplined focus on operational performance and world-class execution across the entire company.
If you'd now move to page 11, we've provided you with our 2011 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the improvement in
sales cadence as we go through the year, which reflects program timing, the current environment, and importantly the
historical trends of the business. With that said, we see 2011 more back-end loaded than in the past. The growth in the
back half is driven by several factors. Specifically, international orders will begin to meaningfully ramp up later in the
year. And from a domestic perspective, we would expect a continuing resolution to be behind us, and with that, we see
a marked improvement in the second half compared to both the first half and the prior year.
In the first quarter specifically, we see sales in line to slightly down from Q1 2010 despite the four extra workdays.
This is primarily due to Zumwalt being down approximately $125 million, the timing of international orders, and the
impact of the continuing resolution.

Finally on page 12. As many of you have requested, we've provided a summary of the financial impact of pensions in
2010, as well as our assumptions for 2011 through 2013. We believe this will help you to better model our company
over the next few years. I do want to point out that 2011 represents the inflection point, holding all assumptions equal,
after which the FAS/CAS pension adjustment should become a tailwind to earnings. With respect to CAS
harmonization the current expectation is that the rule is likely to be published in 2011 with an effective date of 2012. If
this were to be the case, we would expect the new rules to have a favorable impact on our FAS/CAS pension
adjustment.
So let me conclude by saying that in 2010, Raytheon once again executed well and delivered solid bottom line results
despite the challenging environment. We have a strong balance sheet, a diverse portfolio of innovative technologies,
strong demand for our solutions domestically and internationally. And looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to
deliver improved customer and shareholder value.
With that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the question-and-answer session, Raytheon does ask you to limit yourself to
one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rob
Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bill, we seem to have a trend here over the last several quarters across the industry with sales
coming in a bit light, margins exceeding expectations. How do you see that trend going forward? Bookings would
suggest, and Dave, you went into a great level of detail about timing and international, etcetera. But it's pretty clear that
I think the revenue line is going to be a challenge going forward. How long can you offset with the performance?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: From our standpoint, we still see plenty of
opportunities in the company, there's a lot of effort going in our supply chain side of the businesses. As most of you
know, that makes up about half of what we do. We're not going to be riding on the backs of our suppliers. I want to
point that out. What we're going to be working on more is giving our suppliers better visibility into what we're doing,
we're necking down to a small core group where they can line up their investments with our investments to make sure
that we continue to deliver the best value to our customers.
And as we look at how we're doing that buying across the company and sourcing and development, we think we have
some more opportunities for the company in that area. Plus from our standpoint, we realize that in this environment,
things do take a little bit longer, and I think I mentioned on the last call that we're – got Six Sigma teams looking at our
cycles at the beginning of each of the programs as we do things to take out some more time as we go and do that.
Clearly, if we can take it out of our cycles, it makes it getting a little bit back more to normal. From my perspective, I
see a few more months of the congestion that I talked about, but mid to latter part of the year, at least my take of this,
having been doing it a fair number of years I expect that to change a little bit. And we expect it to be favorable in that
regard.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bill, just on that note, and maybe Dave, you might have an answer for this as well. But if the
CR, which has clearly caused some of this consternation, if the CR is extended through the full fiscal year '11, how
sensitive is your guidance to that?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, well, given all the discussions
that are taking place around the CR, the full year CR is not considered in the guidance, okay. We don't have an

expectation that that would be the case. And frankly, Rob, it's exceptionally difficult to calculate, especially when
you're talking about the Defense budget. So I wish I could give you a more crisp answer, but there's – there would be
too many puts and takes in that situation.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Sure. Fair enough. Thank you both.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Rob. I would add a little more color. I
think the real problem is, when you look at the government side from the program managers of the acquisition cycle.
They're trying to figure this out. For those on the call, clearly, the last time we went past February 9 was in 1970. So
once we get to March 4 and beyond, they'd be a little bit unchartered waters. My take on this is that people understand
it and they're going to try and give the department some flexibility so they can operate, we've got a couple of wars
going on now. And people realize that, and I think people will do the right thing as we go forward.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Thank you, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Campbell with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning. It's actually Carter Copeland for Joe. Just a quick one, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, go ahead. I'm just teasing you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Oh, watch out.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: A quick one for you, Bill, on AST. I wonder if you might talk a little bit about the
technology, about the value proposition of that transaction? What you think Raytheon may be able to do with that? And
whether or not we could see more transactions like that, if you see that sort of stuff out there. Any color would be
helpful?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, thanks for asking, because we're in a
tender offer process right now. My comments will be somewhat limited, but if you look at the pricing and desirability
of AST. We've evaluated the transaction carefully, Applied Signal brings world-class technologies and talents that
really complements Raytheon's strong ISR solutions and capabilities. You have to remember, or maybe you don't, but
90% of what they do is classified.
We believe what we paid for the business is appropriate. We think we can really create shareholder value. You didn't
ask this part, but if you look at Raytheon's classified business, bookings were up 16% last year, sales were up 14%.
And we've had about 13% growth year-over-year, a double-digit in the classified arena. And I think what you got to do
is, given our transparency and the way we've driven the company, I think we can create real value with AST as it gets
added to our portfolio.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And one follow-up for Dave. As you look across 2010, all but one of the businesses
outperformed the high end of the range in terms of margins. When you look at 2012, I know it's early. But are there
specific segments where you see the opportunity to do that again?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think you meant, do you
mean 2011?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yeah, 2011. Sorry.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, yeah, all right. I thought you
were getting out over your tits a little bit, because it would have been a good question.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I mean, you can tell us 2012 if you'd like, too.

It's driven by a combination of things. Obviously, continued strong performance, and it is helped a little bit by the mix.
In looking at IIS, you have to peel this back a little bit, but when you look at it excluding the E-Borders impact, 2010
approximated about 9% margins, which was very healthy for that business. And importantly, that includes about 50
basis points related to purchase accounting. There's been a number of cyber acquisitions that are now embedded in that
business. Year-over-year, we're looking to see that down a little bit because there was some one-time events, some
contract restructuring, some productivity that took place in that business that may be difficult to replicate, but we're still
moving forward, I think, with a healthy margin profile there.
With respect to Missiles, Missiles includes the ramp up of several development programs. So out of the gate, we're
seeing them down maybe 10, 20 basis points, but they'll continue to focus on the things we've been talking about
around productivity and cost efficiencies, and we'll monitor that as we go through the year.
With respect to NCS, there, you sort to have the same sort, the same scenario. There's a number of production programs
that are nearing the end of the cycle while development programs are beginning to ramp up. So we would see sort of
the exit margin rate in '11 to be healthy. What you're looking at now is the average of 13.6 to 13.8.
SAS, the lower margin there is driven by the integration and the purchase accounting related to AST. If you exclude
that, we're looking at margins 10 to 20 basis points better than where we ended '10. From a Technical Services'
perspective, we had some favorable contract mods worth about 30 basis points in 2010, combined with cost savings in
'11 that are being passed back on to the customers relative to their training program. So this is more of a normalized
margin profile for TS. Probably a little bit more than you wanted to know. But let me just kind of put the whole
company in perspective for you.
A couple things are happening. One is, we have the acquisition, like we said, assuming that it closes in the first quarter,
which we currently anticipate, that will from a company perspective impact us by about 20 basis points. And the
performance improvement that we saw in '10 on new contracts, those savings and cost reductions that we've achieved
get passed back to the customer. With that, we'll continue to drive from that perspective, but that's kind of what's
happening year-over-year.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: That's excellent detail. Thank you very much, Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Troy Lahr>: Thanks. I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the international market opportunities and
kind of how you're looking at your sales between Europe, Middle East and Asia, and kind of where you see
international orders and sales for 2011?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, let me start with a broad perspective, I
think from an Asia and a Middle East point of view, we see those as being – continue to be strong with Raytheon. Put
in perspective last year, if you look, our sales represented about 23% international, what was it, 10% growth
year-over-year. So it's important to us, those regions are important. If we look at some of the areas that we see activity,
Australia continues to be a good market for us.
We expect to do some additional work there, especially in LAND 17, as we've gone through that, we expect that
sometime in the first half of the year. Air traffic control radars, which I haven't talked about in a while, continue to be
strong for us. We're seeing an uptick as more and more people are starting to fly, we're getting interest in our primary

and secondary radars along with our command and control. So that is a growth for us.
Our Missile business continues to see it. Dave mentioned the Paveway orders. We expect that to continue this year at
least in the same kind of range and size. Our TPY-2 radars, those are our long-range radars that we use for missile
defense, we see that picking up with international customers. Patriot, clearly for us, Saudi is a customer that we
finished technical discussions. Preliminary discussions have taken place. We're informed that it has been budgeted in
country, so we expect to be wrapping that up. We'll hear about Turkey and their decision sometime here in the first or
second quarter. Other Patriot, I think you heard in Dave's report, Kuwait has started to buy missiles. We expect them to
also expand with new fire units as we do Taiwan. Israel and other countries are in there, so Patriot's got a nice history.
We also see some Homeland Security activity taking place in various other parts of the world that borders are close-by,
but our customers have elected to keep those classified or at least we'll announce the orders, but not who they go to. So
internationally, I think the order book and activity is about as high as I can remember it. So we're feeling pretty good
about it, we just got to work through the issues of the countries deciding and moving forward. But I feel pretty good
about the international marketplace right now.
<Q - Troy Lahr>: And as a percentage of sales, how does that, how do you think that shakes out as a percentage of
orders for 2011?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, if you look at it from an international
point of view, I mentioned last year was 23%, we expect that to grow in the range of 23% to 25%. So we're pretty much
on target for hitting our 25% of sales that we announced a few years ago.
<Q - Troy Lahr>: Okay. And do you have a bookings target out there for 2011?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we do, about 28% to 30% is what we
expect to take place. And overall bookings for the company, we expect to be about $27.5 billion plus or minus a half a
billion.

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access Three Forty Two.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Dave, I was wondering, if you broke down the quarter where you mentioned the sales were a
little bit light. In response to the question I asked you in the third quarter, you said you were looking for domestic sales
to grow 4% to 6%. Was that where the weakness was or it was less international growth for not getting the orders?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, yeah. Okay, so let me just kind
of frame up the fourth quarter. We talked about some of this earlier, Bill touched on it, so did I. But let me just repeat
that, firstly. As we take cost out of the business, it does improve the margins, as we addressed earlier, but on cost type
programs, it impacts sales. On the quarter, that was – that impacted fourth quarter sales $25 million to $50 million.
Secondly, we're in the midst of the CR, which affect a number of programs. We're typically funded for several months
on programs, and we're now seeing funding go down to even a monthly basis. Overall, the CR impacted us for about
$100 million. It's probably worth noting that about half of that was in IIS. And lastly, we did have some timing impact
that Bill and I both addressed earlier, both from a domestic and international standpoint, primarily in IBS and NCS.
And together those were about $50 million to $100 million. Those were the biggest, that's kind of the way to frame-up,
I think, fourth quarter and what's going on from a top-line perspective.

how much classified grew, and then how much domestic ex-classified grew?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, George. I think I know what
you're getting at. So let me put a few numbers around this. Domestic grew around 1% on the quarter, International grew
in the double-digit range, 11% to 12%.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Hi, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Sam.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Dave, back, I guess, in October, you talked about a cash flow from operations of about $1.4
billion to $1.6 billion. You came in $300 million to $500 million more than that. Can you talk about what the moving
pieces were that drove that higher?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it was, actually it was driven
by the – and I'll repeat myself. We have a tremendous focus on working capital management and cash conversion. SAS
in particular, performed extremely well, and they were $200 million, $250 million improved versus what we were
seeing. So that's going to be a timing difference between Q4 and Q1. But they were able to move forward on a number
of initiatives they had, and I think performed exceptionally well. From the balance of the businesses, I think generally
speaking, everybody had a focus and basically outperformed our internal expectations, and that's kind of the short
version.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: All right. And then if I look at 2011, if I just look at your slide about the pension contributions,
it looks like, because of the discretionary and the gross funding you put in, in 2010, it's about down about $900 million
from '10 to '11. But yet the operating cash flow number is really not all that different in terms of where your guidance
is. And so can you just talk about why that we wouldn't see that go up a full $900 million?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. Let me just briefly give you
kind of the walk year-over-year. So we ended the year with $1.9 billion, that being the starting point cash flow in 2010.
From a pension funding standpoint, we pick up about $800 million as you just noted. Net cash taxes year-over-year are
working against us to the tune of $400 million or $500 million. And then there's really the timing that I spoke about
when we were addressing the fourth quarter cash flow.

some color on, if the CR goes longer, which areas get hit the most and which areas are better insulated against the CR?

Page 11 of 16
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Cai. Let me try and put it in perspective,
and I'll speak from the lens of a customer as a program manager. If you're a PM and DOD, and you're not sure what
your budget is going to be, especially if you're a new program, it's even worse. But an existing program, especially on
the intelligence side, they basically have gone from the yearly funding to quarterly and now in some cases, as Dave
pointed out, to monthly. And the reason they do that is they want to make sure whenever the decision comes on the
funding, they're prepared to execute their programs going forward, and not having consumed all the money up front. So
there's nothing left for the balance of the year, if that all makes sense.
The other thing that's taking place in our backlog that I want to point out is that the company has been extremely
successful in converting a number of our programs that used to be funded for longer periods of times into IDIQs,
indefinite delivery indefinite quantity. These don't show up in our backlog, but they give us the ability to spin and react
quickly to customers' needs. We've increased that about $600 million last year. So it doesn't show up in the backlog,
and those also don't show up kind of in the funding. So between the IDIQs, the change because of the CRs, it affects
both the backlog, the funded backlog, and we're sorting it all out. We thought it would be helpful to mention, because at
least I believed I was going to get a question on this, that the IDIQs at $600 million, those do have an impact on the
numbers, and we thought you should know about it.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great answer. Thank you very much, no, that's very helpful. And then on the -
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: – foreign, there are a couple of reasons things can move to the right. One is, just it always
takes longer, and second, maybe priorities changed. Has now for example, like if Saudi held up by the fact of now we
have this big fighter sale and maybe that's kind of moved in front of Patriot or maybe give us some color on the why's
of things moving a little bit out to the right?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, it's a great question. I spent some
time going through all our programs, I wish I could give you an underlining cause for the delays, each is driven
program-by-program or for customers' specific reasons. In Saudi, you're absolutely right, the F-15 was a big one, it was
also a big one between DOD and the State Department and the Hill to get approval, that's gone through. You're now
starting to see other things moving. Dave talked about the Saudi Patriot or a Saudi Paveway order for us, which was
close to $0.5 billion, that came in right afterwards. So we're starting to see things move.
There's a little bit of delay in the beginning of the year because Congress is changing over and we all know that the
composition of the House changed. So as soon as they all get their feet on the ground, then we'll start to see some more
activity. But it's really case-by-case, country-by-country, and Saudi has notified a lot of us of what they intend to buy,
and we're working with them to get that through. Other parts of the world are changing. I think Asia realizes the threat
there. They're starting to adjust their needs and their order books, and we're chatting with them. So it's really
case-by-case and program-by-program. And what we do see is the new programs are getting, they're getting through
DOD, but they sure take longer, if that helps.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.

<Q - Heidi Wood>: Great. Thanks very much. Bill, I want to go back to that question on AST, you are one of the last
soldiers left standing with the battle scars to prove it on those 90's consolidation wave. And one of the chief lessons
learned there was the purchase price of the entity. So can you help us get more comfortable with why AST at these
valuations and why now? Was there anything particular that happened that increased in your mind the relative
attractiveness over the next five years for AST's profile?

<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Heidi, I think so. When you look at
where the Department of Defense is going and where our customers are going. I'll start with a 60,000-foot look. We
will get out of Iraq, we will get out of Afghanistan. There will be troop adjustments at some point that the Department
will make. But the threat environment in the world hasn't change, or at least the threat from terrorism, the threat from
nations that want to cause some problems. And so what do you need in that environment? You need SIGINT, ELINT,
EW. Those are the things that tie into ISR and the command and control.
And for us, the Gretzky quote is probably still the best one that I can think of, is you want to where the puck is going to
be, not where it's at now. And so for us, I think we were wise enough not to get into Fed IT, the market proved that. I
think we were smart enough on cyber security three years ago before anybody else talked about it that we set the
marketplace there. And we see this as the next one. And from our standpoint, we wanted to make sure that we got a
good piece of property, and we thought long and hard. And as I mentioned, they're 90% classified. So we know what
they do and we think we can marry that with what else we do, and offer our customers some real value and solutions in
some cases that they thought of and even more cases where they haven't thought of.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: And as a follow-up, because I actually, I thought you might say that. And I wonder if -
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Why did you ask me?
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Because I wanted to check some things because I want to press still further, which is that there is a
domestic angle. But I want to ask a question from the international angle because we have these great zone disputes
near Japan that are on the rise. Japan is talking about strengthening both its command and control as well as its ability
to collect and analyze information. So is this an opportunity for Raytheon? Can you take yours and AST's capabilities
to our closest allies?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I believe so, where the government will
allow us to do. For your benefit and others, we do the BADGE system in Japan, which is their command and control
that we do for them to set that picture up. The radars that exist there, TPY-2 on our Patriots and other sensors. So we
have the ability to net that altogether. And Japan has been a good ally and the United States especially in that region,
our Navy's operate together – run, exercise together like no other two countries in the world. And so our belief is, yes,
we see being able to take what they do and we do, and put it together and help our allies understand what's going on.
Because what we want to know in times of – the environment that we're in, what you really want to know is what are
your neighbors doing? And we think we have the ability to know what's going on in the world, I guess the best way I
could say it.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Great. And then I guess, just a last thing as an adjunct then, you are at 23% of sales
internationally. How high can international go when you look at the skyline, Bill, have you peaked?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we have not peaked.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: How high can you go?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: How high do you want us to go, Heidi?
<Q - Heidi Wood>: I'd like to see 25%.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I guess the point is that we thought we could
hit 25% within a five year window, I think that will happen. I'm not so hung up on the absolute number. I'm hung up on
the growth, and we've had double-digit growth. We look to this year to be in the high single digits kind of thing, that's
coming out of the chute, I'd like to push it harder.
We think there are opportunities, and we think given our product mix, I really feel good about Raytheon's depth and
breadth of programs. And it gives us a lot of flexibility in what we're working on internally is our agility. How do we
move quicker? How do we do that with existing programs? And that ties into our C-Rad, which has really grown in the
company, and that's our engine here for technology. And so we can offer our customers things that they need. And as

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Gleacher & Company.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Just a question, Dave, quickly on the IDS guidance, you indicated that you're going to get a little
bit of step down this year and it seems more timing, and then also a little bit on the program changes. How do we think
about that, not that you want to give us 2012, but do we expect this to kind of come, snap back or is this kind of the
new run rate that you see for that segment?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, no, I'm glad you asked the
question, Peter. 2011 is a bit of an anomaly for IDS, driven by the areas that you just mentioned in your question.
Looking ahead, we're not going to give formal guidance for 2012, but I would say it would be more in line with
historical growth rates. If you're looking at say the '08, '09, '10 timeframe.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then just, Bill, if I could just quickly ask. You mentioned
cyber, and you have been, you have some great assets in that area. I mean, how do you view currently, the opportunities
there? I mean, is there going to be more external growth opportunities or are you just seeing the money is finally
starting to flow, and you're going to see some better organic growth opportunities, any color on the cyber? What you
can tell us would be great.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, let me add one thing, because Dave
talked about IDS. On the Zumwalt side of it, because of the Nunn-McCurdy Breach and the Navy allocating some of
the effort to the ships this year. What that does for us? If you think about it, it really spreads our funding out, which
gives us a nice base going forward that we would have peaked and then started to tail off. So now that'll help IDS by
giving them a nice base. It creates a problem this year, but overall, we think it's pretty good, and that should be factored
into your numbers. I wanted to mention that.
On cyber, cyber has been good for us. We've had, if we look at the way we measure it internally, it's had real good
double-digit growth, let me say in the 20% range both in bookings and in sales, and we expect that to continue. We're
actually, because of some of the stuff you can read in the newspapers, we've actually got some real key technology
wins that we're doing for some of the services, code named Programs Quickstop.
But basically, how we deal with insider threats, and that's one of the strengths of the company. So we see the attention
and the activity, plus we start to see programs happening on some pace and cadence, and we expect that to continue and
pick up this year after delay because DOD has now got each of the services and the agencies all lined up, so there's an
infrastructure there, and we're feeling pretty good. We've had a couple of takeaways. So we think we're on track there.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Yeah, Bill, just if I could follow-up on that, you're starting it sounds like to get some real critical
mass. I mean, it begins to start impacting in the top line. Should we think about, is that the case as we get into out years
here for Raytheon?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think so. The fact that we're coming at
it from a full endpoint of view, the sword and the shield, we see our customers coming to us for solutions in this case.
And the fact that from a company point of view, we use internally what we sell. So when we sell it, we can show our
customers that it's scalable, because a company of our size and critical nature of what we do, we can show the metrics
that are real, because it's operating in Raytheon before they use it.
<Q - Peter Arment>: No, that's excellent. Thanks again.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Bill, you have mentioned today that program delays have been a source of consternation not
only for Raytheon, but for the industry over the last year or so. And I think we've talked about this in the past where
this is causing not only Raytheon's growth rate to slow, but the entire industry as well. My question is, to what extent,
with the CR kind of being put aside, to what extent do you think we have now reached the logical conclusion of these
program delays and that we're going to get more into a normalized program award cycle?
And as a follow-on to that, clearly your guidance suggests that revenue growth is going to pick up into the back half of
the year, and we may exit the year with a growth rate as high as 5% on a year-over-year basis. And you started to talk a
little bit about '12 from a segment perspective here. Can you give us a sense of what a more normalized growth rate
might look for you as we move out of this acceleration of growth, given some of this pent-up demand and looking out
into '12 and '13, what more normalized growth might look like?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's a great question. I think the way I look at it
is the frustration that you might hear from some in our industry is that we can see the order, we can touch the order. But
getting it booked and signed and everything takes time. And our frustration really sets around being able to peg when
that would happen because you all look to us with some specificity in mind. And to me, given the economy, the budget,
what DOD's tried to do, the agreements that they tried to get with the Administration. And now we go to the Hill, we're
going to have a little bit of this first year of everybody getting their feet on the ground. And I sense that when you look
at the committee chairs on defense, they're pretty strong on what they want to go do, yet in the political environment,
the budget is one that has everybody's attention, and they'll work through that. Having said that, having been through
this somewhat before, not these exact circumstances, our intelligence, our modeling tells us that that will pick-up and
get better at year end. I think what we have to really look at and will plug into play is that how Congress will look at
the deficit going forward.
For Raytheon, we try and shield ourselves in that regard by having our international business being about a quarter of
what we do. About two-thirds of what we sell is to DOD, another third it goes other places, and Raytheon's tried to
broaden our portfolio. If you look at our programs, we don't spin around any one program. I think we only have two
programs that are around 500 million in sales, the rest of them are all less than that.
So we're really a portfolio of programs that give us the ability to move out and do other things. And that's kind of how
we look at it, and we'll keep updating you as we see things as we go through the congressional process here, because
that has a lot to what we do.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So, yeah, Bill, let me just add one
thing to that from a cadence standpoint, because I think it's a fair representation the way you phrased your question.
First half versus second half, we talked a lot about that both in our opening remarks and throughout the Q&A. So in the
first-half, I would, we're kind of looking at a flattish to maybe slightly up period-over-period sales growth standpoint,
and then sort of mid single-digits in the back half. So if you're trying to think of how to sort of normalize things going
forward, I just want to reaffirm that the way you're looking at this is right. Again, the back half of '10, going into the
first part of '11, we talked a lot about what's going on with program awards and the timing and the CR, and I'm not
going to rehash all of that, but if you're thinking about how the company is going to look going forward, I just want to
put in perspective and just reaffirm the way you're thinking about it.

<Q - Jason Gursky>: So just to clarify, 5% probably represents a little bit of out performance, given the pent-up
demand that we've seen in that kind of longer-term growth rates will reflect a more bit of what the budget itself here in
the United States is going offer up, plus a little bit from international?
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I don't really want to
characterize it one way or the other, but I just want to reaffirm the way you're looking at this sort in the mid single-digit
range, second half, is the appropriate way to look at it.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.
<A - Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations>: John, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator
Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Harned>: I was interested in going back to the E-Border situation, because when you look at that, I mean, I
think of it as you were dealing with the customer in the U.K. home office that was somewhat immature. And I would
associate more risk with that. And now, when you look at a lot of the international opportunities ahead of you, how do
you ensure that you don't run into some of those similar, into a similar type of situation?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I guess the best way to look at it is
contractually how you look at it, and that contract was a little bit unique. As you point out, I can't say too much about
it, because we're in arbitration on that. But we've gone through all our contracts to make sure that that particular
situation like that doesn't happen again. Our contracts internationally are usually systems that we've done before,
whether they be Paveway, whether they ACE or radars or they be missiles. And from that standpoint, this company has
a history of doing what it says it's going to do. And I think as I said on one of the calls in my 39 years in the business,
this has happened once.
And I want to point out that the system is operating in country. It is delivering actionable results. It handles 120 million
transactions on a yearly basis, and Raytheon delivered. And that's really the point I want to make as this company has a
record of standing by what it says it's going to do and it does it. And we'll deal with the rest in arbitration, but I feel
comfortable with what we're doing for our other international mature customers.
<Q - Doug Harned>: And has it changed the way you look at some new customers that you may be seeing on the
international front?
<A - William H. Swanson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. That's what we get paid to do. We make
sure here we have gate reviews on all of these. We get smarter as we do things. Our antennas get better to be able to do
this. And we make sure that we reach out to our customers even more so. And it's made us better.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter
conference call in April. John?
