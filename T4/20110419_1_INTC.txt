financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Kevin.
I am very pleased to report another record revenue quarter for the company. As anticipated, consumer demand in the
U.S. and Western Europe was soft, but consumer sales in emerging markets and demand for both enterprise servers and
clients were better than expected. The combination of a feature led product segmentation strategy and a simplified
branding structure has been very effective in improving the purchasing process for buyers and leading us to achieve our
best product mix in many years.
Additionally, the rapid recovery from Cougar Point chipset issues earlier in the quarter enabled a much faster ramp of
Sandy Bridge products than we anticipated in January.
With regards to the tragic events in Japan, I want to first comment that all of our employees and their families are safe,
for which we are very grateful. We did sustain some damage to our sales and marketing offices in Japan, but nothing
major that would hinder our ability to service our customers. Our team on the ground is actively participating in relief
efforts. And we are deploying our technology to help connect families that have been dislocated by the earthquake and
tsunami.
As for our business, I want to note that we did not see any unusual changes or fluctuations to our backlog after the
earthquake, nor do we anticipate any major disruptions to our supply lines moving forward.
Aggregate inventory levels of the PC supply chain remain healthy and well within normal operating ranges as we enter
Q2. In Q1, our customers replenished approximately half of the inventory that was depleted in Q4, primarily with new
Sandy Bridge based products. Compared to the first quarter of last year, which was a very good quarter for us, we
achieved double-digit growth across every major product segment and across every region in the world. Revenue for
the data center business was up 32% from a year ago, with operating profit improving nearly 50%.
Our other businesses also showed solid growth. The embedded business was up 33%, NAND Flash was up 17%. And
I'm pleased to note that one of our new business areas, the Digital Home Group, grew 129% from last year, and is now
shipping at a rate of over 10,000 units per day into set-top boxes and smart TVs. Our PC client business remains strong
and grew 17% from last year.
What we are witnessing is an explosion of computing devices that connect to the Internet, and Intel is a big part of this
trend. We not only participate through selling our products into these device categories, but we also profit from the
wide array of products that we sell in the build-out of the data center capacity required to serve all of these devices.
Turning to the Data Center Group specifically, the first quarter was another very strong quarter. DCG recorded Q1
revenue of $2.5 billion, putting us on a trajectory to reach $10 billion in revenue for this year across our server, storage,
and networking products. The cloud build-out continues to be a major driver of growth for the company, with demand
from China showing notable strength this quarter. Within the Data Center Group, the storage business increased 45%
sequentially, and was up 65% from a year ago.

During the quarter, we launched Sandy Bridge Xeon platforms for the single-socket market, and early demand for this
product has been very strong. Looking ahead, we are very bullish about our Data Center business and expect it to be a
major growth driver for years to come.
This past quarter, we also launched Sandy Bridge for client PCs. As I've stated before, I believe that this is the very best
product Intel has ever delivered to our customers. Early demand for Sandy Bridge has been outstanding. In fact, the
ramp of Sandy Bridge in the channel is the fastest ramp we've ever seen, and sell-through has been robust. The reviews
of Sandy Bridge have been outstanding, and we expect the ramp to continue on a very sharp growth trajectory.
We also launched Oak Trail just last week, which is a platform designed specifically for tablets. We are seeing very
good design momentum with Oak Trail across multiple operating systems. Over the course of this year, Intel will have
tablet platforms that run Windows, Android, and MeeGo.
We remain committed to success in the smartphone segment, and we're actively working with a large number of
handset manufacturers and carriers around the world on Medfield based designs.
Overall, we begin 2011 with great momentum. We've added McAfee and the Wireless division of Infineon to our
portfolio, and have ambitious plans for both acquisitions going forward. We are investing in developing new products
for phones and tablets, and are turning our advantages in Moore's Law and computer technology into breakthrough
products for these segments.
All of our major product segments are growing, and these new segments are expected to add to that growth momentum.
We remain on track to begin production on our 22-nanometer silicon process technology by the end of this year. This
revolutionary technology will further distance Intel from the competition across all segments of computing.
Let me make two final comments about demand and CapEx. Like many of you, I noted that some of the third-party
research firms issued reduced forecasts for PCs in 2011. I want to be clear that our views differ from some of theirs.
The PC business has evolved into a global industry approaching that is approaching 400 million units this year. While
some channels like PCs sold through consumer retail outlets in mature markets have deep visibility, other channels,
especially in emerging markets, are not well reflected in the forecast of third-party firms until shipments from Intel and
its competitors have been reconciled.
Over the last five years, we have put considerable effort into improving our visibility with systems like just-in-time
inventory hubs for our major customers as well as real-time metrics to monitor sales through all of our worldwide
channels. As a result, we were able to call the inflection in our business in Q1 of '09 as well as predicting 2010 growth
to within one point of accuracy.
Our projections for PC segment growth in 2011 remain in the low double-digit range based on early sell-through
strength we are seeing as we begin 2011 and the great reception to Sandy Bridge in both consumer and enterprise
segments. And while it's too early to call 2012, with an improving global economy, we see no reason for growth to be
materially different from what we see in 2011.
Secondly, we are increasing our forecast for CapEx spending this year. This reflects the widening of our process
technology lead and the incremental opportunity that advantage will provide our business. The increased CapEx is
focused on both 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer capabilities. As we tailor our product plans to meet the needs of
emerging notebook, tablet, and phone usages, we see a need for more platform features to be integrated into the
microprocessor, taking advantage of our leading-edge silicon capability for power management, performance, and
smaller, lighter devices. These are high ROI investments and will be the foundation for significant growth opportunities
ahead.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.

The first quarter of 2011 had several significant milestones. It was a record quarter in terms of revenue and earnings per
share. We closed both the McAfee and Infineon Wireless division acquisitions. Our customers launched their Sandy
Bridge platforms, our fastest ramping product in the company's history.
In addition, the company identified, fixed, and recovered from the Cougar Point chipset design issue, completely
mitigating the $300 million revenue impact that was originally forecasted. The factory network executed flawlessly,
lowering throughput times and significantly increasing first quarter output of Cougar Point replacement parts, fully
recovering to customer demand by the end of the quarter.
As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division, we will be providing non-GAAP financial
information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide additional visibility into the operational results of the company.
Excluding the impacts of deferred revenue write-down and associated costs, amortization of acquisition related
intangibles, and other acquisition related accounting impacts, we achieved first quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, gross
margin of 62%, and earnings per share of $0.59. The rest of my comments will use GAAP financials unless otherwise
called out.
The first quarter ended up significantly better than our expectations. From a market standpoint, strength in emerging
markets and enterprise offset the weakness that we expected and saw in the mature market consumer segment. We
continue to benefit from the strength of our product lineup across servers and clients. The introduction of Sandy Bridge
extended our leadership and resulted in an increase in average selling prices.
The third quarter of last year was the first time where our revenue exceeded $11 billion. Revenue for the first quarter of
2011 was $12.8 billion, up $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter and up 25% year on year. The acquisitions of McAfee
and the Infineon Wireless division contributed approximately $500 million of the $2.5 billion increase from a year ago.
Gross margin of $7.9 billion in the first quarter was a record, and the gross margin percentage was 61%. While gross
margin benefited from higher average selling prices when compared to the fourth quarter, 22- nanometer startup costs,
higher unit costs, and the impact of the acquisitions brought gross margin down three points from the fourth quarter.
The Cougar Point impact to gross margin was approximately three points, consistent with the impact to the fourth
quarter.
R&D and MG&A as a percent of revenue dropped to 28.7%. Our plan for 2011 is to sustain the progress we've made in
our productivity and our efficiency while making some critical R&D investments in the core business and adjacencies
such as tablets and phones and software capability and in process technology.
Operating profit of $4.2 billion in the first quarter was up 21% year on year. Net income of $3.2 billion and earnings
per share of $0.56 were up 29% and 30% respectively when compared to a year ago.
Our philosophy of both investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders was evident in the first quarter
as we completed the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division, increased our capital spending,
completed a $4 billion buyback, and increased our dividend per share by 15%. The cash generation of our business
remains strong, with cash flow from operations of $4 billion in the first quarter.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8
billion, flat to the first quarter and in line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross
margin range to be flat to the first quarter at 61%.
The first quarter was a great start to 2011 and puts us on track to exceed our financial goals for the year. Seasonal
growth from the first quarter puts us on the path towards another year of double-digit unit growth and revenue growth
in excess of 20% after the 24% growth we saw last year. We are making some critical investments in our business, both
in terms of research and development and in taking advantage of our process technology leadership. The cash
generation of our business remains strong, and the first quarter results put us on track to another year of double-digit
earnings growth.

R. Kevin Sellers
Okay. Thanks, both Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. And as is our usual practice, we'd like to ask each
participant to ask one question, and then you may have a follow-up if you have one. So Chastity, please go ahead and
introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thanks, congratulations on a great quarter. First question is maybe just helping us understand
the emerging markets and how big it is; and maybe, Paul, some of the characteristics of that market that are different
and are sustaining the growth that we're not seeing elsewhere.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, actually, let me take a shot and just give you – I think we've talked about this before, Glen.
This is Stacy. The emerging markets now are well over 50% of our total business level. And I think the dynamic that's
going on there is really one of economics. The desirability of technology is high. And the affordability of technology is
now coming into the range where when we look across markets like China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, you've got
a couple billion consumers that now the price point of a PC is within one to two months of income, and it's really
driving our growth. And penetration rates are still pretty low, so we think this is something that has legs and will drive
our growth into the future.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: And in terms of characteristics, Glen, I'd just point out that my comment on the channel
strength for Sandy Bridge is principally emerging markets. Something like a third of all the PCs sold in emerging
markets are not branded machines. They're white boxes built by the channel through our distribution network
worldwide. We saw strength on Sandy Bridge and even strength in the desktop business, which we haven't seen for
some time, based upon that product in those markets. And of course, those markets are still surging in terms of
purchasing notebooks. It's not a low end mix, I'd also add. It's a pretty average mix of products on a worldwide basis.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thanks. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask something about 22-nanometer. Paul, you used the
word revolutionary, and I've heard people at Intel use that before with respect to 22-nanometer. So I wonder if you can
shed some light on what that exactly means. And then as part of the response, with $10.2 billion in CapEx, which is
ostensibly almost all geared towards 22-nanometer, is it really Intel putting their mouth where their – or putting their
money where their revolutionary mouth is? Or is it really the money is because you're trying to manage the absolute
amount of capacity that you have?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: This is Stacy. I'll start with the second part of that and then turn it back over to Paul. The CapEx
number for us is really driven by a couple of things. It's driven by the unit growth in the mix that we're seeing, and it
protects our ability to meet demand at 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer. You didn't say 14-nanometer, but that's an
important part of this story. And it enables our strategy to integrate more features and functionality onto that
leading-edge process technology, which as Paul said in his prepared remarks, it gives us performance, cost and power
efficiency advantages.
Let me give you an example. Probably the biggest single chunk that's happening inside of this increase in CapEx is the
fact that we've made the decision that for the development fab for 14-nanometer, we're going to make that fab bigger.
That gives us the ability to actually, at the early stage of the ramp, move more products to 14-nanometer, take
advantage of that process technology leadership, ramp it faster. So we're going to spend some construction dollars
today to have that capability in place at 14-nanometer. But over the 14-nanometer life, it should save us money by

going faster on that first factory. So those are the kinds of things that we're doing to both protect the ability to respond
to demand and also make sure that we have the transistors available on the leading edge to give us the competitive
advantage in the marketplace.
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: He wanted you to -
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: On the revolutionary comment? You're right; you picked that up, Glen. I actually thought I was
the first one at Intel to use that, so I thought I had embargoed -
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: I've written it a few times already. So...
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well it's not inaccurate, but I'm afraid it's only meant to be a teaser today. We'll be disclosing
that technology in early May before the analyst meeting. We're having a separate press event around that. And I think
when you hear that announcement, you'll understand why this phrase is appropriate.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Okay. I look forward to it. Thanks.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Thanks, Glen.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tim Luke>: Thanks so much and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I was wondering, Stacy, if you might
have been able to just give us some sense of how you're thinking about the shape of the year for the acquisitions in
terms of – I think you said – you outlined that you expect McAfee and IFX to double sequentially. But how would we
think about the seasonality there? And I was wondering on a broader level, how we should think about any of the
seasonal trends for the second half of the year given all the different puts and takes on data center and emerging market
growth?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure, I'll be happy to do that. And by the way, I understand this is your last call. So I think as a
thank you for your years of following us, we'll let you ask a multi-part question this time. We're sure you're dying to do
that.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: We were a little disappointed. We thought you'd give us a seven-parter, Tim.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, so you can think of another part to this, if you want. In terms of McAfee and Infineon, we
closed Infineon at the end of January. We closed McAfee at the end of February. The combination of those two
acquisitions added $0.5 billion of revenue to Q1. And based on having a full quarter in Q2, they should add another
$0.5 billion in Q2.
So now let me help you a little bit with Q2 math because you've got a couple of offsets. You've got this incremental
$0.5 billion for McAfee and Infineon. It's offset by the fact that we don't have the 14th week. Those are roughly in line
with each other. And so when you net those out, what you see is Q2 is kind of flat on an ongoing business basis to Q1,
which is in line with the seasonal patterns we've seen over the last five years.
Going into the second half of the year, I'm not going to get as discrete as providing a forecast for each quarter. But
we're not seeing anything that would cause it to be a different year. We see through all kinds of economic climates. The
second half of the year tends to be two to three points higher than the first half in terms of revenue. That's consistent
with our expectations as we work through the year.
<Q - Tim Luke>: As a follow-up then, given the focus of investors on the tablet and smartphone side, Paul, you've
obviously been making some changes in your team associated with smartphones. There's a lot of product ramp in
tablets. What do we see as the key milestones: for example, with respect to COMPUTEX, et cetera, for these two
areas?

<A - Paul S. Otellini>: You'll see quite a bit of tablet demonstrations at COMPUTEX. If you notice what we did at
IDF in Beijing last week, there were a lot of tablet centric announcements there around MeeGo and Windows and
Android. And so we're heads down on a number of designs on tablets on all three of those operating systems. We
received the Android code – Honeycomb version of Android source code from Google. And we're actively doing the
port on that and expect to be able to ramp those machines over the course of this year for a number of customers.
In terms of phones, obviously, we lost Nokia, which took a lot of wind out of the sails for phones this year. We've
redirected those resources onto a number of other major accounts, focusing on carriers who want their own devices and
also on handset manufacturers. They're all based on Medfield, which is I think still the first 32-nanometer phone apps
processor in the industry. And quite frankly, the limit in terms of them getting to market is going to be the
interoperability testing of the networks at this point in time. So I think I would be very disappointed if you didn't see
Intel based phones for sale 12 months from now.
<Q - Tim Luke>: Thank you very much.
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: Thanks, Tim.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: That would be Ambrish. That's pretty close; Paul, a question on the emerging markets.
And each time I put out the over/under shipment, I hear back from your on-the-ball IR team about how that number is
not being counted by the IDCs in regard to the rest of the world. But for the total PC market, what is the percent that
these third-party companies are missing?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: What is the percent they're missing?
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Of the total PC market because the PC data for the first quarter...
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: They're all over the map. Right now, Gartner is at 11% for the year, and IDC I think is at 6% or
7%. And I gave you our number, which was the low double digits. So there are some that we agree with and some that
don't. And I think as normally happens, when we release our results and when our competition releases theirs and they
integrate all the data, they revise the forecasts.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay, that's fair. And then I had a follow-up, please.
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: Go ahead.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: The follow-up would be on Medfield, Paul. What are some of the key metrics that are
working that are getting the engagements with the key customers? Is it a combination of Medfield being on MeeGo as
an open source OS where people can't differentiate, or is it just the fact that you have been able to bring down Medfield
performance down to the competitive ARM architecture?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: It's both. Early customer activity is on Android and on MeeGo, and we've got ports on both
those operating systems. The product is very good in terms of performance, particularly in the area for media, so
high-def video replay, that kind of thing on phones. And the power is right smack dab in the envelope you want it to be.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay, thank you.

<Q - Uche Orji>: Thank you very much. Paul, first of all, congratulations on very strong numbers, but let me just
begin a little bit on the Data Center Group. You called out storage as up 45% sequentially. Can you talk about what's
going on within the sub-segments of DCG, like for the IP data centers, enterprise, network, and servers, so if you can
just tell us what's going on there? And we've seen this group grow significantly faster than what we think servers are
growing in terms of units. Can you talk about the trend of multi-processor servers as what's maybe driving those ASPs,
just so we can get comfort as to what the longer-term growth will be?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Sure, Uche. First of all, we recognize this group has had pretty phenomenal growth across all
of its various product groups. So what we've decided to do for the analyst meeting is do a deep dive for all of you guys.
And we'll do a full, if you will, keynote session on that, breaking out all the detail on how we see the server market, the
market for Xeon-class devices today and tomorrow. But if you look at traditional servers, you're right. We're
outgrowing the traditional enterprise server market by a factor of two or three. And as we look forward, by 2014, for
example, we think half of the market for Xeon is high performance computing and cloud. That's a dramatic change
from 80% of the market being enterprise servers just a couple years ago.
So when you look at the rate of growth of HPC, of clouds, of the nominal growth in servers, and then the conversion of
other parts of the data center; that is, networking equipment and storage from proprietary designs principally now to
fundamentally Intel-based designs, you see an aggregate growth rate that is really representative of, I think, all the
growth in the Internet. All these devices connect to these servers or these network machines one way or another, and
this is where we're benefiting quite well. And so on one side, you watch the growth of tablets and smartphones. This is
where the rubber hits the road for those devices is in data centers around the world.
<Q - Uche Orji>: Thanks for that. Let me just ask you, on the Moore's Law transition you're making now from
22-nanometer to 14-nanometer, I don't know if I should read that as being slightly more aggressive than what we think
has been a typical ratio as you go from 32-nanometer to 22-nanometer or from 45-nanometer to 32-nanometer. Is there
anything that – I know Glen asked this earlier when he talked about this being revolutionary at 22-nanometer. But what
is driving the speed now in terms of moving to 14-nanometer? In terms of what you're able to do at 14-nanometer
vis-à-vis say 22-nanometer or 32-nanometer, can you give us any idea as to what comes in here? People are talking
about having mixed signals and the abilities and all of that. Is there anything else you can tell us: A) as to what's
driving this speed; and then also, what we should expect?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: This is Stacy. So I'm going to punt on the capability part of that question for another few weeks.
You'll see that when we do our disclosures around 22-nanometer and really start to talk about some of the secret sauce
that's going to come out in that technology because that will carry forward into 14-nanometer.
In terms of the speed, we're still on a two-year cadence, so that hasn't changed. That is our Moore's Law cadence, and
we're driving that faster than anybody else in the industry. So even at that two-year cadence, we're extending our
leadership over others. What we're realizing, though, is that competitive advantage is becoming more and more
important to us. And we're getting – we've always gotten paid for it in terms of cost. We're now also now getting paid
for it in terms of differentiating our product line and getting paid in pricing. And so at an economic level – you can see
it in our results over the last six or seven quarters, is we've extended our leadership. Our products have extended over
the rest of the industry. We've segmented our product line, and we're getting paid in a new way for that process
technology leadership.
As we get out to 22-nanometer, as we get out to 14-nanometer, what you're going to see is we're going to bring
capabilities to the process technology more quickly than we have historically. And so we'll intercept 22-nanometer with
our smartphone roadmap, with our netbook roadmap. Earlier in the technology, we'll ramp our core business more
quickly, so we get into these square wave transitions and then get paid for that performance and cost by having the
leadership over the rest of the industry.
<Q - Uche Orji>: Great, and just one last question. Paul, you mentioned Digital Home -
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: Uche, let's hold it to one follow-up. We've got a lot of people in the queue.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Hey, thanks for letting me ask a couple questions, guys. First, can you just talk about where
utilization rates are now and where you expect them to go in the second half of the year and how much capacity you're
adding? And could we run into some actual shortages coming up here?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Could we run into some shortages? We're running, I'd call it, in the healthy range of utilization.
So as we've said before, not too hot, not too cold. Certainly on the chipset side of the business, as we had to respond to
the Cougar Point issue, we ramped very quickly there. But I'd say in general, we're healthy.
We're not anticipating shortages, and I think we have the ability to respond. If demand ends up being hotter, we can put
the capacity in place. And frankly, if we end up in a situation where demand ends up being less, I think you saw in
2009, we now have the tools to respond very quickly to that kind of an environment. So I think we can respond to both
sides of that equation as we get into the second half and into 2012.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Great. And as my follow-up, you guys did a good job of explaining the differences between
your PC forecast and the third party. It seems as though perhaps some of your OEM customers have a little bit more of
a tempered forecast on PCs versus you. Maybe you could take a shot at explaining that. Is that maybe on the storage
side? Or what would be the differences there, in your opinion?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: PC on the storage side? I'm not sure I understood the question, Chris.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I don't think we want to get into characterizing various specific customers, Chris. Some of
them have their own issues. Let me just say that I think that those who are more enterprise centric than those who are
focused on consumer markets, particularly in Western Europe and the U.S., are seeing numbers that are closer to ours
than closer to what yours were.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: The elephant looks very different depending on which part you're looking at. If it's an emerging
market part, it looks pretty good. If it's a mature market, Europe, it looks tough.
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: Thanks. Go ahead Chastity, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thank you very much. Could you give us an idea of what percent of microprocessor sales
Sandy Bridge made up of in the March quarter and what this percent might be in the June quarter?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I don't think we want to get into that level of granularity, David. I can tell you that the unit
shipments on Sandy Bridge will more than double from Q1 to Q2, and it is our fastest ramp ever for a new processor
family. And you'll see it move from the high end throughout, sprinkling down through all of our product families over
the course of the year. It's a very, very rapid ramp.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And just to give you one other tidbit, to give you a flavor, more than 50% of my CPU inventory
now is Sandy Bridge. So that kind of gives you a sense of how fast we're replacing the older generation products with
Sandy Bridge, and gives you a good indication of what things will look like over the next couple of quarters.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay, great. And for my follow-up, Stacy, in your online comments, CFO comments, you
have for your gross margin puts and takes a hit of one percentage point from higher platform unit cost, another 0.5%

from lower ASPs for the second quarter. Does Sandy Bridge have a higher platform cost and a lower ASP, or is there
something else happening here on top of the ramp of Sandy Bridge?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No, it's something else. So as do you the walk from Q1 to Q2, I'll just take you through the full
walk. So obviously, we get three points of benefit because we don't repeat the Cougar Point impact that's in Q1. We see
about a point and a half then that offsets that because it will be the peak quarter in terms of our startup costs. If you
think about the trends we've shown you over the years, Q2 is where – Q2 of an odd numbered year is where those
startup costs will peak, and then they come down.
There's about a point, as you pointed out, in unit costs. There is really two things driving that. One is that we're seeing a
little bit of an increase in some of our component costs, so think of substrates made in Japan where supply lines got a
little bit tight, so we're seeing a little bit of a pricing impact on those kinds of things. And then we're also, again, as a
result of what happened with Cougar Point, we pulled in the ramp of our China factory pretty significantly. And so
what you see is more chipsets coming out of a new factory that's ramping, and that's driving my weighted average cost
up a little bit in Q2.
And then the ASP piece is, and I realize I have a little bit of a credibility issue on forecasting ASP right now given it
was up again in Q1, but we had a very rich mix in Q1, as Paul pointed out. The way Sandy Bridge ramped was at the
higher parts of the pricing stack first. Over the course of Q2, we'll see Sandy Bridge flavors across a much more
representative series of price points. And I'd expect the Q2 mix to come down a bit and be more in line with what we
would normally expect.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Great, thanks very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: It's not huge. It's half a point of gross margin, but it does come down a little bit.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Great, thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.
<Q - Srini Pajjuri>: Thank you. Paul, on the corporate side, obviously demand has been very strong. I'm just
wondering what's driving that. Is it just the Windows 7 upgrade cycle? And if so, where do you think we are in that
upgrade cycle?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I'm assuming the corporate PC side because -
<Q - Srini Pajjuri>: Yes.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: – we're seeing, obviously, on the corporate side, we're seeing good growth in the data center.
Yes, I think I said that mid-last year, we started seeing the enterprise market start to recover from the recession
timeframe. And the most recent data we have is that something like 75% of enterprise PCs are still running Win XP.
And so if you think about a three to four-year refresh cycle, we're probably not even halfway through that cycle yet.
And I think that the adoption of Win 7 seems to be pretty strong. And the combination of the Win 7 SKUs with Sandy
Bridge, as we look forward into Q2 and Q3, look really good from our customers' perspective.
<Q - Srini Pajjuri>: Thank you. And maybe for Stacy, on the stock buybacks, it looks like you were pretty aggressive
in Q1. And given the strong cash flow, and also you ruled out larger acquisitions pretty much, is this something we
should expect going forward, this kind of buyback rate? Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: We've articulated the priorities in terms our cash priorities as first investing in our business;
second, the dividend; third, using the buyback to return cash to shareholders and bring down the cash levels. I think you
see that we've been very aggressive in terms of all of those in Q1. You do have to keep in mind, we have brought down

the cash balances quite a bit. But you could temper that by pointing to the fact that in the first quarter, we announced
that the board authorized an incremental $10 billion of buyback, and we're just at the beginning of that authorization.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James Covello>: Great, good evening, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I'm sorry to come back to
this, but if I think about this third-party data situation that we're talking about, even if I assume a 5% ASP increase for
the quarter, you guys would have outshipped PC clients by 20% relative to the third-party data. So is the idea that the
third-party data is off by 20%? And if that's the case, we haven't seen that kind of discrepancy up until now between
your data and the third-party data. So what's making that data more wrong this quarter than previous quarters?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think what that analysis misses, Jim, is how much inventory levels came down in the fourth
quarter. If you remember, in the fourth quarter we were significantly worse than seasonal. And what we saw in the
fourth quarter was a significant bleeding off of inventory, some of which we believe was in anticipation of us bringing
out Sandy Bridge. And so component inventories came down. You saw a little bit of a refill of those component
inventories in the first quarter. So the amount that it came down, probably half of that went back in, which would be us
being above seasonal.
When we go off and do our looks across the channel, we see inventory levels being healthy, and I think it really points
to the robustness of the supply chain. The people who make motherboards for notebooks brought their builds down. We
saw some older generation inventory bleed up. It looks like they're starting to ramp up now as they get into the
back-to-school season
<Q - James Covello>: Okay. I guess if I could just ask my follow-up on that then, that's a little different than the idea
that just the third-party data is wrong. Is it that the third-party data is just really off, and that's why the third-party data
is so different from your shipments? Or is it that the supply chain drew down a whole bunch of stuff and it rebuilt it
during the quarter, which is pretty reasonable?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Let me back up, Jim. The comments that I made relative to third-party data in ours were on an
annual basis, looking at year over year, trying to set the granularity for the year. And I didn't comment on the specific
comments that were written up recently on Q1, it was X% down from Q4 or X% down from year on year because that
looks at consumption, and what Stacy was talking about was our billings. And there is a bit of a difference there, at
least in the ramp up for Sandy Bridge. So it's apples and oranges.
And I think that our experience is that on an annual basis, the numbers are closer – our numbers are closer than theirs
are closer together and as they correct over the course of the year to be aligned. You saw that happen last year as we
were predicting 17% – 18% all year long. The numbers were all much lower than that, and then they came back in line
as we got to the fourth quarter.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Jim, let me just – I left out one piece as you think about Q1. So what Paul said is exactly right.
When I talk about Q1 and we're talking about the supply line impact, you also can't lose sight of the fact that for us, Q1
was a 14-week quarter. That's a piece of our shipment numbers relative to what you may be seeing from other data
sources.
<Q - James Covello>: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Thanks, a question on the foundry strategy. There's a lot of flux going on in the foundry
world, and I think TI and some other OEMs are going away from the Korean giant. What part of the incremental
CapEx is part of a strategy that you may have there that you've been not talking up? And will you talk about that over
the next several quarters? Thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: It's not a driver of our CapEx. We're interested in talking to some very specialized companies in
terms of doing foundry things. We're not building a broad-based foundry business. And it's not driving our CapEx
number.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Okay. Then if I could follow up, in terms of your next generation process nodes – over
the next couple, do you expect your performance specs, or your transistor performance, to continue to lead or expand
the leadership it has had over the past several nodes? Thanks.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Yes, we don't see any abatement in that trend of transistor performance, and that news you'll
hear in detail in a couple weeks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question; Paul, a question on the server and the data center business,
obviously very strong this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the mix between MP and DP servers? How is the
transition progress towards Westmere EX? And just in general, what's your assessment of the competition?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: After we launched the new MP server chips, the mix came up a little bit. But we're seeing
pretty robust growth in DP as well. A lot of the Internet data center growth is DP machines in some of those
configurations. On the other hand, some of our largest IDC customers are using the biggest, beefiest parts we have. So
it really is different.
I haven't seen this shift dramatically in the last couple of years. There's just a nice, consistent mix of DP versus MP. But
the capability of all the devices is really what is stunning. The amount of compute power that we're delivering per core
now is really what is delivering a lot of the value in a very power efficient envelope. So the ROI on upgrading from old
to new servers is really what is compelling both for enterprise and data center – enterprise and Internet data center.
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: This is Kevin. I would add because we made this public too, what we have seen across UP,
DP, and MP has been a mix shift within those categories. So to Paul's point, that has been one of the drivers of the
revenue growth is because the ROI is so good, we're finding the data center providers, what they're doing is they're
buying up in that stack for the ROI. So that has been a big driver.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I think a good example of that...
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: To the higher bin split.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Yes, to the higher bin split. And a good example of that was this quarter, we brought out UP
versions of Sandy Bridge, and that caused a pop-up in that segment of our business.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Got it. And as a follow-up, I think it's obvious that one investor question has been when will we
start to see Intel make more tangible progress on the mobile side? And the question there is that – so first, when will we

start to see that progress? What kind of metrics should we track? And conceptually, what do you think will be x86, the
architecture's differentiation versus the established ARM ecosystem? There are a lot of very strong players like
Qualcomm, TI, NVIDIA, and others. Thank you.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I'm not going to give you more granularity on mobile than I gave already in the earlier answer,
Vivek, so sorry to disappoint you there. Watch those things as they come out. Our customers will announce the design
wins when they are through their interoperability testing or entering it when it becomes visible, and I don't want to add
more to that.
In terms of x86 versus ARM, it is not just about the core as much as we would like it to be, and I guess as much the
ARM guys would like it to be. It's about the core, the overall capability of the system-on-chip, the things you put
around it, the graphics, the comm subsystems, the media processing subsystems, and the overall power envelope
relative to the performance that you can deliver of the SoC.
So the Intel advantage that we see going forward is the combination of a very robust computer architecture that can
scale, the ability to bring on very high performance graphics and media processing, and now a wide array of comm
architectures that we can bring in, and taking advantage of the world's best silicon. When you add those together, I
think it gives us a very strong value proposition in this market.
I'd also point out that all of the major operating systems in phones, in smartphones, are written at a high level such as
they're cross-platform and portable. And so it is easier for people to move from ARM to Intel or ARM to ARM than it
has been in the past in the Windows world.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: All right, great. Thanks and good luck.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yes, good afternoon, guys, and congratulations. Paul, going back to your opening comments
about weakness in consumer client for U.S. and Europe, what do you attribute that to? Do you think this is tablet
cannibalization, poor macroeconomic, Win 7 difficult compares? And I guess more importantly, do you think Sandy
Bridge has enough brand recognition to drive a recovery in that market? Or how do we think about that for the balance
of the year?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I think it's a little bit of everything, plus you mentioned Win 7 saturation for consumers, the
tablet things, and macroeconomics. I think it's a little bit of each of those, John, but I'd add one more, which I think is a
big one. Remember, in 2009 and the first half of '10, during the depths of the recession, the consumer notebook market
worldwide, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, was very strong, and it was strong contrary to GDP at the
time. Remember, GDP was going south and consumer sales were going north. And I think what happened is that people
bought a lot of machines in that timeframe and that were still just early in the cycle. So those machines are one and a
half years old or less.
And so seeing a consumer refresh right now probably isn't on average what you're going to see in mature markets
because this is not like emerging markets where people are buying their first machine. This is a mature environment
where people are buying a new machine when they decide they need to upgrade or whatever. Now clearly, some tablet
cannibalization is impacting that, but I think the bigger one is the macroeconomics and the prior cycle.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: And then, Paul, as my follow-up, talking about the enterprise client market, that has been a
relatively strong market. If you had to characterize what inning you thought we were in for the enterprise upgrade, what
would you say? And I guess, now at what point do we have to start worrying about that refresh being done?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Top of the fourth, three on, no outs.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
<Q - Shawn R. Webster>: Yes, thank you. In terms of the client business, I was wondering if you could give us a
flavor of what your units did sequentially, parsing out between desktop and notebook growth sequentially, and what
your outlook is for Q2.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Certainly not at the level of granularity you're asking the question, but I can give you a sense.
From the standpoint of client shipments, you'd say slightly above seasonal once you net out the 14th week. And again,
it comes back to my answer to Jim Covello's question, which is what we saw was an inventory burn in Q4 and a partial
refilling in Q1, and that led to units being slightly above seasonal. Going into Q2, you net out the impact of a full
quarter of acquisitions with the lack of the 14th week, and you'd say Q2 looks pretty seasonal.
<Q - Shawn R. Webster>: Okay, thank you. And then given the CapEx growth that you're seeing, I was wondering if
you could give us a sense of what you expect your total wafer production globally to do – to grow in calendar '11 and
calendar '12? Is it consistent with your PC outlook, or is it something that's different from that?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Wafers, over time, on in-generation will grow a little bit faster than the TAM because of the
phenomenon of what I said of we're moving more capabilities to in.
And then I think your follow-up question to that should be so okay; what happens if we get that wrong? If we're wrong
on the demand, how do we respond to the market? And I'd point back to the capability we have to very quickly roll
forward capacity from one generation to the next, and I think you saw that from us in 2009. When the bottom fell out of
the market, we were able to bring our CapEx number way down, offset over half of the 32-nanometer investment by
repurposing equipment we had already purchased for 45-nanometer. So if we overestimate, we can respond within a
couple of quarters and get gross margins back up into the healthy range pretty quickly.
The flip side is if we underestimate, it takes us two years to recover, and that's a devastating financial impact on us. So
we look at this as being a pretty – it's a high ROI investment for us, and we have the tools to modulate it if it comes to
that.

<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Yes.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I don't think it has to happen. Our forecast that we're building the year around assumes that we
have a seasonal year from the point we're at in Q1, so it doesn't assume that there's a big change at this point in time.
Could we handle one on the upside? Absolutely, but we don't need to – we aren't building that into our numbers.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Okay, that's helpful. And then to follow up, in the past, you've sometimes quantified the number
of tablet design wins that the company has. Can you be specific in that regard? And related to that, is there a particular
OS flavor, whether it's MeeGo, Android, or Windows where you think you'll be particularly successful at least with
your initial wave of launches?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I don't have an update simply because I didn't hear the final number from IDF, and we'll do
another number count at COMPUTEX. Actually, we'll do another number count on May 17th for the analyst meeting.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: 35.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: 35 or so? It's in that range. It hasn't changed. My sense is the bulk of the units, the SKUs this
year, will be Android.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Great, good luck with it. Thanks, guys.
<A - R. Kevin Sellers>: Thanks, Craig.
Operator
Thank you, and our final question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Citadel Securities.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Yes, hi, good afternoon, guys. First question, Stacy, your comment on the unit costs in Q2
going up because of substrates and the pull-in on the ramp of the China factory, is that transient relative to the chart you
put up at your Analyst Day where you were expecting a bump down initially in Q2 and then a bigger bump down in
Q3? How does that chart change?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Q2 is clearly elevated from what I put up at the Analyst Day, and then you'll see a pretty rapid
decline back towards trend over Q3 and Q4. And you can see that if you look at the just gross margin trend, we're 61%
– this is on a GAAP basis. The annual number is 63%, so that would suggest that the second half is back up towards the
mid-60s%, 65%, and you've got a couple of tailwinds there. One is the abasement of startup costs. We start on the trend
where they start falling off starting in Q3. And our costs get a little bit better as we go into the second half of this year,
consistent with what I showed at the investor meeting.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Okay. And my follow-up question was on startup costs, so there was a point and a half impact
in Q1, and then a similar impact in Q2. I guess my question is, is the impact a little similar in Q2 because it was lower
in Q1? Because again, I think the profile was up in Q1 and Q2 per your initial expectations. But I thought the increase
in Q2 was going to be more modest relative to Q1, if my facts on the Analyst Day chart are correct.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, so I'm trying to triangulate in my head. It hasn't changed for the year. When I started the
year, I was expecting it to be about three points. It's still about three points on the year. So yes, I think what you're
seeing is it was a little less in Q1, a little more in Q2, and then it starts coming down. You can see it's down a point and
a half by the time we get to Q2.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I'm sorry, I just went – yes, a little higher in Q1. And yes, so what you said was correct.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Okay, thanks, Stacy.
