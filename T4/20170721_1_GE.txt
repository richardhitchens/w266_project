MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the GE second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of
Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to GE's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With us today are Chairman and
CEO Jeff Immelt, our next Chairman and CEO, John Flannery, and GE Vice Chairman and CFO Jeff Bornstein.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that our earnings release, presentation and supplemental have been
available since earlier today on our website at www.ge.com/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are
making today are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them
today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Immelt.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Matt.
GE had a solid quarter in a volatile world. Let me give you a few themes that describe the environment. The U.S. is
stable although slow growth rate. Global growth is accelerating, but resource markets remained challenging. Our top
line results are solid.

In the second quarter, our organic results were: orders up 5%; revenue up 2%; margins expanded by 10 basis points;
and industrial profit grew by 4%. At the half: orders are up 6%; revenues up 4%; margins expanded by 70 basis points;
and industrial profit grew by 11%. At the half, we reduced structural cost by $670 million ahead of plan. We generated
$3.5 billion of cash in the quarter in line with our expectations.
In the quarter, we made progress on our portfolio strategy. July, we closed GE Baker Hughes. This move significantly
strengthens our position in this sector. This is a more competitive business and position for growth. We closed LM, a
critical vertical integration move for our wind business. LM is already improving growth and margin. We remain on
track to close the sale of water in third quarter and Industrial Solutions by year end. And we see good strategic and
operational synergy with Alstom.
Overall, we have no change to our 2017 framework. John will update you on his views for 2018 and beyond later in the
year.
Our orders have been strong, up 8% year to date and 6% in the quarter. We saw strength in both equipment and service.
We grew backlog by $3 billion. We continue to see pricing pressure in oil and gas. We have slow industry with excess
capacity.
Let me give you a few order highlights that we consider most noteworthy. Aviation was up 14%, really an amazing
performance. At the Paris Air Show, we announced $30 billion of commitments, 10x our nearest competitor. Oil and
gas equipment orders grew by 50%. This includes one of the few big project deals in the industry with Eni in
Mozambique. Renewables were up 12% behind some global deals. We're gaining share in Europe. We took orders for
nine H turbines in the second quarter with 33 in backlog.
Global orders were up 11% and represented 66% of our total. 9 of 12 regions experienced growth with China up 26%,
India up 36%, and Europe up 35%. Transportation signed an LOI worth $575 million for locomotives in Egypt. Digital
orders were up close to 40%. At the half, Meridium orders were up 86% and ServiceMax orders grew by 101%.
Healthcare created a collaboration with partners for artificial intelligent solution. And in service, aviation spares grew
by 14%, military grew by 28%, and Power received a $3 billion service commitment for power plants in Algeria.
There's no doubt that we're outperforming competition in many markets and gaining share. This in time is building our
installed base for the future. With this order rate and backlog, we feel great about the 3% to 5% organic growth for the
year. Organic revenue was up 2% and margins were up 10 basis points in the quarter. Year-to-date organic revenues up
4% and margins were up 70 basis points. Service revenues up 8% year to date.
So here are some key revenue highlights. Global revenue was up 7% with growth in 9 of 12 regions. Europe grew by
15%, China by 16%, India by 35%, and MENAT by 15%. For the half, we had organic service growth in all segments.
We're gaining share with our products. LEAP has an unprecedented advantage in the market. We believe that GE has
greater than 50% share in the gas turbine market and the market for H. In wind, we're gaining share in Europe for the
first time. Healthcare closed a number of big enterprise deals for both healthcare solutions and life sciences. Our new
cell therapy business grew by 37% and our Mammo business where we've launched new products grew by 20%.
Digital revenue growth was 17% and we see this accelerating through the year.
Let me give you some perspectives on our margin performance. As I said earlier, our structural cost is $670 million
year to date with strong performance in the business and corporate. We expect to beat our $1 billion goal. We had $150
million of non-repeat items that impacted our Oil & Gas and Power businesses. Jeff will review these in the segment
reviews. We grew equipment in a few areas that are dilutive in CM rate in the short-term but open up service growth in
the long-term. These include the H and LEAP products and the Power balance of plant. This was expected and
reflected in our margin goals for the year.
In the second half, we are targeting 120 basis points of improvement to generate 100 basis points for the year. This kind
of second half expansion is typical for GE. We see sustained revenue growth and structural cost-out helping us to
achieve this goal. In all, we expect to hit the EBIT target we've discussed in the past.

For cash, CFOA was $3.5 billion in the quarter, $2 billion from capital and $1.5 billion from Industrial CFOA in line
with expectations. Here are some of the main drivers of Industrial CFOA. Net income was actually below last year due
to increased restructuring costs not covered by gains. Working capital performance was very good, up $1.5 billion from
a year ago and a $700 million improvement in the quarter. We saw improvement in receivables, inventory and
progress, which was partially offset by lower payables. Contract assets were a drag but better than the year ago.
The second half CFOA profile will be a lot like last year. We expect higher earnings. We expect to reduce working
capital by about $4 billion in the second half. Last year, this was actually more. It was about $5 billion. Contract assets
will grow at about the same level and we will benefit from timing of other items. We ended the quarter with $14 billion
of cash on the balance sheet in line with expectations and we should be within the $12 billion to $14 billion goal for
Industrial CFOA.
Now, over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff. Starting with consolidated results. Revenues were $29.6 billion, down 12% in the quarter. Industrial
revenues of $27.1 billion were also down 12%. As you can see on the right side of the page, the industrial segments
were down 2% on a reported basis but up 2% organically driven principally by the appliances disposition. Industrial
operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.28, down 45% versus the prior year driven by substantial Appliance gain in the
second quarter of last year.
We had $0.06 of restructuring with no gains in the quarter versus $0.11 of net gains after restructuring last year.
Operating EPS was $0.19 in the quarter, down from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2016. This incorporates other
continuing GE Capital activity including excess debt and headquarter runoff costs that I'll cover on the GE Capital
page.
Continuing EPS of $0.15 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net EPS of $0.13 includes discontinued
operation. The total disc-ops impact was a charge of $152 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital Exit Plan item.
GE tax rate was 13% in the quarter. We still expect the ongoing operations of the business to have a mid teens tax rate
for the year. However, the Water disposition will be a low tax transaction and will bring the overall tax rate for our
Industrial to around 10% for the third quarter and about that for the total year. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable,
reflecting a tax benefit on a pre-tax continuing loss.
We had a better cash quarter. CFOA was $3.5 billion, including $2 billion dividend from GE Capital and Industrial
CFOA was $1.5 billion in the quarter. It was up $3.1 billion from the first quarter and up substantially from the second
quarter of last year. At the half, Industrial CFOA is at $200 million usage.
We expect substantial improvement in cash in the second half driven by higher earnings, continued working capital
improvement on higher shipments, partly offset by contract assets. For the year, we are trending to the bottom end of
the $12 billion to $14 billion range on CFOA, driven by pressure principally in Power and Oil & Gas.
John and I are reviewing our capital allocation plan for the year. Dividend remains our priority. We are relooking the
$11 billion to $13 billion range on cash used for buyback based on the timing of dispositions. Year to date, we bought
back $3.6 billion of shares.
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, the Industrial segment revenues were down 2% on a reported
basis and up 2% organically. Through the half, the Industrial segment revenues were up 4% organically.
Industrial segment op profit was down 4% reported and down 1% organically. And the Industrial op profit, which
includes corporate operating costs, was down 1% reported and up 4% organically. The difference between Industrial op
profit and Industrial plus Vertical EPS year over year is driven by the effects of restructuring, the Appliance gain and
the associated tax impacts of Appliances.

Through the half, Industrial op profit of $6.8 billion is up 4% reported and up 11% organically. On an EPS basis, we've
earned $0.48 of EPS, which is $0.62 excluding the first half naked restructuring. Given our outlook on Oil & Gas and
Power, we are trending to the bottom end of the range of $1.60 to $1.70 EPS for the year.
Next on Industrial and other items for the quarter, as I said, we had $0.06 of charges related to Industrial restructuring
and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were a little more than $700 million on a pre-tax basis. This was
slightly less than we expected driven by the lower cost to execute projects and short-term timing delays on projects that
we'll likely execute here in the third quarter.
Corporate, Power, Renewables, Healthcare and Oil & Gas had the largest investments in the quarter. Restructuring
charges totaled about $500 million and BD charges were approximately $200 million, mostly related to Baker Hughes,
the LM Wind acquisition, the Water disposition, as well as the Industrial Solutions disposition and the digital
transactions. There were no gains in the quarter.
For the year, we expect about $0.25 of restructuring to be offset by $0.25 of gains from the Water and Industrial
Solutions dispositions. We're targeting a third quarter close for the Water transaction and a fourth quarter close for
Industrial Solutions. The Industrial Solutions transaction may push to early 2018, but our plan is to do $0.25 of
restructuring this year. We'll update you on deal timing as we get closer.
Next, I'll cover the segments, starting with Power. Power recorded orders of $7.7 billion, down 1% in the quarter.
Excluding the large Hassyan steam order in the second quarter of last year, orders actually grew 11%. Equipment
orders were down 1% but up 33% ex the Hassyan order. Gas Power System was up 26% on higher H turbine orders of
nine versus five last year and six HA units booked in Mexico, our first in the country. The H backlog totaled 33 units.
HRSG orders grew 100% to 10 versus five a year ago. Offsetting GPS was steam power, down 42%, with no repeat of
that Hassyan order, which totaled about $800 million. Equipment backlog grew 27% year over year.
Service orders were down 1%, primarily driven by lower AGPs in the quarter of 20 versus 24 last year and a larger mix
of light AGPs versus full scope, and by lower outages, which were down 9%. This was partially offset by growth in
installations and other upgrades. Service backlog grew 7% year over year.
Power revenues were up 5% to $7 billion. Equipment revenues were up 12%, driven primarily by Gas Power Systems,
up 17%, on higher scope balance of plant and higher HRSG shipments of 10 versus four last year. This was partially
offset by lower gas turbine shipments of 21 versus 26.
Service revenues grew 1% on distributed power services up 10%, offset by flat power services. Power services was flat
on lower outages and fewer and lighter scope AGPs, 21 versus 28, offset by higher other upgrades, which were up
42%.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 10% on higher equipment versus services, including higher balance-of-plant
volume at low margins, fewer AGPs and lower variable cost productivity, which was partly offset by structural base
costs down 7%. Lower VCP in the quarter was impacted by about $70 million of liquidated damages for delivery
delays and field mod costs of about $20 million that we don't expect to repeat going forward.
The business is finding opportunities for growth. We took nine H turbine orders in the quarter. We also booked the
largest services deal in the history of the business, the $3 billion Algeria deal with Sonelgaz that included 68 AGPs.
This showed up in backlog, not orders in the quarter.
However, we're planning for a down market this year. We expect the power market to see demand for about 40
gigawatts of power this year, down about 10%, consistent with what we said in March. We are also planning for a
down market in 2018. We expect to ship 100 to 105 gas turbines in the year, no change in that outlook. We believe that
we have a technology advantage relative to competitors and we're gaining share. Having said that, the market is very
competitive, and overcapacity of new product introductions will continue.
For services, we expect 2017 outages to be down about 4%, driven by F-class major outages, which we think will be
down about 9%, as a result of lower utilization, lower capacity payments, particularly in North America, and extended

intervals between outages. This is softer than we expected coming into the year.
We are targeting total upgrades to grow and AGPs to total between 155 and 165 for the year. However, we've got a risk
of 20 to 30, driven by timing of large second half AGP deals that are yet to be agreed to. For the first half, the business
is up 10% on revenues and higher by 7% on operating profit, with margin rates down 50 basis points. Power has taken
over on $143 million of structural base costs to date, and we're continuing to work additional actions on costs for the
year.
Next is Renewables. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, up 2% reported and down 2% organic. Onshore wind
orders of $1.7 billion were down 5%, driven by lower repower orders and services. Onshore equipment orders were
higher by 4% on strong international wins. The number of units ordered was 567 versus 637 last year, down 11%, but
the megawatts grew 12% on larger machines.
Hydro orders of $250 million were up 38%, and LM had $80 million of orders in the quarter. Revenues were $2.5
billion, up 17%, up 13% organic. Onshore revenues grew 12% and Hydro grew 79%. Onshore was driven by the
repowering product that we introduced last year. Wind turbines shipped totaled 757 versus 856 last year, down 12%,
but the megawatts shipped grew 8%.
Operating profit of $160 million was up 25%, driven by repower volume, better product costs, and foreign exchange,
partly offset by price. Margin rates improved 40 basis points.
The wind market continues to be very competitive. Product cost-out is absolutely imperative. The team has made
progress on the 2-megawatt platform and need to execute the same on the 3-megawatt turbine as we begin to deliver
that machine. LM will be critical to drive cost and differentiation going forward. This business is on track for
double-digit growth and improved margin rates for the total year.
Next on Aviation, the market continues to be robust. Global passenger RPKs grew 7.9% year to date through May, with
strong growth on both domestic and international routes. Air freight volumes have been very strong as well, going up
over 11% May year to date, and load factors globally are above 80%.
Orders in the quarter totaled $7.3 billion, up 14%. Equipment orders grew 11% and services grew 15%. Within
equipment orders, commercial engine orders grew 35% to $1.9 billion on higher LEAP, GE90, and GE9X orders.
These orders did not include any of the Paris Air Show announcements we made.
Military equipment orders of $292 million were down 48%, driven by no repeat of an order last year for 212 T700
helicopter engines. Service orders grew 15%, as I mentioned, with commercial services higher by 16% on strong spares
growth of 14% to $21.6 million a day and strong military services growth of 14%. Backlog finished the quarter up 2%
to $159 billion.
Revenues in the quarter were flat at $6.5 billion. Equipment revenue was down 16%, driven by commercial down 15%
and military down 39%. Commercial engine shipments were lower by 10% on fewer legacy engines, partly offset by
higher LEAP volume. The business shipped 93 LEAP engines in the quarter. Service revenues grew 13% on higher
commercial spares, up 14%, and good military performance, including our military spares.
Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 11%, primarily driven by higher service volume and base cost productivity
which more than offset the negative LEAP margin. Margins were 210 basis points higher in the quarter. At the Paris
Air Show, we announced $31 billion in orders and commitments, including new engine commitments totaling $21
billion and services up $10 billion. None of these announcements were booked into orders in the second quarter.
In additive, we announced the development of the world's largest laser powder machine targeted to the aerospace
segment. We also announced a partnership with Stryker to provide machines, material and services for their global
supply chain operations.
The LEAP engine continues to perform to spec with 62 aircraft flying today. The business is on track to ship 450 to 500
LEAP engines this year. The business has executed well in the first half. As LEAP shipments accelerate in the second
half, we expect that margins to be pressured and still expect total year margin rate to be roughly flat with 2016.

Next, on Oil & Gas, we closed the combination of our legacy Oil & Gas business with legacy Baker Hughes on July 3.
The new company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BHGE. In September, Lorenzo and his
team will give you an update on the outlook for the new company and their progress on integration and synergies.
Today, we will discuss only the results of GE's legacy Oil & Gas business and not the results of legacy Baker Hughes'
business.
The Oil & Gas environment remains challenging. Our legacy business sees some improvement in activity, but we have
not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments. Oil prices remain volatile, and as a result, our
customers remain cautious. As we have said previously, we expect shorter cycle activity to increase in the second half
of the year. So far, these improvements are trending below expectations.
Orders in the quarter of $3.2 billion grew 12% versus last year and grew 14% organically. The equipment book-to-bill
ratio was 1:1 for the first time in the better part of two years. Equipment orders totaled $1.4 billion, up 50%. Every
business segment grew. Subsea was higher by 177% on orders in Brazil and the Eni Mozambique Coral project.
Turbomachinery was up 14%, also driven by the Eni Coral scope, and service orders grew 57% on strength in the
Middle East.
We had terminations in the quarter totaling $542 million, driven predominantly by one project scheduled to deliver
beyond 2018. Service orders were $1.8 billion, down 6% on softer markets, driven by turbomachinery down 13%,
surface down 11%, Subsea down 6%, partially offset by strong performance by digital solutions which grew 6%. Total
backlog ended the quarter at $20 billion, down 12% versus last year.
Revenues of $3.1 billion were down 3% versus last year. Equipment revenue was down 8% driven by Subsea down
31%, which more than offset growth in surface up 12% and turbomachinery up 3%. Service revenues were flat year
over year. Operating profit of $155 million in the quarter was down 52%. Performance was driven by unfavorable price
and negative variable cost productivity that more than offset sourcing and structural cost-out.
On variable cost productivity, I've put the impacts in two categories. First, we had two big one-time items: rework on a
non-recurring issue related to a single contract totaling about $30 million and a write-down of obsolete inventory for
about $25 billion.
Second, lower volume impacted both overhead absorption and supply chain benefits. We also had $25 million of
integration costs in the business in the quarter. As the market recovery has been slower and more volatile than we
planned, the performance of the business in the second quarter was below expectations. Customers are delaying
purchasing for both larger projects and shorter cycle OpEx activity.
Given the slower market activity, we expect the numbers in the second half for legacy GE Oil & Gas to be lower than
previously anticipated but improved from the first half. The business is very focused on the synergy pipeline with the
integration in order to offset as much of the market pressure as possible. Beginning with third quarter results, BHGE
will release its own financial statements and hold a separate earnings call. We will consolidate Baker Hughes GE into
our financial statements less the 37.5% minority interest.
Next on Healthcare, orders of $5 billion grew 3%, 4% organically. On an organic basis, the U.S. was up 1%, Europe
was up 2% and the emerging markets grew 11%, driven by China up 18%, ASEAN up 25%, Latin America grew 5%.
The Middle East actually declined 6% organically in the quarter.
On a product basis, Healthcare Systems orders grew 3% and 4% organically, driven by ultrasound up 8% and imaging
products higher by 4%. Mammography and CT were particularly strong on the new product launches. Life Care
Solutions was flat, driven by the impact of healthcare reform uncertainty in the U.S. market. Our Life Sciences business
grew orders 5% organically with core imaging up 8% and bioprocess up 5%. Revenues in the quarter of $4.7 billion
grew 5% organically. Healthcare Systems grew revenues 5% organically and Life Sciences grew 8% organically.
Operating profit was up 6% in the quarter to $826 million, driven by volume and productivity partially offset by pricing
programs for product cost reductions. Margins improved 30 basis points in the quarter. We expect the second half
performance to be similar to the first half, with low to mid single-digit revenue growth with stronger operating profit

growth. The business is executing well and will continue to simplify its structure to drive lower product cost.
On Transportation, North American car load volume continues to improve off a low base. Car load volume grew 7.3%
in the quarter driven by intermodal, higher by 5.6% and commodity car loads up 9%. Commodity car load growth was
driven by export coal up 18% and agriculture up 10%, partially offset by petroleum down 4%. Despite improving
trends since mid-2016, over capacity remains with park locals around 4,000 and very little investment appetite from
U.S. customers.
Orders in the quarter of $830 million were higher by 22% on easy comparisons. Equipment orders of $231 million
doubled on international demand for 26 locos. Service orders of $600 million grew 7% on good growth in loco parts
and mining. Revenues of $1.1 billion were down 14% with equipment down 27% and services flat. We shipped 120
locos in the quarter versus 222 a year ago with international shipments up 34% partly offsetting North America, which
was down 77%. Operating profit in the quarter was down 26% on lower volume, partly offset by cost actions.
The North American locomotive market will continue to be challenging in 2017 and 2018. We expect 2017 loco
shipments to be lower by about 50% with operating profit down double-digits as we've guided. The business is focused
on growing internationally. The business recently announced a $575 million win in Egypt for 100 locos plus services.
We expect this to book as an order in the third quarter. Executing on resizing the business to market has been ongoing
and we'll continue to evaluate additional actions if needed.
Next, on Energy Connections & Lighting, orders for the segment totaled $3 billion with Energy Connection orders of
$2.6 billion and current orders of $380 million. The Energy Connections orders were down 12% reported and down 7%
organic driven by grid down 8% on no repeat of a large Egypt order and power conversion down 14%, offset by 1%
growth in Industrial Solutions.
Revenues ex-Appliances were reported down 2% but up 2% organic. Energy Connection revenues were higher by 4%
organic on strength in grid and Industrial Solutions, partly offset by power conversion. Lighting revenues were down
9% with current down 2% and legacy down 17% as a result of the market exits and restructuring we've been doing over
the past year.
Operating profit in the quarter was $80 million, up over 400% ex-Appliances. Energy Connection nearly doubled
profits to $68 million on grid and Industrial Solutions performance and productivity partly offset by power conversion
on weak volume. Lighting earned $13 million versus a loss last year.
As announced, Energy Connections will be consolidated with Power in the third quarter which we believe will create
significant opportunity for future structural cost-out. We will provide recast data once we finalize it here in the third
quarter.
Finally, I'll cover GE Capital. The verticals earned $544 million in the quarter, up 20% from the prior year driven
primarily by higher base earnings. GECAS, Energy Finance and Industrial Finance all had strong quarters and
delivered a solid first half of the year as they execute ahead of the plan on their 2017 assets sales.
In the second quarter, the verticals funded $1.9 billion of on book volume and enabled approximately $3.9 billion of
industrial orders. Overall, portfolio quality remains stable.
Other continuing operations generated a $716 million loss in the quarter, driven by $343 million of excess interest
expense, $182 million of preferred dividend, $146 million of restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and
$45 million of headquarter runoff expenses.
Other continuing was $335 million better than last year, driven by lower excess interest and lower headquarter costs.
Discontinued operations generated $152 million loss from trailing costs and Exit Plan related items.
Overall, GE Capital reported a net loss of $324 million, 72% better than last year. GE Capital paid $2 billion in cash
dividends during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $4 billion and ended the quarter with $160 billion of
assets, including $37 billion of liquidity, down $7 billion from the first quarter.

Looking ahead, during the second half of the year, we expect lower asset sales. And as a reminder, we will conduct our
annual impairment review with GECAS in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will perform our annual cash flow
test of our runoff insurance business. We recently have had adverse claims experience in a portion of our long-term
care portfolio, and we will assess the adequacy of our premium reserves. We will update you in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, in other continuing operations for the second half of the year, we continue to expect incremental tax benefits
associated with recovering a portion of the Exit Plan tax costs we incurred.
With that, I'll turn it over to John.
John L. Flannery
Thanks, Jeff. I just wanted to give you a quick update on our transition process.
As you know, my official start date is August 1, and we had indicated earlier that I'd be doing a full review of the
company and be back to investors in the fall with my views. We're on track with this process. I'm in the middle of a
series of deep dives into each of the businesses, looking at everything you would expect. What is the market outlook?
Where can we grow? Where can we improve margins? How is the cash conversion? What returns are we getting on
investments? For example, next week, we'll be visiting our Power and Aviation businesses.
We're also taking a hard look at our corporate spending, going through a zero-base budget exercise on all of our
functions and making sure 100% of our GE store outlays are accretive to the overall results of the company.
In addition to the business reviews, I want to repeat the process I used in Healthcare to really get out and listen to what
people are thinking, good and bad, about the company. I always start with customers and employees, but it's also
important to get the view of our government partners and especially our investors. I was out with Matt Cribbins last
week, and we saw about 100 different analysts and portfolio managers, and we'll be doing more of that over the next
couple of months. There's a lot of positive feedback from these listening sessions but also plenty of suggestions on
ways we can improve.
This is all leading to a report out in November. Our main focus then will be translating the business assessments into
our thoughts on cost-out and capital allocation choices as well as reframing our look at 2018 and beyond. I'm really
excited to get started officially on August 1 and look forward to our ongoing dialogue.
So, Jeff, back to you to wrap.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, John.
Overall, we have no change to the framework, but there are puts and takes in each area. We see the key elements of
earnings to be on track, 3% to 5% organic growth and 100 basis points of margin enhancement. We have pressure in
Power and Oil & Gas but will outperform on structural cost-out. We've set a target of $17.2 billion for Industrial EBIT,
and we expect to hit it even with those headwinds. Jeff discussed the impact that additional pressure from the resource
sector could have on the EPS range earlier.
We expect to hit $16 billion to $20 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions. We still expect to have solid Industrial
CFOA, between the $12 billion to $14 billion, again, somewhat dependent on the resource sector. Our dispositions are
taking longer than expected, but we hope to close both in the year. I expect John to take a fresh look at capital
allocation, but GE will always have a strong commitment to the dividend.
Let's take a bigger picture view of the company. We've created a very strong position in Power, Healthcare, Transport,
and Resources, big industrial segments. We don't like the current Oil & Gas cycle, but our business is significantly
improved and will prosper if the cycle recovers. We're gaining share in most of our markets with $327 billion of

backlog. We have a leadership position in the Industrial Internet and additive manufacturing, two growth areas and
drivers of industrial productivity. In a volatile global economy, our Industrial EBIT plus the earnings from our GE
Capital verticals should be about $19 billion and again generate between $16 billion and $20 billion in free cash flow
plus dispositions, so a pretty good performance in a volatile environment.
I know John Flannery can improve on this. John is off to a great start, and I look forward to working with him.
Matt, now over to you for some questions.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Thank you. With that, let's open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hey, my question would really be on the CFOA for the year coming in at the lower end of the
$12 billion to $14 billion guidance. It sounds like that's mostly Power and Oil & Gas. So I wondered if you could give
us some transparency around what is the cash conversion or free cash flow margin like in those two businesses in 2017.
And when you think about their cash flow performance this year, how much do you think it's weighed down by
short-term one-time factors? In other words, how quickly do you think it can spring back to an acceptable level of cash
flow in those two businesses?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Julian, so we expect the Power business to deliver positive CFOA in the year for sure as
well as Oil & Gas. And we actually expect Oil & Gas to have, relative to the environment they're operating in and how
we see their second half, reasonably good performance around CFOA for the year for Oil & Gas. So the Power
business is going to be something like 50% to 60% conversion in the year. Other businesses will be higher. Healthcare
will be closer to 100%. Aviation will be quite good. But I would guess that Power is going to be somewhere between
50% and 60% conversion for the year.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would also add, Julian, we're doing $2 billion of cash related to restructuring. A lot of that's
in the Power sector. I know none of us expect that to repeat in 2018. So that's some natural tailwind, let's say, in terms
of CFOA in 2018.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So why don't I walk from the first half to the second half a little bit in terms of how we're
thinking about it? There's no doubt that we have a big second half to deliver on cash, and that's similar to where we
were last year.
Relative to the first half, there are really three big drivers. One, we've got higher earnings in line with our volume, our
cost-out profile and gains versus restructuring. In the first half, we had a $0.14 headwind. In the second half with the
gains, we'll offset that $0.14 headwind and have a $0.14 offset in earnings. We'll have significantly better working
capital performance, although I think we feel pretty good about the second quarter. We generated $700 million of
CFOA in the second quarter from working capital, and that was almost $1.5 billion better than where we were the
second quarter of last year. And I think importantly, within that was a couple hundred million of inventory
improvement, which I don't think we've ever realized on in the second quarter of any year in recent history.

Page 10 of 15
As we look to the second half, the working capital will get better, largely driven by inventory, a bit by payables, and
we'll have some receivables improvement. And that's consistent with where we were last year. So working capital last
year we improved in the second half better than $5 billion. We're not anticipating $5 billion. We're looking more at just
under $4 billion of improvement this year. So we think we've executed before. We can execute again in a similar way.
And lastly, on contract assets, we still expect contract assets to be a cash usage in the second half, but not nearly the
rate that we saw in the first half. And we expect it to look very similar to the change in contract assets in the second
half of last year, which was about $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion.
So, if you look at second half cash flow versus 2016, we delivered $11 billion of CFOA in the second half of last year.
We need to do about $1 billion more this year, which is primarily a function of earnings. And we expect working
capital to be about $3.9 billion better in the second half, so the total improvement for the year of about $3.3 billion.
And that's less than the $5.1 billion of working capital improvement we had in the second half of last year.
As I said, contract assets to be a little bit of a drag in the second half, but in line with where we were in the second half
of last year. And I'd say lastly, other operating, all the other elements of cash flow will be better in the second half than
the first half and will be better substantially versus 2016. So that's kind of how we think about going from first half to
second half.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'd also say, Jeff, in 2016, we ran the place with a couple $3 billion less working capital.
We're going to do the same thing in 2017. But I think the team, there's a lot of juice in us left and I think we have every
expectation that we're going to be able to continue to reduce the amount of working capital that's needed to run GE in
the future.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good morning, guys. Jeff Immelt, good luck as you move on.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew. Hey, thanks, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Sure. So could you give us a little more color on what you're seeing in Power? You
mentioned trending toward the bottom of your EPS range for the company, I think despite a lower tax rate. And then to
Power specifically, is services overall just a tougher market than you'd thought? You talked about the delays you were
seeing in services. But how much of the Power weakness would you say is execution related and how much
low-hanging fruit does Russell have to improve delivery timing and overall execution in the business?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So I guess I'll start. Others can weigh in. I would say, generally, I think the units market
on the equipment side is more or less what we thought it would be. We said we saw a 40-gigawatt market down 10%.
In that context, we said we thought we'd take orders for 85 to 95 units in the year. We still think that holds. We've got
about 39 units through the first half. We said we thought we'd ship 100 to 105. We think that's still a reasonable
expectation. And we talked about the gas turbine business, the units business, turning around profitability from the
launch last year to this year. And we still expect that holds true.
I think on the service front, I think it definitely is softer than we thought. When you look at outage volumes. We
thought outages were going to be down mid single-digits. Right now, it looks like, particularly in the gas space and on
the bigger F-class outages, we're running about 9% down year over year. That's partly driven by utilization. It's partly
lower capacity payments. It's partly extending intervals between outages. But that feels softer. So the transactional
business, which is 50-plus percent of the business, that feels softer than where we came into the year.
But I'll put a little bit in perspective. I think having said that, through the first half, revenues in the business were up
10%. Operating profit was up 7%. There was definitely some execution there. I talked about $90-plus million of LDs
and a field mod that we had to do. We don't expect those to continue. The $70 million of LDs were really around 3
launch H units where we took a little bit of risk on schedule and commissioning not having been through the process.

Page 11 of 15
And it took us a bit longer to get there. We feel like we're absolutely on track on the balance of the H commitments. So
we don't expect the LDs to continue.
And then when you think about total year, we still think about the Power business being up mid single-digits on
revenue and up roughly high to low double-digits on earnings. I just think that in the backdrop of everything we've got
in front of us here, that it does feel softer. The business still thinks they're going to do 155 to 165 AGPs in the year, but
I think the mix of light AGPs versus full scope AGPs is a higher – the mix to light is heavier than we probably
anticipated coming into the year.
And then I talked about in that estimate on AGPs, we have some risk. We've got some really big deals in the second
half that could put 20 to 30 of those units at risk. I'm not telling you the business doesn't think they're going to deliver
them. I'm just highlighting for you there could be a risk there. So, definitely, services softer than maybe we came into
the year with. I think the units business is more or less as expected. And it's gas outages on the service side, lower
steam and boiler work on the outage side in services, but overall, if we can get to a year that's kind of up mid
single-digits on revenue and high single-digits to low double-digits in op profit, everything else being equal, not too
bad.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I would add to that, Andrew, as you put the Energy Connections business together with
the Power business, you're going to look at a funnel of maybe another $1 billion of structural costs you can take out of
the combined business rolling into 2018. So I think, add to Jeff, there's probably close to $100 million that shouldn't
repeat that we should have done better in the quarter. I think the profile for the year is still going to look attractive for
the segment. And I think the team has a nice cost where it's developing a good cost plan going into 2018 that I think
should create a buffer against the market.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: There is both an opportunity and a necessity to restructure the cost structure of this
business given the market that we're operating in. And I expect that the business on their structural cost commitments is
going to overperform in 2017. And as Jeff just talked about, we're building a plant around something close to $1 billion
of structural cost outage as you move to 2018.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we have Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning. Jeff Immelt, good luck and thanks for all your thoughts and
insights over the years. Much appreciated.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Jeff, you and I have done this a long time. I'm going to miss you and I look forward to
having a beer with you as a citizen someday, as a civilian.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: I would like to do that, definitely. Just on cash flow, I guess maybe, perhaps, for Jeff
Bornstein. The first half obviously came in short of what you thought. You thought you would kind of equal last year at
roughly $400 million. I wonder if you could also decompose what the source of that maybe roughly $600 million
shortfall was? And just your comment on share repo, are you linking the conclusion or execution of these divestitures
to your share repurchase plan? Or what variable is really driving the reevaluation of the repo? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so I think what I said on the call, and maybe I misspoke on the call, what I meant to
say on the call was we expected that CFOA in the second quarter would be substantially better sequentially from the
first and substantially better than the second quarter of last year. I didn't mean to say that we would be flat year over
year. I think, generally speaking, at a $1.5 billion, $1 billion of CFOA, we felt pretty good about that.
Would we have liked to have been a bit higher? Sure. But I thought the inventory performance was pretty good. The
receivables performance was pretty good. Payables were a use in the quarter, maybe a little higher than we expected,
but that's partly driven by the cost-out that's happening and the inventory improvement. So I think that at $1.5 billion,
that was reasonable performance and it puts us pretty close to where we were to the half.

Page 12 of 15
You're right, we're down $600 million year to date, year over year, but that was included in the context of how I kind of
walked you from how we think about going from the first half to the second half for the total year and what that means
for working capital and other cash flow improvement we expect to see. On repurchase, I think our share buyback has
always been predicated on dividends from GE Capital and the dispositions. So no change in there.
I think that there's a risk that Industrial Solutions won't happen in the year. It's hard for me to exactly handicap, but I
think there's at least an equal probability that it will happen in the first quarter of 2018 as it will happen in the fourth
quarter of this year. As I mentioned earlier, we feel pretty good about the fact that Water will get to a closing here in
the third quarter.
So, having said all of that, I think as part of John's relook about what we're doing, I think John wants to go back and
rethink about how we think about capital allocation in the company. And embedded in that obviously is how we think
about share buyback. And so we're being open objective and John wants to take a look at it and really work through
with the team, with the right way forward us and what the right alternatives are.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Can I add something?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, go ahead.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, I hate to be a broken record, but Jeff, there's $2 billion of cash associated with
restructuring in 2017. That's probably $500 million or $600 million more than 2016 and that should mainly not repeat
going into 2018. So that's in these numbers.
And I would just echo what Jeffery said about capital allocation, what John should do. The only other context I'd give
you though is that everybody here prioritizes the dividend at a very high level and I just don't want anybody to ever be
confused about that in the context of GE, what we do, how we do it and whoever CEO is, how we think about that as a
context.
I was here the day we cut the dividend. It was the worst day of my tenure as CEO and the dividend is really, I think,
incredibly important for investors and for the team.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Just one point of clarification on the restructuring cash. So, yeah, we'll probably spend
slightly more than $2 billion in cash on restructuring in 2017. Everything else being equal, I'm trying to avoid giving
you 2018 guidance here before John's gone through the framework, but we would expect to spend substantially less
than that in 2018, but it won't be zero. There will be projects we do in the third and fourth quarter that will have cash
that spills over into 2018.

<A - John L. Flannery>: Listen, we're going through a process that we've laid out for you guys. It's a substantial
process in a large company that takes a commensurate amount of time. I'd say Jeff and Jeff have laid out a framework
for the year already, so there should be no change in thinking around that. And then we're spending a lot of time
internally with the team, so there's no risk of limbo inside the team. I actually start August 1, but there's a lot of
interaction already. So I'm not worried about internal paralysis, if you will, and you have our outlook for the year. So
look forward to a robust discussion in November about the company and not worry that we're going to be dead in the
water in the meantime.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I think, Deane, the teams are still executing against their AEIP plans, their LTIP plans.
There's a ton of operational focus inside the company that investors can count on while John is going through his kind
of an over-the-top review.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I would just, if you don't mind, John, I would just add. It's an enormous company. It's
complex. We want to reground, rebaseline everything we do in this company, how we do it, the value of the GE store,
how it creates value in our franchise. That's a big, big body of work as well as understanding portfolio and John getting
deep on and developing his own views about what we're going to invest against, what we're not going to invest against,
et cetera.
So I understand the point completely, Deane. I just think that's a meaningful body of work. And I think when John gets
up in front of investors and shares his views, we want that to be absolutely as well informed as possible. So I just think
it takes that amount of time. But I understand your point between now and then there will be a lot of people speculating
on how John might come out on some of these things.

Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Jeff, thanks for all the work over the years. I look forward to work with your successor.
Thank you very much. Just a question on Power, the outlook for 2018, just talking about lower and thinking about
Siemens's commentary, is it cyclical or is something structural going on in terms of outlook for Power?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I think, Andrew, if you look at a macro study like IEA or BP's study of the industry
and things like that, these would show slow but steady increases in the evolution around natural gas really for the next
20 years in terms of additions to capacity and things like that. And you can triangulate that against whatever your
assumptions might be on accelerating penetration of solar, reduction of nuclear. There's a whole series of things over
the next 5 or 10 or 20 years. But I think what's clear is with the ongoing outlook for the cost of natural gas, gas turbines
and gas power generation are going to be one of the staples of the future of the industry.
Now does that mean 50 gigawatts instead of 40 gigawatts in the short term? I don't think any of us are that smart.
You've got places like Saudi Arabia that used to be the biggest gas turbine market that have been slower over the last
couple years. They're going to need capacity. What does China do vis-à-vis their environmental issue? There are
probably five markets that matter that would make it more on the upside. But I actually think there's a fit for the gas
market going forward.
That being said, I don't think there's any benefit to Jeff or John or to Russell [Stokes] now to be overly bullish about the
near-term dynamics around the industry. But at the same time, I think somewhere in the 40-ish area is pretty much
where I would think about the industry going forward. And then outages, as Jeff went through, this is going to be a
function of renewable mix. It's going to be a function of hot summer, cold winters, price of coal, price of gas, a bunch
of other things. But I think there's reason to believe that that number stabilizes as time goes on.

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Andrew, I think that when we get up in November, we will share our view of where we
think the Power business is going for 2018 and to some degree beyond that. We think the power market this year for
gas turbine is going to be 40 gigawatts. That's down roughly 10%. It might be down again next year. I think so far, the
businesses competitively have been in a good place. We've seen a little bit of price but we're definitely outperforming
competition on both price, orders, and share. And when John is deep in the business and develops a view with Russell
on where this is going, we'll share that in November.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think you're sitting, though, Jeff, in a year where equipment V is going be – the power
equipment V is going to be 10% or something. It's going to be high. Let's put it that way. So that doesn't spell disaster, I
don't think.

contract accounting long-term service agreements. I'm wondering if there's an update on the accounting change impact
next year and also if there's any view to somehow monetizing the LTSAs in a way that's different than the past.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So a couple things, one is I don't have an update for you today on the ASC 606 accounting
change. We are working it rigorously. When we have an update as to the impact 2016 – 2017 and really look at what
we think the impact might be in 2018, we'll share that with you. Right now, we're going through first quarter actuals
and auditing those and making sure we've got the processes in place to deal with all the changes. So I don't have any
change in guidance for you on that. I don't have an update other than we're going through the mechanics and the
process. It's pretty complicated stuff, particularly around LTSAs.
On monetization, listen, I'm – particularly where there's an interest in putting upgrades or other investment into a
contract, if there are capital market solutions to help customers do that and we're pricing for that as opposed to us
essentially pricing it, I'm wide open on that. Those structures are not simple, but we continue to explore what those
might be. We've done a little bit of it. We've done some of it for sure but mostly focused around how we think about
upgrades.
And the variable component where it's utilization based, it's very difficult to think about doing something around that.
But if you've got fixed payments embedded, like for an upgrade, that is something that we can think about doing. The
last thing I'd tell you just because – in the quarter, nobody asked, but our CMRs or LTSA gains in the quarter were
$500 million. They were $600 million in the second quarter of last year, so they're down $100 million year over year.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Okay. Thank you. And just a reminder that the replay of today's call will be available this afternoon on our investor
website. And, Jeff, to wrap up your final call.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Matt. So the first time I did this, all we did was fax a press release and that's been replaced 64 subsequent times
by this incredible work. So it shows you I've been doing this a long time or how much times have changed. I would like
to publicly thank the GE finance team led by Jeff. You guys have no idea how much work goes into this. Matt, thanks
for your great effort, but JoAnna, especially you. It's been great to work with you for so many years. And I just wanted
all of our investors to appreciate the incredible work that goes into this. We've always tried to be respectful, transparent
and honest in this process.

I'm looking across the table at Jeff Bornstein. He's got a six-inch binder. He knows every fact and everything to do with
the company. And I feel great about John Flannery and what he's going to do with the company going forward. So,
again, I'm sure I'll see many of the investors over time, but I want to use this as an opportunity to do a shout-out for the
GE team and what great work they do.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thank you.
John L. Flannery
Great.
