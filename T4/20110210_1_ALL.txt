As noted on Slide 1, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations, and actual
results may differ materially. So refer to our Form 10-K for 2009, our 10-Q for the third quarter 2010, and our most
recent press release for information on potential risks. We expect to file our 10-K for 2010 by March 1st.
Also, this discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our press release
and on our website. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available following the call. Now, Christine Ieuter
and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions that you may have once this call is completed.
Now let's begin with Tom Wilson. Tom?
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. We appreciate your continuing interest in Allstate. I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth
quarter and the year. Bob will then cover the business unit results, and Don will cover investments and our financial
position. Overall, we made continued progress on our business strategies in 2010 to position the company for long-term
growth and raise returns on capital. Let's start by reviewing the numbers on Slide 2 and then I'll provide some context
on the underlying strategies and drivers behind these results.
At the top, revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1.9% from the prior year, as actions to restore auto margins in
several large states negatively impacted growth. We generated $296 million in net income for the quarter and $928
million for the full year. Operating income fell for both periods, reflecting higher catastrophe losses, lower net
investment income, and increased frequency of auto claims, that's particularly true in New York and Florida. Book
value per share increased 14.5% to $35.32, that's compared to fourth quarter of 2009 number.
If you go to Slide 3, in Allstate Protection, we recorded an underlying combined ratio of 89.6 for the year, which was
within our outlook range of 88 to 90. We did begin to see some signs of success in our efforts to grow our auto
business, with increases as we moved throughout the year and higher business in most states – higher new business.
This resulted from our new Mayhem campaign and improvements in agency effectiveness. We were not successful in
raising customer renewal rates, so that the new business success did not result in overall growth this quarter. The
actions we took in three large states to improve auto profit margins negatively impacted the good work our agencies are
doing in raising their service levels. Our direct business, which largely appeals to the self-directed price-sensitive
customers, was up 19.8% for the year to $745 million. Overall, standard auto policies in force were down 1.5% from a
year ago and essentially flat to the third quarter of 2010. We continued fixing homeowners profitability with the
average rate and premium for the quarter up 7% from the prior year. Catastrophe losses, particularly a hailstorm in
Arizona, however, offset these gains.
In Allstate Financial, we successfully completed the "Focus to Win" downsizing, exited the bank and broker-dealer
distribution channels, and began shifting our focus to underwriting unwritten products from our traditional focus, which
was more on investment spread-based products. We also just announced our intention to wind down the Allstate Bank,
which means we expect to no longer be a thrift holding company for regulatory purposes. Operated earnings increased
for the quarter to $104 million and finished the year with positive net income. We continued to improve the growth
trajectory of Allstate Benefits, formally known as the Allstate Workplace Division. It's been very successful in
expanding in both the small and large employer markets.
In investments, our strategies were well timed and executed and generally ahead of the market. We stayed long
corporate credit and held on to the structured securities that we felt were undervalued by the market. We continue to
mitigate risk by reducing our exposure in the muni bond and commercial real estate portfolios. We did spend over
several hundred million dollars on our macro hedge programs to protect the portfolio's value if there were large
increases in interest rates or declines in equity prices. Given the substantial increase in our capital levels in 2010, we
will reduce the size of these programs in 2011. We generated a good total return on both our property-liability and
Allstate Financial portfolios for the year but did experience a 7.7% decline in investment income. The net of these
results is that we had large increase in book value per share and were able to initiate a share repurchase program in the
fourth quarter.

Bob will now take you through the operating results in greater detail.
Robert L. Block, Vice President, Investor Relations
Turning to Slide 4, property-liability net written premium fell 0.6% for the quarter and 0.2% for the year versus
comparable periods in 2009. Overall, a reduction in units was partially offset by rate actions taken. Allstate brand
standard auto net written premium finished the year with a slight increase over 2009. For the quarter, the result was a
small decline. The underlying trends were similar to prior quarters. New business application growth was flat for the
year but increased almost 8% versus the fourth quarter 2009, as you can see in the middle of the slide. Excluding a few
large states where we have taken significant profit improvement actions, new business was up 19% and 13% quarter
over quarter and year over year respectively.
Retention fell by 0.4 of a point relative to the fourth quarter of 2009, about the same level of decline we experienced in
the third quarter of 2010, and is currently at the lower end of our historical range. Overall units in force were lower year
over year but flat relative to third quarter 2010 levels. Average premium were comparable to fourth quarter 2009 levels,
resulting from a combination of higher rates in underperforming states and rate investments made in key growth states.
Moving back up to the third line, Allstate brand homeowner net premium grew just over 2% in both the fourth quarter
and the total year. We posted increases in the average premium that more than offset declines in units, as has been the
case in the last several quarters. Rate actions approved in the quarter affected 10 states, averaging 7.4%. Despite the
rate activity, retention remained slightly higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009.
A significant source of net written premium decline remains in the IA channel, where we utilize the Encompass brand.
Net written premium in total fell 17.5% for the year in Encompass as we direct our efforts to improve the overall
profitability of the business. As Encompass strategically shifts back to its core product portfolio that independent
agencies value, the decline in net written premium has begun to moderate to 10.5% in the fourth quarter 2010 versus
the fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving to a discussion of margins for the year, the 2010 combined ratio increased 1.9 points to 98.1%. About one-third
of the variance was due to higher catastrophe losses, and the balance to the underlying business. The underlying
combined ratio, 89.6, came within the outlook range of 88 to 90, as we provided you at the beginning of 2010. As we
look forward to 2011, we expect the underlying combined ratio to be within the range of 88 to 91. Remember that this
measure excludes catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates.
We recorded an all-in combined ratio of 100.8 in the fourth quarter 2010, a 7.6-point increase from the fourth quarter
2009. When you break down that 7.6-point increase in the fourth quarter, catastrophe losses account for 3.3 points of
the increase. Prior-year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, were worth another 0.4 points. And the balance, or
3.9 points, came from the underlying business, primarily from the Allstate brand standard auto, and to a lesser extent
homeowners and commercial.
On Slide 5, we provide a look at the loss components for Allstate brand standard auto – or on auto. On the left side of
the exhibit, we show the reported frequency levels for bodily injury and property damage. To simplify the frequency
charts, we averaged the 2005 through 2008 experience. The fourth quarter 2010 results followed the trends established
over the last several years, with bodily injury frequency increasing 7.7% and property damage frequency rising 2.4%
and are at their highest levels in the last six years. There continues to be upward pressure on auto frequency.
In the upper-right-hand corner, we provide the quarterly increase in paid severity for both coverages since 2004. Both
coverages declined in the quarter relative to the prior year and have performed very well over the last several years.
This offsets some of the frequency pressure.
In the lower-right-hand corner, we show the recorded combined ratio as well as the trailing 12-month results. You'll
notice the jump in the combined ratio in the fourth quarter 2010. A similar pattern occurred in 2006, 2007, and 2008. It
did not occur in 2009. The movement in the combined ratio from the third quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter 2010

was primarily the result of higher frequency levels, part of which is the underlying trend and part of which is seasonal.
The auto combined ratio also was negatively impacted by current year severities, particularly in personal injury
protection. We will factor these frequency and severity trends into our pricing actions in 2011 to protect margins.
Overall, the combined ratio for standard auto was 95.5 for the year, up 1.9 points from 2009.
On the next slide, we show similar components for homeowners. The underlying, excluding catastrophe, frequency
improved in the fourth quarter by 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter 2009, while the paid severity rose 4.1%. The
underlying loss ratio for the quarter was 47.9%, an increase of 0.7 points compared to the fourth quarter 2009. For the
year, the underlying loss ratio was 49.4%, an improvement from 2009 of 1.8 points. We will continue to drive for
improved profitability in this important line of business.
Switching to our results for Allstate Financial. On Slide 7, you see results for the top and bottom lines. Our strategy to
shift focus to underwritten products and away from spread-based products continues. We generated over $2 billion of
premiums and contract charges for the year, an increase of more than 10%. The primary driver of this increase was in
accident and health, produced through Allstate Benefits, as this division successfully acquired several large employer
accounts in 2010 and now stands as the number two player in the workplace voluntary market in terms of annualized
sales. The total premium and deposits were $4.1 billion, down from $5.1 billion in 2009, as annuities are
de-emphasized.
Looking at the profitability results for Allstate Financial on the bottom half of the slide, we generated $76 million in net
income for the fourth quarter, $58 million in net income for the year, a turnaround of $541 million from 2009.
Operating income increased to $104 million in the quarter and $476 million for the year. Remember, when you look at
these operating income results for 2010, there were several favorable items that hit in 2010, primarily in the first two
quarters, $26 million and $12 million respectively. The first quarter related to our annual DAC unlock study, and the
second quarter related to reserve re-estimates of the recovery of a disputed reinsurance recoverable.
Breaking down the operating income into component pieces, the benefit spread was favorable in the quarter, first time
this year. Investment spread was flat, as the continued downward pressure on lower interest rates and declining contract
holder funds was offset by lower interest credited in the quarter. Expenses increased in part due to non-deferred
acquisition costs emanating from the growth at Allstate Benefits. Allstate Financial made significant progress in 2010.
Income trends stabilized. The focus on shifting the mix to underwritten products is working, and Allstate Benefits
continues to generate profitable growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Don.
Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob.
Slide 8 provides a longer-term look at the composition of our portfolio and the unrealized capital gain or loss by asset
class. We came into the year with a portfolio valued at just under $100 billion and a pre-tax unrealized capital loss of
$2.3 billion. We finished 2010 with a portfolio worth just over $100 billion with an unrealized capital gain of $1.4
billion. During the fourth quarter, the unrealized position declined by $1.26 billion, driven primarily by a rise in interest
rates near the end of the quarter.
Through our focus to reduce risk and optimize returns, we continued to favor corporate credit risk under municipal and
real estate exposure. During 2010, we reduced our holdings in municipal bonds by $5.5 billion of amortized cost and
commercial real estate exposure by $2.3 billion of amortized cost. Our municipal bond portfolio went from an asset
allocation of 21% at year-end 2009 to 16% at the end of 2010. Our focus has been to lower our exposure to certain
sectors, such as appropriations debt in states and municipalities that are under budgetary stress. Our preferred segments
of Corporate and Other fixed income securities proved to have significant market returns during 2010.
Slide 9 shows trends for our portfolio yields, net investment income, and duration. We had a drop in property-liability
yields, as actions to shorten duration and reduce higher-risk exposures impacted net investment income. This resulted

from the fact that proceeds were reinvested in lower yields. The decline in Allstate Financial's net investment income
was primarily the result of reductions in contract holder funds. Overall, with rates rebounding and less risk mitigation
activity, our yields and net investment income have shown limited deterioration in the current quarter. For the year,
total net investment income was $342 million below 2009, with lower assets under management accounting for about
half of this decline. The balance of the decline came from lower reinvestment yields, offset partially by equity and
partnership dividends.
Slide 10 shows trends for our realized capital gains and losses. The fourth quarter results were a net positive $116
million, driven by derivative gains from rate hedging, sales gains, and improving limited partnership results. These
gains were partially offset by impairment and intent losses in our real estate and municipal bond portfolios. Both for the
quarter and the full year, impairment losses declined substantially from prior-year levels.
Derivative results are primarily driven by interest rate management activities, which partially offset fixed income
valuation changes. Macro hedge protection, which has struck well above market rates, protects against material interest
rate increases. Even with the rate increases in the fourth quarter, these positions remained out of the money. The losses
incurred from having this protection during a declining rate environment in 2010 was $206 million. ALM hedging and
AP's duration management programs helped maintain targeted duration ranges and are struck at current market levels,
having more sensitivity to changes in rates. While we saw gains in the fourth quarter, we incurred losses for the year, as
rates fell overall.
Finally on Slide 11, you can see our solid capital position. For the year, shareholder equity grew by $2.3 billion to $19
billion. Statutory surplus continues to be solid. Holding company invested assets grew to $3.8 billion after a $700
million dividend from AIC was made in the quarter. And as you know, the board authorized a $1 billion buyback in
November. We repurchased $160 million of the stock by year-end 2010 under that authorization, which expires at the
end of Q1 2012.
Now let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Langen McAlenney. Your
question, sir?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Oh, good morning, everyone. Your underlying combined ratio guidance, if you take the
middle of it, it's 89.5, which is roughly even with where you ended the year at 89.6. Yet you're talking about auto
holding and homeowners improving. Why would I not be modeling an improvement in underlying underwriting, if
that's your goal?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Bob. This is Tom.
First out with your – I like to see you keep your record consistent. First out with your report and first question. And
don't I remember, are you like a Green Bay fan or something?
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Yep. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Unfortunately.
Anyway. But back to your question, and a more serious note. We provide the range to give you some sense for where
we think the pace and the rhythm of the business is. It's a wider range this year than last year, specifically because of
the performance of two states, which are New York and Florida, which as you know have large personal injury
protection coverages in them as no-fault states. They have – those states, the results have deteriorated substantially in
those, and so that's a little more volatile. We believe we can fix that, so I wouldn't – we don't necessarily shoot for the
middle, the top, or the bottom of the range. That's just where we think we will end up. We will obviously shoot to get

the combined ratio as good as it can be.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Okay. Working the other way on the question, I mean, the last three quarter comparisons
were underlying slips of 1, 2, and then 4 points this quarter. So it seems like to get the underlying flat is going to take
some work. You mentioned maybe that the year-ago comparison was tough. I think that was part of your opening
remarks. But is down 4 underlying a fair state of where you are, where the base is?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah, Bob. This is Joe Lacher. I don't think that's a fair state of where we are. I think a
big part of that – and you can see it on Page 5 of the webcast when you do year-over-year quarters – is the fact that the
fourth quarter tends to be a higher quarter. Last year was abnormally low. So I think that's a bad measure to use, trying
to do the year-over-year quarters.
I think when you look at the overall number – and the blue line on there actually shows a rolling 12-month average, as
a combined ratio, sees a relative flattening over the last four or five quarters except for a little uptick in the fourth
quarter from an auto perspective, and that really comes from the New York and Florida PIP and BI issues that we're
talking about, that we're seeing move faster than we had anticipated. So our actions to improve those geographies – and
they're places where they've had those problems before, and we know how to handle them – are how we're thinking
through our numbers.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Bob, put another way, the entire
uptick in combined ratio – or not – a large proportion of that uptick in the combined ratio is in those two states.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: For the full year, the auto combined ratio went up a couple of points. A little north of
85% of that's driven by the changes in New York and Florida.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So the rest of the business is running
fine. We just got to fix those two states.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks a lot. Just a couple questions. So of the 7-point increase sequentially in standard auto
loss ratio, how much of that is the result of those two states? And if you were to back those two states out, where is the
underlying combined on the standard auto book? And just a couple follow-ups. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mike, we don't obviously give
guidance for just auto alone, and I wouldn't necessarily look at the – I think as Joe pointed out – wouldn't necessarily
look at that 7 points as the appropriate comparison. When you look at it year to year, it is up, and as Joe pointed out,
85% of it's in those two states. The rest of the states have an auto combined ratio that generates a very attractive return
on capital.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Oh – yeah, I wasn't asking for guidance. I was just asking in – if you back out those two
states, what's -
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, if you back out those two states, I
think it's about 91.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: On a full-year basis.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay. So 91 on a full-year basis for ex those two states in standard auto.

<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: Correct.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: That's what we achieved in 2010.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay. And then I just want to ask – can you talk about your decision to use an underlying
combined as a metric? Kind of going through here the last several quarters, you have this measurement that you hit
your target but yet, we kind of look at the results as the world at large looks at the results, and you see the impact, the
frictional impact of cat. Does it make sense to maybe think about putting a little bit more attention on that exposure,
maybe giving people a heads up as to what that's looking like when you're going to have meaningful exposure?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Mike, you're pointing out an
issue we've had forever in the insurance business because of the volatility. Let me tell you how we think about it, and
then I'll give you some sense for what we've – and trying to find a way to help give you and other people better
information on cats. First, if you go all the way up, as – what we expect to deliver to our shareholders are good
operational results. Second, to have the business strategically positioned for the future. And third, to make sure we have
the right management team to execute those two things. And those are the kinds of things we need and want to
communicate on.
Underneath that first bullet is obviously the issue of how much you're going to make this year or this quarter. Because
we've not been able to forecast catastrophes well, we said that the only thing we could really give you that we feel
comfortable in looking at the rhythm of business and making a judgment as to where the next year will be, was
excluding catastrophes – and then prior reserve related issues, which are – nobody factors those into their estimate.
So the issue is with the weather different, that being in – if you look at hurricanes, the water's warmer and the air is
different, and so you have much larger, much more severe hurricanes. So when the hurricanes started to hit, obviously
very difficult to forecast what your losses are after it hits, much less before the season. What's happened is you've seen
a big increase in other related weather – so tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires – because of severe weather patterns. And
those are notoriously difficult to predict. I don't think – if you had asked me, did I think we could have a $355 million
hailstorm in Arizona, I wouldn't have thought the hail could be that bad in Arizona. It obviously was. We are changing
our pricing to reflect that, which is why you see the average homeowner's premium going up 7% this year, and you
should expect to see it go up next year.
It's very difficult, though, to give any kind of forecast until the event happens. We have looked at can we give you more
information once the event happens, which is a little difficult because if we set up a structure to give it to you on the
first of the month or the fifth of the month after a month, sometimes tornadoes happen on the 30th and the 29th, and
you don't even have all the claim calls in yet. So it's very difficult, even on a monthly basis. We continue to try to find
ways to come up with better information, but yet we haven't found any silver bullet.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: I mean, one thing you just might want to consider is this storm was in October. Maybe if you
give people some idea of what this looks like, then it might help, when your earnings do come out, at least people will
have some notion, and that would just be a suggestion if you might incorporate that.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I understand. We're open to any
thoughts and help you guys can give us, because we obviously want you to know what we know when we know it.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: And then just one other one, if I could. As far as holding company liquidity, $3.8 billion of
liquidity, you had a relatively active cat quarter. You bought back some stock for the first time in some time. So how
should we think about that? I mean, you're not – it doesn't seem like the frictional cat activity is impacting your
deployment. How do we think about that part of the equation?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Capital – I would say we are long
capital. We continue to be long capital. If you look at the capital in the various insurance companies – and Don quoted
the numbers there – we are, I think it was $15.2 billion in statutory capital. We feel well capitalized and capable of

handling any volatility that comes from catastrophes, either because of the capital we have or the reinsurance programs
we have in place. When you look at the holding company, we have $3.8 billion of essentially cash or highly liquid
securities, and that is the area that we use to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and we have plenty of capital there.
Whatever happened in this quarter will have no impact on our share repurchase program. And as we look at our
models, we don't find a case in which we would not complete the $1 billion program we have out there and still have
extra capital. And we continue to generate extra capital, in part because our business is not growing as rapidly as we
would like.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Right. So – but if you have $4 billion, roughly of capital, you have less than $1 billion in
outstanding repurchase, your business is not growing. Why end the date of your buyback as 2012? I mean, do you plan
on being at $5 billion in holding company liquidity next year? Or where is that number – where do you want that
number to be?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mike, all I can tell you – here's the
way I look at those programs. One, if we don't have a use for the capital, we give it back to the shareholders, either
through dividends or through share repurchase. We've bought back about $19 billion of stock since I've been here. And
so if we don't have a use for it, we buy it back. I tend to lag a little bit so that the company is stable and we don't have
to go look for money, because the worst time to look for money is when you don't need it. When we put a share
repurchase program out there, we put it out there, one, that we will complete, because if you look at the history of share
repurchase programs, there are a number where people talk about them and then don't actually get them done. We
believe in finishing what we say we're going to do. And it was only once we weren't able to do that, which was in the
financial crisis of 2008. So we put it out there, and then we just buy it back as aggressively as we can. So when we're
done with this one, if we still have extra capital, we'll consider doing another one.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay. And you may finish it before – I mean, so there's a chance you could up before this
one expires?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. There is a chance we'd do that.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Given that we bought back $160
million of stock in 45 days. I don't know that we'll always continue at that pace, but yes.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi, good morning. First, on the frequency, and I appreciate that about 85% of the frequency
spike was in New York and Florida, but we've not seen this from some competitors. So if you could you help us
understand what happened differently at Allstate versus the competitors that you saw a higher spike in the second half
of this year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Vinay, this is Tom. I'll give you an
overview answer, and then Joe, maybe, will want to jump in and give you more specifics.
It's always difficult, of course, to compare our frequency to other people's frequency because we don't know what
happened to their business, and some of our larger competitors, such as State Farm and Geico, we actually don't see
their numbers. So there's only a few large companies that you can see, and some those companies also have change in
mix of their business. So as you write more preferred customers as a percentage of your book and less high-risk
customers, the weighted average of your frequency changes. That doesn't mean the underlying trend in your business
isn't the same when you get down and look at individual risk classes. That would be the first thing.

The second thing I would say was that the issues that we've seen in New York and Florida are not ours alone. So all
you got to do is look at the press in Florida about how much fraud's going on with PIP. Our sense is in New York,
when we look at the competitors, same thing is happening.
Joe, you might want to jump in on frequency in other parts of the company?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: Yeah, I would add to that, Vinay. I think if you look at Page 5 of the webcast, you can
see frequency trends there. The black line's 2010. The blue line's 2009. The red line, the average of the previous 2005
through 2008. 2009 and 2010 for our frequency numbers were higher than all of those prior periods. So this is not
something that pops in the fourth quarter exclusively. There's been an underlying pattern there, and I think that's
consistent with when you peel apart, the way Tom talked about, what we're hearing broadly across the environment. I
think we end up being larger and more concentrated in personal lines than some of those players, so it does this, and we
don't have the underlying mix change. But there has been a consistent trend running in New York and Florida. You can
look at rate filings. You can look at conversations in the press, conversations with insurance departments. There's a
consistency to this in the environment.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Should we be concerned at all about some adverse selection in terms of your retentions going
down and the new business that you're adding?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: I guess we always have that concern and are sensitive to it and watching it, because that's
an issue or risk you always have as an insurance company. One of the reasons we've seen new business flat – when
Tom and Bob described that new business was up outside of these states, is because we've tightened our underwriting
programs and tightened what we're allowing to come in from a new business perspective in New York and Florida, for
exactly that concern.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Second question is on the retentions. That seems to be the lowest number, I think, since 2001.
Just wanted to get a sense for what the drivers of that are. And I understand that you've been taking rates up in two
states, California and Florida, but it seems that it's the lowest ever that I've been tracking. Just want to get a sense if
there's something else that's really factoring into that number?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: There's a couple of different thoughts -- you want to – ? A couple of different thoughts
on it. We have seen these retention levels before. I think if you go back to the time periods you're talking about, we saw
some peaks two years ago, three years ago, so we're sort of operating at the low end of a range that we've operated in
historically.
Number two, the actions we've been taking in Florida, California, and New York are aggressive defense of profitability,
so it creates some disruption there. And the actions we've been taking from a homeowners perspective also add to a
little bit of that underlying disruption. So it's inside of a normal range, and we're actively trying to drive it back up to
the middle and upper end of that normal range.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Vinay, this is Tom Wilson. Couple of
things I would say is, one, it is our goal to do a better job for our customers, because this is not just a price game. A lot
of people look at insurance and think it's only about price. That's not the way the market segments, if you do a fair
amount of consumer research on it. So obviously, you also have to raise value.
We've done a good job in a number of areas, but obviously not good enough, because the number didn't go up across
the country, and that's a disappointment to us. But we have our agency loyalty scores; we track the performance of
individual agencies. That was up about 5% last year. The index was, if you look at our claim operation, they've done a
good job of increasing the amount of empathy and responsiveness they have. We have more work to do there, but it's
also about raising the value that we provide to customers as well. And so we've tried to build a set of processes and
programs in place all the way down to the – our 401(k) plan pays out based on customer loyalty. So all employees are
aware of it, and they're all motivated and compensated by it.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: And outside of those three states, how are you seeing your retentions?

<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Vinay, I'll answer that question, and

up outside of two or three large states.

Our next question is from Keith Walsh from Citi. Your question, please.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Hey, good morning, everybody. Just the first question, I think. I know in the past you've been
asked this, about how standard auto – or actions on your homeowners book, if they in fact impact retention on standard
auto. And I just wanted to ask it again, because it just seems that the trend continues there. And I've got a follow-up.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Keith. The answer is
anything you do to customers that's negative, whether that's raise their average price in the homeowners by 7% or put
new risk management programs in place so you're not writing new business and you're brokering it to somebody else if
it's in a cat-prone area, have a negative impact on you. But we try to do it in a way that is customer friendly, and if you
look at what models would say happen and what our actual results are, the actual results, we're able to manage our way
through it, so it's – usually ends up being somewhere around that 20% to 30% of what a straight-up model would show
you. So we're doing a pretty good job of managing our way through it. It does show up in the numbers, but I think that's
just, again, about showing value. I'm not prepared to have us lose money on homeowners when we have so much
capital up on it to retain the auto insurance. It's a challenge for us as opposed to an excuse.
<Q - Keith Walsh>: Okay. And then just turning to net investment income, on Page 9 of the presentation, you show
sort of a $33 million variance in property-liability and a $45 million year over year in Allstate Financial. Is that a good
run rate to think about as we head into 2011 when we think about how net investment income will probably year over
year look?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me make an overall
comment, and then Judy will give you some sense for the underlying run rate and the specific numbers.
First, there's three components to our investment income. Obviously there's volume. Second, there's lower rates. And
third is what you invest in.
When you look at volume, the size of the Allstate Financial balance sheet is down on the contractholder funds about
20% since the end of 2007. So the last three years, we've brought that down 20%. And that's obviously because of
Matt's shift to focus on the underwriting profitability versus spread base probably. So that rolls through that. It's not
necessarily a big impact on operating income, because as well as you're losing the assets, you're getting rid of a
liability. So that tends to be a little more of a margin reduction as opposed to a straight-up number that you would see
in just investment income.
Secondly, obviously, lower rates. Judy can talk to that.
And then what you invest in is obviously important as well. Since 2008, we've been focused on total return and
protecting the balance sheet, and if we didn't want to own something, we sold it despite its negative impact on
operating income. So if there was a muni bond we didn't want and it was paying a good rate, we sold it, even if that
meant we had to in the short term invest it in govi's or something like that because we said, let's just protect the balance
sheet. That focus will shift now as we go into 2011, where we'll be more focused on operating income because we're
kind of invested in what we want to be invested in now. We can start to manage income.
Judy might want to talk about both that piece and lower rates.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So when I think about, first, lower rates, the portfolio still has a higher book yield than the
market yield. Yet that has been going down as market rates have gone up. So in the last quarter, you would have seen

that our income somewhat stabilized, and that was partially because during that quarter, we actually – our reinvest was
higher. Reinvest yields were actually higher than the yields on our disposition, plus we didn't have as many dispositions
in the fourth quarter. And as Tom had said going forward, we have stabilized some of our risk mitigation programs. So
when I look at market yield versus our book yields, as I said, still our book yields are higher, yet market yields are
rising as we go into 2011.

Our next question comes from Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America. Your question, please.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Thanks. A lot of the questions have been answered, but I guess a couple still outstanding. I
was wondering if you could talk about your ad budget maybe going forward and what you're expecting to do this year
with the campaign? And then also, I know it's still not fully through the quarter yet, but to the extent you can comment,
is it fair to expect inflated weather cat losses in the first quarter? And then my last question is, you didn't really talk too
much about California. Can you give more of an update on that state?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Alison, good morning. Thank
you for getting all your questions on the table. We can speed it up this way.
First, with respect to the ad budget, let me go way up for a minute and then swoop down to the ad budget – with a
caveat that I'm not going to tell you exactly what we spend, because I care less that you know, but I care a lot if, like,
Progressive and GEICO know. So first, we decided we wanted to broaden our approach to the marketplace, make the
brand a little more contemporary, and that as we – and we were going to spend more money, and we needed a – we
couldn't continue to run just one campaign, which was the Dennis Haysbert campaign, because it wears out. People get
bored watching the same commercial all the time.
So we came up with the Mayhem concept, which is very important because it's about value. And the tagline at the end,
"Dollar for dollar, nobody protects you better than Allstate," is because we want people to understand that it's not just
about price. That's because – that campaign is really targeted towards the core group of customers that come to us,
which are personal-touch loyalists. These are people who want advice, want a local presence, want to buy multiple
things from one company, and it's a portion of the market where our – we overindex in our share. And so it makes us
more contemporary and calls into question for those people.
The contemporary piece and the kind of funny nature of it also happens to appeal to the other end of the spectrum,
which is the self-directed, price-sensitive people who are – don't really care as much about local presence. Don't want
as much advice, more willing to do it on the web and do it through the call centers. So it happens to be kind of a
one-two punch for us. It strengthens our existing programs, as well as broadens and makes us more contemporary. We
like it. It's working. If you look at our quotes and our new business, it's way up, and so we're liking the results of that.
We will continue that one-two punch, as we continue to try to serve both segments of the market with this value
proposition, but – and I would expect we'll probably spend about the same amount of money this year as we did last
year.
If you – the question on weather – who knows? It's February, whatever it is, 10th or something like that. It's been a
dicey January. The bad news is there's been all kinds of bad weather. The good news is sometimes when there's bad
weather, people aren't driving. And so then a question is, how quickly does the weather get over? Does it turn into ice
dam problems on houses, does it turn into ice on roads and then people slip and crash into everybody when they believe
that it's safe to drive. So it's really – I have no way of predicting what we'll do in the third quarter.
And then in California, Joe can answer that question.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: We're continuing to see – there was no update for California, which is why we didn't talk
about it. We're seeing comparable trends, and we're attacking them and working on them and are confident we're

And our next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Your question, please.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Thanks, and good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the decision to exit the bank product in
Allstate Financial and what that – if I go back a couple of years, Allstate also exited the variable annuity business. So
I'm trying to get a sense, is this a trend towards narrowing down the offerings within Allstate Financial, and could
Allstate maybe look to exit that business entirely over time?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me provide some longer-term
perspective, Jay, for you onto why we got into the bank, and Matt can answer it very specifically, how it relates to what
he has going forward.
We got into the banking – we got a thrift charter in 1998. It was right around Gramm-Leach-Bliley when financial
services companies were going to do everything for everybody, and we decided we should have one of those. We got it,
and we turned it into basically a savings vehicle, which was a place to put money before you rolled it into annuities or
life insurance and away. And so that business grew to about $1 billion. Matt can talk about how that concept fits in how
he's going to execute it in the future. But his conclusion, which he'll take you through with a little more specificity, was
that it was not strategic. Given that it was not strategic and it would subject the company to regulatory oversight at the
holding company level, which had the potential – and I say only the potential – to conflict with the state-based
regulatory environment we're in, we decided it was not necessary to continue to own that business.
As it relates to variable annuities, variable annuities was a different situation. We just didn't like the economics. We
thought people were giving it away. It wasn't age related; it wasn't health related. We didn't like all the features on it.
And we sold it to Pru because we didn't like the product mix. That didn't mean we didn't want to sell the product to
people, though, so we continue to sell variable annuities through our agencies and the EFSs that are just other people's.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Hey, Jay, it's Matt Winter. Thanks for the question. Let me start out by kind of explaining
what we're trying to accomplish at Allstate Financial right now, which is we're looking at it from two perspectives.
First, to add an element of financial stability and higher business returns to the business. And secondly, to focus on
adding strategic value to the corporation.
So as we looked at the first prong, the financial stability and business returns, we made the decision that in order to
decrease some of the volatility in that business's results, we needed to change the mix of business and move away from
some of the spread-based businesses and increase the proportion in our portfolio of earnings that come from mortality
and morbidity based businesses. We find that the profile of those earnings is more appropriate for where we are in this
enterprise. And so a lot of what we're doing is trying to get to a more balanced perspective in a mix of business and
slowly allow the spread-based businesses and some of the investment-related businesses to roll off while we build
mortality and morbidity based businesses, and at the same time, improving the new business and continuing business
returns. So a lot of the decisions we've made about product lines to exit has been a result of that. So that's one of the
reasons we stopped manufacturing our own book value annuities.
The issue with getting out of the banking business has more to do with the second prong, which is the strategic value.
Once we stabilize the organization financially, we want to make sure we're focused on adding strategic value to the
enterprise, which we think we do in one of two ways: by either bringing new customers to Allstate or by helping
existing customers develop a deeper relationship with Allstate. And the products that tend to do that best are the
longer-term products, the mortality and morbidity based products that last for five-, 10-, 20-, 30-year products, they
tend to change the nature of the relationship from a transactional relationship to a longer-term relationship. And as a
result, as we look at the product we want to manufacture and offer, we want to concentrate on those products that will
add the greatest strategic value to the enterprise and the customers.

The banking products tend not to do that. They're quasi-transactional; they're shorter term in nature. And they don't fit
within our overall strategic and financial objective of growing mortality, morbidity based business and entering into
long-term strategic relationships with the customers. That, in addition to the regulatory issues Tom mentioned, led me
to the decision to recommend to the corporation that we exit that. We'll still offer those products to our customers. We
still believe in the ability to deepen the relationship a little bit with that, but it doesn't necessarily have to be with a
product that we manufacture.

And our next question is from Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Hi, good morning, everybody. A couple questions. One, just if you change the hedging
in 2011 versus 2010, can you talk a little bit about where that cost reduction will actually show up, how much is
balance sheet versus income statement related? And then the second question I have is with respect to – just as you
think about 2011-2012 and rather than strategic factors, just maybe think about what do you think the most important
operating factors are, excluding the loss ratio ex cats and development that you're kind of focused on to measure
progress this year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Matt, let me – on the macro
hedging programs, that will go through realized – largely goes through realized capital gains or losses, which shows up
not in operating income obviously but in net income. And then obviously that translates into book value per share. So
that's how the math of that piece works.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: On the interest rate swaps, if there was -so that actually – okay. And including the
make whole or make -
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That goes through realized gains or
losses, yeah. We don't -
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Okay.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That doesn't get rolled up into
investment income.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: Okay.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And – which makes tends to – makes
sense because what you're trying to do is protect the balance sheet. You could argue about whether it ought to be
marked to market and go through realized or not, given that some other stuff doesn't go through realized. But that's a
battle for the accountants to fight, not for us.
Secondly, I'm going to interpret your question broadly and then come back to the specific things that we're focused on
for this year. So first, I think the thing you and other shareholders and analysts at the company should be looking at is,
one, how are we doing operationally, and two, how are we doing strategically, and three, what's our team look like and
how are they performing? When you look at operational results, we obviously need to improve our auto results in New
York and Florida, so it's something that I'm spending time looking on, Joe's working hard on getting that team
organized to drive the results. We do need to grow the rest of the country, but I am prepared to not grow if that means
we have to give up too much margin in Florida and New York. So everybody wants us to look at the commodity ratio
and growth. I'm just telling you how I think about those two with some sort of components down below it.
We obviously need to continue to – improving the homeowner business. I think we made good progress on it this year,
but we have more to go there. At Allstate Financial, we need better integration into the Allstate agencies, so our

cross-line sales need to be going up, as well as our workplace business needs to continue to grow. That business has
really grown rapidly. It's a hidden gem under there, which nobody really wants to talk about much, but it is a great
business that's doing quite well, and we're very pleased with it.
From the investment side, we need to continue to generate both operating income and growth in the overall balance
sheet, so we try to – we will manage between those two. We talked a little bit earlier about before our efforts were
primarily focused on the balance sheet and we were less focused on operating income. This year, we'll be a little more
focused on what investment income is, as well as managing the total return. So we're not giving up on one, but we're
prepared to – life is always about a set of offsets and tradeoffs. So the net of all of those really is operating income and
book value per share are two measures that you and everybody else look at importantly.
Strategically, we need to continue to do a better job and reposition our Allstate agencies around the personal-touch
loyalists and make sure we're doing everything we can do for them, which means customer retention going up, selling
more Allstate Financial products, have more cross-line relationship between auto and home. So there's a lot of work to
be done in that in making sure our agencies are as effective as they can be. We need to work a little harder on what the
value proposition is for the self-directed, price-sensitive people. That goes through our direct business. As I mentioned
to you, our direct business, it was up 19% this year, $745 million. That's a real business. It's growing quite rapidly. That
customer segment wants things a little differently than the customer segment that wants it through the Allstate agencies.
It is not just about price. People don't just migrate to those channels because of price. They migrate to those channels
also because of the offering. Price is obviously important. So we need to work a little harder on that piece.
And then organization – if you look at our management team, well over half of our senior management team has been
here about three years or less. We need to just continue to make sure we function effectively as a team. We feel like
we've got our legs under us now, and we can continue to deliver good results.
<Q - Matthew Heimermann>: All right. Thanks.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Stifel Nicolaus. Your question, please.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess the key question in auto is whether the
overall policy in force or growth trends, however you want to look at it – is the aggregate impact of California, New
York, and Florida versus the rest of the country getting better or getting worse?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Meyer, maybe you could give me a
little more. Are you talking about top line or bottom line?
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Top line.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: Well, I think we mentioned to you that the new business stats ex those states were up
year over year, and I think Tom mentioned that retention was better in those other geographies year over year. So the
measures of items in force are better when you put those two together than they are in those three big states. The issue
for us is those are three big states for us that represent a large portion of the organization, and we're going to
relentlessly drive to get the profitability right in those and not try to drive growth overall by selling things at a loss.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: When you look at, I guess, the rate actions that you are planning for this year and what you've
seen so far from competitors' rate filings, is there any chance that volume in those states stabilizes in 2011?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: It's a different story when you go state by state. That becomes a tough question to project
what we think competitors are going to do from a rate-filing perspective, and I hate telegraphing to them what we're
doing with any specificity. So there's always a chance that that'll occur. I think those are difficult environments where
we've had a broad set of industry issues and a broad set of industry challenges with PIP and BI, so I hope that's what we
see.

<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. One last question, if I can. There was an other personal lines reserve charge that I think
cost about $0.10 per share in the quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there? Because it was a – I think relative
to the amount of reserves for those products, it seems like it's pretty significant.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I'm not sure which specific –
why don't we follow up? Because I mean, there's a variety of thing going through reserves obviously. We've moved
some money around on lead paint; we obviously have some PIT stuff going on. So I'm not sure which specific piece
you're looking at and what report you're getting it from. If you just follow up with Bob, he can get you the specific
number.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay, perfect. Will do.

Our next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: Yes, thank you. One thing that is positive in the quarter that I'm looking at is 5,000 standard auto
drivers added. I'm wondering how the Mayhem is playing into that and what that means for 1Q, which tends to be a
very difficult quarter for you guys to add customers.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Josh, it's Tom Wilson. I don't know
that first quarter is any more difficult than any other quarter to add customers, is my first reaction. They're all hard. But
as we mentioned a little earlier, the Mayhem program is working. Quotes are up. Brain consideration's up. The way in
which we're quoting those people, we're being more effective at it. So we're liking the new business. And as Joe just
pointed out, we are growing in most other states, other than the ones where we're working hard on, getting the
profitability in place, which is in part a result of the Mayhem campaign. So we like what that's doing there.
The other part, too, is we just have to keep more of our customers, so even though retention was up quarter to quarter in
most of those other states, we still would like it to be higher. So it's improving, but the overall number will continue to
be challenged by the efforts in New York and Florida. As Joe just pointed out, we know how to make money. We know
how to get a combined ratio down. That team is working hard on doing that, and if that means that we give up more
growth in those states than we garner in the other states – we look at each state as its own battleground and own place
we want to pick up market share, and so – but we're not going to lose in one market so we can make ourselves feel like
we're winning in total.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: Can I make any intuitions about there being a trend change going on, or it is premature?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think it's a little early to tell. I
mean, I think you could say in the other states, we're growing rapidly and we're feeling – so I think if you just look at –
I would tell you, our business model is working. Going after the personal touch, the advertising we're doing, we know
how to run a good combined ratio in auto. I'm not worried about that. We got a few places we have to fix, and I think
you would draw that conclusion. Drawing a conclusion or trying to make a forecast on sales and retention, while not as
difficult as catastrophes, is also a little bit difficult.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: And then my second question, I definitely think you guys have certainly exhausted this in Q&A
in some sense. But in the way this shows up in the numbers, it would appear as if the frequency uptick, particularly, I
guess, in New York and Florida, came suddenly, in terms of the way it hits the P&L. I mean, maybe I'm not really
understanding how this books, but I understand that this has been a developing issue, but the rise is very sudden, the
way it hits the numbers. How can I reconcile that a bit?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I would say that the number continued
to accelerate throughout the year.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: And particularly in the fourth quarter?

<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: You get two things going on in there. One, particularly when you look in the sequential
quarters, there is a seasonality effect. And if you go back to the bottom-right corner of Page 5, you can see that pattern
of fourth quarters being higher for a long period of time. So that's a big chunk of it. There is a second piece of it that
some of these trends were accelerating over the course of the year. There have been some fee schedule changes in New
York. There have been things that are accelerating that issue. So a little bit of what was going on in the quarter was
maybe a catch-up as we digested those from the previous quarters. So it's a combination of all of those. Biggest piece is
it's seasonality, and then the next piece is the continuation of those trends.
<Q - Josh Shanker>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Matt, could we do the last
question?
Operator
Our final question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Yeah, thanks. Some quick ones here. First one, Don, is it possible to get what the pension
expense figure was for 2010 and what you expect it to be in 2011?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I could tell what you it was in 2010; it was
about $350 million.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: And most companies are saying that that's going to actually probably be down in 2011. Would
you expect it to be similar for you all?
<A - Don Civgin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know what, I'm not going to tell you
what we expect yet for 2011.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Okay. And then the second question – just curious, the Arizona loss. Just looking at what at
least industry loss statistics are out there right now, it looks like an awfully large number for you all relative to what the
industry is reporting. I'm wondering if there's anything unusual with that loss, concentration issues in Arizona, your
policy's more generous, something like that that possibly happened?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher, Jr.>: Here's what we're seeing on it, Brian. It is a little bit different. The storm happened. We
have a normal pattern of reported losses that comes in. And you get a lot right after the storm, and then there's sort of a
decay rate that runs through there and it declines. We actually saw that normal pattern running through, and all the
sudden, it popped and went back up, and now it's starting a decay rate again. Arizona has a unique law on how long
somebody – it's a waiting period on when new contractors come into the state and get licensed before they can start
actually working business. So we got a bunch of roofers come into the state, get licensed, they're going door to door,
knocking on people's doors, saying, "Can I get on your roof?" That's accelerating the claims. And almost to the day we
saw what would've been the expiration of that waiting period, we saw a spike in claim volumes come up right after that.
It came up late in the year, actually after the turn of the year. So we went back and have reacted quickly to what we
were seeing in those underlying numbers to get that cost rolled through our fourth quarter. So I think that's some of it.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Okay, great. And then just the last question. I'm curious, your new issue app's clearly up. My
question is hit ratios on kind of new issue apps coming in, how has that been turning on a year-over-year basis?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: What do you mean by -?
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Meaning actually binding it.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, close ratios.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Close ratios, sorry. Hit ratios. My apologies.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's a tale of 50 states. So I wouldn't
– we still like where we're positioned competitively. If we don't like where we are, we restructure the rates, open new
companies, do all the things we do. So there's nothing really to do in terms of – nothing major there in terms of
forecasting.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Great.
Thomas J. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Let me summarize then. Just – we had good progress in executing our strategy this year. We do have the financial
capability and wherewithal to do what we want to do, which is both grow our business and give a good return for
shareholders. Our goals this year are obviously to improve our operating results by getting customer loyalty up, by
lowering the combined ratio, and raising investment income – although that has to be adjusted for volumes as the
balance sheet gets smaller. We need to grow our businesses profitability, and then differentiate ourselves from the
competition by serving the unique needs of each customer.
So thank you all. And we'll see you next quarter.
