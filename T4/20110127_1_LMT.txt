Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon everyone. For those on the East Coast I hope you're digging out of the snowstorm
satisfactorily and for all on the call today I hope you're looking forward to a prosperous 2011 as we are.
I trust you've had the opportunity to read today's earnings release on our fourth quarter results. As the release outlined,
operational performance in the fourth quarter continued at a solid rate and enabled us to achieve strong financial
results, including over 20 billion in order bookings that expanded our backlog to over $78 billion, while achieving sales
growth of 5%.
We also continued to generate exceptional cash flow that provided the opportunity to repurchase a record level of over
13 million shares in the quarter to pay dividends of almost $270 million and to fund $840 million to our pension trust.
This focus on operating cash has been a foundational element of our strategy to provide sustained returns through share
repurchases and dividends, while still ensuring appropriate investments in the business and that approach is working
well.
Let me start with a very brief strategic update. Over the course of our last several calls, we've described to you our
sense of this new reality that we're working in, one characterized by growing complexity in the global security
environment and continuing pressures in the world's economy. All that we see reinforces this perspective and is driving
our actions.
As an illustration, just since we last spoke in global security as our Defense Secretary visited on January 11, the
Chinese showcased the pace of their advancement in low observable technologies with the J-20 aircraft. In conjunction
with previous demonstrations of anti-satellite systems, advances in communications and intelligent surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities, the development of anti-surface ship weapons, the expansion of submarine capabilities and
persistent cyber-campaigns, questions about how China might use its expanding military strength are growing.
Also in the region it's now estimated that North Korea will likely have an operational ICBM within five years, a
prospect Secretary Gates recently called a direct threat to the United States and one that only adds to the risks
associated with an unstable and provocative government.
On the economic front, our nation's debt now exceeds $14 trillion and the recently convened 112th Congress will soon
need to address the prospect of increasing the debt ceiling, as executive branch agencies contemplate overall spending
reductions.
On January 6 Secretary Gates took a step in that direction by presenting a revised DoD Future Years Defense Program
indicating that the President's budget request for government fiscal '12 for the base budget would be set at $553 billion,
which represents about $13 billion less than the prior-year's estimate but also about 3% real growth over the current
continuing resolution, which is set to expire March the 4. The Secretary indicated the rate of real growth in the base
defense budget will remain positive in government fiscal '13 and '14 and flatten out in government fiscal '15 and '16.
Given the strength, the alignment and the quality of our portfolio, we expect continued revenue growth through this
period, and we continue to refine our strategy. In parallel with the government efficiency drive, we've been executing a
series of cost reduction and efficiency initiatives as well. Relative to our portfolio, we successfully completed the
divestiture of the Enterprise Integration Group to Veritas Capital for $815 million in cash, and we believe we will likely
have an agreement for the sale of our Pacific Architects and Engineers unit by the end of the first quarter 2011.
We continue to take out costs by reducing expenses across the board, particularly in travel, participation in air shows
and the like, by carefully scrubbing our capital requirements, by tightening our organizational span of control and
improving agility through actions like the Voluntary Executive Separation Program and other measures and by
focusing on consolidations to remove excess capacity, optimize facility utilization and efficiently balance our
workload.

Most recently we announced the phased closure of our Eagan, Minnesota facility by 2013, and the movement of our
contract work from Baltimore, Maryland to other company sites by 2011. While these actions are very difficult for our
workforce, and we undertake them with a measure of regret – Karen, let me interrupt the call for a moment. We're
getting some conversational feedback. Are we okay on this line?
Operator
Sir, your line should be fine. It appears to be the only one open at this time.
Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Very good. Thank you. While these actions are difficult for our workforce, and we undertake them with a
measure of regret, they are necessary to meet the demands of this new reality that we're in. We'll continue to seize
opportunities to reduce costs, increase productivity and drive affordability throughout our company and throughout the
supply chain. A significant component of our strategy is to focus on execution as improving quality and predictability
while shortening cycle times not only lowers costs and assures that every dollar counts, it puts more critical security
capability into our customers' hands sooner, giving them the tools they need to meet complex global security demands.
We also recognize at this critical time of portfolio rebalancing that it's essential to maintain our focus on cash
generation and smart allocation. Our desire to return at least 50% of free cash flow to investors in the form of share
repurchases and dividends remains a top priority as does assuring that we invest in the technologies that will our
customers the edge in every mission area.
While we're interested in acquisitions, we'll remain very selective following our string-of-pearls model, meaning we
look for acquisitions of an appropriate size to facilitate smooth integration, appropriate content to contribute to
innovation and appropriate value leading to profitable growth.
We'll also continue to look at our pension trust, relative to future funding needs. And finally we'll continue to invest in
our people to assure that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to find success in the demanding
environment that we face.
Turning to operational performance. I'll start with aeronautics where two programs warrant special mention, the F-35
and the C-130J. On the F-35, we continue to see progress across key areas of the program but like any development
effort, challenges certainly remain. In the flight test program, we completed 141 test flights in the fourth quarter,
representing the highest quarterly level achieved to-date as the tempo of flights continues to ramp up.
For calendar year 2010, we exceeded our plan test goal of 394 flights by completing 410 test flights but the STOVL
aircraft remains the most challenging variant, with 212 flights completed. That's 39 flights behind plan. We're now
working with our customers to finalize the test requirements for 2011. While the discussions are not yet complete, we
are currently looking at about 872 flights in total. We've flown 36 flights so far this year, and we'll update you when the
overall plan is final.
In the key area of software development, the STOVL variant flew with software block 1.0 for the first time in the
fourth quarter. This software will serve as the foundational building block for all future avionic software on the F-35. It
represents a key step in the process of validating our avionics system and ensuring that it operates in a way that gives
our warfighters a clear advantage over every adversary. Block 1.0 software enables information fusion from the radar,
from electronic warfare system and from the electro-optical targeting system and provides initial weapons release
capability.
In his announcement of January 6, Secretary Gates identified the Air Force conventional take-off and landing version,
and the Navy's carrier version, which represent over 85% of the planned domestic production run, as proceeding
satisfactorily in development. However, testing challenges and delays on the short take-off and vertical landing variant
resulted in his decision to decouple STOVL testing from the other models, to move the development of the STOVL

aircrafts to the back of the overall joint strength fighter production sequence and to place the STOVL version of the
airplane effectively on probation.
These actions will better position the STOVL variant to demonstrate improved reliability over the next two years and
get the Marine aircraft back on track in terms of performance, cost and schedule. We're completely committed to this
course of action and very much appreciate the attention the F-35 is receiving.
Secretary Gates also outlined the recommendations of the technical baseline review, announcing the intention to add
$4.6 billion to the F-35 development program over the next 5 years, extending development to 2016. These funds are to
be used for additional development scope, for testing and risk retirement activities that better position the program for
production and to correct prior estimates. The government fiscal year '12 production buy, our Lot 5 procurement, will
be budgeted at 32 aircraft and the production ramp rate for future production lots was set at 1.5 meaning 150% growth
in quantity lot-over-lot.
Since the Lot 4 quantity recently placed under contract was also for 32 aircraft, the near-term flattening of lot-to-lot
quantities, that's 32 aircraft in Lot 4 and 32 aircraft in Lot 5, does not support the planned cost reductions that are
associated with lot-to-lot quantity increases and learning curve efficiencies. However, we do believe that with the total
quantities of aircraft to be procured we and our customers have ample opportunities to focus on overall affordability
objectives, and we will.
Turning to the C-130J program, we continued to advance both with additional new business awards and increased
annual production levels. The government of South Korea became the 14th country to select the C-130J with a contract
for four new airlifters, bringing the total number of C-130J aircraft ordered since inception to 300. We also delivered
nine aircraft in the quarter, bringing our full year production to 25 airplanes about 50% higher than our 2009 level.
With a current annual production capacity of 36 aircraft, we have the ability to satisfy robust domestic and international
demand.
In Electronics Systems, the team finished the year with a solid quarter across the portfolio. Noteworthy fourth-quarter
items centered on two areas: The Littoral Combat Ship and missile defense activities. In late December, the United
States Navy awarded us a contract to construct the first of up to 10 Littoral Combat Ships through 2015, an award with
an overall potential value of approximately $3.6 billion.
On the production front our second vessel, the Fort Worth, was successfully launched in December and remains on-cost
and on-schedule with more than 80% of construction completed. LCS was highlighted by Secretary Gates as a program
deserving additional U.S. investment, and in this new reality of tight budgets will offer domestic and international
navies a highly-capable, cost-effective system.
In Ballistic Missile Defense, we received a contract for over $900 million to provide Patriot Missile Defense Systems
to the United States, to Taiwan and to the United Arab Emirates further expanding the global footprint of this proven
system. Additionally, the United States Navy awarded a contract to produce Aegis weapon systems for the DDG 113
destroyer with options for two additional destroyer systems. This contract also provides options for an Aegis Ashore
system that will adapt the sea-based capability to a land-based system to protect the United States and Allied troops in
Europe against ballistic missile threats. Finally, operationally the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System was used by
the Japanese Navy to successfully intercept and destroy a target, further illustrating the capabilities of this fielded
system.
Moving to Information Systems & Global Solutions. Our team achieved two key events in the quarter that deserve
special merit. Under the $1.4 billion,10-year IDIQ contract for the National Airspace System Integration effort, a
contract known as NISC III, IS&GS will compete for task orders to provide a broad range of information technology
support to the Federal Aviation Administration. IS&GS will serve as the prime contractor in this effort and will build
upon their prior experience under the NISC II contract.
I also wanted to congratulate our team on their successful completion and delivery of the 2010 census data for the
United States government. This effort represents the successful processing of over 165 million census forms and is an
essential tool used by our government to determine, among other things, the number of congressional seats appropriate

for states and the correct allocation of federal funds to state and local governments.
In Space Systems the United States Air Force awarded a $1.4 billion contract for the fourth Advanced Extremely High
Frequency satellite. This award expands the current contract from three satellites to four and follows the outline in last
year's Quadrennial Defense Review to potentially award up to six Advanced EHF satellites. Importantly, the Air Force
announced that it intends to purchase satellites in block buys to lower the acquisition costs. We believe this approach is
an exceedingly smart way to buy these systems in a fashion that will significantly contribute to affordability objectives,
and we applaud Air Force leadership on this initiative.
Also in Space, our decades-long support of the Trident II missile continued to be recognized with an award of a
contract for over $900 million to manufacture new missiles and provide related support services to this critical element
of national security and deterrents.
Finally and I have described for you many times my admiration for the quality of our leadership and our workforce. I
was very pleased to see five Lockheed Martin employees recently recognized as Fellows of the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics. They are Dr. Ray Johnson, Mr. Frank Cappuccio, Dr. Stephen Englestad, Mr. Jeffery
Hamstra and Dr. Pradeep Raj. They are exceptional leaders, and I was gratified to see their talent and contributions
widely recognized inside and outside our corporation.
I'll turn the call now over to Bruce, who will provide some additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and
our outlook for 2011. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob outlined, our financial performance in the fourth quarter was both
strong and broad-based, and as I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please refer to the web charts we've
included today.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and our 2010 orders. Orders in the quarter were over $20 billion and were strong across all
business areas. Most visible awards were the finalization of the F-35 LRIP IV contract and the first of potentially 10
LCS ships, but you can see every business area had large awards in the quarter. For the full year, orders were nearly
$47 billion, which represents the highest annual order level in our history. And I think this is a good indication of the
alignment of our portfolio with the needs and requirements of our customer.
Turning to Chart 4 and a look at our ending backlog. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6, and that
resulted in growing our backlog by $1 billion during 2010 to our year-end level of over $78 billion. On the right hand
side of the chart, it's noteworthy to see the duration of backlog for a number of our major programs, particularly if you
consider unexercised options there, beyond what's included in our current backlog amounts.
Moving to Chart 5 and our sales for the quarter. Overall the corporation grew 5% in the quarter, with Aeronautics was
particularly strong with 19% growth, driven by increases in both the F-35 and C-130 program sales. Electronic Systems
performance was stronger in the quarter than we expected, resulting in the business exceeding the upper end of its
guidance range for the year.
Overall, three of the four business areas showed growth in the quarter with Space Systems showing a decline, due to
the absence this year of several large milestone-driven sales events that occurred last year.
Looking at our full year sales growth on Chart 6. Total growth for the corporation was 4%; Aeronautics also grew the
fastest for the year at 8% growth, followed by Electronic Systems at 6% and IS&GS at 4%. Space systems was lower
this year by 5% due to lower Orion sales and the wind-down of external tank activities for the shuttle program.
Moving to Chart 7. Our earnings per share for 2010 was $7.18 from continuing operations, significantly higher than the
outlook we provided to you in our last earnings call. The increase was seen in three main areas: Operational
improvements, largely driven by the stronger performance in Electronic Systems, resulted in $0.12 per share increase.
Passage of the R&D tax credit provided another $0.12 improvement and other improvements in our tax provisions,

partially offset by the facility consolidation charge Electronic Systems and all other items netted to another $0.09
benefit.
Chart 8 is a summary of our cash generation for the year. As Bob mentioned, our cash flow was very strong this year,
and we achieved a record level of cash generation of $5.8 billion before pension contributions almost 25% more than
2009 levels. As we outlined to you in the October earnings call, we made over $2.2 billion in discretionary
contributions to pension plans in 2010, bringing the funding level in our plans to over 80% as measured on an Arista
basis. At this level, our plans are sufficiently funded under the requirements of the Pension Protection Act to avoid any
determination of the plans being termed at risk.
Overall, our cash from operations from $3.6 billion. In addition, we received over $800 million from the close of our
sale of the EIG business, allowing us the flexibility to make both our pension contributions and continue our strong
cash deployment practices, which brings us to our next chart.
Chart 9 highlights a significant level of free cash returned to our shareholders in 2010. Overall we returned $3.5 billion,
an increase of 25% more than 2009 levels. Share repurchases were $2.5 billion more than 30% above 2009. Dividends
returned almost $1 billion, reflecting the 19% increase in our quarterly dividend rate announced in October, which
brought our annual dividend amount to $3.00 per share.
Chart 10 shows our share repurchase levels in the quarter and for the year. For the quarter we repurchased 13.2 million
shares, the highest quarterly level in our history and double the amount we repurchased last year in the fourth quarter.
For the full year we repurchased 33 million shares, also the highest annual level in our history. The record level of
share repurchases reduced our share count significantly as seen on the next chart.
Chart 11 shows the level of our share repurchase activities since 2005. We reduced over 7% of our outstanding shares
in the year, again the highest percentage of share-count reduction since implementing our repurchase program in 2002.
The 346 million shares outstanding at the end of the year represents the lowest level in our history and reflect nearly a
20% reduction in share count over the last five years, and we have over $2 billion remaining in the share repurchase
program authorized by our board in 2010.
Now turning to our financial outlook for 2011, as shown in Chart 12. As we discussed last quarter, we expect 2011
sales to grow at a low single-digit rate with segment operating profit remaining fairly flat with 2010 levels. We're now
showing an improved FAS/CAS adjustment, primarily due to a higher discount rate then we assumed last quarter. I'll
give more details on this change in an upcoming chart.
Earnings per share from continuing operations are projected between $6.70 and $7.00 per share, and I'm especially
pleased at our cash from operations guide has risen to $4 billion, significantly higher than what we previously outlined.
I should also point out that we are assuming at least $1 billion in share purchases in 2011, and that our guidance
assumes a timely resolution of the FY '11 Defense Appropriation Bill this year.
On Chart 13 we'll discuss segment guidance for sales and operating profit by business area. Aeronautics should have
sales growth in the upper single-digit range, with operating profits projected to increase at a mid single-digit rate above
2010 levels, reflecting the ongoing transition from higher margin production fighter programs to the lower-margin
development and LRIP activities on the F-35 program.
In terms of phasing for the year, I'd expect sales to be heavier in the second half of the year as aircraft deliveries are
planned that way. C-130 deliveries are likely to be weighted one-third in the first half and two-thirds in the second half,
while F-16s will be about 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half.
Electronic Systems is expected to have slightly lower sales due to the completion of the Persistent Threat Detection
System activity last year, the delays in timing of awards, such as LCS and FAS production, all of which are partially
offset by growth in the SOFSA CLS contract. Margins are expected to be similar to the level of 2010. Phasing of sales
for Electronic Systems will be fairly consistent across the four quarters, trending slightly higher in the second half.
IS&GS sales will be lower in 2011 due to the completion of the U.S. Census work in 2010, while margins will be
similar to what we experienced last year. Sales will likely phase lower in the first quarter and first half due to the

absence of the Census program in 2011.
Finally, Space Systems revenues are also projected to be flat compared with 2010 results due to the wind down of
shuttle activity offset by growth in satellite activities. Segment operating profit is expected to be down slightly due to
the wind down of shuttle activity and phasing of sales for the year should be fairly consistent across the four quarters,
except for the timing of two planned commercial satellite deliveries in the second and fourth quarters.
Looking now at Chart 14. As I've highlighted earlier, our FAS/CAS adjustment to earnings have significantly improved
from our initial assessment in the last call. The new guidance for 2011 is $925 million headwind on projected earnings
rather than the $1.2 billion level we indicated in October. Drivers of the improvement were: discount rates increasing
50 basis points to 5.5%, higher than the 5% estimate we provided in October; our actual return on assets was over 13%
in 2010 versus our assumption of 8.5%; and with the largest swing in our FAS CAS estimate, resulting from the change
in our discount rate, this highlights the sensitivity of our GAAP earnings to the volatility of rapidly changing interest
rates, rather than the fundamental economics of our business.
Turning to Chart 15. You can see the significant year-to-year headwind the increased pension expense creates on our
EPS from continuing operations. Removing the FAS/CAS impact from both 2010 and 2011 shows growth in adjusted
EPS of about 8% at the midpoint of our 2011 guidance.
In our final chart, Chart 16, I'd like to offer my perspective on how well Lockheed Martin is positioned within the
industry and as a stock ownership opportunity. As I see it, there are four key reasons why our stock represents a good
value proposition. First, we have a strong dividend yield of nearly 4%. Second, we have a strong history of consistent
share repurchases, averaging more than 4% annual reductions in our share count over the last five years and more than
5% over the last three years. Third, while our cash generation over the past few years has been strong, despite the large
discretionary payments we've made to our pension plans, those significant cash outflows will eventually swing to cash
inflows as our reimbursements catch up to and surpass our required contributions. And finally there's no program in the
DoD budget that has the growth potential of the F-35 program going forward.
With that, I think we're ready for questions. Karen?
Q&A
Operator
In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Well, I have a Joint Strike Fighter question that is a joint question itself. I think it's for both
Bob and Bruce. I wanted to ask you, Bob, you went through the restructuring alluded to by Secretary Gates back in the
earlier part of the month, and the push to the right and some of the timing on some of the lots, redirection of some funds
into R&D et cetera, and you talked about the fact that this is going to perhaps move savings initiatives over toward the
life of the program. You won't be able to target them learning curve-wise earlier on. So I'd like to ask you how we
should think about Joint Strike Fighter revenue and margins over the four to five-year period the Secretary was
referring to relative to your earlier expectations?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, thanks for the question, Rob. So you have a
sense of where we are in Lot 4 and while Lot 5 is proposed at 32 airplanes as is the typical process throughout the fiscal
year, the Congress will review the request for 32 airplanes, and they will have deliberation and they will make a
decision, hopefully with an Authorization and Appropriation Bill that supports the quantity to be purchased.

When we think of overall pricing, revenue, affordability margins, we think that it will be exceedingly difficult on the
affordability front to get near-term cost reduction opportunities without near-term volume increases because volume
increases are so intimately related to our ability and really the industry's ability to drive down learning curves. So we're
seeing a bit of a slowdown in the near-term ramp. We fully reflected our expectations in the near-term in the 2011
guidance as we look forward and learn more about the Congressional actions, we'll be sure to update our guidance
accordingly and keep you well advised.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
<Q - David Strauss>: Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon, David.
<Q - David Strauss>: Bruce, a quick question for you, what is assumed in your guidance for share repurchases at this
point?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: $1 billion for it, David.
<Q - David Strauss>: $1 billion?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Right.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Richard Safran>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon, Rich.
<Q - Richard Safran>: I wanted to ask about cash. So given that cash flow came in meaningfully higher in 2010 than
you expected and given the strength of bookings, et cetera, does that kind of imply there may be upside to your $4
billion cash guidance? And also as kind of like a second part, just wanted to know what the current thinking is about
dividends versus buybacks? And by that what I'm asking is there a potential here, for example, for more meaningful or
higher dividend raises than we've seen previously?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know what, Rich, why don't I
take a shot at this, and see if Bob has anything to append at the end to it. You're right. Cash flow is very strong in 2010.
I was particularly pleased that if you take a look at all four business areas relative to what our expectations were as we
entered the year all 4 business areas exceeded those expectations. You may recall we were contemplating during 2010
some increase in our working capital throughout the year. We actually ended the year relatively flat so we did not have
that increase, and we were also expecting a slight increase in working capital as we headed into 2011, which we're now
believing will be flatter still. So that's, in particular, is what drove the cash higher in 2010 and gives us the confidence
to increase the number to $4 billion in 2011.
You talked about the orders. I was extremely pleased with orders. Again, $20 billion in the quarter especially
considering it's a quarter that's under continuing resolution, and the fact that that led to $47 billion for the year, which is
the highest level of orders we've ever had in the corporation, I think is a testimony to the alignment of our portfolio
with the requirements and needs, again, of the customers' needs.

And so if you ask, you were asking about the dividends versus buyback if there's a change there. We remain committed
to the 50% return of free cash to shareholders as we've stated numerous times. Obviously, we have the firepower that
we demonstrated especially in the fourth quarter to continue the share repurchase and the dividend increase.
We always revisit the dividends with our Board of Directors sometime in the third-quarter timeframe of the year. We'll
do that again this year, and I think in short, Rich, we'll be opportunistic especially on the share buyback, and we'll
revisit the dividend policy in the third quarter with our board, just what we always do.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Rich, I'd only add that we spend a
significant amount of time focusing on cash generation because we recognize that is the single, most significant source
of our ability to run this business effectively and return value to investors. We like the balanced approach with our
share repurchase program and our dividend increases that you've seen of us lately. I think if we're able to continue to
generate cash flow in a superior fashion, we'd like to follow through with more of those actions.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr, of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. Could you tell us what you expect the tax rate to be for 2011 and
any quarterly pattern? And secondly, you gave us a delivery pattern for your aircraft in 2011, but sometimes in the past
changes within a model from one customer to another have resulted in different margins. So should we expect that the
Aeronautical margins will start out low and get better as we go through the year? Is there any kind of visible pattern
there?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Let me try to address the first
question first obviously Cai. Tax rates we're expecting on a recurring basis are probably going to be about the 30%
level. I wouldn't expect to see large changes quarter-to-quarter. I think that was part of your question as well, and I
would not expect to see that.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Phasing of the aircraft is going to be
a little back-end loaded within Aeronautics, again as I've said for both F-16s and C-130s. I don't think margin-wise I'm
trying to recall off the top of my head the quarterly spread of our margins within Aeronautics, I don't believe you're
going to see a whole lot of changes other than I'll say the normal sort of risk retirement items as we progress down the
production of all these aircraft. But from a planning perspective and a guidance perspective, I don't see that that I'd
point out to you at this point in time.

<Q - Joseph Nadol III>: Bob, the F-35 SDD contract is something I think I've asked you about one or two of the past
two or three quarters, and I just want to ask again as to where you are? My guess is that it impacted the margins here in
the fourth quarter in Aeronautics. Although that may have just been mix, but my guess is that there was an SDD issue
there. And it seems to me, and I'd like your view on this as well that this may be sort of a sore spot in the relationship

between Lockheed and DoD right now. So I know you don't want to take a bad deal, of course, but just update us there
on how you're thinking about it and where we are?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah I will say that we started and finished the
year in SDD at the same booking rate so we can clarify that at the outset. There isn't really a sore point or sore spot in
our discussions regarding the SDD program with the Department not about the opportunity for fee or profitability and
not about – it's all about focusing on assuring we're doing the right things at the right time to deliver three variants of
the Joint Strike Fighter. And I honestly believe we see that reflected in the amount of time the Secretary of Defense has
directly spent in reviewing and discussing the circumstances surrounding the F-35.
For a Secretary of Defense to be literate and conversationally competent about the details of the technical baseline
review is a significantly important thing to us because we share a same goal. And the goal is to deliver this airplane as
quickly as we can and as affordably as we can. Because when all of us look at the complex change in the global
security environment, we see an increasing need to have this airplane sooner for three services in the United States and
certainly for regional friends and allies who live in areas that have expanding difficulties.
So there are not really contentious discussions here. There are full throated views about how we should remedy some of
the issues we're finding in the test program, but it's done professionally, it's done constructively and I will say of all the
observations that have been talked about that are developing in the system design and development phase, all the test
areas that need correction, we're working cooperatively. Every one of those areas is being evaluated by subject matter
experts in the government. Most of them have approved corrective actions in place, and we're executing against those
corrective action plans. And the ones that don't have them approved have them in development and review. So I think
we're going to increase the momentum and the tempo of the program, including the flight test program, including
software development. We're all steering toward the same course and we all share the same objectives.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Harned>: Good morning or afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Doug Harned>: I want to continue on the F-35 because some of the statements that Bob you've made in the past
and even today suggest that you think that you could go to higher rates than what the Secretary is talking about in the
restructured plan. And what I'm interested in is understanding what is the source of that difference in views and then
also although I understand that you're ahead on both the A model and the C model in terms of flight tests, and what are
the challenges you face there beyond just the number of flight tests to push this forward and be on schedule I would say
on every aspect of those programs?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Well, let's talk about production capacity
first. We've facilitized the Joint Strike Fighter line to accelerate at a rate faster than 1.5. That's true. And we've done
that in concert with our government customers in full co-operation. I think the Department of Defense is providing their
best professional judgment after undoubtedly one of the most thorough reviews that any program has ever had with the
results of the technical baseline review. What is a prudent, near-term 1.5 escalation in quantity year-over-year? I'm sure
in the future that will be reviewed again based on our performance. We accept that 1.5 rate now. We have a lot of areas
of interest that we have to go focus on. The F-35 I think it's important to remember when we're talking about volume
now, we're talking about U.S. Government volume and the F-35 has an extraordinary international potential business
base here.
And expressions of international interest have been increasing. So I would submit to you, Doug, that if we are able to
execute on a plan that allows everybody to build confidence and that certainly is our commitment, then just as we've
had periodic reviews of the program to-date that have resulted in some adaptations to the program, there can be similar
adaptations increasing the ramp rate. We have an independent manufacturing review team that periodically looks at our

manufacturing productive capability, and I'm sure they have been flexible and wise in their judgment thus far and
they'll be that way looking forward.
You asked about the A model and the C model and the flight test program. We look at this I think in general terms in a
couple of pieces. One is assuring that we're demonstrating the flying qualities of really all three variants, and the
STOVL variant is in the flight test program and it is showing signs of improved performance. That's an area we're
going to concentrate on intensely, but it doesn't mean we've lowered our concentration on the conventional version or
the carrier version. There's also a software development program, and I think you know we're developing software in
three blocks. The blocks have interim releases called A and B.
We've released software Block 1.0. We continue to write the other software blocks. We have to synchronize the
software block delivery with the capabilities being demonstrated in the flight test program so that we can continue to
expand the envelope and continue to move these jets closer toward initial operational capability.
And then there's another piece for preparation for training because the jets have to be inserted into a training program
with pilots in a curriculum to also prepare them for the initial operational capabilities. So you can get a feel from this of
why it is absolutely so vitally important for us to stay in lock-step with our government customers, with the Joint
program offices, with the services, with the systems commands who bring the engineering talent and the subject matter
expertise forward.
It is a large program. It does have complexity but in that size and complexity there's a lot of strength and experience
and judgment that is all dedicated to getting this program right. And we're very gratified for that level of cooperation so
there are a lot of moving parts. Sometimes they don't all move in exactly the way we want them to, but generally that
movement is forward. We're showing progress, and we're going to continue to apply all the resources we have to make
this a successful program.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Just a quick bookkeeping question. All things equal, how will pension expense trend into '12 and
'13 and then maybe just a clarification on some things that you've chatted about in the past, which is what you would
view as full-rate production on the F-35 program? And the year in which we might get there? And the level of revenues
that one might expect once we reach full-rate production?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Jason, I'll tackle the pension
question first. You asked about going forward in '12 and '13. And the way we always characterize it is, if things don't
change from current assumptions, so kind of current course and speed, the same discount rate and same long-term asset
return rate, 8.5% and 5.5% for the discount rate, I would expect that the FAS/CAS adjustment from some $925 million
headwind in 2011 will drop very dramatically in 2012.
Being maybe think of it as maybe a couple hundred million dollars or a little more maybe of headwind in 2012. And
then I would think it would flip in 2013 to where it's actually got a bit of a tailwind at that timeframe. Now all this is
dependent upon, and I've tried to predict when this is going to happen. I've been unsuccessful in those predictions in the
past, but all this is predicated on when CAS harmonization occurs and its impact on the CAS recovery there. We are
assuming, when I say that, that that'll occur in 2012.
And as far as full-rate production, I'm going to ask Bob to give some comments on that.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Jason. It's been a while since we talked
about moving to full-rate production because our focus has been so much on the system design development phase and

the low rate initial production, but the last time we had these discussions we were looking at ramping up to the
neighborhood of about 200 airplanes a year. We were talking in terms of about one a day. I don't see any reason,
assuming that we resolve the issues that are before us now and continue to execute and demand stays strong for the
program, which we believe it will. That's probably the range or the neighborhood that we'll be looking toward.
Relative to timing, we really need to have the jets proceed through initial operational capability before we get to those
levels of full-rate production. That timeline now is in the neighborhood of 2016 or so. The Services are examining the
dates that would be appropriate for their initial operational capability. So I think the short answer is in the 200 a year
range, and we don't go to full rate until after IOC and that date today is about 2016.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Yeah. Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Ron.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good evening, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Maybe changing the subject a little bit away from F-35 on the Littoral Combat Ship, you won
the recent award domestically. Is there an export market for the vehicle? And can you yet expound on that?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we think there is an export market for the
Littoral Combat Ship. The Government of Saudi Arabia has expressed some interest very directly in the performance
characteristics of the ship, and they're looking to modernize their Eastern Fleet. So there's a prospect there. We've had
some additional, I'd say, inquiries as to the suitability of the Littoral Combat Ship. I think international customers want
to get some more information about the vessel. And I think they were honestly looking to see what the award would
actually look like in its final manifestation, and that award just took place at the end of December.
The Littoral Combat Ship is the size and class of vessel that we think will be of considerable interest to many navies
because most navies don't really have a very substantial tonnage in their ships. And of course the modular configuration
of the ship, the ability to reconfigure it in near real-time with different mission modules for different tasks I think will
have great appeal.
And then as we look to the future, we'll look at evolving the ship's capability, for example for Ballistic Missile Defense
capabilities and actually are interested in listening to potential customers as to how they might want to customize or
reconfigure the vessel for very specific mission purposes. The ship was really built to have additional flexibility, small
crew, high performance, use information technology wisely and that allows us to reconfigure it and customize it in
various ways. So I do think that it will have some interesting international opportunities. We'll look for them, and we'll
be sure to keep you posted as these matters mature.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. First, just a clarification, Bruce. On the FAS/CAS for '12, you were saying it's a $200
million FAS/CAS adjustment, not a $200 million headwind to the 925 million. Is that right?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Let me be more precise than
I obviously was when I first answered. So $925 million headwind in 2011 and that dropping dramatically to about a
$200-ish million headwind, not additive to the 925 in 2012.

<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay. I think you can stop the cardiac arrests out there that may have occurred. The real
question I have is on – maybe for Bob, on the F-35, the STOVL production adjustment relative to the rates, relatively
anticipated given the testing and the re-basing there, but I'm curious how you think we should think about the Air
Force's decision to cut its buy by 20%? I mean is this – it seems like the testing was going well, it seems like the Air
Force's rhetoric is strong, just curious how we should interpret this?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, just for – because I am sensitive to some of
these discussions, I don't want to overly clarify your comment. The Air Force didn't cut the volume of their buy. They
rescheduled the rate at which they'll acquire the CTOL so the totals still look the same. The Air – I have great empathy
for the Secretary of Defense and the leadership in the Pentagon who are looking at load balancing in a period of this
new reality that they see too. There are fiscal challenges that they face, there are security challenges they face, they're
going to be compelled to do more without having more resources in given fiscal years, and I think they're simply trying
to make the right decisions and balance their load.
I'm absolutely confident that as we continue to make progress on the Joint Strike Fighter including the conventional
takeoff and landing version, when we demonstrate that the airplane can fly effectively, that we're burning down our test
points, that we're meeting our flight test schedules, that we're delivering software on schedule, and we're meeting the
milestones in preparation for training, the Air Force strongly desires to begin to phase the Joint Strike Fighter into the
inventory. I'm absolutely confident of that.
I think I have the same confidence for the United States Navy, and I certainly have it with the United States Marines
Corps as I meet with the commandant of the Marines Corps with some regularity. He is personally and substantially
involved as a service chief in taking ownership and accountability for getting Marine aviation the F-35 B version. He
measures performance on a weekly basis. I couldn't ask for a higher level of partnership, and it's circumstances like that
when we focus together with the same set of metrics with great transparency on what we've accomplished and what we
have yet to accomplish, that progress will be born. And so I'm really confident that we're going to be able to meet our
milestones, and as we demonstrate the milestones there'll be greater confidence in the airplane, and actions will flow
accordingly.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Thanks so much. A sideline non-aero question for just a second. Can you give us an update on
what your percentage of international sales were in 2010? And Bob, highlight for us the major campaigns you see in
2011? And are you seeing international demand rising? Or is it flat vis-à-vis last year? Or are you seeing it tail off?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Heidi, I'll answer the international
sales question. We ended the year right about 15% sales going to international customers. And that's in line with what
at least I've talked about on previous calls about trying to grow that amount over the next two or three years up to 20%.
I think we're on a good path to do that, and I would think we will see that transition from where we are today about
15% to 20%, ratably over the next couple of years.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And Heidi, when we think of international
business, we think there'll be greater opportunities there for sure. I mentioned in the remarks when the call opened
some changes in the global security landscape that I think some people may have reacted to with surprise but not
everyone. It's very clear that technologies continue to proliferate. Countries and individuals continue to make
investments and sadly the threats that people face have not diminished in their entirety.
When we look at the maturity of our portfolio, the quality of our products and frankly the reputation that we enjoy
globally, say in our Aeronautics portfolio with airplanes like the F-16 and the C-130J, and I believe the F-35 will take
its position right alongside really venerable programs and aircraft like that. There's a very high level of interest in
securing these kinds of assets and I think individuals recognize as we increase our production rate, we lower our cost;

our quality is good. When they're thinking of affordability this is a very opportune time to think about re-capitalization
needs along those lines of business.
With the proliferation of missile systems, missile defense capabilities become preeminent. We have the Patriot system,
we have the THAAD system, we have the MIAD system, we have the Aegis system including Aegis Ashore. These are
very robust, very proven technologies. Individuals don't take a great deal of programmatic risk, and I think they get a
great deal of protection.
It seems to us that international opportunities will vary perhaps a little less so in Europe for perhaps obvious economic
reasons but probably more so in the Middle East and more so in the Asia-Pacific theatre. We're concentrating our
efforts there. We're getting substantial inquiries from those areas.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam Pearlstein>: Good afternoon. I guess one of the questions which just I think was where Heidi might have
been going is, I don't know, are there specific campaigns you can highlight that we might be watching as we go through
the course of 2011? And you had a pretty strong fourth quarter order rate. Do you think you'll be able to get a
book-to-bill up at one time as we look through 2011?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, let me talk about the – Sam,
if I could, this is Bruce. Let me talk about the phasing of backlog. Last year, we had I'll say an uneven distribution of
orders across the four quarters. We actually dropped down to what $71 billion of backlog in the third quarter before we
had the $20 billion in the fourth quarter. I think what we'll see in 2011 is a much more even spread.
In fact as we're looking here, the first quarter might actually end up a little bit even higher than where we ended the
year. And then we may drop down a bit. Third quarter always seems to be our low point for the year. And I still think
we'll end up the year either equal to or slightly higher than we ended the year 2010 with.
And then I'll maybe start the bidding with the international opportunities and say probably first and foremost the C-130
sale to the UAE is likely going to be a first quarter, maybe early second quarter event. That'll be, think of that as a
dozen or so C-130s. We're still hopeful that we can have, sometime this year, some interest from the government of
Iraq on an F-16 buy. And obviously the – maybe not obviously, but one of the bigger ones we're counting on later in
the year is the UAE THAAD program. And I'll go over to Bob and see if you have anything else. Bob?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, Sam, I would only reinforce those are the
most active campaigns. Probably the UAE THAAD is the most substantial with regard to missile defense.

but they really have to pass some pretty stringent tests, adding creativity, innovation, capability that we don't have
today, the right size, the right value. We look at a lot of prospective acquisitions. We don't pursue a lot of prospective
acquisitions, and we're going to continue to be selective.
On the divestiture side, we don't have anything else in queue beyond PA&E. We did a very thorough assessment that
led to the divestitures of EIG and PA&E. I think our focus will be on assuring we run a very tight shop here. Cost
reduction, and there is no area or no element of our cost structure that we will fail to look at to see if we can get
efficiency improvements and productivity. Recently we announced the closing of Eagan, as I mentioned, and some
repositioning work out of Baltimore.
I will continue to look at ways to optimize ourselves with respect to the portfolio internally. I will say we very much
like the portfolio that we have in an environment where global security demands are increasing in areas where we have
demonstrated expertise, where affordability matters, and we know economically there are increasingly scarce resources.
It is why we are so focused on assuring we have sufficient volume and program continuity to allow us to continue to
drive down learning curves to give customers real value. So I would tell you today I really like where our portfolio sits.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Karen, this is Jerry. I know we're coming up on the hour
here but if we've got some people in the queue, we can do this a little bit longer. If people want to try to ask their
questions I'd like to try and get as many as we could. That's all right.

Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr of Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Troy Lehr>: Thanks. Bob, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the – you guys targeting
adjacent markets. In the past, you've talked about that, but you really didn't address it in your strategy discussion going
forward. Is there less of a focus on that? Or does that just kind of fall into the acquisitions category?
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. We like – well, I thought the Littoral Combat
Ship was a representative of our interest and successful pursuit of opportunities in the adjacent market and frankly, I
don't talk about Littoral Combat Ship as adjacencies anymore because it's not. It's a core product line for our company,
and that's how we build the core of the business, and we're pleased with that. I will tell you that when we've explored
the market on the horizon for energy opportunities, we still have a keen interest in those areas. In cyber-security, in
health care information technology, let me say our judgment about the quality in those markets is that it's maturing with
some differential.
A little slower than we anticipated, we think there are reasons for that deceleration. It doesn't mean our interest has
diminished, but we're not going to lower our standards and pursue initiatives in areas where we don't believe we can be
successful. And I mean completely successful in delivering value to customers, running an efficient and good operation
that we're proud of that's good for our employees, and generating the kind of financial returns that will more than
satisfy our investors.
I'll return to the quality of the portfolio that we do have. We believe we have a sufficiently strong and well-integrated
core business portfolio here so as to continue to generate profitable growth from that core. We want to focus on
generating cash. As we generate cash it gives us considerable latitude to make wise investment decisions. We invest
considerably in innovative technologies inside our company, in business ventures with other organizations who bring
value added either in the quality of their portfolio or their customer points of presence, and we have done that over the
last year.
I think of that as enriching the pipeline for future innovation and future opportunities. If we can't find acquisitions that
make a lot of sense or investment areas in these adjacent or horizon markets where we have high degrees of confidence
that we're going to return good value to investors, we'll continue to pursue our share buyback program, our dividend
program. We feel we have enough degrees of freedom to continue to generate economic value, while we pursue
superior position in the marketplaces so we're going to build on the core portfolio that we have.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: Thank you. I have a cash flow question that's sort of two parts. Bob, the first part of it has to do
with sort of contracts and the terms and conditions that you're seeing? And then the second part of it, Bruce, is could
you give us a little more detail on how you got to the $4 billion in operating cash flow? I realize that D&A is probably
700-plus and net's probably 2.5 billion, and so there's obviously there's some working capital or some other items
making a difference there.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, the terms and conditions, Howard, tend to
orient around performance-based payments or progress payments on U.S. Government contracts. There's been a little
bit more discussion about shifting the balance a bit from performance-based payments to progress-based payments. I
think we've seen that a little bit but not in any wholesale way. So our cash flow projections include the balance that
we're experienced in our projection of where that balance might go on those two cash-recovery mechanisms.
I will tell you that a great credit to Bruce and the finance team we spend a lot of time and focus and attention on
refining the cash-collection cycle here, focus on working capital but really focusing on demonstrating value. And when
you talk about contract terms and conditions, it's important for us to work contract descriptions where customers know
they're receiving value and can therefore release the cash with confidence. And I think our cash generation capacity is
reflective of the system that's working pretty well. I hope that answers the feel you wanted to get for the mechanics of
cash flow, and I'll turn the balance over to Bruce.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Howard, back to your question,
how we're getting to the $4 billion, I'd point to maybe two things that I see improvements on going forward, some of
which happened in 2010, as I said, I think some are going to carry over to 2011. One, as we start to see international
contracts, back to Heidi's question on the level of International business we're doing, that will grow over the next two
years, including 2011. And with that International business, I think we'll see some customer advances coming to
fruition.
And secondly the thing I'd point to is we've done I think a very, very nice job here recently in 2010 throughout the year,
and I suspect we could still do a little better, particularly in the Accounts Receivable area where I think in particular the
IS&GS business area has had a tremendous focus on improving that. That's where a lot of – just to be blunt, most of our
other business areas tend to get most of their cash collections from a single payment office or a few payment offices
within the Federal Government, often time that is the payment offices in Ohio.
IS&GS has literally multitudes of payment offices because of their multitude of customers. And I think we've done a
very good job of putting that kind of focus on collecting those across that mixture of payment offices, such that we're
getting better returns and quicker payments of our cash than we previously were seeing. And I think that's going to
continue into 2011. So I'd believe that it is those two things as the main drivers.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 342.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Yes good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, George.
<Q - George Shapiro>: Two-part question. One I wanted to know whatever happened to the $600 million profit pool
for the SDD program that was going to get reset to different milestones? And then the second is why in the LRIP IV
contract wasn't there a contingency put in there in case production rates didn't grow as expected given that there was
clearly some risk that that would have happened in the budget environment that we're in?

<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well let me talk to you first, George about the
$614 million. We still have not finalized the discussion on any prospective reallocation of the $614 million as it relates
to an award fee pool for work done under the system design and development contract. Let me also add that when we
contemplate the prospective addition of $4.6 billion in the over-target baseline that Secretary Gates mentioned, and I
say prospective because we just haven't worked that into the contract yet. Insofar as that $4.6 billion relates to the
extension of effort already under contract, it won't carry any incremental fee with it. The $614 million was an award fee
pool beyond that $4.6 billion. It has not been allocated on milestones yet. I think that conversation will begin shortly as
we fold in the revised program plan, establish milestones and do this in a very discrete way, conversations will
conclude on the appropriate size of that pool and the allocation of that pool to specific milestones. I can't answer you
with greater detail because we don't have greater detail. As soon as we get it we will describe it to you.
On the second part of your question was on Lot 4 having a condition about the quantities in Lot 5. We don't believe the
performance environment on Lot 4 is going to be adversely impacted by the quantity on Lot 5 and don't need a
provision in the contract as such.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: George, I'll add one thing to that. If
you consider the growth that we're going to see on the SDD contract, the $4.6 billion that Bob talked about, there will
be some overlap obviously in the cost profile of that SDD extension and the short fall from the production contracts
that will help to mitigate a lot of that impact on LRIP IV.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Karen, I think we have time for maybe one more call.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of SunTrust.
<Q - Pete Skibitski>: Hi, guys.
<A - Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Pete.
<Q - Pete Skibitski>: Yeah, Bruce, I just want to follow up with you on the earlier question on your pension
projections. Given where you may have a $1.5 trillion deficit now, can you give us your out-year pension projections
under the scenario where cash harmonizations may be delayed a year or two?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: In terms of FAS/CAS, Pete, I'm not
sure.
<Q - Pete Skibitski>: Correct.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Again, we've talked about
$925 million – I should have let Myles Walton answer this question probably. He's probably got the numbers as well as
I do at this point, but with current discount rate and the current asset return, again we think the FAS/CAS in '12 will go
down to about a couple hundred million dollars as opposed to the $925 million.
<Q - Pete Skibitski>: Right. That's under cash harmonization actually happening, correct?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good point. Maybe your question is
will cash harmonization happen?
<Q - Pete Skibitski>: Yeah. What would be the net expense if cash harmonization doesn't happen or if it slides out a
year or two?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think the impact in 2011 as I recall
was about $100-ish million or so when we pushed cash harmonization out. My guess is since it's another year later it's
probably a couple of hundred million dollars if it were to push out from 2012. I tell you that's one, I think, we and the

industry that we're going to be looking for that to happen. I think we've delayed that beyond what was originally
contemplated. When the Pension Protection Act was put in place, we were carved out very specifically large defense
contractors as needing an adjustment to the CAS as a result of the PPA requirements. And that's one that I think as an
industry, and we, Lockheed Martin, will look to have coverage for 2012.
Robert J. Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, Karen, we've gotten a little long on the call. Let me thank everybody for the additional time. Certainly, thank you
for your questions. We appreciate your thoughts. We're going to go focus on execution here, and we look forward to
keeping you well-informed as to the progress that we're making. Again, thank you for your time today. Karen, thank
you.
