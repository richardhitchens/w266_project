MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2017
Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the
analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of
Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.
Troy Jeffrey Lahr
Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Troy Lahr and with me

Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy.
After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit
yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release. And you can follow
the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.
Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk,
which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings, and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the
presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of
non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.
Dennis A. Muilenburg
Thank you, Troy, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our
business environment, and our performance and growth plans. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our
financial results and our outlook.
With that let's move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing
delivered second quarter 2017 financial results that included strong operating performance and robust cash generation.
During the quarter, we generated $5 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock, as we
continue to deliver on our commitments of returning cash to shareholders while investing in innovation, future growth,
and our people. From 2012 till now, we have repurchased more than 200 million shares and increased our dividend per
share by 190%.
Revenue in the second quarter was $22.7 billion, reflecting planned production rates and timing of commercial and
defense deliveries.
Core earnings per share of $2.55 was driven by solid execution across the company. Based on our strong first half 2017
performance and improving confidence in our outlook, we are raising full year guidance for operating margins,
earnings per share, and operating cash flow. Greg will discuss these in more detail shortly.
Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter commercial airplanes
generated revenue of $15.7 billion on 183 deliveries and reported operating margins, 10%.
A healthy pace of sales announcements at the Paris Air Show contributed to 183 net new airplane orders worth $22
billion during the quarter, adding to our already robust backlog that now stands at more than 5,700 airplanes.
Other key commercial milestones in the quarter included delivering the first 737 MAX 8, launching the 737 MAX 10,
and manufacturing the first 777X test parts in our new Composite Wing Center. Also the second and third 787-10
aircraft entered the flight test program ahead of schedule.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported second quarter revenue of $6.9 billion. Operating margins were a record
for this business segment at 12.9% on continued strong operating performance.
New orders booked during the quarter totaled $5 billion, including a $1 billion award from the U.S. Missile Defense
Agency, a contract for the UK Ministry of Defense for 38 Apache attack helicopters, and an F-15 support contract with
the Defense Logistics Agency.
Key milestones for our Defense and Space unit included a successful ground-based mid-course defense intercept test
and first flight of the second production ready T-X trainer aircraft.
Also as part of our next step in driving market-based affordability, Defense, Space & Security announced a more
streamlined organizational structure designed to accelerate decision making, further improve productivity, and enhance

our competitive position.
Overall, and to summarize for the quarter, we delivered solid execution across the company, generated strong cash
flow, increased our backlog, and returned significant cash to shareholders.
With that let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continued to see healthy demand in our commercial,
defense, space, and services markets.
In the commercial airplane market, airlines continued to report solid profits. And passenger traffic continues to outpace
GDP with traffic growth, 8% through May. Also cargo traffic is starting to experience a healthier recovery with 10%
freight traffic growth over the first five months of the year.
Beyond positive traffic growth trends, we've seen over the past few years an evolution in key market dynamics that we
believe in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. For example, demand is
more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe. It is more diverse and balanced across the spectrum of
customer business models as well. There is also more balance in demand between new airplanes needed to replace
older airplanes and those needed to support fleet growth requirements. And customer purchasing patterns have become
more stable and consistent, driven by sustained and increasing airline profitability.
Reflecting these shifts, we recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook. And we now forecast $6.1 trillion
of demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, an increase of more than 1,400 aircraft from
last year. More specifically, we see demand for more than 29,500 aircraft from the single aisle market and
approximately 9,100 aircraft in the widebody market. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market
conditions and a robust backlog, provide a solid foundation for our planned production rate increases.
Our high confidence in increasing 737 production to 57 per month in 2019 is based on our existing backlog of nearly
4,500 aircraft and a production skyline that is oversold through the end of the decade.
In the widebody market we continue to see some varying levels of near-term demand across aircraft models. However,
we have seen steady orders and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in widebody replacement demand early
in the next decade. 777 production for 2017 is sold out. And for the current generation 777, we have 111 orders in
backlog, which includes four additional aircraft that we booked in July.
Production continues at the seven per month rate before we lower the production rate in August to five per month. And
as we've previously stated, that production rate will result in 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and
2019, as we transition production to the 777X. At that rate and with the existing orders and commitments in place, we
are now in an oversold position in 2018 and approximately 90% sold out in 2019.
While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on the current environment and
our ongoing sales campaigns, we believe the rate plan that we put in place establishes a floor for the program and
supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X. And we have a strong foundation of 340 777X orders
and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of the new 777X.
Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production with over 700 firm orders in
our backlog. The recent order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners illustrates continued healthy near term demand
for this unmatched fuel efficient family of aircraft.
As we have discussed on prior calls, we have a focused effort underway to secure additional 787 orders to support the
14 per month production rate planned for the end of the decade. We remain disciplined in our ongoing 787 production
rate assessment with an emphasis on production stability, growing profitability, and ensuring that supply and demand
are kept in balance.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. In the
enacted FY 2017 federal budget, Congress added seven AH-64 Apaches, 12 F-18 Super Hornets, and four V-22
Ospreys, as well as a significant funding increase for Space Launch System. We are also seeing strong support for
numerous Boeing programs above the President's FY 2018 budget request.

International demand for our Defense and Space offerings remains high as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial
derivatives, fighters, and satellites. We continue to make progress towards completing a healthy mix of previously
announced international sales, including 36 F-15 fighter aircraft to Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft to Kuwait, up to 48
Chinook helicopters to Saudi Arabia, and the final C-17 to India.
Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as
commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. As part of
these efforts, we are also leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for winning future franchise
programs, such as the JSTARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, unmanned carrier based MQ-25A,
and the T-X trainer, along with advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities.
Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth
opportunity for the company. To capture an increasing share of that growth, our new Boeing Global services business is
focused on traditional services, such as parts, modifications, and upgrades, as well as new offerings, utilizing data
analytics and information based services. Comprised of major elements from our formal Commercial Aviation Services
and Global Services and support groups, Boeing Global Services successfully began operating as an integrated new
business unit on July 1. And it has already begun capturing key market opportunities.
On the Defense Services side we announced exclusive aftermarket distribution agreements with GE Aviation and
Rolls-Royce for engine spare parts that have a combined potential value of more than $10 billion over the life of the
program. Also during the quarter, Norwegian selected Boeing Global Services to provide flight training across its entire
Boeing fleet. And in part to fuel our growth in digital aviation, we launched Boeing Analytics, brings together our
enterprise capabilities and the work of more than 800 analytics experts across our company who are focused on
transforming data into actionable insights and customer solutions.
With growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation, and
accelerating productivity improvements to fuel investments in our future. The gains we have achieved thus far this
year, and those we expect in the months ahead, are reflected in the increased guidance for margins, earnings per share,
and cash flow that Greg will discuss in more detail.
With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results.
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Second
quarter revenue came in as planned at $22.7 billion, while core operating earnings per share increased to $2.55, driven
by solid performance across the portfolio.
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the second quarter our Commercial Airplane business
reported revenue of $15.7 billion, reflecting the execution of planned production rates and timing of deliveries. BCA
operating margins were 10% on solid execution on production programs and within our services business.
As Dennis indicated earlier, BCA captured $22 billion in net orders during the second quarter. And backlog remains
very strong at $424 billion, more than 5,700 aircraft, again, equating to more than seven years of production.
Cost performance on the 787 program continues to improve with deferred production balance declining by $531
million in the quarter.
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue in our Defense business was $6.9
billion, and operating margins were 12.9%, largely driven by strong performance at Military Aircraft and Global
Services. Boeing Military Aircraft second quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, reflecting the planned wind down of the
C-17 program. Operating margins of 13.2% reflect overall solid core operating performance.

Network and Space Systems reported revenue of $1.7 billion on planned timing of satellite volume, and operating
margins were 9.1% for the quarter. Global Services and support revenue was $2.3 billion, reflecting timing of contracts
and mix, and operating margins of 15.4% reflecting strong execution across the portfolio and favorable contract mix.
Defense, Space & Security reported backlog at $58 billion with 37% of that from international customers.
Let's move to cash flow on Slide 7. Operating cash flow was very strong at $5 billion for the second quarter, driven by
solid operating performance across the company and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures.
With regard to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $2.5 billion in the
second quarter. And for the first half of the year we've completed 28.5 million shares totaling $5 billion. Our continued
balanced cash deployment efforts reflect our ongoing confidence in the long term outlook for our business.
We anticipate completing the remaining $9 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next year.
Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth, again remain a priority for
us.
Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $10.3 billion of cash and marketable
securities. This cash position provides us flexibility to invest in highly profitable growth opportunities, while again also
returning cash to shareholders.
We also announced today that we are taking action to further the de-risk the company by accelerating $3.5 billion of
pension funding, which we expect will eliminate nearly all future mandatory pension funding through 2021.
During the third quarter, in addition to the previously announced $500 million cash pension contribution, we will make
another $303.5 million of discretionary pension contribution using Boeing common shares. We will utilize our strong
cash position to increase share repurchase by the $3.5 billion above our prior plan for 2017. And we now expect to
repurchase approximately $10 billion of Boeing common shares for the full year.
We continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade. And we remain committed
to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors.
Over the past several years, we have taken meaningful actions to reduce risk and cyclicality in our business. And
today's actions are another step in that direction.
Let's turn now to Slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2017. We increased 2017 core earnings per share guidance
by $0.60 to now be between $9.80 and $10, driven by improved performance across the company and lower than
expected tax rate. We're also increasing BCA margin guidance to greater than 10% and BDS margin guidance to
greater than 11.5%.
As Dennis indicated earlier, we're also raising cash flow guidance for improved performance and tax savings from the
additional pension funding. Cash flow guidance is increasing by $1.5 billion to $12.25 billion, with approximately $700
million related to tax savings and about $800 million on proved operating performance.
We're also lowering CapEx spending guidance by $300 million to $2 billion for the year on improved efficiency,
disciplined spending, and some favorable timing.
So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, increasing momentum for our company.
In the second half of the year an important focus for us will be ensuring the continued seamless ramp up of Boeing
Global Services and leveraging our new three business unit strategy in the marketplace.
We'll also be expanding our efforts in driving key cross enterprise levers to improve productivity and affordability and
accelerating innovation across the company, all with an eye towards profitable growth in the second century.
So with that I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments.

Dennis A. Muilenburg
All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong first half of the year behind us, our team remains focused on further driving
both growth and productivity.
In addition to the encouraging commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've also
taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business, including remaining disciplined in our production rate
decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating
labor stability with long term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical.
Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength-on-strength
to deliver and improve on our commitments, and to stretch beyond those plans to sharpen and accelerate our pace of
progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.
Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp up in commercial airplane
production, continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business, delivering on our development programs,
growing our Integrated Services business, and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, driving
world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation, and
growth and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry. All of which position Boeing for continued
market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders,
employees, and other stakeholders.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, in the interest of time we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part
question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Dennis, in the past you've talked about taking free cash flow up sequentially year over
year. You've obviously got a very big free cash flow number this year, an increase. And first, I want to make sure that's
still true in the following years.
But I'd like to understand two aspects of it. First, does your outlook with rising free cash flow assume that you'll get to
the mid-teens target for margins that you've talked about in the past? Or could that be additional upside? And then
second on CapEx, you've taken down CapEx $300 million for this year. How does that fit in with the trajectory going
forward where you've got the 777X, and you potentially may have longer term, a new mid-size airplane coming out? So
how do you think about both aspects of the cash flow trajectory?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet. Hey, Doug. First of all, on your initial question, absolutely confirmed. We still
expect year-over-year cash growth throughout the end of the decade, even with a higher foundation starting point for
that based on the performance this year. We still expect year-over-year cash growth going forward.
A lot of that again is driven by just fundamental performance in the business, increasing profitability on the 787. You
can see the progress we're making there. We expect to make more progress going forward. The ramp up on 737
production and just fundamental improved performance across our program. So we still expect this to be a sustained

year-over-year cash growth business.
Now our work on margins as you referenced contributes to that. We still have our target out there for our teams to get
to 15% margins by the end of the decade. You can see that we're making progress towards that target. And as we've
mentioned to you before, we expect that to be steady progress, not progress that waits till the end of the decade. We
expect to see incremental margin improvement over the next several years. That is a contributing factor, and we're
keeping that target closely in focus.
And then on the CapEx point, you did see us reduce our guidance for the end of the year in terms of CapEx spend this
year, reflecting some efficiencies in our performance as well as a bit of timing. But you should expect to see a very
stable CapEx profile going forward. I said part of our plan for the company is to have a non-cyclical business and a
well-tailored R&D and CapEx profile. And we think as we're in the middle of 777X over the next few years, that'll be
winding down. We have other investments that we're contemplating for the future. But all of those are feathered in to
provide us a very nice stable CapEx and R&D profile for the rest of the decade.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Does that triple – does that CapEx reduction reflect anything about how 777X is
proceeding?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: I think it gives you a sign that the program is proceeding on plan. We have hit the peak
on the CapEx spending for 777X. The Composite Wing Center was one of our big investments there. We're now
building initial production parts in the Composite Wing Center. So 777X is moving forward right on plan. And we
expect to begin delivering those airplanes in 2020 as planned.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you so much and good performance. So, Dennis, of your plan to get to sort of 15%
margins in commercial, how much of that should we anticipate being from extension of accounting blocks? And how
much of that is just core line performance?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yes. All of those are contributing factors, Cai. Certainly we're working productivity
internally, and that's a day-to-day activity in every dimension of our cost profile. All of our market based
competitiveness work, both direct and indirect costs, every element of overhead, those are elements that we're working
hard.
It applies to our supply chain. Recall that 60% to 70% of our cost base in the Commercial Airplane business is in our
supply chain. So the work we're doing through our Partnering for Success initiative. Again we're making some great
progress there with our suppliers and partners. More work to go there.
And it's also true that favorable mix going forward and what we see in terms of block extensions as we continue to
grow our production profile, that certainly contributes as well. Those production block extensions are margin accretive.
And also related, as we stand up our services business, in general we expect services growth to be accretive to margins.
So all of those are contributors to that 15% target.

And, Mr. Rubel, if your line is on mute possibly?

<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Come back to him.
<A - Troy Jeffrey Lahr>: Yeah, we'll come...
Operator
Thank you. Yeah. We'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Great quarter.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Thanks, Pete.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Yeah. I wanted to start on MAX execution. With the six you delivered in the second
quarter, do you feel you're on pace to meet that delivery? You kind of set that at I think 10% to 15% of the total 737
deliveries for the year.
And then kind of along with that, can you give us a sense of how the switch over transition is going on the three lines in
Renton, just in terms of kind of switching over the other two lines from the NG to the MAX and kind of what level of
risk you think that entails?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. You bet. Let me take a first cut and then, Greg, feel free to add in here.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: But the MAX ramp up is going well. As you noted, the six deliveries in the quarter.
We're continuing to ramp up right on pace. And the airplane is also performing well in the field. As we mentioned
before, our production system transition overall on 737 to 47 a month was scheduled for this quarter. The production
system is now running at 47 a month. So we've successfully ramped up, while we've introduced the MAX.
And we are now in the process of moving from the separate third line to integrating into the NG line and actually have
airplanes flowing through that integrated NG MAX line.
So team is doing a great job of ramping up the production system and fully integrating the operations. We still expect
deliveries to be in that 10% to 15% of the total 737 volume for the year.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Greg, you got anything you want to add?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. I mean the only thing I would add, Pete, is as we've made these transitions in rate,
again think about risk reduction. And so I think the team has done a great job of pre-planning that and investing in that
third line, getting the program up and running, and then transitioning into the mainline. And this is just another example
of, how do you de-risk that transition and continue to drive value and meet our customer commitments? And the team
is doing that. So we got a big back half in front of us. But they know exactly what they need to do. And they're off to a
great start.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: That's great, Greg. Maybe one follow up. Period costs as more MAX enter service and
more operators get the aircraft over the next couple of years. Do you expect period costs to grow over the next couple
of years on that? Or is that going to be kind of flattish?

Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Dennis, I wonder if you could spend a few minutes talking
about your updated thoughts on the middle of the market? You've obviously spent some time over in Paris and
probably had some customer conversations about that aircraft. So maybe just talk a little bit about how the business
case is coming along on that one? A little bit about the production system and how you think you're going to get there
from a cost perspective.
And then you've talked about the free cash flow outlook through the rest of this decade. But this is a program that's
going to probably begin ramping in 2020. So just kind of talk about the handoff from your current development
programs into the middle of the market and the impacts that that might have on cash? Thanks.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet, Jason. We're continuing to make progress on our efforts there as we talk to
customers about the potential middle of the market airplane. We've talked with more than 50 customers around the
globe with a diverse set of business models and business needs.
We continue to see a potential market there for 2,000 to 4,000 aircraft. We're continuing to work our way through the
details of what that airplane might look like, potentially a family of two airplanes, working through passenger size and
range of the airplanes, and having good, meaningful discussions with our customers.
We're also working through the details of the supporting business case. We're certainly going to leverage all of the
investments that we've made across things like 787 and 777X, the composite technology that we've invested in. But an
important part of this is also taking a look at the fundamental manufacturing system and how we design and build for
the future and taking advantage of some of our new digital tools. And that'll allow us to take significant cost out of
development, production, and improved downfield support.
And then all of this, we're looking at it through a lifecycle lens. And as we ramp up our services business, this could
also be a contributor to helping us ramp up in services.
So that's all work that's productively moving forward. We're still looking at a timeline that we've talked about before.
That if we were to introduce this airplane, it's probably an entry into service in the 2024 or 2025 timeframe. So we have
time to do our homework and do it well. And we'll make a good disciplined business decision.
From a R&D and CapEx standpoint, it feathers in very nicely with the work we have underway. By that 2020
timeframe we'll be down the backside of the 777X R&D profile and CapEx profile. We'll begin delivering 777Xs in
that timeframe. And so if we were to launch a middle of the market development program, it would feather in very
nicely on the backside of 777X.
So we really don't see a significant change to our profile in terms of CapEx and R&D spending. We think we'll see a
nice steady profile throughout that time period. So we're going to continue to do our work here and make a good
business disciplined decision and one that adds value for our customers.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Wanted to ask about cash progress through the rest of the year. Year to date it looks like
advances, Greg, have been a pretty big tailwind. Your guidance for the full year, how are you thinking about advances?
And then your commitment to free cash flow growth from here, how are you thinking about advances playing into that?
And then also 777X and the inventory build there? Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. Yeah. There was some favorable timing in the quarter on advances, but there will not
be favorable timing in the year. So the guide increase is on performance as well as the tax benefit associated with the
pension.
So again as I outlined, about $700 million for the pension, about $800 million. So this is – you got to equate this to core
performance. This is focused on working capital and all elements of working capital, right down to the program and
functional level. Looking at payables, receivables. Probably most of the focus getting into inventory, right down to the
line and making very efficient business decisions there. So you got to equate this to performance.
As you look at the cash flow going forward, I think Dennis addressed it earlier. We still expect it to grow for all the
reasons he outlined. I won't repeat them. But on top of that, again we got more focus on the elements within cash down
to the team level, and they're off to a great start. So I think there's more opportunity there for us to capture.
In 777X, inventory build and so on is all in those comments about us expecting cash flow to grow. We've taken that all
into consideration. So it's about execution. It's about being more efficient, as Dennis outlined. And it's about executing
on our production rate increases, as we have.
And at the same time looking for opportunities to reduce risk, like we talked about earlier with Pete on MAX. Or
another example, on the pension. We're taking that risk off the table, and we're pre-funding that to give ourselves again
a clear line of sight that really focuses more so on just day-to-day efficiency and operating performance.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: And, Greg, in terms of the working capital opportunity, receivables, payables, inventories,
how far along do you think you are in terms of capturing the opportunity you see there?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. I think there's still a lot of opportunity there. And again we're benchmarking ourselves
not just within the industry. We're benchmarking ourselves to top quartile, as Dennis has outlined. So we're
benchmarking with people that you wouldn't traditionally benchmark with outside the industry that are really good at
this, taking those best practices and bringing them in.
And there's some areas where we're more mature than others. And by the way there's areas within Boeing that we are at
best-in-class levels. So how do we take those best practices and bring them across on the other programs. So bottom
line is I think there's more opportunity there for us to capture.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: You're welcome.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: I was hoping to follow up on the margins at BCA. Obviously the core underlying
margins, I'm not sure you've – kind of pre-R&D. The mature margins look like they've been the best in almost a
decade. And kind of leading me to the next question, which is you raised the guidance to greater than 10% for the year.
I think the prior guidance contemplated either retaining your 14 planes a month target for the 787 or kicking that
decision out. Are you implying that you're in a more comfortable position to retain the 14 planes a month 787
production by the end of the decade with this guidance raise?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. The assumptions on the guidance raise around 787 are unchanged. So they're within the
guidance there. And obviously we haven't – we have assumed that we are going to 14 planes a month. And we've got a
market to support that. But we've still got some work to do. So we'll continue to finish that work. But that, all of that is
taken into consideration in the margin guidance.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Those alternatives are bounded by the guidance.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. Yeah. Correct.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And was there any – just a clarification. Were there any block adjustments, unusual
in the quarter?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Could you say what they are?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Just one, 737. Nothing unusual. But 737 all MAX.

Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hi, Rajeev.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: I wanted to come back, Dennis, to middle of the market aircraft and maybe approach it in a bit
of a different way. You've been talking more about the prospects of it obviously. Would it be fair to assume that such a
program could serve as leverage to increase aftermarket opportunities on existing programs as opposed to just this new
one? And have you had any successful conversations to that effect?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah, Rajeev. As I said, as we contemplate middle of market airplane, we are taking a
look at that through a life cycle value lens, a services lens. It can be a way for us to amplify some of the investments
we're making to grow services.
As we look at our parts business downstream and how we structure that for the future and making sure we have the
right kind of intellectual property arrangements to do that, that gives us some opportunity to expand that thought
process to other product lines. The investments we're making in digital aviation, information based services, the
architecture of the airplane to maximize that value. There's learning associated there that again allows us to
cross-pollinate to our other production lines.

We're also thinking through our vertical strategy. As we build out vertical capabilities for the future, how we might use
a middle of the market airplane to amplify that effort. Things like our composite wing investment that you're well
aware of. Propulsion integration is another area where we've been investing. We're standing up an actuation capability.
It's going to provide support to 777 and 737. We could further amplify that. So this is a way for us to also build our
vertical strategy with an idea that vertical depth can also add life cycle value.
So those are all lenses that we're working on. And we are certainly evaluating middle of the market airplane as a
mechanism for helping us grow services. And as we think through that life cycle lens that's a business process approach
that again can provide value more broadly to our services business across commercial and defense.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: Thanks. And then just a brief follow up. Just as you look at doing more on the services side,
and you've obviously been talking about it a lot more, Dennis. What have you been hearing from some of your
suppliers and customers as far as just the feedback and what you're looking to do?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. The key is as we move to this dedicated integrated services business, we're
absolutely focused on our customers. And we believe there's great opportunity here to add value for our customers and
provide better solutions for them. So that's where this all starts.
As we've had discussions with our customers, those have been very encouraging, because we are focused on adding
value for them. And we're convinced that with our depth of OEM knowledge, some of the investments we're making,
and our partnerships with our suppliers that there are ways to do that together.
And certainly throughout our supply chain there's interest in what we're doing in the services area. As we contemplate
this growth market, as I said about a $2.5 trillion market over the next 10 years, we see that as a growing market. And
one where working with our supply chain, we can grow together and provide better value for our customers. That is our
focus on this effort.

Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Sorry about that before.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, Howard.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Howard.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: We're glad to have you back.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. To shift from performance, because it's pretty impressive, to talk about maybe
orders and sort of the outlook for a moment, sort of two parts to it. One is that it looks like book-to-bill this year based
on what you've done in Paris and to date is clearly going to be better than 1x. But could you also talk a little bit about
what's going on in the leasing market? Because those are kind of what I'd call shadow orders, where we're seeing
aircraft being placed that had already been ordered by the leasing company, so that you're expanding your footprint.
And what does that mean and give you a confidence in terms of your forward look to volumes?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Got it. Well, first of all, on overall book-to-bill, Howard, we're still expecting a
book-to-bill of about 1x for the year. You're right. We had a very strong Paris Air Show. And we're very pleased with
the outcome there. And I think in general there was some upside there compared to what we had expected going into
the air show.
So we're encouraged by the momentum there. But if we look at overall market both narrow bodies and wide bodies, we
still expect orders volume to be similar to last year, a book-to-bill of about 1x. As you know, there's a lot of timing
associated with orders volume.

That said, with a backlog of over 5,700 aircraft, we don't have a great sense of urgency to have to build overall backlog.
We're in a very, very solid position. We are very focused on filling out the 777 bridge as a key part of our orders effort.
You see we've made some great progress on that. And I wanted to reiterate again that we're now in an oversold position
in 2018. So that's new, good news for the 777 bridge, although we still have more work to go there.
Now to your point on the leasing companies, we do see a lot of energy there, again both narrow bodies and wide
bodies. And as we have customers around the world that are thinking through different business models, the leasing
channels are certainly providing some good support to the overall market growth. And you can see that satisfying needs
in both passenger and cargo growth.
I think just as another really good signpost is during the quarter, AerCap's order for 30 787-9s. While we continue to be
mindful of some hesitancy in the wide body marketplace, having a premier customer like AerCap and their leasing
horsepower making a big order in the wide body marketplace I think is another good signal for us.
So we're going to continue to be mindful about the risks and be very focused on filling out the 777 bridge. And I'm
feeling good about the progress we're making. And I think the energy we see in the leasing market supports the overall
market strength.

The next question is from Andrew Gollan with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew P. Gollan>: Hi, gents. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a broader question on capital structure.
So in light of the decision today that we've learned about, accelerating the pension funding, in recent years Boeing had
a neutral balance sheet position in terms of gross cash and consolidated debt broadly, broadly. So with this injection
into pension funding, we move to a net debt position of about $4 billion. I just would like your insights into how you
think about capital structure. Is this a reflection of just confidence? Or how you think about the right capital structure
for the group relative to history?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I think it certainly reflects confidence we have in our business in the market and our
ability to execute in that market. And I think it goes to the foundation that Dennis talked about as far as the backlog.
But I think as far as general capital structure, what you see today is what you should expect to see going forward.
And we're very focused on again, on risk mitigation and top line and bottom line performance. And so as we make
these decisions like pension – and that really ties to our performance. If we weren't performing at the levels we are at,
we wouldn't have the opportunity to do something like this. And this is a really great opportunity to look after that kind
of profile up to 2021 and kind of pull that back, take that risk off the table. And at the same time, very committed to
meeting our obligations to all of our employees.
So in returning clash to shareholders, balanced deployment, investing in our company, in innovation, that's what's
gotten us here the last 100 years. That's what's going to get us and allow us to lead in the second century, as Dennis has
articulated. And that's going to continue to be our focus.

<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Morning.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Greg, I wanted ask about the 787 and very good progress on the deferred balance this quarter,
the $530 million reduction. Was there anything kind of unique about this quarter? Or is that sort of the new floor for
deferred reduction going forward?
And then when we think about the second half of the year and how much better things could get, I was under the
impression that there were some price step-downs coming in the second half and that we would see further acceleration
from that level?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. No. Seth. I'd say there's nothing unique. It is just again as we've articulated the kind of
big moving pieces on improving deferred, certainly first and foremost executing to making the deliveries and making
rate. The team has done a great job in doing that, coming down the learning curve in the factories as well as step down
in the supply chain. And then of course the more favorable mix as we bring more -9s and -10s in.
But frankly, I guess the only thing that would be a little bit unique here is that we've got -10s in flow, and they're in
early production. And that would be more of a headwind.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Right.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: So I think what you see here again, beyond that, is pretty straightforward. So obviously we
expect that to improve going forward as we continue to focus on each of those elements.
So again my credit to the teams in Charleston and in Seattle, because they've done a great job staying day-to-day
focused on every unit being more efficient than the prior one. They in some cases are setting new standards for the
company.
So back to my kind of best practices, we have teams coming in now that are looking at some of these initiatives they
have on 87, and we're bringing them across to places like rotorcraft and the fighter lines. So that just gives you a sense
of how day-to-day focus is really making a difference in the progress that's being made in the 787 program.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: And to your point, Greg, on 787-10, it's showing the value of real manufacturing
commonality as well with those...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

very well with your inside performance. But how do you make sure everybody kind of feeding that is up to snuff as
well? Particularly as rates go higher.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet. Yeah, Ron, we spend an intense amount of time with our supply chain, just as
rigorously taking a look at their productivity curves and investments and ramp up as we do to our internal operations.
In fact, that's all done hand in hand, because we know that we're only going to be successful when our supply chain is
successful. And as we're ramping up narrow bodies with the 737 line, now up to 47 a month in the production system,
having just taken that step from 42 to 47, our supply chain has come with us.
As you know we've been paying very close attention to the ramp up on the MAX and the Leap engine. And our
partners at GE have been doing a great job of ramping up in parallel with us. We're keeping a very close eye on any
other pressure points that we might see in the supply chain.
So I don't want to make this sound like it's easy. But it's something that is on track and something that we're paying
attention to every day. And we're confident that we have the ability to ramp up to 57 a month. The market certainly
supports that kind of ramp up. And by doing it in a disciplined fashion, bringing our supply chain with us, we're
confident we'll be able to execute.
This move that we just made from 42 to 47 a month didn't get a lot of fanfare. But our team executed it really very
cleanly. And that's really a credit to our team that they know how to do these rate ramp-ups and do them incrementally,
to take out risk and bring our supply chain along.
Next year we'll ramp up to 52 a month, and in 2019 we'll ramp up to 57 a month. So it's a nice disciplined progression.
And as part of our Partnering for Success effort we're bringing our supply chain along.
And we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. If we see any risk points or single source risk points, we'll make sure
that we're building risk mitigations behind those. But right now we're healthy and marching forward.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: And if I may, as a follow up to that question. When you think about standing the service
organization, how are you balancing the – obviously your needs and wants in the aftermarket with your suppliers?
Right? Because from the supplier perspective, for a lot of them, that's their lifeblood. So how do you balance that?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. As I said earlier, Ron, our objective is to grow together in a growing market.
Right? This is a market that has a lot of headroom for all of us to serve our customers in a more value-added way.
Now certainly from a Boeing perspective, the market as it stands today, we're about a 7% to 9% market share in today's
market. So that gives us headroom to grow in a market where clearly we have a significant platform presence that's
well beyond 7% to 9% of the market.
Going forward, we expect that market to expand. And so while there are some places where we will logically have
some competition between ourselves and our supply chain in terms of competing for certain service market segments,
in large part this is about growing the market together and adding more value to our customers. I think we're just
beginning to scratch the surface on these digital aviation solutions, a value add for our customers that's going to grow
the market and something that we can do together with our supply chain. So that is our preferred business model.
Now where we need to, we'll build out vertical capabilities, because we're determined to make sure we're adding value
for our customers. We've made some of those investments already. We're currently looking through about 40 different
categories of support and parts, areas where we may invest for the future. In some cases those will be vertical
capabilities. In some cases new partnerships with our suppliers. And in some cases when we need to build an additional
supply chain component, we'll make those kind of investments. I think a good example there is the 777X landing gear,
as an example.
So that whole portfolio of options is in front of us. The key here is the majority of the work should be growing the
services business together, doing it in partnership with our suppliers, and in a way that ultimately adds value for the
customers. That's how we win in this market.

Looking at the growth rates of the different end markets that you're targeting, I just wonder when can you get to that
aspirational $50 billion target? Is that 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Just in terms of thinking about it.
And somewhat related is as you stand up the Global Services and pull out what I presume is a relatively high margin
business out of the segment, how does that affect your BCA aspirational goal of 15% margin, just because it's now
going to be a different business?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet. Let me take on that first part, and then I'll ask Greg to chip in on the second
question there.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure. Yeah.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: But if we take a look at that $50 billion target, revenue target, annual sales, we've set an
aspirational goal for our team. That is an aggressive target. We are targeting to hit that level over the next 5 years to 10
years. So we've provided some span of time to do that. Our preference is to do it more quickly. But we're making the
right disciplined investments so we grow in a value added way both for our customers and for our company and
partners.
Now we do see the majority of that growth being organic investment. Now we do expect some complementary
inorganic investments, either acquisitions or in some cases new partnerships. We're working through a whole range of
options right now that will fuel that growth. So this is a place where we will invest to grow. But we do see it primarily
as organic growth.
And I think already we've seen a number of successes here just coming out of the gates that are encouraging signs on
the value we can add for our customers. Now we stood up Boeing Analytics as you heard. That's adding information
based services value for our customers. Just recently we signed contracts with Delta, China Airlines, and Korean Air
for airplane health management predictive alerts. Now we've got a new agreement with AirBridgeCargo for the fuel
dashboard. We've got a 10-year service contract with Turkish [Airlines] to optimize navigation capabilities. We've got
the agreement with Norwegian that I mentioned in my comments on flight training capabilities.
So we're seeing steady progress, great opportunities for us to leverage our OEM depth, leverage our fundamental parts
and services business, upgrades and mods. And then really began to drive accelerated growth in information base
services and data analytics.
So all of those will contribute to that $50 billion target. And we're going to move forward in a disciplined way but in an
aggressive way. And, Greg, you want to comment on the margins?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. I mean I would say from the aspirational goal perspective, it hasn't changed. So yeah,
there will be some movements in the portfolio to the three business units that of course we'll report out into third
quarter and give you further insight into that movement. But that's going to be – the services business is going to be
about a $14 billion business at about 15%. But the aspirational goal for BDS and BCA is unchanged.

Now obviously we're looking at the BGS side of it and looking at the marketplace there and the risk and reward. And
you can imagine we're raising the bar there internally as well. So it's not just the $50 billion. But it's also from a margin
perspective, it's the risk and reward imbalance and what we're offering to the customers as far as value goes. So broader
aspiration, again I wouldn't think of it any different with the change in setting up three business units versus two.

<A - Troy Jeffrey Lahr>: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. Great. That'll be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Dennis, Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey, Dennis and Greg. When we were in Paris we talked a little bit about the kind of the
productivity initiatives, kind of the champion time concepts. And I think we were talking about the 787 for example
about in terms of the productivity and what you're squeezing out there. Is this an initiative that you're going to be able
to still roll out broader across BCA? Or is that a little more unique, just because it was a newer program at 787? Just
kind of getting at the productivity gains that you guys are making?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. Peter, absolutely we're going to roll it out. But it's even broader than commercial
airplanes. And this idea of champion times not only at the unit cost level but at the component level, we have teams that
are working mid-body and aft-body on 787. They're studying new champion times.
And what we're seeing is this culture of champion time performance, the farther you drill down, the more powerful it is.
And we got teams at the work group level that are adopting this philosophy.
We're now taking that and we're transporting it to our other commercial airplane programs. And Kevin McAllister is
doing a great job of spreading that across his enterprise, but in collaboration with Leanne (sic) Caret (58:55) over in the
Defense and Space business, the same thing. We're taking that same philosophy to our fighter lines, the satellite lines,
the rotorcraft lines.
So this is part of our One Boeing strategy. And this champion time approach to driving productivity we think is a real
enabler for the future. And our teams are where the great ideas are. Our people are the holders of our innovation. And
this champion time work is really unleashing that innovation.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thank you.

question please.
Operator
And we'll go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Cameron>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Cameron>: Can I go back to the supply chain [ph] stroke (1:00:16) services? The sort of mantra is that
we've got a close eye on this. And PFS is – PFS 2.0 is a win-win, et cetera, et cetera.
But yesterday [ph] Embrear (1:00:29) kind of trumpeted their latest Partnering for Success deal, basically today issued
a profit warning and it is basically skirting bankruptcy. Another of your big partners, or big suppliers basically said if
services expands like you talk about then they might have to change their pricing model.
So is there a disconnect between what you say and some of your suppliers say? Or have you really got all this sorted,
not just now, but in the medium term?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. Hey, Doug. When we take a look at this again, the key is when we talk about
growing services, we always go back and start with the customer. This is about adding value for our customers. And we
can do that in partnership with our suppliers, as we always have done in the past.
Now certainly as you've pointed out, there's some sense of nervousness or uncertainty as we ramp up. We understand
how that might be the case within some of our supply chain. But our actions are following through in developing
partnerships with our supply chain and adding value for our customers.
Now are there going to be some places where we're going to have to make some hard decisions? Where we're going to
have to develop alternatives? Where we're going to have to build additional supply chain capacity? Yes. There will be
some hard things that we'll have to do. But all with an ultimate focus on adding value for our customers.
And I do believe overall the services market is a high growth market. And the large majority of our work can be work
that we grow together with our supply chain. And where we do have some hard spots, we'll deal with those. That's what
our Partnering for Success initiative is designed to do. It's allowed us to get tough business issues on the table, drive
those to resolution, so that ultimately we can grow together and ultimately we provide better value for our customers.

Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Oh, hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hi, Julie.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Dennis, you mentioned inorganic growth for BGS a couple of minutes ago. And BDS has been
overshadowed over the last few years by the growth with the commercial division. Would you mind just updating your
thinking, your approach to mergers and acquisitions? I mean Boeing has been focused on bolt-on deals for a long time,
maybe going back to the McDonnell Douglas merger. And I'm wondering now with your stock trading up near $230 a
share, that's a really rich currency. And are you open to considering larger strategic acquisitions?

<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, Julie. Our strategy and our position has not changed. When we look at uses of
cash, we consistently see our priorities as being first, most important use is organic investment. And we are making
good use of that today. We are bringing more innovation to the marketplace today than we ever have. And that spans
our entire business, not to leave out our Defense business. It certainly includes things like the 787, the 737 MAX,
777X, but it also includes investments that we're making in programs like T-X, our satellites business, the autonomous
systems that we're developing.
So we are making organic investments across the board. That's still our number one use of cash. And that's with the
purpose of out-innovating our competition.
Secondly, we're going to continue to return cash to our shareholders. And approximately 100% of free cash flow being
returned through repurchases and dividends continues to be our second priority.
Third is inorganic investments. And we don't see a need to change that strategy. We're going to continue to look for
bolt-on opportunities, things that complement our organic investment.
But our best, most efficient use of capital is our organic investment machine. That is a well-tested, well-honed machine,
one that's producing real growth. And we complement it with our M&A actions.
And we're going to be focused on growing our services business and targeted verticals. And those are areas where we
have made investments in the past. And we'll continue to make inorganic investments. And we see those as being
complementary as we build out vertical capabilities with life cycle value. So that's our strategy going forward.

Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Dennis and Greg, thanks for taking my call.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet. Good morning.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Hi. So Boeing has done a lot to restructure, downsize its workforce, reduce production costs. Does
Boeing's size and structure now properly match the revenue and demand that you see? Or if not, how do you think
about what more needs to be done? And I'm not thinking about incremental, I'm thinking more about sort of large
structural moves.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet. And in terms of our business structure, obviously the big move we just made
to stand up our integrated services business was a major structural move. And we're very pleased with the three
business unit structure that we now have. We think that's the right framework for future growth.
Now within that we need to be driving competitiveness every day. And we're going to continue to be relentless on that
front. And just a reminder, our cost structure is much more than head count. We're looking at all dimensions of our cost
structure. This includes our supply chain. It includes every category of overhead, includes efficiency both inside and
outside. And we are going to be relentless on driving our cost structure down and gaining efficiencies, so we can fuel
the future.
As I said before our number one use of cash and what we create as we drive competitiveness is to invest in future
innovation. And that's a really important investment, not only in products and services. It's also in our manufacturing
and design systems. It's in our support and services systems. And it's in our people.
And we're focused on making all of those investments for the future. This is not work that we're ever going to be
finished with. Right? This is a relentless effort to drive competitiveness to fuel our future innovation.

Next we go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, Jon.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: A couple questions. First is on CapEx and how it relates to NMA. You kind of think about the
spending you want to put forth as far as your business plan goes. How much are you weighing the existing
infrastructure that you have in factory space and current investments as it relates to what you can use for NMA?
Whether it's the Composite Wing Center, existing infrastructure in Everett like the 787 line, and also availability in
Charleston and St. Louis. How do you look at that?
And kind of continuing the NMA thought, you put out a forecast this week that calls for 637,000 new pilots over the
next 20 years. How much of NMA's sizing and the need for an aircraft like that relates not only to the congestion at
airports but also a long term expectation about the availability of pilots and the need to fly larger aircraft if they're not
available? I mean is the pilot shortage a real threat here? And is the NMA strategy partially in response to that?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Well, I'll take the second one. But, Greg, why don't you start with the first question?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. Look, Jon, I think just like any good business discipline and decision, you look at
capability, you look at capacity, and then you look at affordability. And all that will be taken into consideration when
we look at the NMA with obviously a clear eye towards winning in the marketplace. And how do you do that in the
most efficient, effective way possible?
So basically everything would be considered. Just like in any good business decision, you're going to look at all your
alternatives, taking in all those three elements into account. And then make a good business decision at the end of it. So
that's what will be embedded into the NMA business case as we think about how we mature that going forward.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Exactly.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: And then, Jon, on your question about pilots and demand for the future, we are taking a
very hard look at this growing marketplace. This is sort of in the good problem to have category. But as the world
needs 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, as we see traffic growing at 6% to 7%, 8% so far this year, clearly
fleet growth is right in front of us. We're projecting that the global aircraft fleet after you account for replacements will
roughly double in size over the next 20 years.
That's going to drive pilot demand. And so we're working very closely with our customers on how do we help create
that pipeline. By the way, that affects both our Commercial business and our Defense business, where there is a need
for future pilots.
Some of it is in how we design our future airplanes, how we improve training efficiency, how we allow for rapid ramp
up in talent. Part of our services business is going to be related to improved pilot training and efficiency for our
customers.
I wouldn't say that launch of the middle of the market airplane, as we consider our options there, is really driven by the
potential for pilot shortage. It's really more driven by just the overall market demand. We see traffic growing. We see
route structures evolving. There are new point-to-point regional structures that may require a new airplane. That's really
the basis for this 2,000 to 4,000 potential market that we see.
Now we'll have to be mindful of pilot shortages as a potential risk area. But we don't see that as the driver for going to a
middle of the market airplane. Middle of the market is really more driven by market growth and customer needs.

Next we'll go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Morning.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Staying on the NMA and the next new airplane, you did, despite Greg's answer just now, you
did during the previous talk, talk about increasing vertical depth, the potential for doing more propulsion work, more
wing work. And I was just – I'm just wondering how significant a shift you see there. Of course historically, as every
new plane that Boeing has come up with has had more buy in it than make in it, the proportion – the make/buy
proportion has shifted towards buying. And like 15 years ago Boeing was talking about getting out of the parts
business. But here you're now talking about increasing vertical depth. How big – how significant a shift might we see
in that next new airplane in terms of the make/buy proportion?
And also how do you see employment within Boeing being affected by that? We're seeing a lot of jobs lost here in
Washington State. How do you see that near term as well?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. Dominic, to your first question, we do see increasing focus on vertical content
and life cycle value going forward. I think you've seen some of that evolution reflected in the 777X compared to the
787, where we brought more of the engineering back in house. We think that's a more efficient way to design and
engineer for the future. Composite wing manufacturing, complex composite manufacturing is a core capability that
we've brought back in house and invested. Propulsion integration as you noted. We see selective areas in actuation
systems as a place where we want to invest for the future. You noted the ramp up that we just announced in both
Portland and Sheffield associated with 737 and 777 actuation.
There are several other categories of capability that we're looking at. And where we can build vertical capability that
adds value, takes risk out, and adds life cycle value as we look through the services lens, those are areas we're going to
invest.
So I think you will see an evolution that's more towards additional vertical content with a clear focus on life cycle value
addition as an evaluation criteria around that. And if we decide to proceed with middle of the market airplane, that
philosophy, that strategy will be reflected in the airplane.
Now in terms of your question around employment, as you know we've had to continue to make some tough decisions
as we are driving competitiveness. We're continuing to do that in a way that is very respectful of our employees and our
people. And where we can, voluntary layoffs and other actions that are frankly good for our people and good for our
company. And this is a continuous process.
So I'm not going to try to give you any long term trend or numbers prediction. Just knowing that we're going to
continue to drive competitiveness, because we're going to invest in innovation for the future. And ultimately that
investment is good for our company. It's good for our people. It's good for growth of our business. And it's going to
provide value for our customers. And that's our headset as we make these decisions. We're going to do the right thing to
grow the company. And ultimately that will be good for our people as well.

Next we go to Peggy Hollinger with the Financial Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peggy Hollinger>: Hello. And thank you for accepting my call as well. Just a couple of slightly different
questions, not about the performance. We've noticed the controversy over the head of the Ex-Im [Export-Import] Bank.
And I just wondered whether you think perhaps, given that controversy it would be a good idea to have another
nominee? Or do you think you can work with this nominee? And just a little bit of a statement on where we are with
regards to the Ex-Im Bank. And if you could update us a bit on Iran please.

<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah, on both those. First, on Ex-Im Bank. Again we continue to believe that it's
fundamentally important that we get the Ex-Im Bank up and running and fully reauthorized. There are about $30 billion
of deal opportunities in the pipeline that when the bank is fully up and running again can be executed and will create
American manufacturing jobs. And those aren't just Boeing deals. Those spread across all of industry. So
fundamentally as a country, we need to get the Ex-Im back up and fully running.
Now part of that process, the nomination process to fill the board seats is crucial. We do think it's important that we
have a chairman of the Ex-Im Bank who supports the bank's mission. And as various candidates are being evaluated,
that's an important lens to be looking through.
And we know there are a number of nominations in flow right now. We're encouraged that there's action being taken.
We are also urging Congress and the administration to move forward with finalizing those nominations, filling the
board positions, and getting the bank back up and running at full speed. That'll be good for the economy and good for
American manufacturing jobs.
On your second question around Iran. We're continuing to make steady progress on that front. Again all of this is being
governed by U.S. government policy. And we're staying completely within that licensing process, stepping our way
through the gates. That is moving forward on track. And we still expect to begin delivering airplanes next year.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
That will be from Gillian Rich with IBD. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gillian Rich>: Hi. Good morning. My question is kind of a follow-up to an earlier one on what specific changes
in the airline industry would you say are driving these requirements for this new kind of mid-market plane, like a new
design? What specific things have your customers kind of been telling you about?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah. When we take a look at the market for this airplane, again we see route structures
around the world continuing to evolve, as general passenger traffic growth is occurring. In particular new regional
structures, point-to-point connectivity that's in this 4,000 to 5,000 nautical mile range, airplanes that are in the 220 to
270 passenger range. That's the ballpark that we're looking at and discussing with customers.
So this is really – reflects the fact that the overall market is growing. And these new regional point-to-point structures
are evolving. And those new regional structures aren't served well by existing airplanes in general. And so there's an
opportunity here to add value for our customers.
That's the real focus here. And in order to have a airplane that can serve that marketplace, it needs to have some of the
efficiencies in terms of turn times that you get with a wide body airplane. And it also needs to have the economic
efficiencies that you get with a narrow body airplane. So hence, sort of a hybrid approach to what that design might be.
Those are the details that we're working through with our customers right now.
