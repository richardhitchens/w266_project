MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Rashira and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the
Sprint Nextel fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]
Now I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Yijing Brentano, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may
begin.
Yijing Brentano, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Rashira, good morning to Sprint Nextel's fourth quarter 2010 earnings call. Thanks for joining us this
morning. For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the quarter. And then
our CFO, Bob Brust, will cover the financial aspects of the quarter. Bob is joining us remotely today due to family
reasons.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide two is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing
forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings,
which I encourage you to review, including Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on our Annual Report on Form 10-K; Part 2,
Item 1A, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; and when filed, Part 1, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for 2010.

Turning to slide three, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our
non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the fourth quarter can be found
on the attachments to our earnings release, and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our
website at www.Sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.31
compared to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2010 and $0.34 in the year-ago period. Net tax expense for the full year 2010
was $166 million. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net tax benefit of $5 million, primarily due to resolution of state
tax matters, which caused our full-year tax expense to be lower than we had projected at the end of third quarter. We
expect that for the full year 2011, we will record a net tax expense of approximately 10% to 12% on pre-tax loss.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse.
Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Yijing, and thank you for joining us this morning. The momentum Sprint has been showing in recent
quarters continued in the fourth quarter, and Q4 represents a good way to cap our turnaround efforts throughout 2010.
Sprint's three key priorities have remained unchanged for three years. Number one, the customer experience is the
foundation of building number two, a strong brand, which leads to attracting and retaining customers; fundamental to
number three, improving our cash position.
At the beginning of 2008, I told you on my first call at Sprint that the turnaround would not be quick, and that there
were no magic bullets. I'm not declaring mission accomplished yet, far from it. We are not even close to reaching what
I think Sprint is capable of. But as I will describe, our progress has been significant and we're on the right track.
Let me begin with the customer experience on slide four. Bob Johnson and his team have completed their first three
years of our journey with their 12th consecutive quarter of improved satisfaction with customer care and first-call
resolution, according to the Advanis survey. Both numbers achieved all-time best results. Our top-box and bottom-box
satisfaction scores were also best ever. This progress was corroborated by Vocalabs in an independent survey that was
completed three weeks ago, where Sprint moved into first place in the industry for both overall call satisfaction and
first-call resolution in the fourth quarter, from last place just one year earlier.
In the recently released J.D. Power survey, Sprint was the only carrier to show a double-digit improvement in their care
customer satisfaction score over the past year. In Consumer Reports, Sprint was the only major carrier to improve in
each of the past two years, so much so that we moved from last place two years ago into a statistical tie for first as the
best overall choice. And calls to care per customer declined 10% from last year, reaching both an all-time best and
achieving industry best in class.
Please turn to slide five. A leading independent survey rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's data service best in the
industry in November and in December. And the same independent source rated customer satisfaction with Sprint's
CDMA and iDEN networks both best ever. In addition, our CDMA and iDEN networks both achieved best ever results
for blocked calls. As a result, our fourth quarter postpaid churn was our best fourth quarter ever, contributing to our
best ever annual churn performance. Fourth quarter prepaid churn results represent our best quarter in five years, and
our prepaid annual churn was at its lowest level in five years.
Please turn to slide six. I'll talk about the brand. These customer experience improvements have strengthened the Sprint
brand. Our brand health metrics, which are: most want to investigate, purchase consideration, first brand preference,
and positive brand momentum, all achieved best ever results in the second half.
In a well known independent survey, in the third and fourth quarters, Sprint improved its number of promoters and
detractors significantly in each of the past two years. And the combination of these two, the Net Promoter Score for the
Sprint brand for CDMA, is up a whopping 24 points in two years, and we're the only major US carrier to show any
gain. We've moved from a distant fourth to a strong number two in just two years.

Turning to slide seven, I'm pleased to report that these improvements in the customer experience and the brand helped
us deliver 1.1 million total net adds, and we were also postpaid net add positive for the quarter. Both results are our best
in almost five years.
The fourth quarter was also the first quarter where our entire postpaid business has been net port positive. That is, more
customers switched to the Sprint and Nextel brands than switched from Sprint and Nextel. And it was also the first time
that the Sprint brand, which was net port positive for its third consecutive quarter, was net port positive against every
major competitor.
The Sprint branded postpaid subscriber base, which increased by another 519,000 customers in the fourth quarter, is the
fastest growing in the country among major wireless carriers, as the Sprint brand was net add positive for the fifth
consecutive quarter.
Our postpaid share of gross adds improved year over year for the sixth straight quarter and was up over 300 basis
points year over year, and up 460 basis points for all of 2010 versus 2009. We improved our share of gross adds, while
the percentage of postpaid customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84% as of the end of 2010.
Prepaid net adds were up by 175,000 sequentially, delivering our best prepaid Q4 net add performance ever. Our Boost,
Virgin Mobile, and Assurance brands all saw positive net adds in the quarter.
Sprint launched 4G service in 16 new cities during the quarter, including New York, San Francisco, Miami, and Los
Angeles. Sprint 4G is now available in 71 markets, reaching more than 110 million people. We had strong growth in
our dual-mode 3G/4G customer base, driven by our industry leading device lineup. The EVO and Epic continued to
garner even more awards and accolades in the quarter. And the announcements of the HTC EVO Shift and the
exclusive BlackBerry 4G PlayBook brings our industry leading 4G device lineup to 18. The EVO 4G is our fastest
selling new device ever.
Moving to slide eight, on the cash front, we maintained a strong liquidity position by generating $913 million in free
cash flow for the quarter and $2.5 billion in free cash flow for the year. Quarterly adjusted OIBDA was $1.32 billion,
as ARPU gains were offset by the investment costs associated with more postpaid and prepaid adds and upgrades.
Net operating revenue grew sequentially and in calendar year 2010 for the first time since 2006. Our fourth quarter
operating loss of $139 million showed a 74% improvement year over year, and our annual operating loss was better by
57% versus 2009. Also in 2010, we significantly exceeded our synergy targets for the Virgin Mobile and iPCS
acquisitions that we made in late 2009.
The first year of our Network Advantage outsourcing project with Ericsson met or exceeded its performance and
financial savings objectives. Also during the fourth quarter, we announced our Network Vision blueprint, a multiyear
initiative to enhance voice and data services, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs, and improve
environmental sustainability. We have selected Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, and Samsung to install new network
equipment and software, including multi-mode base stations over the next three to five years. The project will bring
together different spectrum bands onto a single base station, and will allow for the flexibility to offer new technologies
using a range of spectrum bands.
We intend to repurpose some of our 800 megahertz spectrum for CDMA service, which will enhance coverage and, in
particular, the in-building experience for our customers. We also expect to launch the next generation of push-to-talk
services in 2011 on the CDMA network, offering customers sub-second call setup time along with robust data
capabilities. It is expected that iDEN cell sites will be phased out beginning in 2013.
Currently, we are conducting laboratory testing and expect to begin field integration testing around the middle of the
second quarter. We expect the first upgraded cell sites to go live with the new equipment in eight of the largest metro
areas beginning in the August timeframe. This will allow us to deliver performance improvement to as many of our
customers as quickly as possible, and this will also set the stage for cost reductions starting in 2012.
We expect that Network Vision will provide us with additional flexibility to potentially use our own spectrum and
network assets to provide additional 4G capacity or use other spectrum that may be available to us in the future over

our network to create further 4G capacity. If Clearwire utilizes our modernized network, there could be significant
economic benefits for both companies.
So in conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter and in all of 2010. Sprint's customer
experience, brand, and subscriber performance all strengthened throughout the year, and we generated strong cash flow
too.
Chart nine shows the change in major carriers' postpaid net subscribers versus the previous year. Sprint's annual
improvement of 2.7 million net subscribers versus the previous year is unprecedented in the history of our industry.
If I were to pick a sports analogy, it would be 1999's Indianapolis Colts or Arizona Diamondbacks, both which
registered record breaking turnaround years. In Peyton Manning's rookie season, the Colts finished 13-and-3 after
finishing 3-and-13 the previous year, a 10-game improvement. And after going 65-and-97 in 1998, Diamondbacks
owner Jerry Colangelo added Randy Johnson and a number of new free agents. In 1999, they won 100 games and their
division. Both teams lost in the first round of the playoffs. So in spite of their improvements, they finished the seasons
far from satisfied, but their enormous progress signaled better things to come.
In spite of very strong competitive pressures in 2011, we expect to generate positive postpaid net adds and to improve
total net adds this year as compared to 2010. The company expects full-year capital expenditures to be approximately
$3 billion, and we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow during 2011.
I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Bob Brust, who will talk about our financial performance in more detail.
Bob?
Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to slide 10, I would like to start out by discussing revenue
performance for the fourth quarter and full year. We are pleased that total consolidated revenues grew sequentially for
the second consecutive quarter. Revenues improved by 1.8% as compared to the third quarter of last year, and were up
5.5% compared to the year-ago period. The sequential and year-over-year improvements were driven by higher
equipment and wireless service revenues, partially offset by lower wireline revenue. Acquisitions completed in the
latter part of the fourth quarter of 2009 also contributed to the year-over-year improvement.
Wireless service revenues grew sequentially primarily due to higher average revenue per user for postpaid. Growth in
the number of prepaid subscribers also drove sequential improvement in wireless service revenues. Postpaid ARPU,
while still rounding to $55, benefited sequentially from higher monthly recurring charges, including the $10 premium
data services add-on, and improvement in care cost, partially offset by lower usage based charges.
We expect postpaid ARPU to grow in 2011, due to continued growth in smartphone sales and the $10 premium data
service charge, which now applies to all smartphones activated since January 30th. We project prepaid ARPU will
decline slightly in 2011, due primarily to the continued success of Assurance Wireless and our Boost with Shrinkage
program, which we announced last October. Boost with Shrinkage allows customers to reduce their bills in increments
of $5 after six on-time payments to as low as $35 per month. We believe the program will lead to higher price
satisfaction amongst our customers and lower churn.
Postpaid subscriber losses in 2010 slowed significantly as compared to 2009, improving by nearly 2.7 million on a
full-year basis. Although we still lost postpaid subscribers for the full year, we were very pleased with the improvement
we saw throughout 2010, including the net addition of 58,000 postpaid subscribers during the fourth quarter. The
improvement in postpaid subscriber results and continued growth in prepaid subscribers along with fourth quarter 2009
acquisitions have been the key drivers in stabilizing revenue in 2010. In 2011, we expect wireless service revenues to
grow, wireline revenue to decline, and total consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly higher as compared
to 2010.

Moving to slide 11, as Dan mentioned, we had a good quarter in terms of free cash flow, generating $913 million
during the quarter. This was up from $384 million in the third quarter, due in part to favorable working capital changes,
a one-time federal tax stimulus refund of $153 million, and lower sequential scheduled interest payments. For the full
year 2010, we generated a total of $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which was approximately $300 million lower than last
year. The decrease in free cash flow was roughly equal to the increase in CapEx between the two years.
Looking ahead, we expect first quarter free cash flow to be lower sequentially. The primary reasons for the projected
sequential decline include scheduled higher interest payments and the expected reversal of other working capital
changes, which benefited the fourth quarter. Additionally, the tax stimulus refund received during the fourth quarter is
not expected to recur, and we intend to make pension contributions totaling approximately $150 million, with the
majority of it occurring in the first quarter. We expect to continue to generate positive free cash for the total year 2011.
We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Since the end of 2010, we
repaid the $1.65 billion note that came due in January 2011. That was our only note maturity during 2011. In January,
we amended our Export Development Canada loan to extend the maturity on a portion of the $750 million originally
due in the first quarter of 2012. We extended $500 million of this facility to December of 2015, while the remaining
$250 million will still mature in March of 2012. As a result, 2012 maturities decreased from $2.75 billion to $2.25
billion.
Capital expenditures were $608 million in the fourth quarter compared to $462 million in the third quarter and $554
million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total capital expenditures for 2010 were slightly over $1.9 billion compared to
$1.6 billion last year. Capital investment in 2010 focused on wireless quality, coverage, and capacity to maintain our
competitive position, and data services and network quality.
As Dan talked about earlier, we expect that full-year 2011 capital spending will be approximately $3 billion, including
about $500 million of incremental spend due to the Network Vision program. Originally, we had planned to spend
about $2.5 billion in CapEx in 2011, including expenditures to add data capacity. Some of the capital assumed in the
original plan will be substituted with spend through the Network Vision program. Keep in mind, the $500 million I
referenced is incremental spend. Total capital expenditures related to Network Vision in 2011 will likely be higher than
$500 million.
The total incremental cost of the Network Vision program over the estimated three to five year deployment program is
expected to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. We expect that just over 50% of the incremental cost will be capital,
while the remainder will be operating expenses. We plan on ramping up capital expenditures related to Network Vision
in the second half of 2011, with the highest levels of capital investment taking place in 2012 and 2013.
We spent approximately $415 million on rebanding for the full year 2010, and are targeting to spend a similar amount
in 2011. Some spend that was originally expected to occur in 2010 will now likely occur in 2011 due to the timing of
certain licensing reconfigurations.
Moving on to slide 12, I will talk about the drivers of the sequential change in consolidated adjusted OIBDA. As Dan
mentioned, consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $1.315 billion, down $24 million sequentially and down
$94 million from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted OIBDA declined
slightly sequentially primarily due to higher net subsidy and sales and marketing costs, which were partially offset by
higher service revenue and lower cost of service.
SG&A increased sequentially primarily due to higher fourth quarter media spend and selling expenses associated with
stronger retail gross adds and upgrades. Retail gross adds increased by approximately 5% as compared to the third
quarter. The sequential increase in net subsidy was driven mostly by higher postpaid and prepaid handset sales and also
higher postpaid subsidies for devices sold due primarily to the continued growth in the smartphone mix. Cost of service
was lower sequentially due largely to the effects of seasonality, including lower service and repair and cell site utility
expenses.
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially, as the revenue decline was mostly offset
by a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume, which also drove the

improvement in the cost of service.
Looking ahead, we are forecasting wireline adjusted OIBDA to decline significantly in 2011. The scheduled migration
of wholesale cable VoIP customers off of Sprint's wireline platform is expected to cause wireline adjusted OIBDA to
decline by approximately $25 million sequentially in the first quarter and slightly less than $200 million for the full
year 2011. We expect the migration of our largest VoIP customer to last through 2014.
At the beginning of each year, we reestablish intercompany rates for transactions between our segments, which are
generally determined based on market rates. Over the past several years, there has been an industry-wide trend of lower
rates due to increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and
Internet service providers. The change for this year will have no impact on the consolidated adjusted OIBDA, but it's
projected to result in a decline to wireline adjusted OIBDA of approximately $250 million for the full year. The
sequential decline in the first quarter is expected to be approximately $60 million. On a full-year basis, we are pleased
that our cost management results resulted in significant consolidated operating expense savings in 2010.
Headcount reductions in 2009 resulted in savings of approximately $150 million last year. We also realized service and
repair savings of about $150 million, primarily driven by a focus on repairing customers' handsets and using
refurbished devices instead of using new devices as replacements. We saw improvement in our marketing productivity
as well as lower customer care costs as we continued to reduce call volumes, primarily due to fewer calls per
subscriber. As a result of these savings, we were able to offset some of the increased costs associated with higher retail
gross adds and growing subsidy expenses.
As Dan mentioned, our consolidated net operating revenues grew by approximately $300 million year over year. And
operating expenses declined by approximately $500 million in 2010, resulting in a greater than 50% reduction in the
company's operating loss.
As I stated earlier, despite pressure related to scheduled migration of cable VoIP customers, we expect total
consolidated operating revenues to be stable to slightly up in 2011. Growing revenues and improving our cost structure
is key to improving long-term margins. The Network Vision project should significantly improve our cost structure and
is expected to yield $10 billion to $11 billion in net benefits over a seven-year timeframe. We should start seeing
benefits from reduced roaming and backhaul costs in 2012, with expected margin expansion starting in 2013. We
expect that 2014 will be the first year in which benefits should more than offset the incremental OpEx and CapEx. We
currently assume that the project should break even on a cumulative cash flow basis in 2015.
We expect that subsidies and growth in data usage will continue to place pressure on margins through 2011, and
anticipate that postpaid ARPU growth and continued focus on cost management will offset some of that pressure.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter will likely be relatively stable sequentially.
In summary, we're pleased with the recent improvements in subscriber and revenue performance. We look forward to
focus on revenue growth and cash in 2011.
Looking back on my time at Sprint, I'm encouraged by how far the company has come. When I joined the team about
three years ago, the company was in a very difficult position. However, despite sizable economic headwinds and tough
competition, the team managed to stabilize and even began to grow the business. Sprint will continue to face new
challenges down the road. However, as I prepare to return to the beach, I am confident that the company is in good
hands.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick [JPMorgan Securities LLC].
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Let's start on the subscriber trajectory. So now that we've
passed to positive postpaid for everybody, CDMA seems to be doing really well. What's the indication on iDEN losses?
How do you think about where that base starts to ease off in terms of losses and what's being done there?
And then second, Bob, if you could talk a little bit about EBITDA for the full year on a consolidated basis as well,
given the wireline reductions, that would be great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: All right, Phil, this is Dan. As I said in my comments, we are actually
going to begin migrating some of our iDEN postpaid customers to the CDMA network once we develop those really
robust new capabilities on CDMA that I described. I will say, though, that we have been – as I mentioned in terms of
network performance, the iDEN network is performing at its best levels ever. And actually, iDEN postpaid churn is
better than it has been in many, many years. So we're providing a great service experience to our iDEN customers. So
we have done a lot to mitigate and reduce churn. And so iDEN's improvement has actually been a big contributor to our
overall improvement in overall postpaid churn.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Phil, it's Bob. Your question was the outlook for earnings this
year; a lot of moving parts going on, especially with the commencement of the Network Vision. I think it will remain in
a stable position with earnings this year versus last year, as we did last year. And as we said in the comments, we
should see improvement starting in 2012 with the backhaul and the roaming from the Network Vision and some
upward pressure for more volume. So I would look for another stable year this year.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay, so wireless improves a little bit, offsetting some of that wireline reduction?
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, something like that, Phil. It's hard to tell. Part of the wireline is
a reallocation of cost and part of it is a true drop in revenue. So we have to deal with the drop in revenue, but we'll
continue our cost improvement efforts this year, and I would look for a stable year.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Good. Thanks, Bob.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Hodulik [UBS Securities LLC].
<Q - John Hodulik>: Hey, thanks. Dan, could you talk a little bit about sequential trends? Obviously, there's a lot of
change in the market these days with Verizon getting the iPhone and some of the 4G launches. How do you expect –
we thought the positive postpaid guidance was very positive. How does that play out through the year, especially with
the seasonality you see in the first quarter? And then also what kind of lift are you getting from non-voice devices like
tablets or hotspots, those kinds of things?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: John, are your questions looking back on 2010 or is it more going
forward?
<Q - John Hodulik>: No, more going forward, looking into first quarter and the seasonality and the change in the
competitive landscape.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Clearly, as you point out, there is clearly seasonality in our business. I
think one trend we're going to continue to see in 2011 is that we'll probably see in the industry more growth in prepaid

versus postpaid, and so I think that's one of the overall trends. Clearly, today is a big, well known new device launch
with a competitor, and we have actions in place to respond and try to mitigate that impact. But as we said in our
forecast, we expect to be net add positive on postpaid this year. And we intend to continue to differentiate ourselves in
the market with simplicity and value and through a very, very strong device lineup and to continue the improvements in
the customer experience and continue to strengthen the brand.
So as you think of the postpaid business going forward, and we talked about this a little bit in the comments, we made a
lot of improvement in terms of churn, both on the postpaid side and prepaid side in 2010, and that will be a major area
of focus of ours going forward in 2011. So expect to continue to see churn improvements in the company as really we'll
call it the primary vehicle that will maintain our subscriber performance.
<Q - John Hodulik>: Okay, great.

Your next question comes from Michael Rollins [Citigroup Global Markets].
<Q - Michael Rollins>: Hi, thanks for taking the questions, just two things. First, can you just give us – I'm not sure if
I heard the percent of the postpaid base that's now on smartphones and the percent of sales that were smartphones. And
then secondly, could you talk a little bit about Clearwire and how the need to expand 4G fits into your capital budget
with Network Vision? And what should the buy side's expectation be for expansion of your 4G coverage footprint for
2011? Thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: A couple things; first of all with respect to smartphones, for our CDMA
base, 69% of the devices that we sold, both new – if you will, new plus upgrades in Q4 were smartphones, bringing, if
you will, the total CDMA customer base up to 50% at the end of the year of smartphones.
Secondly, we're still working with Clearwire. And we're still working, depending upon what we do with Clearwire, it
will impact what we do, if you will, in terms of our own capabilities on Network Vision with respect to 4G, so that's
still work in progress. So we intend to make more comments in that regard in the future once they're solidified.
<Q - Michael Rollins>: And just one other thing for Bob; you mentioned before your goal to keep $4 billion, I think,
in cash for the end of 2011. You earmarked a couple changes to debt maturities, CapEx. What's your new target, or is it
the same target to exit the year with a certain cash position?
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Mike, we need to have a substantial cash position with $2.2 billion
of debt maturities next year and the Network Vision process going on, but it will be substantial. We have a new CFO
coming on shortly, and it will be up to he and the company and Dan as to what that position will be. But it will
probably be somewhere where it has been.
<Q - Michael Rollins>: Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from Mike McCormack [Nomura Securities Co.].
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks, and Bob, best of luck to you. Just thinking, Dan, about the situation in
Q1, and obviously you talked about the significant launch today. How should we frame the controlling SG&A thought
process as we go through Q1? I think as a Sprint customer, I've been offered a pretty aggressive upgrade policy. What
are the changes that you've made to the actions that you've talked about to respond to the iPhone launch?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Mike. As I said earlier, I think the key for us is just to continue to
provide a very strong customer experience and the brand strengthens and what have you. We also announced in our
results in the fourth quarter, we upgraded 10% of our base. So we've had a fairly substantial and we'll call it aggressive

upgrade plan for our customers to get customers on contract. Actually, what was helpful to us is we're seeing on the
churn side over time in the last year a significant improvement in voluntary churn, and in particular also an
improvement in off-contract churn, which is important in terms of showing us that the customers are more and more
loyal to Sprint.
With respect to Verizon, obviously, our customers not only have a strong device lineup, but they get a lot of value with
what we provide them. So I'm not saying there won't be any impact when Verizon has the iPhone, but we're doing what
we can to make sure that our customers stay with us and continue to have attractive offers out in the marketplace.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Dan, just to follow up on the CapEx side, putting some parameters around the Network
Vision spending, but what should we be thinking about as we exit this year, assuming gross adds continue to hold up
pretty well, core CapEx as a percentage of revenue on an ongoing basis?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well we haven't provided, if you will, forecast or guidance with respect to
CapEx as a percentage of revenue. What we've said is that this year, expect CapEx to be roughly $3 billion, which is up
over last year. And roughly $500 million of that is associated with Network Vision. And roughly, the other half is just
improving capacity and coverage for our – especially on the Sprint side, growing customer base on CDMA. The big
spend, though, on Network Vision, really ramps up in the second half of this year, and really the next two years are the
largest spend years, if you will, 2012 and 2013. So you should expect on the CapEx side to see a slightly higher spend
in those two years and then coming back down.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong [Goldman Sachs & Co.].
<Q - Jason Armstrong>: Hi, thanks. Good morning, maybe a couple. First on the recent price hike that you put in on
"Any Mobile, Any Time," I was just wondering, is there something specific to that plan, maybe the marginal
economics of it that drove the rate increase, or do you think you have the opportunity to do this across more parts of
your base?
And then secondly on Clearwire, Dan, I think historically you've talked about limitations on incremental funding from
your perspective, really attached to their approach to the network or their approach to a retail strategy. It seems like
there has been some positive movement there. I'm just wondering. Should we interpret these as signals that you've
worked out differences and are prepared to move forward with funding? Thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: First of all, the increase that we added to our "Any Mobile, Any Time"
and our other, if you will, Everything plans of $10 a month, originally we had them on our two very high-end
smartphones, and we expanded that to all of our smartphones. And fundamentally, what drove it was that smartphone
users used a lot more of our network than non-smartphone users. And so our cost of service, if you will, was higher for
smart devices than non-smart devices.
So we very much wanted to keep our differentiation in the market in what keeps our customers satisfied and what we
know they want, which is the simplicity of unlimited. And to be able to maintain that, we felt this was the right thing to
do, rather than going to a metered approach for those higher end users, so that was really the driver. And I wouldn't
signal at this point looking at doing it for other devices. But again, your question was really what drove it, and it was
really the additional cost of service on smart devices because the usage has been increasing fairly substantially year
over year.
Second, with respect to Clearwire, we have very good discussions and negotiations going on with Clearwire with
respect to, if you will, resolving some of the differences in view between the companies. You mentioned one of them
we're discussing that is very public. We have good discussions going back and forth, good faith discussions with
respect to wholesale rates and wholesale pricing. But I would not read anything more into that with respect to funding.

We are not at that point where we've made any decisions in that regard moving forward. We're very pleased with the
fact that Clearwire was able to secure additional external funding in the fourth quarter. And if they need more, that will
be a bridge that we cross at that time.
<Q - Jason Armstrong>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Barden [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
<Q - David Barden>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Maybe, Bob, I just wanted to try to understand the
moving parts a little bit better. It feels like the revenue picture on a consolidated basis is flattish, maybe slightly up,
maybe up for wireless a little bit; but on the margin front, as you say, lots of moving parts. If we're spending $500
million of incremental capital on Vision, it seems like a healthy percentage of the amount of operating expense we're
looking for over this process. I guess $2 billion to $2.25 billion is probably going to be coming out over that time. So it
feels like in the wireless business, there's going to be – I don't know, $200 million, $300 million, $400 million of
incremental expense coming into the second half. But then I guess I think I also heard you say that you're going to
change the cost allocations where wireless is going to be paying the wireline business about $250 million less, and
that's going to start at the beginning of the year.
So could you try to walk us through how spending more on Vision, reallocating costs, and then whatever other cost
initiatives are going on gets to us flattish EBITDA in 2011 versus 2010? Because I guess it feels like we should
probably be anticipating a little bit more downside with the spending that's going to go on here. Thanks.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Like you said, there are a lot of moving parts. First of all, there is a
relatively intense continuing cost reduction effort going on, as there has been. We expect, as I said in my talk, the
stability in revenue is caused by a downward pressure on wireline and an upward pressure on wireless. The wireless
upward pressure on revenue also helps us with our expense position, and especially with reinvesting in our marketing
and our sales costs. So we are prepared – we're trying to keep this thing stable this year in anticipation of the benefits
we're going to get from the Network Vision, so I'd say relatively stable. It could be up a little bit. It could be down a
little bit. It's too early to call, and I'm not going to go into those details with you right now at the early part of the year.
<Q - David Barden>: Just, Bob, on that, so maybe help us understand the linkage then between the CapEx half of the
$4 billion to $5 billion and then how the expenses get layered in. If you're going to spend $500 million of incremental
CapEx in the second half of this year, what kind of OpEx incremental expense goes along with that? Thanks.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: I don't think we've disclosed that yet. Have we, Steve? Steve, are
you on?
<A - Steve Mapes>: Actually, I can help you out on this one.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<A - Steve Mapes>: If you think about 50% of the incremental spend is OpEx over the period, and the way I'd look at
that is break that into two halves. First half, that is when we are at cell sites, and for a few months at each cell site,
we're going to have an overlap in rent. So that increase happens, and it is really as we're building out over time, so not
loaded into this year at all.
The second thing to look at in terms of the expense is actually the migration of our iDEN customers and the cost of
that. And that's quite back-end loaded because, of course, we're having – iDEN is still going to be around until 2013.
We're doing a lot of work in terms of migration now that we're not spending a lot of OpEx, and so we're anticipating in
the 2013 period to be looking at migration costs. So that's the way I would characterize the 50% OpEx spending.
<Q - David Barden>: Got you.

<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: And David, this is Dan. You're exactly right to point out that 2011, with
the additional spend on the network and what we've already disclosed with respect to the wireline will require some
things to improve in order to keep OIBDA relatively flat. But as I mentioned earlier, ARPU, we expect that to improve
in postpaid churn. We expect that to improve in both postpaid and prepaid. We'll obviously continue to be relentless on
the cost management side. And prepaid, its profitability will continue to improve because of the subscriber and revenue
growth, if you will, on the prepaid side of the business.
<Q - David Barden>: All right. That helps, thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.

Your next question comes from Rick Ellman.
<Q>: Thanks for taking the question, just two. When you were talking before about the $10 add-on and how you came
around to deciding to go ahead with that, you mentioned that you wanted to stick with unlimited as opposed to going to
some type of metered or tiered structure. I was just wondering, though. If you're in a position to offer unlimited at a
lower price than your peers, why wouldn't you just tier and offer lower tiers at a lower price than your peers as well
since that could potentially accelerate the improvement in your subscriber growth?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: First, there is a lot of complication – or complexity and additional cost
whenever you increase the number of offers that you have out there. We've reduced the number of rate plan
combinations we have over the last two and a half years by about 90%. And that has a lot to do with our lower costs,
our lower calls to care, our improved performance at retail. So simplicity is very, very important for a lot of reasons.
Secondly, as you add in more tiers, there's actually the potential of dilution, where people will move down to lower
ARPU levels as well as some of the positive potential that you outlined.
So we will continue to look at this and watch this. We talk to our customers a lot. We have a pretty good handle on the
market and where the competitors have their offers in the market versus ours, and we like the simplicity and the value
that we currently offer. But given the usage characteristics, the changes in that that are taking place at a fairly rapid rate
in the market, as well as competitive price moves, we may make a change sometime in the future, but we actually like
the simplicity of the rate card that we currently have.
<Q>: Great, thanks for taking the question.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from Simon Flannery [Morgan Stanley].
<Q - Simon Flannery>: You talked about 4G a couple of times within the context of the Sprint network. First, can you
talk about your thoughts on LTE versus WiMAX at this point? And do you have the spectrum if you refarm the iDEN
to do both CDMA down there and also maybe put in some LTE? I think you had referred also to potentially some other
options for getting spectrum. Perhaps you could expand on that, thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Simon.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Good morning.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: We haven't said yet what we will do. But as part of the Network Vision
project, as you know, part of the, if you will, the RFP part of the project was the ability to put LTE, should we decide to
do so, on our network. We haven't reached a conclusion yet. We're still in the process of determining what we want to

do in terms of 4G and deployment.
Part of that is definitely looking at WiMAX versus LTE. We do have the ability and the capability with Network
Vision, and we do have the spectrum to put LTE on our own spectrum, should we decide to do it. Not for an infinite
period of time, but we have the ability to do that, should we decide to do that. And as I mentioned earlier, when we're
ready to explain more about our 4G plans, we'll do so going forward. And as I also said, we clearly are working well
with Clearwire as well.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: So is that a midyear process?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Either midyear or possibly even earlier in terms of telling you what we
might do; not midyear in terms of implementation, but in terms of describing more to the investment community what
our plans are with respect to 4G. It's likely we'll tell you something before the middle of the year.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Chris Larsen [Piper Jaffray, Inc.].
<Q - Chris Larsen>: Hi and thanks for taking the question. I just want to clarify, Bob, and also thank you for your
service and wish you luck in your retirement.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Chris Larsen>: On the wireline side, the $200 million on the cable is in addition to the $250 million on
allocation, just to be clear. A little bit of that is accounting, but there is also the wireline pressure, so it's a total of $450
million.
And then, Dan, you've had a great decline in churn. Do you feel like you need to keep growing your SoGA, or do you
feel like this is a year where you can reap that harvest that you've sown on the churn declines? And maybe you could
talk a little bit about the impact to your gross adds from increasing – the $10 increase? Do you feel like you've got your
cost structure right for your SoGA – for your SAC, et cetera?
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: The first question on the wireline, you have that right. I think you
did the math properly. So I'll turn it back to Dan.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Chris. There clearly was an understanding on our part that there
would be some, if you will, SoGA growth impact by increasing our prices, but we still thought it was the right thing to
do in terms of our cost structure and profitability going forward. So as we look at our improved year-over-year postpaid
performance, more of that will come from continued improvements in churn. We would hope that we could see some
slight improvement in SoGA in 2011 versus 2010, and we will endeavor to do that. But the lion's share of the
improvements will come, we believe, by continued improvements in reducing postpaid churn.
<Q - Chris Larsen>: And then on the cost structure, your SAC cost structure, how do you feel you stand there? I
noticed that you clamped down a little bit on your upgrades. Was that an effort to not upgrade as many people that
already had a smartphone that they got 12 months ago to get a new one, and really just to help that migration of ARPU
but reduce the OpEx there, or can you talk a little bit about that?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: We still have, if not the best, one the best loyalty programs in the
business. We did look at the cost of our loyalty program. And it was, if you will, running us more than we wanted it to,
if you will. So we did look at making some adjustments to the Sprint loyalty program, which again, we think is very
strong competitively. But that was, if you will, a cost-driven change. It was costing us too much in upgrades.
<Q - Chris Larsen>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Timothy Horan [Oppenheimer Securities].
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Thanks, guys. I'm glad I'm not in your seat. A lot of tough questions, but I appreciate the
answers. Just on the EBITDA clarification, are you talking about stability off this quarter or for the full year? It matters
a little bit.
And then, Dan, just two strategic questions; any more thoughts on your long distance network? Does it maybe make
sense to make that a separate company or part of a separate company strategically? And secondly, do you see the
ability to do any more tuck-in acquisitions out there? It seems like the Virgin tuck-in has worked out fairly well given
your network capacity, or do you think that's something you would look at down the road? Thanks.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: On the stability question, it's mostly aimed at the first quarter. As
you put a budget together, you put a lot of assumptions in it. And stability means within a percentage of this year, it
could go up or down 5% to 10% and it would still be relatively stable. But it's mostly aimed at the first quarter, should
be fairly stable with the fourth.
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Timothy, Dan here. With respect to the wireline business, it's clearly
very important to our overall business, not only in terms of the overall solution set that we offer to our enterprise
customers, but increasingly just being able to carry larger amounts of traffic from one market to another. But that being
said, we are not opposed to finding a better business combination with respect to wireline. And we have a very open
mind in that regard, but it's got to make good financial sense for our shareholders. So it's possible, but I don't want you
to read anything into that. We are not opposed to that. You had one other question. It was...
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Sorry, yeah, do you see the ability to do any more wireless tuck-in acquisitions out there? The
ones you've done here recently have worked out pretty well.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: If something presents itself, it's always possible, but there are none that
we are currently contemplating.
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Thank you.
<A - Yijing Brentano, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Rashira, we have time for one last question.
Operator
And your final question comes from Jonathan Chaplin [Credit Suisse].
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks very much. I'm wondering if I could just dig into the EBITDA question again. If we
take out the two one-time impacts of Network Vision and then the transition of costs, wireline costs out of the business,
if you just look at the organic trends in the business as subscribers start to grow, ARPU grows, and revenue grows,
what would the impact on EBITDA margins in the wireless business be just from an organic impact of growth plus
operating leverage? Would you see margins expand, or is the cost of more smartphones in the base offsetting all of that
organic margin expansion?
And then I know the question has been asked a couple of times, but it's still unclear to me how much of an EBITDA
impact there's going to be in 2011 from Network Vision. Thank you.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: As Steve said, the impact in 2011 is not going to be that great
because a lot of the costs are back-end loaded in the program. We're just starting this thing, and so we'll have to see
how it plays out, but it would look like most of the operating expense is later in the program.

The trends on margins, all the things you said should put some upward pressure on margins, the $10 premium, growth
in wireless and all of that. But we have a lot of things that are going on in the company with regards to continuing to
keep the growth going on, the higher subsidy expense, whatever is going to happen with our competitors. So I think if
the company ends up with a stable year on earnings, it will have done a very good job this year. So that would be my
hope.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Bob, if I could just follow up on that, of the $450 million in revenue that comes out of
wireline, what's the EBITDA impact for that?
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: The $450 million is not revenue. That's adjusted OIBDA.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: $200 million is due to revenue decline and the other $250 million is
due to the allocation.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it, thanks very much.
