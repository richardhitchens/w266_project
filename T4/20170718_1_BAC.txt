MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to today's Bank of America 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Announcement. At this
time all participants are in a listen-only mode. I'll be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure
to turn today's program over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead sir.
Lee McEntire
Morning. Thanks for joining us this morning to discuss the second quarter 2017 results. Hopefully everybody has had a
chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the Bank of America website. Before I turn the
call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements. For further
information on those please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
With that I'm pleased to turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO for some opening comments before
Paul Donofrio, our CFO goes through the details. Over to you Brian.
Brian T. Moynihan
Good morning and thank you for joining us for our second quarter results. This quarter represents another solid
example of driving responsible growth here at Bank of America. We're staying the course on executing against a
responsible growth mantra that's allowed us to gain market share and grow revenue. That mantra drives the way we
manage our costs effectively, while at the same time making continued large investments in people and technology for

the long term value of this franchise. That mantra allows us to manage risk well, whether it's credit, market operational
or reputational risk.
That mantra also drives an appropriate pace of growth in a modest GDP environment while holding credit cost down.
All of this has resulted in significant operating leverage leading to strong earnings growth and supports our plan to
deliver more capital back to shareholders. Through the first six months of 2017, we have more than doubled the amount
of net share repurchase and dividends to shareholders compared to the first half of 2016. As a reminder, with the
successful CCAR results behind us, we announced plans on June 28 to deliver $17 billion in capital back to
shareholders over the next 12 months through higher dividends and net share repurchases.
For the quarter, we produced net income of $5.3 billion after tax, growing 10% compared to last year's second quarter.
Now that was driven by continued strong operating leverage across the franchise. Our efficiency ratio touched 60% this
quarter. In addition to the net income improvement, a 2% reduction in diluted shares resulted in a 12% improvement in
diluted EPS. Year-over-year net interest income improvement of nearly $900 million drove revenue growth about
proving the value of this deposit-rich franchise. We continue to also make progress on our returns and our return on
tangible common equity moved above 11% the first time despite increasing capital levels.
As we look at the next slide on first half line of business results and I'll let Paul talk about the details of the quarter in a
minute. But I wanted to highlight basically two things. First, the momentum that the businesses have compared in the
first half of this year versus the first half of last year and second, I'll focus a bit on our Consumer business as it reached
$2 billion in after-tax earnings last quarter.
So as a broad statement, each business segment grew earnings and capital had its reporting returns well above our cost
of capital. Consumer Banking produced $3.9 billion in after-tax earnings for the first half of the year growing 14%
from 2016.
This was achieved with good revenue improvement and controlling cost and driving operating leverage while
maintaining great credit quality. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management business recorded first half earnings
of $1.6 billion up 9% year over year with a 27% profit margin. Both of these are records for this business.
Our GWIM business has seen assets under-management flows of $57 billion for the first six months of the year. It's a
strong performance considering the industry is navigating many changes, both from the customer side and the
regulatory side. Where we've been growing and having strong margins, we've been investing. The Merrill Lynch One
platform, our Merrill Edge platform and other many investments are providing great transparency for clients allowing
us to lower our cost. Our Global Banking business, serving commercial customers and commercial lending and treasury
services and investment banking has produced first half profits of $3.5 billion after tax. Earnings up 36% from last year
with strong operating leverage on a operating basis and lower credit costs.
And even though this is our most efficient business at 43%, we continue to make investments in both technology and
people. This quarter, for example, this year, we've rolled out our CashPro customer interface for mobile devices making
our cash management services more convenient for our client. And over the last few years, we've embarked to increase
our local market coverage by just simply hiring more bankers. We've hired nearly 400 bankers over the last couple of
years and we have continued to hire more and we'll hire 200 more by the end of next year.
And finally, when you look at our Global Markets business it earned $2.1 billion in the first half and generated 12%
return on its capital. We grew our sales and trading revenue excluding DVA in the first half of 2017 versus the first half
of the prior year, in this case 2016, for the first time in five years, the first half grew faster than the previous year's first
half. This growth combined with continuing expense discipline drove that improvement.
So in general, all our businesses continue to improve and now I'd want to focus a second on our Consumer business and
you can see that on slide four. So given the $2 billion in earnings milestone, I want to talk about and focus on the
multi-year effort this business has gone through. This change really began around 2009 when we had more than 6000
financial centers, 100,000 associates and about one third less deposits. And at the time, we had some digital banking
capabilities but nothing near what we had.

The team has worked hard over an extended period to produce the results you see today. Not only have they
significantly reduced head count. We've done that while adding more and more sales and relationship teammates.
We've not only reduced financial centers, but we've invested and refurbish many and added others in markets we didn't
previously serve.
And we've continuously invested heavily in technology to drive innovation to keep up with customer behavior changes,
and all during this our customer experience continues to improve.
As you go to slide four, you can see some of the trend of results just for last four years. In 2014 due to all the change
that you're all familiar with, the revenue had declined in this business because the regulatory changes into focusing
more on our direct business to our consumers as opposed to some of the indirect businesses.
As you can see also from the crisis forward, we had focused on underwriting prime and super-prime customers. And
you can see that in the change in total net charge offs that occurred prior to 2014 and remains in good stead for the last
four years. At the same time, while the credit costs have come down, our risk-adjusted revenues have been improving.
Also you can see our expenses, on the lower right-hand side, continue to drive tremendous operating leverage leading
to that net income growth.
Today's business operates at a 52% efficiency ratio and with continuing to drive the customer behavior changes,
continued investments for further cost improvements, we expect that to go lower.
Continuing on slide five, you can see some of the other changes in the business that have enabled us to make this
change happen. How do we make this happen? We do it by optimizing and driving technology enhancements for our
customers, for our teammates, and ultimately for the benefit of your, our shareholders.
This sustained level investment's is also validated by the top tier rankings by third parties, whether it's in digital
banking or mortgage banking fulfillment operations or Merrill Lynch, and they continue to enhance these offerings.
This quarter, we launched new capabilities for car shopping and financing of those cars through mobile and added new
person to person features through our partnership with Zelle.
We've also rolled out small business capability to respond fast to the needs of the small businesses we serve across
America. We can't emphasize enough of the positive impacts of these investments, especially in mobile and digital
have made in our improvement, as mobile banking users, you can see have grown to 23 million at the end of the second
quarter. Rapid adoption in digital is shown on the charts, you can see on the interactions in the lower part of the page.
This quarter, we broke through the 1 billion interactions digitally with our customers. That's 1 billion in a single
quarter.
When you look at deposit transactions, you can see that 21% of all our deposits are made through mobile devices today.
That's equivalent of what a thousand financial centers does. That's important for client satisfaction. It is also important
because those costs one-tenth of what it cost to do it over the counter.
Once customer got used to transacting, were now using devices in a broader sense. You can see in the quarter, 370,000
points were set up on a mobile device to come to the branch. When they come to the financial center, we're in better
shape to serve them because we know what they're coming for, and we know what they need. In addition, sales on
digital devices are up to 22% of all our account in loan sales.
So then we switch to the payments side. Payment volumes have been increasing over this time period, but
electronification of those payments shows increased adoption of mobile banking and other digital payment methods.
You can see on the lower part of the page on the left-hand side while payments have grow 4% overall, digital has
grown at 8% pace while non-digital is relatively flat.
Our latest push that we've made, a lot of discussion about with all of you has been person to person. This is an
important payment stream that we are driving. It's already sizable, but it still only accounts for 3% of the total payments
in our Consumer business this quarter. It's still in early adoption, but P2P customers sent $18 billion in payments
through our platform in quarter two. This is up 20% year-over-year.

So people focus on all the digital activity, but at the same time we have 800,000 customers a day come into our
financial centers. These financial centers serve those customers well, not only helping them transact when they need to
but more importantly, help answer their financial needs and by serving with the products and capabilities that we have
with a face-to-face specialized professional. We'll continue to invest in that branch structure and that's all in the run rate
you see today.
We have now built or refurbished 290 centers over the past 12 months and expect to have completed more than 1500
by the year end 2019. In addition, we have upgraded all our ATMs or are planning to upgrade all ATMs and we'll
finish that by the end of 2019 as well. That's 16,000 new ATMs over three or four years.
All that has led to customer satisfaction levels which reached the highest level in our history. So at the end of the day,
our Consumer business is an example of driving responsible growth, growing with no excuses, doing it on a right way
with the customer, doing it and managing risk well and importantly doing it on a sustainable investment basis, investing
in the future while producing great returns in the current.
With that, I want to turn it over to Paul for some more details about the quarter.
Paul M. Donofrio
Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. I'm starting on slide 6. As Brian said, we earned $5.3 billion or $0.46 per
diluted share with EPS increasing 12% versus Q2 2016. Revenue of $22.8 billion is 7% higher than Q2 2016 and
expenses of $13.7 billion was 2% higher than Q2 2016.
The quarter included a few noteworthy items. First, we completed the sale of our UK consumer card business during
the quarter, resulting in a small after-tax gain. The transaction added roughly 12 basis points to our advanced CET1
ratio through both additions to CET1 and reductions in RWA.
A pre-tax gain of roughly $800 million recorded in all other reflects a number of factors, including a premium on credit
card receivables sold and the monetization of goodwill. It also reflects the recognition in other income of currency
hedging gains and transaction losses from currency fluctuations that were previously recorded in OCI.
Lastly, we recorded tax expense associated with the currency hedging gains, which drove our effective tax rate higher
in Q2. After tax, the gain added about $100 million to earnings. The sale completes the transformation of our consumer
credit card business from a multi-country, multi-brand business to a single-brand business serving core retail customers
in the United States.
As usual, we also note DVA for you. This quarter net DVA was a negative $159 million, which was similar to Q2
2016. We also recorded a couple of charges and expense that are worth mentioning. The first is a $300 million
impairment charge related to a few data centers we are in the process of selling. The second is severance costs which
were approximately $100 million higher than Q2 2016
Provision expense was $726 million compared to $976 million in Q2 2016 as net charge-offs of $908 million improved
versus Q1 and year-over-year. And as Brian mentioned, ROA and ROTC approached our financial targets, improving
both on a year-over-year basis and on a linked-quarter basis.
Turning to the balance sheet on slide 7. Overall, end-of-period assets increased a modest $7 billion from Q1 despite the
sale of assets totaling $11 billion associated with the UK card business.
We increased assets associated with our trading business as we continued to invest in our clients, particularly in our
equities business. These increases in assets were offset by a decline in cash driven by seasonal deposit outflows
associated with tax payments and a shift from deposits to AUM and brokerage in our Wealth Management business.
When looking at deposits on a year-over-year basis, they are up $47 billion or 4% from Q2 2016, driven entirely by our
Consumer Banking business. Loans on an end-of-period basis were up $11 million from Q1 as broad-based growth

across consumer and commercial loans was modestly offset by the runoff of legacy non-core loans. It's worth noting
that this loan growth excludes UK card. These card loans were moved from assets of business held for sale when we
announced the transaction in Q4 2016.
On the liability side, long term debt increased $2.5 billion during the quarter to $22.4 billion as we increased issuance
to meet TLAC requirements. Given our progress in the first half towards the requirements, we currently expect to issue
less debt in the second half of 2017 as compared to the first half.
Global liquidity sources were $515 billion this quarter and we remain compliant with fully phased-in U.S. LCR
requirements. The asset composition of our global liquidity sources is materially the same as high-quality liquid assets
as defined under the U.S. LCR rule.
However, HQLA for the purposes of calculating LCR are reported not at their fair market value but at a lower value
which incorporates regulatory haircuts and exclusion of excess liquidity held in certain subsidiaries. Therefore, the
HQLA on a net basis when reported will be lower than our current GLS number.
Common equity increased $2.8 billion compared to Q1. This increase was driven by $4.9 billion of net income
available to common and improved OCI of $700 million, offset by common dividend and net share repurchases totaling
$2.8 billion in the quarter. Tangible book value per share of $17.78 increased 6% versus Q2 16.
Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel 3 ended
the quarter at 11.6%. On a fully phased-in basis compared to Q1, the CET1 ratio improved 50 basis points to 11.5%
and remains well above our 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET1 increased $4.4 billion to $168.7 billion, driven by
earnings, utilization of deferred tax assets and less goodwill deductions given the UK card sale. These improvements in
CET1 were partially offset by return of capital.
The CET1 ratio also benefit from a $34 billion decline in RWA driven by continued optimization work including
model improvements as well as the sale of UK card. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized
approach. While our RWA reduction was lower under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio still improved 40
basis points to 12%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory
minimums to take effect in 2018.
Turning to slide 8, on an average basis, total loans were up $15 billion or 2% from Q2 2016. Note that the sale of UK
card lowered average loans by $2.9 billion. So you may want to adjust for that when studying growth trends. As usual,
loan growth was reduced by the continued runoff of non-core consumer real estate loans in all other.
Year-over-year loans in all other were down $24 billion. On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up
$39 billion or 5%. Consumer Banking led with 8% growth. We continue to see good growth in residential mortgages.
We also saw growth in credit card and vehicle loans. Home equity originations are up nicely but continue to be
outpaced by paydowns.
In Wealth Management, we saw year-over-year growth of 7% driven by residential mortgages as well as structured
lending. Global Banking loans were up 3% year-over-year. There was a lot of Capital Markets activity this quarter and
this may have impacted more than usual loan growth among larger corporates as a number of funded bridge loans were
paid off and as borrowers substituted bonds for loans in a flattening curve environment.
On the bottom right, note that we grew average deposits by $44 billion or 4% year-over-year. This growth was driven
by our Consumer segment which grew deposits by 9% year-over-year.
Turning to asset quality on slide 9. As I have emphasized before, the stability of our asset quality and loss trends
reflects years of disciplined client selection and strengthened underwriting standards along with an improving
economy. While there is room in the industry for other strategies, we remain focused on responsible growth.
Credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs, delinquencies and reservable criticized exposure all
improving from Q1. Total net charge-offs were $908 million or 40 basis points of average loans decreasing $26 million
from Q1.

Provision expense of $726 million declined $109 million from Q1 and was down $250 million from Q2 2016 driven by
lower losses in consumer real estate and improvements across most of our Commercial portfolio, particularly energy.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loans coverage ratio of 120 basis points and a coverage
level 3 times our annual net charge-offs.
Turning to slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. Asset
quality metrics in consumer real estate continue to improve, while net charge-offs were down overall there are a few
small items to bring to your attention.
Within Consumer, we had a small recovery on the sale of a legacy Consumer portfolio. And note that one-third of the
quarterly UK card losses went away with the June 1 sale. While U.S. card losses increased from seasoning, they remain
low. Consumer NPLs of $5.3 billion are at the lowest level since Q2 2008.
NPLs came down from Q1 levels. And keep in mind that 43% of our Consumer NPLs are current on their payments.
Commercial losses were up modestly from Q1 driven by a couple of names.
Turning to slide 11. Net interest income on a GAAP, non-FTE basis was $11 billion, $11.2 billion on an FTE basis,
compared to Q2 2016 which has the same day count and seasonal factors. NII is up $868 million or 9% driven by an
improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing in an environment where both short-end rates and
long-end rates increased.
We also benefited from loan growth and excess deposits deployed in security balances. Compared to Q1 2017 NII was
relatively flat, as the benefit from an increase in short-end rates was offset by a number of factors, including lower
long-end rates in the quarter. First, we increased client financing activities and balances in our equities business to
support clients and drive growth.
Some of the products we use to accomplish this created interest expense with no interest income, instead they drove
trading account profits recorded in non-interest income. Second, the UK card sale closed June 1. That was earlier than
we expected. And so the quarter's comparisons to the previous ones are negatively impacted by one-third of UK card's
interest income.
Third, we saw a decline in leasing interest from the seasonality we see in Q1, but that was offset by one additional day
in interest in Q2 versus Q1. And then lastly, we experienced some negative debt hedging effectiveness. As a reminder,
accounting rules require us to measure changes in the value of debt differently than changes in the value of a swap we
use to hedge, creating temporary ineffectiveness that will revert to zero over the remaining life.
As a general comment on deposit pricing, overall, we held pricing relatively stable in Q2. However, we did increase
pricing for some Commercial and Wealth Management clients late in the quarter, and this will impact Q3 NII. While
holding pricing relatively steady, we were able to grow deposits 9% year-over-year in our Consumer segment.
Looking forward to Q3, please keep three additional things in mind. First with respect to rates, the most recent June
short-end rate hike should benefit Q3 NII subject to continued stability and industry deposit pricing. But the Q2 decline
in long-end rates will have a negative lag effect in Q3 with respect to the write-off of premium associated with
prepayment of mortgage-backed securities.
Second, we will benefit from one additional day of interest. And third, going forward, we will also feel the effects of
the full quarter loss of interest income from UK card equating to about $225 million. Having said all that, we would
expect NII to be up compared to Q2 if the forward curve is realized and if we have some loan and deposit growth.
With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to
increase NII by $3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is broadly in line with our position at the end of the
first quarter and continues to be predominantly driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates.
Turning to slide 12, non-interest expense was $13.7 billion. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 included roughly $400 million
in higher costs from the combination of impairment costs associated with the sale of a few data centers and higher

severance costs. Otherwise, litigation and other operating costs were lower. We feel good about our expense progress
this quarter, especially in light of our continued investments in sales professionals and new technology.
Also remember, we have $100 million in higher quarterly costs from FDIC assessments compared to Q2 2016. The
efficiency ratio hit our 60% target this quarter, improving 300 basis points year-over-year. With respect to associate
levels, on a full-time equivalent basis, we are down modestly from the prior quarter.
Please note that we have changed our disclosure on employees from FTE to head count this quarter. By the way, that
was the same idea from one of our associates. FTE is much more complicated to calculate and less relevant today given
our shift from part time associates, as you can see the head count is down more than 4,000 from Q2 2016. Half of that
decrease is driven by UK card and half by Consumer Banking optimization.
Note, the continuing shift from non-client-facing associates to primary sales professionals, which now make up 21% of
our head count. Compared to Q1 2017 the release of associates from the sale of UK card was offset by bringing on
1,500 summer interns and hiring 1,000 primary sales professionals. Just a quick observation on these interns, we
selected these 1,500 students from 133,000 applications, as we continue to be an employer of choice. From a diversity
perspective, 42% of these interns are female and 53% are ethnically diverse.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 13. Consumer Banking recorded their
highest earnings in a decade. Earnings were $2 billion growing 21% year-over-year and returning 22% on allocated
capital. The business created 900 basis points of operating leverage holding expenses flat while growing revenue 9%.
Year-over-year, average loans grew 8%. Average deposits grew 9%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 21%,
improvement in NII drove the 9% revenue growth, which was driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the
rise in short-end rates as well as solid loan growth. Note that the rate paid on deposits in this business remains low at 4
basis points, as we remain very disciplined on pricing.
Non-interest income included improvement in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than
offset by a decline in mortgage banking income. Through continued efforts to drive costs down, the efficiency ratio
improved nearly 500 basis point to 52%. Cost of deposits fell below 160 basis points in the quarter. Consumer Banking
credit quality remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 121 basis points.
Turning to slide 14 and looking at key trends. Our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing
total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline. The concept of total revenue is important,
as you evaluate NII and fee movements.
Mortgage banking income is lower driven by our strategy of holding more of our originations on our balance sheet
instead of selling to the agencies. We believe retaining these mortgages on our balance sheet provides better economics
over time. In Q2, we retained about 90% of our mortgage production on balance sheet. Also note that our relationship
deepening Preferred Rewards program is improving NII and balance growth, while holding fee lines flat as we reward
customers for doing more business with us.
Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 6% year-over-year and new issuance of credit cards was solid at 1.3
million. Spending levels on cards drives revenue but are largely offset by rewards given back to customers.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom left, you can see that the success we continue to have growing deposits,
loans and brokerage assets. At the bottom right, you can see deposits broken out. Our 9% year-over-year average
deposit growth continues to outpace the industry while the rate paid remains low and stable. Importantly 50% of these
deposits are checking accounts and we estimate 90% of these checking accounts are the primary accounts of
households.
With respect to loans, residential mortgage continues to lead our growth, while we also saw growth in card and auto.
Client brokerage assets are up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong client flows as well as market performance; new
accounts grew 10% from Q2 2016.

The digitalization efforts that Brian discussed earlier and other productivity improvements continued to drive expenses
lower. Expenses were stable compared to Q2 2016 despite strong revenue growth and increases in the FDIC assessment
rate and charges. We continue to remain focused on prime and super-prime borrowers with average book FICO scores
of at least 760.
Turning to slide 15, let's review Global Wealth and Investment Management, which produced record earnings of $804
million, a pre-tax margin of 28% and a return on allocated capital of 23%. The industry continues to evolve as firms
and client anticipate do fiduciary requirements and other market dynamics such as the shift between active and passive
investing.
At the same time, the financial markets continue to provide a tailwind to client activity and balances. We saw $28
billion of AUM flow this quarter, continuing the strength of $29 billion in Q1. Net interest income rose 14%, driven by
an increase in the value of deposits given the rising short-end rates as well as an increase in loans.
Year-over-year, non-interest income improved 3%. However, note that in Q2 2016, non-interest income included a $60
million gain from the sale of cash management capabilities as we transition from proprietary products to open
architecture. Adjusting for that prior period gain, non-interest income improved 5% as 10% higher asset management
fees were partially offset by lower transactional revenue.
Year-over-year, expenses were up 3% from revenue related incentives as well as higher FDIC costs. Revenue growth
outpaced revenue related expense producing solid operating leverage.
Moving to slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances now exceed $2.6 trillion, driven
by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth. Average deposits of $254 billion were down
$12 billion from Q1, reflecting both normal seasonality from tax payments as well as client shifts to investment in
AUM and brokerage. Average loans of $151 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Loan growth remained concentrated in
consumer real estate as well as structured lending.
Turning to slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.8 billion in Q2. Earnings increased 19% from Q2 2016 driven by good
results across investment banking and treasury services. Return on allocated capital was up year-over-year to 18%
despite an increase in capital allocated to this business.
A number of results to note, given the strong performance, record revenue in the quarter, record advisory fees, record
first half revenue and net income, and year-to-date, we remain ranked number three in investment banking with fees of
$3.1 billion.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 7% coupled with flat expenses drove operating leverage of 600 basis points.
Provision expense of $15 million in Q2 2017 is down $184 million, driven by improvements across most of the
portfolio, particularly energy.
Global Banking loan growth was 3% year-over-year. The pace of loan growth remains good, but has slowed, driven by
both capital markets disintermediation as well as reduced demand from clients as they look for more certainty of
economic growth. With respect to disintermediation, clients are using bond issuance to pay down loans and pay off
funded bridges. Global Banking held expenses relatively flat compared to Q2 2016 as savings offset higher technology
investment.
Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, average loans were up $11 billion or 3%. With the
exception of CRE, loan growth was fairly broad based with C&I loans, up 5% in middle-market lending.
Average deposits were stable relative to Q2 2016, NII growth drove the 7% year-over-year revenue increase. NII
increased $286 million from Q2 2016, driven by an increase in the value of deposits, given the rise in short term rates
as well as increase in loans, partially offset by modest spread compression on loans.
Total investment banking fees of $1.5 billion were up 9% from Q2 2016, finishing strong in the last few weeks of the
quarter. As I mentioned, record M&A fees drove the increase. Within debt capital markets we saw a solid increase in
investment grade fees while leverage finance declined.

Switching to Global Markets on slide 19. The business had a solid quarter earning $830 million or $928 million, if one
excludes net DVA. Global Markets generated a 10% return on allocated capital. Earnings were down relative to Q2
2016, which if you remember was uncharacteristically strong, given a rebound from a weak Q1 2016 and the Brexit
vote.
Just to complete the picture, remember Q3 last year was also atypically stronger than Q2 2016. 2017 has followed a
more typical seasonal pattern so far this year while Q2 was solid, sales and trading excluding DVA declined 9% from
Q2 2016.
But comparing the first half results of 2017 to 2016, sales and trading ex-DVA increased 6%. This is the first time in
the past five years that first half performance is up year-over-year. With respect to expenses, Q2 2017 was 3% higher
than Q2 2016, driven by increased technology investment.
Moving to trends on slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading
revenue of $3.4 billion excluding net DVA was down 9% from Q2 2016 finishing ahead of our mid-quarter
expectations.
Excluding net DVA and versus Q2 2016, FICC sales and trading of $2.3 billion decreased 14%. Within FICC, the
year-over-year decline was driven by stronger rates in emerging markets in Q2 2016. Equity sales in trading was up 3%
year-over-year to $1.1 billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity offset by slower secondary market
revenue.
On slide 21, we show all other, which reported a net loss of $183 million. This includes the $100 million after-tax gain
associated with the sale of UK card. Revenue here also includes a roughly $800 million pre-tax gain from the UK card
transaction which was almost entirely offset by related tax expense recorded here as well.
Noninterest expense includes the datacenter impairment charge, I mentioned earlier, which was mostly offset by lower
personnel and other operating costs. When comparing expenses and earnings to Q1 2017 remember Q1 2017 includes
seasonal retirement eligible incentives and elevated payroll tax expense of $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate for the
quarter was 37.1%, which includes approximately $700 million of tax expense recorded in conjunction with the sale of
UK card. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for the rest of the year absent unusual
items.
Okay. A few summary points to wrap up. Again, this quarter we created operating leverage by managing expenses
while improving revenue. For years, we have been focused on growing responsibly including staying within our risk
and client frameworks as well as simplifying the company to improve operational efficiency all aimed at making our
growth more sustainable.
In Q2, consistent with this strategy, we stuck to our strong underwriting standards, while growing loans and investing
in our clients in Global Markets. Asset quality remained strong as net charge-offs, NPLs, delinquencies and
commercial reservable criticized exposure all declined.
Several of the businesses set new records for revenue or earnings as we grow with our clients and manage costs well.
Importantly, we continue to invest in new technology and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain
businesses. And we significantly increased the amount of capital we return to shareholders and announced plans to
increase that even more. These results tell us that responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to
continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate all the detail on the net interest income discussion. One piece of it on
the repo borrowings part of it, the equity financing side. I'm curious if you think of that as a little episodic and you kind
of just go with the flow or is it more a permanent part of the strategy where you're using your strong balance sheet to
help grow? The tag along to that is if it's more permanent, why do it through repo, is that more expensive?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think it's a little bit of both. So we did make a decision to invest more on our equities
business this quarter. That's going to go up and down depending on client activity in every quarter. We could always
change our mind. But generally we've made a decision to add more balance sheet to equities because we see an
opportunity there and because our customers would like us to do that.
In terms of how we add that balance sheet, that definitely can change one quarter to another. This quarter it was a lot of
synthetic which tends to happen when you have clients overseas who have some demand. Net quarter it could be more
plain OPB and that does change the mix of NII when that happens. But it's based upon client demand not necessarily
how we want to manage one part of our P&L versus another.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Got it. I appreciate that. Then the tag along for net interest income guidance is, as you
mentioned, very low deposit beta on the Consumer side, just 2 basis points up in the quarter. Is there a point in time
where you expect that to accelerate over the next couple of hikes? I know we all kind of ask the same thing each
quarter but it's amazingly low.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, look, we're watching it closely. I guess I would point out that Bank of America and
the industry really haven't increased, as you point out, deposit rates on traditional bank accounts. I think we believe we
deliver a lot of value to depositors. Transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, online banking, nationwide
network, rewards, advice and counsel.
There's some real value to having a relationship with us and I think there's value plus the fact that there's been a lack of
market pressure so far that's allowed us on traditional accounts to leave rates relatively flat.
We are starting to see some rate increases on some account types in GWIM and in Global Banking. And if you look at
our models, they anticipate that we're going to have to start raising eventually based upon historical experience. But the
bottom line is we're going to balance our customer needs and the competitive environment with our shareholder interest
and do the right thing. So we'll just have to wait and see.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Brian, I'd just add. When you dig into the supplement and other materials and sort of look at
the Consumer business, even the GWIM business, we have to focus on the core checking balances in the Consumer on
a $650 billion deposit base or $320 billion. And so that is 10 years of hard work of driving core operating accounts to
the consumer where their core checking balances in the primary account, as we call it, run near 90%, up from the 60s
and 70s many years ago. And those are zero interest and they'll remain zero interest because that's the nature of the
beast. So where you'll see other areas like CDs year-over-year down again 10%.
And so, we have been driving this business to be core, core, and core and that's what's happening. In GWIM, you're
seeing the pieces that were functionally investment equivalent move faster. But we feel good about it. We feel good
about how we're driving both the value to the consumer for the total of our services relative to the interest rate paid on
certain types of deposits and frankly relative to the non-interest-bearing deposits.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Great. Thanks, both. Appreciate it.

<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Just to follow-up on the NII, Paul, it sounds like when you net a few positives and
negatives in terms your NII outlook for next quarter, are you expecting a modest increase in the third quarter as of
now? Could you put any size parameters on that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: No. I think we want to get out of the game of putting size parameters on it. I've given you all
the inputs. I can run through them again, if you'd like. But look, we feel good about where we are, that we had some
transient kind of things this quarter. There are a lot of variables that go into this. One of the biggest one is by the way
predicting people's behaviors, predicting customer. So I wouldn't want to give you a number. If you want, I'd be happy
to go through kind of all the different ins and outs again, if you want, but...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: No. That's fine. Maybe you could just remind us how much the Fed hike itself, what
your estimate of how much that helps the June hike? And then also just how much did the lower 10-year hurt in the
second quarter? How should we think about the 10-year impact going forward? So the short-end and the long-end
impacts would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. Look, again, I won't give you a number, but we had a significant improvement in NII
from the short-end, but the long end also did significantly impact us relative to what we were expecting. Because, as
you know, we have a securities portfolio and as rates change, their customer behavior changes and we can amortize
more or less of that premium.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then, just on expenses, could you help us think through the expense
trajectory for the back half of the year and, more importantly, your current thoughts on the target for the $53 billion in
next year? And some of maybe the tech consolidation you did this quarter, how does that impact either the timing or
just confidence level on delivering the expense saves?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. We feel good about our goal. I'll remind everybody that some time ago now, we said
that our full year 2018 expense would be approximately $53 billion. A lot has changed since then. Good, bad,
whatever, a lot of things have changed, but we're still very confident in that goal. To get there we feel like we need to
run in a normal quarter at around kind of $13 billion and then you've got he first quarter that has $1 billion or so more
in retirement eligible and FICA.
If you look at our expenses this quarter, right, we reported $13.7 billion. Last year we reported $13.5 billion. If you
back out the data center and the elevated severance, we'd be at $13.3 billion. So we think we made pretty good progress
year-over-year and we just have to continue to make that type of progress over the next few quarters and we'll get there.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Effectively, John, it's about $100 million step-down over the next couple quarters, which
has been very consistent with what we've been doing. Over the past several quarters, we used to have the major drops
as we get a position, but it's going to have been $100 million-ish year-over-year step-down from the prior year, and so
you'll see that kind of play out, we think.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

And we'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe getting back to the deposit question. You guys are
growing 9% in the Consumer book, better than the industry despite holding low, obviously reflecting your mix. How
far do you think – A, I guess, can you give your sense of what you think is driving sort of that market share? And is this

something where you're willing to test the patience of your customers to lag deposit rates until growth slows more
materially? How do we think about what your decision making process is in terms of rates in the Consumer book?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah. I would make it. Jim, I'd look at more to the broader aspects of your question, some
of the statistics that I talked about earlier. What has been driving this has been in end of the day to get ourselves a
position as the core transaction – in the transaction side of the Consumer business, as a core transaction provider to
every household. And we have our checking account numbers are growing now couple of hundred thousand net new
checking accounts this quarter type of numbers, but have been falling from 37 million in small business consumer
combined down to about 34-ish million. And so we had run off a lot of stuff that were extra checking accounts and
things like that starting 10 years ago frankly.
And so that's what plays to your benefit here because in the end of the day as rates continue to rise, if they continue to
rise, the value of the consumer deposit franchise, as you know, being around this industry for a long time, is going to be
driven by the Advantage and the Checking balances and then some of the other balances will help, but they'll be more
rate sensitive. So it comes more from the operating business than it does from any strategy on actual pricing because
those are free balances and will remain free.
So the question then is how do you gain share and what you see is if you think about it year-over-year our Consumer
business grew about $60 billion in deposits and around about half of that was in checking account balances, one half of
that.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Great.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And that is driven by the innovation I talked about 1 billion digital interactions this
quarter, 22.9 million active digital mobile customers, 30-odd million active digital customers, more and more
capabilities there and becoming more and more embedded in everything that consumer does. And that that means
you're gaining share against people don't have all those capabilities in our minds.
And so as you think about it, that's what's going to drive a lot of deposit value. And if you look at some of the rates and
volumes charts, you get to the interesting things, you look at the corporation overall, year-over-year our deposit costs
on interest-bearing not non-interest-bearing were up $100 million, $60 million of that was in the U.S. and $40 million
of it is on 10% the interest-bearing deposits outside the U.S. So there's not even that much movement on the
interest-bearing part.
So we feel good about the franchise and where we need to price because it's more investment oriented. Say in the
GWIM business, we've priced to maintain those balances. Half of what went out of GWIM this quarter was us putting
people into the market based on our allocation methodology. So irrespective of the rate that went into the market as
opposed into other cash equivalent. So it really comes from all the different advantages we've been driving at to drive
this franchise for 10 years.
<Q - James Mitchell>: All right. Well, thanks for that. Maybe Brian to follow-up on regulation. Obviously, the
Treasury report seemed pretty favorable for the industry. You're not really leverage constrained. Is there any aspect of
the recommendations that you would find most helpful to your business?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: All of them would be helpful in a sense that and that there is a good amount of work that's
gone in by all the industry groups, all the individual companies, and the administration to come up with a list of things
that, you know, our belief is we want responsible, clear, transparent, and regulation that helps maintain the safety and
soundness and capabilities of this industry.
There's no question, but in areas where things have gotten too far you've got to bring them back a little bit and that
lottery list is really there to provide it. So while some are more important to our franchise than maybe other people's
franchise and vice versa, at the end of the day a careful revisiting of some of these things to ensure that we maintain the
safety and soundness while getting good regulation is critical, and I think hopefully the ball is moving forward on that.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay. Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. If I can ask questions on the card business. First of all I notice that the card
losses were up first to second. They're typically down. And I was wondering if you can help us understand just where
we are in the seasoning of the portfolio also noting that the risk adjusted margin continues to slip as well. So what do
you think about card losses going forward and when do we see that bottoming of the card margin? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. So let's start with NCOs, charge-offs this quarter were 2.87%, they were at 2.66% last
quarter, last year I should say. That – both of those numbers and that delta is completely within kind of our expectation
and modeling for the portfolio well within our risk parameters.
As you think about what's going on here, we've got a portfolio; we've got a back book that is in great shape, that's
getting smaller every day. And we've got a front book where that we're growing that is seasoning.
So that's what's driving up the NCOs in a natural way, very gradually. Also a little different phenomenon going on sort
of this year, obviously, there's some seasonality as you go throughout the year. So as you think about the future next
couple of quarters we've got seasonality, which is going to be all else equal, if the year's normal it's going to be
lowering the net charge-off rate. But you've got some season that's going to be increasing it, so we'll just have to see
how that plays out over the next couple of quarters.
What was the second part of your question?
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Just on the risk adjusted – the card risk adjusted margin.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. Well, sure. I mean, a couple of things. One, I tend to think of it as opposed to the
margin as just the dollars that we're producing there. And we've got modest growth in the number of cards outstanding.
We've got good growth in debit and credit card spend. And you know just focusing on the margin; I think overlooks
some key benefits of our strategy to attract relatively higher quality card customers and reward them for deepening
their overall relationship with us.
That strategy is driving incremental deposit growth and making those deposits a little bit stickier, so that helps NII. It
also – if you think about these customers, they have lower loss rates and they tend to reduce their interaction with the
call center. We also have a model that has lower acquisition cost in terms of those new cards. So you know and that's
how we think about it. Yeah, if you just want to focus in on the risk adjustment margin that's going to I think perform
well in line with the industry and probably just a little bit lower, but we're more focused on total revenue.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood. And if I can just ask one big picture one, all the points you made earlier, all the credit
metrics are going the right way otherwise NPAs, inflows et cetera. Kind of coming back into this point about where
card's going and then just not seeing anything else, you guys have been at 40 basis points of losses, any reason to see
that changing really? And then do you still have some room for release as well given that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look absent some change in the world and the economic situation, we don't see a reason
why that necessarily changes materially. I don't want to give you guidance, but that's kind of our view. In terms of
releases, we are building. I just pointed out we're growing loans. We're growing card. Things are seasoning that
seasoning. So you know we may have some releases, but I would more think of those releases as potentially offsetting
some of that growth.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Brian, two questions. One on the Consumer Banking efficiency ratio, you mentioned
you know that there still is room for that to fall from the 52% which is obviously very efficient as it stands right now
today. And you know you indicated all various opportunities to drive incremental revenues at a much improved
expense ratio with all the digital that you outlined earlier. But could you speak to how the branch network could also
impact those numbers? I mean your branch has been coming down about 3% the last couple of years. Is that the kind of
pace that you think you're going to continue or does the digital improvements enable you to move even faster there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well I think Betsy to be careful there, you have to go back to the broadest context which is
the 6100 to 45, we got after this relatively early and so we've got to down a level.
We don't know where it goes from here, because it will be based on customer behavior demands. But if you go back, if
you think about it, over the last several years, we've been adding branches in places like Denver and we'll continue to
build out there. We have been refurbishing branches heavily across the whole franchise. That's all in this run rate you
see.
And that will continue in this is in – and the expectation I'm talking about. So we'll – think we've drifted down 15, 17
branches linked quarter, a 100 odd year-over-year, that'll continue to happen. But I think what you would expect is the
efficiency of that system continues to improve dramatically.
So let me give you an example, in Chicago we had to pull one of these old big branches and what we've done is create a
call center in there to and we have 70 teammates going to work in a call environment just to use up the physical space
to keep the branch open as opposed to cold closing the branch.
So, if you think about it from that scheme, because of the telephony capabilities that exist today, you could actually
distribute phone calls down to individual people based on the number coming in and things like that local call. So we've
done that in three or four markets. We continue to use up the excess capacity. So you wouldn't see a branch decline
there but you'd see 80% of its real estate goes for a different purpose.
So it's a very complex thing, and I don't like to get caught by numbers. I'd say that you've seen us manage it well and
we'd expect to continue to manage it well in the future but we're not going to get ahead of the customer and create any
disruption to the growth we're seeing in the core channels.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, thanks for that. And then separately, you've spoken before about the op-risk
SA-CCR RWA burden that you guys have. We had some questions coming on how you're thinking improvements there
could help you given that it's not directly in the CCAR stress test. But you know, maybe you could give us a sense as to
how you think any changes could help you given that it's not a constraining factor?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Right. I think you've seen us start to make improvements and changes have gone through
in the overall advanced RWA, op-risk being a portion of that. The change had been more in other areas quite frankly.
We'll expect to see further, but you have to be careful. At some point standardized then backs into your constraint. And,
so this will be a toggle between for a long time standard advanced was our need in over the years. Now it's coming
down in advance.
And so standardized at some point will countervail the improvement overall. And then we'll go to work on standardized
quite frankly. So expect us to continue to work on optimization of balance sheet. Really at the end of day you know,
opening up the difference between our GAAP capital levels for lack of better term in our regulatory capital levels so
we're down RWA on advanced based down $30-odd billion this quarter. Expect that to continue improve but be careful
at some point it hits the other side in a world we have so much excess capital is kind of an interesting exercise. But in a
world where we actually start returning that capital through our earnings we're going to have to continue to optimize
both sides of that equation.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then just lastly, you had a nice increase in the dividend. Could you just speak to,
how you're thinking about dividend payout ratios? Do you feel like you – where you should be given the business
model or is there more room and if there is more room what the drivers are to effect that change?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We've always been clear that we in the guidance still relative to large banks is out there of
sort of 30% of earnings to dividends and 70% to share buybacks. We think that the shares are a tremendous value and
we'll continue to do that. And with $17 billion over the next 12 months we can make some headway. So think about
30/70 split for us in the large bank category I think that's a responsible place to be. Right now we're moving up towards
that but we're not quite there.

And we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning guys.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: In looking at your ROE, your returns on allocated capital in the Consumer and Wealth
Management businesses are very strong well over 20%, Global Bank's 18%, Global Markets' about 10%. Can you share
with us, how you're going to get the 8% ROE up let's say above your cost of capital let's say 10%? Is it going to be
more coming from the Global Markets area or management of the capital or somewhere else?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Well, the first thing I would point out is that we have a goal to get our ROE up and we have
a goal on our return on tangible common equity. 1% on ROE we're making a lot of progress, return on tangible
common equity we want to get to 12%. We're at 11.2% this quarter. And we've been making steady progress and if we
stay focused on operating leverage and doing the right things for our customers, we know we're going to get there. I
would make a point to Brian, what Brian was talking about earlier about our excess capital.
So if you just look at the 11.2% return on tangible common equity we have this quarter and if we ran the company at
10% capital instead of 11.5% that would still be above our regulatory minimum. We'd have a 50 basis point buffer.
That would have increased that return on tangible common equity to 12.6%. So we're at our goal right now. From an
operating standpoint, if we could just continue to make progress on the amount of excess capital we have at the
company. In terms of ROE, look we've got a lot of goodwill. We could tomorrow just wear-off all that goodwill.
Nothing would change at the company. Your ROE would just go up to your return on tangible common equity.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. And then coming back to the mobile users, I think you guys pointed out you had
just shy of 23 million mobile users. What percentage of your customer base are mobile users and where do you see that
number going to in the next two to three years?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: You know I think every time I say this can't go up because we're starting to – have some
inflection point where you've got penetration it continues to go up. So I think you know we have 30 odd million
checking holder. So think about the delta between those two being available for lack of a better term.
You've got 34 million digital users. And so you still have some digital only users who don't use the mobile phone just
because they do it which means they come through the website instead of an app for example. And so each year we
think it's not going to – you know you're starting to hit possible inflection point that goes up 10%, 15% year-over-year.
And so I think there's headroom ahead of us.
So I think of us having you know 30% more that we could get just easily and we're growing the customer base and
we'll drive it. And as you see norms change, you'll see that penetration continue to increase. The important thing isn't
necessarily only that 22.9 million users. The important thing is how people use it. And so just take the P2P payments.
Even though we do $18 billion this quarter, even though it's been a product we've had for a while, even though we're

going to relaunch it we'll see how -we'll see how that will drive it. It's still 3%.
And even though all the wallets whether it's Apple or Samsung or Android or etcetera all those are out there. There's
still 1.5% of payments. And so you know in the end of the day you know we had a lot of work within the customer base
and how they use all the form factors to get more efficient and more effective for them. On top of what you think is
more use – more penetration so to speak. So we've got a long way to go on penetration. Only 22% of the sales are done.
So we'll continue to drive that but importantly for the team Thong and Dean and the team is to drive that usage up and
that's where we're starting to see some good pickup but there's a lot of room to go there.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Brian, you mentioned Gazelle, any early read on what you're seeing there and when do you
expect to have a broad launch of that product if you haven't done it already?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Its Zelle not Gazelle. But I don't want to violate anybody else's trademark here. But-
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Sure.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It's still pretty early. The nice thing is that the industry has better network among all of us
that allows us to operate very easily among us, of all the companies. And I think the better time talking about would be
in six months or so after we've gotten everybody up and operating and driving it through. But previous this we were
already driving and it was up double digits year-over-year. And so this is sort of just the awareness and with the
students signing up for accounts from now to the fall, you'll see a lot of embedding this in our marketing and our
capabilities. So, look, maybe next quarter we'll have a better read.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Did you guys disclose the debt hedge
ineffectiveness drag that was in net interest income this quarter?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We didn't disclose the amount. It was meaningful, not like huge amount, but it was
meaningful. And again, I would remind everybody that over time is just going to reverse itself.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. Does that show up in the 10-Q or can't remember where we got that from?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: No. I don't think so.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah. Matt, at the highest level, remember we ate up. If we go back and think about where
we started the quarter, where we ended it, we took out about half of what we thought the increase was going to be due
to the card. The rest of its all the factors Paul is talking about, the ins and outs and chewed up the other half of the
projected increase, so give you a sense of dimension.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, the expenses related to the UK card business that go
away, how much is that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. Look, let me just run you through the whole picture, okay, if you want to build any
models. On the revenue side, it's primarily interest income, think about $10 billion of receivables at 9%, plus you've got
a little small amount of card income. Think that was around $30 million in the second quarter.
The efficiency ratio for that business is around 40%. If you look in our supplement, you can see I think the net
charge-off ratios. It's been running a little bit less than 2%, call it $40 million, $45 million per quarter. I think that
probably gives you just about everything you need to model it. Oh, I would remind you that when we sold it, we did get
12 and 15 basis point improvement in our CET ratio on a advanced and standardized perspective respectively.

And we'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Hi, good morning. So, Brian, I appreciate the helpful commentary you've given on capital
ratios and the continued effort to optimize your RWAs. And just given the significant capital cushion that you're
operating with today, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the payout trajectory over the next couple of years.
And maybe, just to help us frame it from an ROE perspective, because you did note that your excess capital continues
to be a drag on returns, what do you believe is a reasonable spot capital target for you to manage to through the cycle?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, if you take that the 9.5% as the place we're at, we'd have 50 basis points or so of
cushion on that at all times and so that gives you a sense where we are, and we're running 11.5% and that difference is
available, so you'd expect more. That's assuming that we have 2% growth environment and continue to grow and
there's no big recession that comes, we continue to ask for more capital return.
I think, keep you focused in the near term, we've got $17 billion-plus that we've got to take out in the next four quarters
which is a pretty healthy chunk. And then we'll go through next year CCAR process and you'd expect us like the
industry to keep stepping that up to start to work against that excess.
Against that, when Paul talked about the last question, the UK card, remember that the thing that people have to think
about is not only does it give you current capital benefit, but also in the stress, the losses and stuff are out of the system
so you can also pick that up.
So, I'd say, simply point in the next 12 months we're going to return more capital we earned in 2016, to give you a
framework. And we'd expect to ask for – as we earn more in 2017, we'd expect to ask for more for the next ask and
keep driving that forward. And everything contributed, better asset quality, better earnings, and better modeling and
everything else. So our CCAR losses continue to come down, and we continue to drive the responsible growth. So just
think about that as a framework to say more in the future. But we've got a nice pickup just coming in the next four
quarters.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Got it. And then just on some of the expense initiatives, Brian, that you outlined, I'm getting
quite a few questions on how we should think about it from a timing perspective. I know that you have the $53 billion
expense target that's out there. But just given some of the efficiency opportunities that you identified, should we expect
that progress to continue beyond 2018?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah. You just asked me what have you done for me lately. Well, getting to $53 billion
first, Steven, and then we'll move from there. But the idea is that, if you sort of think about an expense base of a
financial services firm, and Bank of America in particular, about two-thirds of the cost are people cost, the cost of
salaries and wages, incentives, et cetera, health care costs rising at 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% a year. And so our job is to figure
out how to pay our teammates fairly and more, for more productively and what they do to drive for you as
shareholders. And if you just lock in a growth rate on just that part of the expense base, you're locking 2% growth. So
what we do through all these initiatives is figure out a way we can turn that into being on a core basis year-over-year
sort of flattish.
And so whether the $53 billion keeps coming down or stays flat or revenue keeps going up both – that will produce
further operating leverage. And so we haven't made projections past the $53 billion, more just because we've got a lot
of initiatives coming in. But you should expect that we will be just as disciplined and thoughtful about how we both
invest and invest to take out expense that we've been so far. And I think that will redound to our benefit in terms of
keeping those expenses relatively flat as revenues grow in the future.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Thanks, Brian. And just one more quick one from me. Just on the DOL fiduciary rule, you'd
outlined your strategy previously for stopping or no longer engaging in retirement brokerage activities but just giving

the potential for that rule to be repealed, I'm wondering if your thinking has evolved around that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd say let's see what happens. I don't think it will change our thinking. We have
accommodated customers' larger balances in some of the areas and some cash IRAs and things that get a little bit
different, but just out of necessity. But the overall trend of driving towards the model products and driving towards the
effectiveness and offsetting demands for lower and lower cost structure the customer pays in fees to get higher and
higher services and the capabilities from us is what's driving this. The fiduciary rule is only a part of it. And so I don't
expect to change our course.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Thanks for taking my questions.

And we'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi. Good morning. First, wanted to follow up on the net interest income, the 100 basis point –
the benefit of the $3.2 billion you get from 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, you mentioned it's primarily
sensitive to the short-end. I think last quarter you gave a sort of a 75:25 split between short- and long-end. Is that still a
good rule of thumb to use?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: It's changed a little bit. We are a little bit more sensitive on the long-end now that interest
rates went down, the asset sensitivity in the short-end hasn't changed that much.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. So, a little bit more skewed to the long-end than the disclosure in 1Q.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: It's like two-thirds, one-third.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Just to back up, in the first half of the year, when you think about the rate environment it's
really changed on the short-end just to give you a sense how it works. We've got $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion to $1.5
billion pickup in first half NII versus last year. And so, you know, that gives you a sense. It really is driven 60%, 70%
depending on the quarter by the short-end.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think that's an important point. I mean, again we picked up that $1.5 billion, and you
haven't seen the sensitivity change much. So that tells you kind of what was embedded in the passthroughs in the first
half of the year.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. Got it. Moving on, just to discuss capital deployment strategies a little bit. You've talked
about your excess capital position, obviously, you upped your returns in this CCAR cycle and you'll keep going
forward with that. But is it too early to talk about acquisitions as part of the capital strategy? And how would you think
about M&A in terms of opportunities, whether from a product strategy, geographic segmentation standpoint, how do
you think about M&A in the context of your capital strategy?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We don't think about M&A in the context of our capital strategy. We are organically
growing this company, including opening up in markets, investing in bankers, investing in branches, investing in
things, and investing in cash management capabilities, we've built out a lot in Asia. Tom Montag and the team driving
our global franchise, we just don't need the distraction.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.

And we'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.

the customer growth and business growth. I mean, that was one of my main concerns after so many years of having to

deal with the overhang issues to be able to kind of reenergize and get that business segments growing again. What are
the couple of things that you could say has helped go through that inflection point as quick as you've been able to do
that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, I think, depending on the business, at the end of day if you go across eight businesses
and the relation of business it's been just deploying more and more relationship management team mates, and being
able to pay for that while bringing expenses down across the board.
So, that's whether its U.S. Trust or Merrill Lynch, the Preferred business and Consumer, the Business Banking, Global
Commercial Bank, Corporate and Investment Banking, and driving that always had great products. We just literally had
to add more sales teams. Behind that has also been the deployment and technology helped our sales teams. We're using
artificial intelligence to prioritize their work in terms of targeting their efforts.
And then if you look in both the markets and the markets business separate from the commercial side of it, in a true
markets business, when you look in the mass market consumer business what we call retail, you see that the nice thing
about the retail business, the mass market is we are now growing and making money in a business which was a little bit
tricky and that's largely because the electronification, digitization has been driving it.
And then if you go to markets, the team in equities and fixed income has done a great job of repositioning that business
and its gaining share. So in each case its investments in people, technology, better customer experience and that all
sounds like you say it all the time, but it has been relentless focus in just driving that and investing behind that at all
time taking out some of the extraneous costs including credit costs through very disciplined client selection and credit
underwriting capabilities.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Paul, wanted to – sort of a second question – look at you know we've talked about you know the
core, core, core and that the company has taken actions to try to drive that. But really we've had an historical shift in the
liquidity premium coming out of the financial crisis and just having rates at zero. So hasn't a lot of this shift been
related to just the environment more than really company actions? And what we're seeing has been the de-risking now
that GWIM deposits are starting to move out, is that the first sign of you know the rerisking or the customer's willing to
take a little bit more risk and drop that liquidity premium? So I'm kind of watching for that first sign of the customer
behavior beginning to change.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, Marty, over across all the years since the crisis there has been ebbs and flows in
customers views about where they want to invest and the cash portion of our balances has come up and down. But I
think the consumer and the investor are very bullish on America and they continue investing in, consumers through
their spending and activity do and the investors you know on the personal side through their investments. And you've
seen those investments in equities and risk products continue to rise almost without fail. And then you know when
there's real market disruption concern, you see a pullback a little bit, but basically without fail has been a steady
investment and that's why we've had assets under management levels of record levels at this point.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: It just seemed like there was a little bit of a change seen there. You'll see it kind of ripple into
some of the other business maybe later, but the third question was, with what's going on in the mortgage business.
You're retaining 90% of the loans in the past – well, I don't know the number, but I bet you were securitizing before the
financial crisis approximately 90% of the loans. How do you look at that business different? That that is such a
paradigm shift that you really are now a portfolio lender much more than you are a securitization. Is there any other
dynamics that we should look at separately?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, you have to. The business that – pre-crisis that came out of some of the other firms
and et cetera was driven by a basic view of generating more and more mortgages as opposed to customers and
penetration of customers and giving mortgage to the customers.
And so one of the way – the major way it did it 75% of its production was bought from third-parties, either through
correspondents or brokers or whatever the methodology. All of that's gone.

And so, if you had that size of production that was bought in a secondary market through wholesale trades of the
production, you would have to go off-balance because you wouldn't have the capacity. During the 2004 to 2008, we
generated $2 trillion of mortgages or something like that. So you had to go off-balance sheet.
Now where we're in now where your quarterly production runs $13 billion, $15 billion and this huge deposit franchise
that needs to be invested, you can put those mortgages on the balance sheet. The odd thing would be, in the past we
were setting them off and then buying back mortgage-backed securities, the answer is, we just retain the mortgages and
frankly with the credit quality of ours, it's not worth paying the insurance.
And so it's really – but it really came by focusing on what we call direct-to-consumer where our market share continues
to be solid and really saying, we're in this business. It's always been a tough business. It's you know, priced on a
commodity basis. It's on your screen every day. And the MSR assets always had interesting issues of how you could
hedge them and make them work.
Our goal as a company was to take all that volatility and up and down out and just focusing on getting mortgages to our
customers of high credit quality. And then why wouldn't we keep them? Because you know in the end of day we've got
to invest our deposits somewhere and these are great investments.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: They're our customers. It's not like we're – as Brian said, we're not buying somebody else's
underwriting. These are our customers. We know these customers. We were over underwriting these loans and why pay
the insurance.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And it's not just you all, I mean, it's been across the industry where you're seeing much more in
retention than you're seeing in securitization. So I just didn't know if there was any operational or other issues that gives
you more flexibility on pricing or product development. It's a very different market than what it used to be when we
were in it before.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I agree it's a different market and I think a better one because of that.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great. Thanks. I just had question first on the lending environment overall. Can you guys
give an update of the pipelines in – I know last quarter you said middle market revolver you were at record levels there.
You did that. You were able to increase utilization rates there, just kind of give a sense of where your clients are, if
optimism is waning?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We feel good about loan growth unless the economy changes significantly we wouldn't
expect much change from the past few quarters. We did see a little bit of disintermediation this quarter in Commercial
that could slow growth in the future but having said that, we haven't changed our medium term outlook on our ability to
grow loans. We expect total loan growth for the company to be a low single digits and we expect to grow mid-single
digits in our lines of business. You know once you – that obviously excludes the headwind from you know loans in all
other mortgage run-off and now UK card is gone.
So which is back to each segment, we're anticipating modest growth in Consumer led by mortgage. We'd also expect to
grow card and auto, although auto growth has probably slowed a little bit but we still expect a little bit of growth. That
growth is going to be partially offset by continued run-off of home equity loans.
In Commercial, again well, things have slowed a little bit. Our outlook still remains favorable led by middle market.
You saw middle market loans grow 5% year-over-year. And I would note that quarter – growth in any quarter in
Commercial can bounce around a bit because you've got acquisition, financing thrown into the mix. All of that, I think
is consistent with responsible growth.

<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. And then just a question on Wealth and Investment Management, you did see
the financial advisors increase 2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Is that a trend now that you think you can get
back into a hiring phase where you can actually grow the number of financial advisor? Cause I mean productivity also
increased as well so whether there was no drag from hiring those advisors?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We have a tremendous customer base that is underserved in the Investment Management
area. And so we're going to continue to grow our financial advisor team to serve that customer base whether it's the
teams that work in the branches, the teams that work in the Merrill office, the team that work in U.S. Trust. And we've
been after that and growing that. And so you should expect that number to continue to go up if Terry Laughlin, Andy
Sieg, Keith Banks and the team are driving it. And so it's a unit of production for lack of a better term. It's your team
that really has the core customer interface and will drive that. Meanwhile, on the non-financial advisor side you saw the
assets edge up 21%. So that means that we're also facing off against the customers who choose to go about it a different
way.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Sure.

All right. I think operator that's all the call. So I want to thank everyone for joining us again this quarter. I think as you
think about this quarter it's a quarter which shows you what responsible growth's all about. It's solid earnings growth,
very solid operating leverage. Each business grew first half of this year versus first half of last year and did it the right
way, did it while maintaining great risk and did it while we invested heavily in technology and invested in our people.
So we look forward to next quarter and talk to you soon.
Operator
This does conclude today's call. You may disconnect at any time. And have a wonderful day.
