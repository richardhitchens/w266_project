MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Presentation and Conference
Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an
opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead,
sir.
James Dwyer
Thank you, Denise, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by Roy Harvey, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief
Executive Officer; and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your
questions after comments by Roy and Bill.
As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations
that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ
materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings.
In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. Reconciliations to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. Any reference in
our discussion today to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA.
A note on financial statements methodology. Because Alcoa Corporation commenced operations as a standalone public
company on November 1, 2016, the financial statements are a combination of financials carved out from Alcoa Inc.
prior to November 1, 2016 and actual results of Alcoa Corporation thereafter. For example, the second quarter of 2016
results are entirely on a carve-out basis, while the first and second quarter 2017 results are entirely actuals.
Finally, as previously announced, the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website.

With that, here's Roy.
Roy C. Harvey
Thank you, Jim. Welcome to our call to review Alcoa's second quarter result.
Overall, our businesses reported solid financial performance in the second quarter even as we experienced lower
alumina prices versus the first quarter of this year. We also continued to make progress against our strategic priorities.
We grew cash to strengthen the balance sheet and continued to progress on our actions to reduce complexity. We have
accomplished much in this first half of the year as a new company, including producing $1 billion in profit, and we
remain committed to further improving the business for the benefit of our stockholders.
Let's start with a few highlights of the second quarter. We generated adjusted net income of $116 million or $0.62 per
share. We reported $483 million in adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, which is down 9% sequentially as lower
alumina prices more than offset higher aluminum prices. Cash generation was strong. Our cash position increased $150
million from the end of the first quarter to $954 million at the end of second quarter.
In our drive to reduce complexity and lower cost, last week, we announced plans to restart three of the five potlines at
our Warrick aluminum smelter in Indiana. It will supply metal to our co-located rolling mill and improve the overall
efficiency of the integrated site. We continue to work to improve results for our can sheet business in response to the
increased volume that we expect for this rolling mill.
Our fundamental outlook for bauxite, alumina and aluminum is relatively unchanged from last quarter. Our alumina
balance outlook has improved slightly due to higher alumina demand in China. In the aluminum market, similar to last
quarter, recent data indicate that global aluminum demand has strengthened, and we have increased our 2017 global
aluminum demand growth forecast to a range between 4.75% and 5.25%. This additional projected demand is offset by
increased production in China. China has significant work to do to bring its market back into balance, although it has
already announced and taken some action to eliminate its overcapacity.
With this continued strength in both demand and supply and with six months already behind us, we are now
anticipating further increases in our input costs. While cost inflation is never welcome, it is paired with improved
commodity pricing that drives better profitability. As a result of these changes, we have adjusted our 2017 outlook on
net performance to negative $50 million for the year.
We have also tightened our outlook on adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, excluding special
items. This is updated from our forecast of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion in the previous quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Bill for a closer look at our second quarter financials.
William F. Oplinger
Thanks, Roy.
I'll quickly run through the details of the results. And as Jim said, all financials prior to November 2016 are on a
carve-out basis. First up is our quarterly income statement. Sequentially, revenues are up 8%, increasing $204 million
up to $2.9 billion, with higher third-party shipments across all segments. Compared to last year, revenues were up 23%,
increasing $536 million on higher alumina and aluminum prices.
Net income attributable to Alcoa Corporation was $75 million or $0.40 per share, declining $150 million sequentially,
primarily due to the first quarter $120 million gain from the sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric assets.
Let's take a look at the special items in the quarter. Combination of special items this quarter total an unfavorable $41
million after tax. The contributors include discrete tax items of $18 million, comprised of $28 million unfavorable

related to the interim period treatment of operational jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized and $10
million favorable from the difference between the Alcoa consolidated rate and statutory rate on special items.
Other items include restructuring of $11 million, mark-to-market energy contracts of $6 million in Portland restart
power exposure of $6 million. In particular, restructuring items are largely related to labor cost optimization at the
Warrick rolling mill and our smelting system. Portland restart power exposure is the near-term market exposure
resulting from renegotiating the smelters and long-term power contract, and that exposure ends this July.
Now, let's look at adjusted EBITDA, the full income statement after special items. Second quarter adjusted earnings
were slightly below the first quarter, with net income attributable to Alcoa, excluding special items, of $116 million,
but improved $160 million year-over-year. Likewise, adjusted diluted earnings per share was slightly lower
sequentially at $0.62 per share, but up substantially year-over-year.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, is $483 million in the second quarter, down $50 million sequentially, but
up $173 million year-over-year. Some key points on a sequential basis, EBITDA margins tightened to 17% due to
lower alumina prices. Year-over-year margins improved 350 basis points on higher alumina and aluminum prices.
SG&A and R&D increased $1 million from last quarter due to a slight ramp-up in R&D spending. On a constant
currency basis, however, SG&A decreased versus both comparison periods.
For items below the EBITDA line, depreciation increased $11 million sequentially due to non-recurring asset disposals
in Canada and residue disposal area replacement coming online at the same time previous projects were completing
their depreciated lives.
Other income expense at $12 million, improved $37 million, primarily due to foreign currency translation effects.
Interest expense is $25 million, consistent sequentially. Remember that the interest expense of $66 million in the
second quarter of 2016 was interest allocated from our former parent company, Alcoa Inc. Our operational tax rate
depends heavily on the jurisdictions where we have profits and losses. In the second quarter, the rate settled at 32.8%.
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased $8 million sequentially to $72 million due to lower
earnings in our AWAC joint venture. Take a deeper look at the factors driving adjusted EBITDA. Sequentially,
adjusted EBITDA is down $50 million, primarily due to unfavorable alumina prices with partial offsets from higher
aluminum prices and other factors. Stronger metal prices were more than offset by the impact of the alumina price
index declining from $342 to $306 per ton, lowering margins $100 million in the Alumina segment.
Increased shipments of both alumina and aluminum drove a $15 million gain sequentially. And favorable energy
performance from improved pricing in Brazil and lower costs in Spain more than offset unfavorable net productivity in
the quarter. The negative net productivity is a combination of smaller items, including temporarily higher operational
cost from the bauxite business and slightly higher conversion cost in rolling. Foreign exchange changes in the quarter
were a net favorable $17 million. The largest driver of the other category was the planned outage at the Rockdale
power facility.
Now let's take a look at the business segments. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA in the segments totaled $546 million,
down $67 million sequentially with declines in our Bauxite and Alumina segments, partially offset by higher
Aluminum segment earnings. Take a closer look at each of the segment's sequential comparison.
Bauxite adjusted EBITDA temporarily declined $12 million on lower earnings from our equity partnership mines, as
well as higher operational cost at Huntly [indiscernible] (10:37). Alumina declined $70 million due to a $98 million
impact from lower API prices with favorable partial offsets from currency, LME and positive net performance.
In Aluminum, adjusted EBITDA was up $15 million to $221 million. Higher metal prices drove $31 million
improvement, along with favorable Brazilian and Spanish power prices. Partial offsets came predominantly from higher
alumina cost as well as unfavorable price/mix and other factors.
As many of you are aware, alumina cost for our Aluminum segment are approximately on a 90-day lag. For those
tracking particular assets, the Brazilian hydroelectric assets produced adjusted EBITDA of $22 million, up 100%
sequentially, as energy prices increased in the region. North American flat-rolled aluminum declined sequentially to

breakeven adjusted EBITDA in the quarter due to slightly lower production.
Now let's look at adjusted EBITDA items outside of the segments. Combined, our three non-segment EBITDA line
items improved $17 million sequentially and totaled $63 million. Our transformation entities plus our legacy pension
and OPEB costs totaled $40 million in the quarter, increasing $8 million sequentially, primarily due to the planned
maintenance outage at Rockdale. In the second quarter 2017, Rockdale was $20 million of the total transformation
expense.
LIFO and metal price lag, which over time we expected net near zero, is more favorable this quarter and improved $12
million. Other corporate costs also improved $13 million to $26 million primarily as a result of lower intercompany
profit eliminations mainly in alumina.
As we noted last quarter, the eliminations are caused by changes in intercompany profit held in inventory. This quarter,
lower Alumina segment margins meant there was less intercompany margins to eliminate at the corporate level. If
margins and inventories remain stable, future elimination should be minimal.
Next, let's take a closer look at cash generation. At the end of the second quarter, we had close to $1 billion in cash on
our balance sheet, primarily the result of $223 million in free cash flow in the quarter. We also have included a
summary table to point out a few key features of our cash flow statement typically. And as you can see in the second
quarter, the key driver, cash used for financing its dividends to our AWAC joint venture minority partner, and the key
driver, cash used for investing its capital expenditures.
In the first quarter 2017, the sale of our Yadkin Hydroelectric Project and remittance of those proceeds to Arconic as
part of the separation agreement impacted both the cash for financing and cash for investing.
Now, let's move to the other financial metrics. Our balance sheet and related financial metrics continue to strengthen in
addition to our increased cash position. Days working capital improved 18 days in the second quarter compared to 19
days in the first quarter. Capital expenditures now total $159 million for the first half. Second quarter spend was $88
million, up $17 million from the first quarter. Return seeking capital was $27 million and sustaining capital was $61
million. We anticipate the spend to accelerate as we move through the year.
Our first half annualized return on capital at 6.1% is up 4.6 percentage points compared to our full year 2016 level.
Leverage improvement continues with net debt of $487 million and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 0.3 times. Pension
and OPEB net liability is $2.9 billion.
Let's review our full 2017 outlook. As Roy mentioned, we are narrowing our full year EBITDA outlook to a range of
$2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. This tighter range is based on the same forward price assumptions as last quarter's outlook,
LME of $1,900, API of $305 and AUD $0.76, and actual results for the first half of the year. Stronger markets pulling
on the input costs, with – net performance will be negative $50 million with the largest impact being higher raw
materials and energy prices.
Turning to shipments, our outlook for all three segments is unchanged versus last quarter for both bauxite and alumina.
We expect the run rate in the second half of the year to increase to meet the full year outlook. On the financial metrics,
we're tracking well and have made three updates, all favorable.
First, we reduced the transformation and legacy pension/OPEB spend from approximately $165 million to $150
million. Rockdale outage and power prices have been better than expected, as has been Suriname's energy volume.
Second, the cash contributions for pension and OPEB will be approximately $230 million down from $250 million.
Finally, the cash flow impact of environmental and ARO payments have improved $30 million from a range $150
million to $170 million to a range of $120 million to $140 million. A large reason for the improvement is cancelling
scheduled demolition work, as well as schedule changes and a variety of closed locations.
Now, let me turn it back to Roy.

Roy C. Harvey
Thanks, Bill.
To start, I'd like to provide additional details and the rationale behind our decision to restart aluminum production at
our Warrick smelter in Indiana, and explain why this was the right decision for our business.
To recap the details, the restart is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018 and includes three of five
potlines. Restart expenses are estimated between $30 million and $35 million in the second half of this year. And lastly,
we plan to record an after-tax benefit in the third quarter to reverse our accruals from the previous decision to halt
production at the smelter.
To be clear, the decision to restart production at our Warrick smelter was not about adding more capacity to the
aluminum market. Rather, we based our decision on three things. First, our ability to more fully utilize the assets at the
integrated site, which includes the smelter, a rolling mill and power supply. Initially, as you may recall, the assets of
Warrick operations would have been divided as part of the company's separation. The rolling mill would have gone to
our former parent company. Meanwhile, the power plant and the idle smelter would be with Alcoa Corporation. Now,
as one integrated location, we can increase the efficiencies of the site. The demolition of the smelter had not yet started,
and our environmental operating permits remain effective.
Second, we evaluated the ability to restart the site with minimal capital expense, while directly supplying the mill with
molten metal. Essentially, the chosen solution was the optimal use of capital to ensure our work mill was fully supplied
with high-quality metal at the lowest possible cost.
Third, we also considered that this restart would make our rolling mill more competitive in the can sheet market to
operational efficiencies as the rolling mill prepares to meet expected growth in production volume. Importantly, the
decision is also aligned with our strategic priorities. We can reduce complexity by more fully utilizing the asset as an
integrated site and will drive returns to the cost synergies and the expected volume growth for our rolling business at
work.
Turning now to our fundamental outlook for bauxite, alumina and aluminum. We continue to expect our markets to
remain stable in 2017. For bauxite, we continue to see the market in relative balance. Our view anticipates that the
Chinese will continue to stockpile bauxite strategically throughout this year while in search of new sources of
high-quality, consistently delivered material. To maintain our view that China is likely to grow its strategic bauxite
stockpile due to refining – we maintain our view that China is likely to grow its strategic bauxite stockpile due to
refining expansions in China, offset by production growth in Guinea and the potential export of remaining port stocks
in Malaysia.
For alumina, our forecast is somewhat improved, with a slight deficit compared to what we anticipated last quarter. We
continue to expect that China will curtail refining capacity during the winter heating season for environmental reasons
and we are forecasting slightly stronger global alumina demand driven by additional Chinese smelting production.
In aluminum, we continue to see strong demand, and we are increasing our global aluminum demand growth outlook
from a range of 4.5% to 5% last quarter to a range of 4.75% to 5.25% this quarter. This revision includes a slightly
higher 2.75% to 3.25% demand growth forecast outside of China, driven by strong European demand where we see
improved forecast for rolled products and extrusion production. In China, we are maintaining our demand growth
figure at 6.5% to 7% on expected strong growth in electrical and machinery applications and in the transportation and
construction markets, which are the two largest aluminum-consuming sectors.
However, this increased demand is offset by higher expected supply in China. So, we maintain our general view of a
modest aluminum surplus this year. With our aluminum supply forecast still projecting a modest surplus, I'd like to
spend a few minutes describing policy activities in China. The Chinese government made two significant
announcements about potential supply reforms in aluminum to two different government agencies.

First, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection announced the reduction of metal production in select cities to
improve air quality during the winter heating season.
Second, the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission announced that aluminum smelters operating
without proper licenses will be curtailed. These actions could potentially impact about 6 million metric tons of capacity
per annum. If all of that occurs, we could see a reduction in China's 2017 aluminum surplus. However, only about
800,000 tons per year have been curtailed so far. And their 2017 outlook assumes that these initiatives will have only a
moderate impact this year.
It is clear though that the effects of these policies could be significant, creating risks to both the upside and the
downside relative to our forecast. The potential for meaningful positive change remains, but at present, we maintain our
2017 outlook for a continued surplus of aluminum in China.
As we continue to see strengths in both aluminum demand and more importantly aluminum supply, we have also been
experiencing raw material cost inflation over this last critical month. In our aluminum and alumina markets
particularly, we have seen steep increases from last year in the prices for caustic, calcined coke and pitch.
As you can see on the right side of this chart, caustic prices have increased by more than 50% compared to the year ago
quarter, pitch prices by more than 25%, and coke prices by more than 10%. We expect these increases to continue, and
they are the principal basis for our net performance guidance change. However, this inflationary environment also
represents an opportunity for operators like Alcoa who are more efficient and with access to high-quality raw materials.
Let me illustrate how this helps with a deeper dive into caustic soda's impact. In the last year, we have seen average
caustic prices, a key input in alumina production, climb 54% from the second quarter 2016's average of $295 per metric
ton to this quarter's average of $455.
Alcoa is an efficient consumer of caustic per ton of alumina produced, using less than other ex-China refineries and
essentially half as much as Chinese refineries. This difference is created by two things, the characteristics of the bauxite
supplied by our mines and our process control systems that optimize our refineries.
As a result, our refineries see less of a cost increase than most of the market, higher caustic consumers in the right of
the cost curve experience cost inflation faster than those in the left, steepening the cost curve and supporting Alcoa's
cost position.
On this slide, we quantify the approximate impact from the $150 per metric ton increase in caustic prices experienced
over the last year, showing Alcoa refinery's cost improving $12 per ton relative to those of Chinese producers and $3
per ton versus the rest of the world average.
Increases in input costs are an unfortunate characteristic of a stronger market. However, we believe Alcoa Corporation
can create three advantages in these situations. Number one, strong procurement processes and the advantage of the
scale of our purchases blunts the impact versus the general market. Number two, the efficiency of our operations
strengthens our competitive position. And number three, the attractiveness of our low caustic consumption bauxite is
enhanced in our own refineries, but also as part of our third-party sales portfolio.
As we enter the second half of the year, we remain focused on our three strategic priorities, which we factor into each
of our decisions. We seek to reduce complexity, drive returns, and strengthen the balance sheet. To reduce complexity
and improve the operational efficiency of the Warrick integrated site, we are restarting some aluminum capacity of the
Warrick smelter. It will provide a direct supply of molten metal to the site's rolling mill as it prepares for production
growth, which optimizes our use of capital in this business and will also serve to drive returns.
We will continue to pursue opportunities to further streamline our business as the year progresses. We delivered solid
profitability in the second quarter and generated $1 billion in profit for the first half of the year. As we get a better view
of the second half, we have tightened our outlook for 2017. We expect our business to remain strong and to generate
$2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year, excluding special items.

The strength in our markets is creating an increase in input costs, and we've adjusted our net performance outlook for
2017 to negative $50 million. And lastly, we increased our cash position to $954 million last quarter and improved our
working capital, both serving to strengthen our balance sheet.
Our three strategic priorities have guided our actions so far in 2017, and we are making a concerted effort to drive these
priorities deep into the organization at every plant and every resource unit by encouraging our employees to pursue all
opportunities that can further strengthen Alcoa.
With that, I'd like to invite any questions that you might have either for Bill or for me.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Harvey. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. In order to use the
time for Q&A most efficiently, we do ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. However, you may
re-enter the queue at any time. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Evan Kurtz of Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Hey. Good afternoon, Roy and Bill.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Hey, Evan.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Hey, Evan.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: So, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on some of the improvements that you made on the outlook
slide and financial metrics to get a sense of kind of how sustainable they are and how we should be thinking about
some of these items in future years. So, specifically, maybe just start with the transformation legacy pension/OPEB
line. You took that down to $150 million. It sounds like a piece of that was Rockdale, which would be sustainable if
that's what lowered that.
And so, how should we think about $150 million as we get into 2018, 2019? Is that a number that we could see going
forward? And then similarly same question really for environmental and ARO payments. That came down as well
because you're foregoing the Warrick smelter. It seems like that smelter is going to be around. So, should we view
these lower numbers in future years?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah. And I think you should use those two particular numbers for future years. And on
the pension and OPEB piece, I believe, in the Form 10-K, we gave an outlook for future years. So that one will go up in
2018 and 2019. But the two-year reference are your best estimate for moving forward. I would comment on the fact
that in the transformation expense item, Rockdale does fluctuate up and down.
The second quarter was a quarter where we had a planned maintenance outage that drove some of the expense in the
second quarter. And as many of you know, we're working toward a resolution on the Rockdale power contract. So, for
now, I think those are your two best estimates for those numbers going forward.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Great. Thanks. And for my follow-up. Just maybe one on the other corporate expense line.
You're tracking way below your full-year outlook. Is there some chance here that that can move lower or is there going
to be some significant second half spending?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: That's still the estimate. Yeah, we are tracking below, but are anticipating a little bit of a
run-up in the second half. So, we chose not to take that one down to $150 million – I mean, below $150 million based
on our outlook for the second half.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Great. Thanks. I will step back in the queue.

The next question...
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Thanks, Evan.
Operator
The next question will come from Novid Rassouli of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Novid Rassouli>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, you had some EBITDA margin compression on
bauxite and alumina, and clearly alumina was on the pricing side. I think, Roy, you'd mentioned about bauxite cost.
And I just wonder if you guys could give us some more details on kind of what was driving the cost higher for bauxite.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah. This is Bill. I'll give you a couple of items that occurred in the second quarter
around bauxite. We had some additional maintenance spending around our fleet in Western Australia. That's temporary
maintenance spending that will decline in future quarters. We had particularly low production at a couple of our joint
venture mine sites, specifically MRN and CBG. And in CBG, for instance, there was some labor unrest that caused an
outage at CBG. So, that has now been resolved and should be okay going into the third quarter.
And then lastly, on the bauxite side, a lot of rain in the rainy season that curtailed some production, specifically in
Brazil. So, those were the three big factors around bauxite margin compression in the second quarter.
I would point you toward the fact that we haven't moved our full year production estimates. So, we have a fairly
aggressive outlook on the third and fourth quarter around bauxite mining production,
so – and we still believe in that.
<Q - Novid Rassouli>: Great. And then just one follow-up, on the Chinese, I think, surplus that you increased. I just
wanted to see the 800,000 that you mentioned that have been curtailed, that is being included in the estimate that you
guys provided?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yes. So, let me give you a little bit of background on how we put our numbers together. And if
you look at slide number 5, you can see what the total impact could be if everything the Chinese have talked about has
been incorporated. What we've done is gone back in and looked at the credibility of each of the potential or already
announced curtailments and when they could actually happen. And we've prepared what is our best estimate about what
will actually occur.
So, just to give you a range of – a range that should be helpful to you. If everything where to happen exactly according
to what the official announcements are, it would drive a significant reduction in that surplus, if not drive it into a
deficit. However, it's our best estimate of what we think will actually happen in China, given past practices, et cetera.
So, the 800,000 tons because it's already taken offline is absolutely in the number, but I will also tell you that part of
the 1.7 which has been announced but not yet enacted, we've taken our best expert opinion on what will actually come
down. And we actually have a very talented group in China, we've been working to improve our reconnaissance on
what's happening both from the political side but also from the actual operational side. I would say that over these last
few weeks, we've seen a lot of – not just a lot of rhetoric, but actual some movement to bring down production. So, that
certainly bodes well, and there is certainly a lot of talk about these actions being real and not just hopes.
<Q - Novid Rassouli>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. Thank you.

The next question will come from Timna Tanners of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Hi, Timna.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Hi, Timna.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Hello. So, about the Warrick reserve, I want to first and foremost ask if there are other
smelters that you're considering restarting or assets that you're considering restarting. This is the first such move
obviously after a lot of closures, so just wanted a little bit more insight on how you're thinking about your portfolio
overall.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah, Timna. So, let me hit that one. It's the similar response to what we've said in prior
quarters. The fact is we look at every single one of our assets and judge and determine whether it's the right time to
either restart or curtail. So, at the moment, Warrick was one that made the most sense and it's not – as I've said on my
comment, it's not a need for extra aluminum in the world but very specifically because it will strengthen our rolling mill
and will be very positive for our shareholders in a number of market configurations.
So, as we look at places like São Luís, as we look at places like Wenatchee and Pacific Northwest, we also have some
curtailed production in Intalco and in Spain even. Each one of those are opportunities for us to find ways to drive return
for our shareholders. It requires the right energy pricing, it requires a local demand for value-added products or local
demand for even prime P1020. But we look at each one of those and evaluate it based upon the cost structure and the
ability to drive better returns.
So, we've made the decision that we've made to-date, and we'll continue to look at those and see where this takes us.
There's obviously a lot of uncertainty right now about what the second half of this year looks like from a Chinese
curtailment point of view. And so, that's going also affect how we make those decisions over this next couple of critical
quarters.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Fair enough. Yeah, go ahead.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: If I could just add on to that, Timna, I mean, Warrick is a pretty unique situation. We – as
many of you know, we have captive self-generation on one side of the smelter and on the other side we've got a rolling
mill that we are growing. And one of our key desires is to grow the production out of the rolling mill, and it made a lot
of sense under a lot of different – as Roy said, under a lot of different market configurations to restart Warrick.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: And we'd talked about in the prior conference calls about Warrick being worked in our can
sheet business, being a bit of a fixer-upper. You should look at the restart of that smelter as an important step towards
making that business stronger and better. The fact that we can grow volumes and we need extra metal units in order to
do it, and by restarting the smelter, it is the lowest capital cost alternative that gives us best return. It was a pretty smart
decision from my standpoint.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Got you. So, just to follow-up, you mentioned uncertainty, and we've got certainly a lot
of it with China and possible tariff action here in the U.S., but I just wanted to ask you, if you're talking about can sheet
coming from Warrick, does that preclude you from the strategy you've been enumerating before about using
[indiscernible] (37:06), are you thinking differently about that project? And if you could give us any fresh thoughts
about what Section 232 may or may not mean for you guys. Thanks.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. What we're trying to drive from a can sheet perspective in Warrick specifically is
separate from what we can do in conjunction with [indiscernible] (37:23). The fact is it replaces some of the material
that we're getting from the Tennessee that's now part of Arconic. So, a shift into Warrick and driving opportunities
there is going to be additive and, in fact, would help to complement the work that we're doing with our Saudi Arabian
partners.

So, we continue to be very positive on our joint venture in the desert. The smelter has been operating very stably now.
The refinery has hit better and improved days, and we're seeing – we're coming out of the start-up phase and getting
into just normal stable production, which is a very good thing to have from a refining perspective.
In the rolling mill, we continue to be in the midst of trials and have incredible opportunities to make that a stronger
place. So, we spent a lot of time with our partners there. As you saw, we were over there as part of the U.S./Saudi
dialogue. We're an important partner inside of the kingdom. And we have really, I would say, a lot of opportunities to
make our current joint venture even stronger.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: What about Section 232, Timna? [indiscernible] (38:36).
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: I thought I'd discuss [indiscernible] (38:39).
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: [indiscernible] (38:39).
<A - William F. Oplinger>: [indiscernible] (38:40).
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: [indiscernible] (38:39).
<A - William F. Oplinger>: You want to comment?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. So, from a Section 232 standpoint, I think everybody knows the investigation is still
ongoing. Alcoa believes that the United States and the U.S. government and Europe and a number of other areas have
really been doing a very good job at highlighting the aluminum issue, and that issue very specifically being
overcapacity and overproduction inside of China.
So, just the debate from the Section 232 case and from the World Trade Organization before that has created what I
think is a very positive set of potential outcomes for aluminum. Now, again, we're not going to say that everything
China said that they're going to do will be done. However, I would say that the work done by the U.S. government and
other actors has really helped to create an atmosphere that has a lot of potential upside for our industry and then, of
course, quite specifically for Alcoa Corporation.
That said, I don't think right now there's a determination about which way that Section 232 case is going to go. I know
they're in the midst of discussing still as we speak. And so, we'll react to what the final determination will be.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: And ultimately – and I think you said it, but ultimately what we want is a level playing
field. And so, that's what our efforts have been, and I think, as Rosy said, some of the dialogue that has occurred over
Section 232 and WTO has helped that situation.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: And it's given us an opportunity to talk about what could drive competitiveness inside United
States, and not talking about trade barriers, but more talking about how can we get long-term energy contracts that are
favorable, how can we look at ways to enhance our ability to smelt efficiently or to create technology, or find ways to
run our smelters in a completely different fashion. So, lots of discussions going on. I think it can have a very positive
outcome, still more to come.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Okay. Great. Thanks, again.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Thanks, Timna.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Thank you, Timna.

<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Hi, Justin.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Hey, Justin.
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Just first question would be just to clarify two numbers that sort of came at me a
little bit quickly. The Brazilian hydro profit generation and the sustaining CapEx?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Brazilian hydro was $22 million in the second quarter. Sustaining CapEx in the second
quarter was $61 million, return seeking capital was $27 million.
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Okay. Thanks for that refresh. On the bauxite business, can you just talk about sort
of what the dynamics in Southeast Asia mean for your ability to grow your bauxite business to the extent that those
dynamics are changing? I think you referred to some of them earlier.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: So, yeah. So, let me try and hit that and see if it answers your question. Southeast Asia covers a
good amount of ground. So, let me see if I hit the right countries. First of all, Indonesia. Obviously, Indonesia has just
started to allow some exports again. They are relatively modest to-date, and all indications point to them continuing to
be relatively modest. Essentially, there's a requirement that you are operating a refinery. We're very close to operating a
refinery in order to get those export permits. So, we think there will be some selective bauxite coming out, but we don't
think it's going to reach anywhere near the levels that it had for a period of time.
Malaysia is – it was a similar story before, but they continue to ban any kind of production. Now, there appears to be
some illegal production going on. Those stockpiles are not draining as quickly as one would think, given the number of
shipments coming out. But the shipments are relatively slim. There really isn't a lot of material coming from Malaysia
into China.
So, stepping back, I think one of the big highlights over the course of this quarter is that Guinea picked up a pretty
significant amount of speed over the course of the last number of months, and you now see Guinea as the largest
exporter of bauxite into China. Australia continues to be very important.
You're also seeing, from a demand perspective inside of China, that you have a number of new announcements about
refineries that are going to be bauxite import refineries, which means that they're built on a coast and relatively isolated
from the bauxite reserves in country. I think that's a very good testament to the fact that the reserves inside of China are
starting to suffer from a quality perspective and are starting to increase in cost because of the additional need for
stripping, for infrastructure, for even going underground in some cases.
And so, it continues to mean that there is very healthy demand of bauxite. I also believe, and if you step back to the
caustic story that I spent a little time talking about it, I happen to believe that the bauxite that we can offer, whether it's
coming from our joint ventures in Guinea or in Brazil or coming from our Western Australian mine, is an excellent
opportunity for us to grow our value, but also to have a great product that can be imported into China.
Now, we connect that over with the broader questions about what is China's production portfolio going to look like?
One of the great opportunities we have at Alcoa is that we can choose to allocate our capital into the part of the
business that's most attractive. I think, for us, bauxite has real opportunities for us, and we have customers that are
essentially lining up in order to take additional production as soon as we can get it out of the ground and get the right
infrastructure in place.
But, we also have opportunities in alumina and aluminum, and so we will continue to pretty thoughtfully look at each
and every one of those places to look for growth. Did I...
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Okay.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: ...did I hit the right points of your question or did I miss something?
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Yeah. No, that was extraordinarily thorough. Thank you. Just one quick question,
then I'll get back in queue. On the Warrick restart, how does this affect your ability? Are you actually going to be
selling, have the opportunity to sell power on to the open market under this restart? Or you're just going to be

consuming more power in – have the opportunity to consume more power in the use of your own assets?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: The vast majority of the power that we will generate is going to be used in the restart. So,
just to give you a little bit of perspective, we've got joint ownership of a fairly large unit there, joint ownership with
Vectren. We've got three smaller units. Those three smaller units were completely being sub-optimized in a curtailed
state.
So, the economics for this restart are going to be seen really within three areas. One is better utilization of the power
plant. Two is running the smelter and making earnings in the smelter. And then thirdly is the growth and opportunities
that we have in the rolling mill. So, again, it's largely a no-regrets move at this point.
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Great. And each of those three areas will be earnings-accretive individually?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Each of those three areas will be earnings-accretive into the aluminum sector. So, you
won't get a lot of transparency into it other than to see earnings grow when the facility is up and running. And as we
said, first hot metal in the first part of next year, full operation in the second quarter.

And the next question will come from Dave Gagliano of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's just a quick one. What was the average
alumina cost that flow through the primary Aluminum segment in the second quarter?

The next question will be from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. On your growing free cash forward, just wondering if you
could again reprioritize for us what your uses of that cash are over the next 12 to 18 months, and what your view is
toward reestablishing a dividend policy?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah, sure. So, good question, Jorge. Was a very good cash flow generation in the second
quarter, $223 million free cash flow. I'd like to see that the cash balance grew, had $954 million of cash in the bank at
the end of the second quarter.
Some of the priorities that we would have for that cash; first and foremost, we're looking to continue to delever. We
think that the rating agencies probably have our credit rating incorrect now because when you look at our EBITDA
generation and the fact that we're targeting $2.1 billion of EBITDA this year, we think that there is – that they
fundamentally have the rating wrong now. But in order to show them that they have the rating wrong, we're mostly
likely to continue to pay down a little bit of debt. We have prepayable debt down in Brazil of around $200 million.
Secondly, you know we have increased the amount of return seeking capital that we are looking to spend. We did that
at the very beginning of the year, so that's not new news. We're looking to spend $150 million of return seeking capital
this year. And then beyond that, first of all, we will hold cash on the balance sheet. We would like to hold $1 billion of
cash on the balance sheet, but once we get north of $1 billion, we will be looking at opportunities to either invest in the
business or potentially pay into the pension plans to do further delevering.

As far as returns to shareholders, as many of you know, our revolver today is fairly restrictive on our ability to return
cash to shareholders. We would like to get a better credit rating over the next few quarters in order for us to go back
and renegotiate those terms on the revolver so that we can begin to talk about returning cash to shareholders either
through stock buybacks or dividend. But that's where we stand today, Jorge.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Got it .And just if I could have a follow-up as well. I think back in 2Q 2016, you had
mentioned that the closure of Warrick was going to be about a $50 per ton impact. Would we expect to see a similar
$50 per ton benefit once it's fully operational?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: We haven't provided what the dollar per ton impact is. I think if you were to go back and
look at the announcements that we made around the first couple of quarters last year to see the impact on cold metal,
we will reverse that impact once it's up and running. So, I don't have a number that I can give you, but we had provided
in prior quarters what the negative impact of cold metal was and, quite honestly, I just don't have it off the top of my
head, Jorge, but it's there.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Got it. Thank you.

The next question will be a follow-up from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just a quick one on Midwest premiums, I just want to get your
thoughts on the recent weakness. I heard an interesting story about maybe some sub-optimally shaped P1020 in the
market that was imported, and people are willing to pay less for it. Just hoping you could either confirm or dismiss that,
and kind of what your thoughts are on that move in the market. Thanks.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. Evan, I appreciate the question. I've not heard the sort of oddly-shaped P1020. When I
take a look at it, and we spent a little bit of time discussing, particularly because of the most recent decline, to me it sort
of steps back to what's happening from a contango standpoint. You have seen contango shrink pretty significantly over
the last couple – over the last few months. And when that contango shrink, it typically means that you're starting to see
metal delivered and actually coming out of warehouses. And the lowest cost warrant that's out there right now sits it's
over in Japan or in Korea, really in East Asia.
And so, that material started flowing to what was a very short market, which tends to be North America. And you
started to see more material show up in North America. Maybe that's some of this sort of oddly-shaped P1020 that's
coming over. And so, it's – I think what you're seeing is that when contangos start to reassert themselves, and it's
actually come back to a much healthier position last I looked at it, I think you're going to start to see some of that
material continue to be financed or start building up some more of these finance stocks. And we'd like to see that
premium, of course, go back up to prior levels.
So, it really just seems to be more of a movement of metal from one part of the globe to another part of the globe, and
really, really is an indicator of the underlying demand. I'd say that North America continues to be very strong demand.
We're seeing even stronger demand in Europe than we've seen the last time we talked about this. And so, it doesn't
signal to me that there's problem – underlying problems in the markets themselves.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you for taking my question. If I could follow up on your balanced or almost balanced
alumina outlook to the world market. In the February to May months for International Aluminum Institute data, the
alumina output averaged 6% more than the ingot output required or about 2.3 million tons too much. And this is just
naive, we're using the IAI output. In your balance outlook, do you expect the alumina output to go down because of the
Chinese environmental restrictions next winter? Do you think the ingot output is more? Obviously, the alumina is hard
to store, but at least the first half of the year doesn't seem to be balanced.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah, John. So, I think I know where you're going with the question. And let me just walk you
through a couple of points. I think, coming into this year, we'd already cleared out a lot of the inventories that were
sitting out there. You looked at the end of 2015, beginning of 2016 when prices were so depressed there. We had built
up about as much inventory as possible inside of the alumina market, and we've worked that off over the course of
2016.
So, coming into this year, I think it was a pretty balanced market between buyers and sellers. And so, as we progressed
through it, the way that we looked at both production and demand, we found it to be pretty equally balanced, and we
looked at them on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in fact, when we looked at the first quarter, it really looked to be a
slight deficit.
Now, the fact is, like you said, you cannot – it's not particularly easy to store alumina, and what we've seen is that
we've got pretty quick reactions in the market so that we actually, because of the spot pricing mechanism and the loan
by or vessel-by-vessel characteristics of the way this is sold, you can really see what's happening on almost a
day-by-day basis in this market. And up until now we've not seen in excess of tons either sitting in China or sitting
outside of China, which is what's driven a lot of strength in pricing.
I think you started to see here over the course of second quarter, prices had come down some. You had more sellers
than you had buyers, but we've essentially rectified that situation. We're back to a point where, well, it's relatively quiet
from a sales perspective. We continue to see that there's just not a lot of alumina out there that can be purchased, and
therefore not a lot of opportunities for downside.
So, I'm not as familiar with the IAI data. We have a very clear look at how we do this ourselves and we watch what's
actually being produced in China. From our perspective, our balance is of the ones that make most sense to us and it's
the ones that best describe what happened from a pricing and a sales perspective on each of those vessels.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Thanks, John. Appreciate the question.

And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference
back over to Roy Harvey for his closing remarks.
Roy C. Harvey
Again, in closing, I just wanted to say that we've had solid results in this first half of the year. We have a clear path in
front of us for the remainder of 2017. There's a lot going on, whether you talk about China or you talk about the
aluminum industry globally. I think there are great opportunities, but we also are prepared no matter what comes at us
and prepared to respond as might be necessary. We're going to continue to find ways to reduce complexity, we're going
to search for ideas like Warrick that can drive better returns for our stockholders, we're going to strengthen our balance
sheet, we'll continue to put cash in the bank, and we look forward to continuing to describe that story to all of our
