MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions
will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.
Gabrielle Scheibe Rabinovitch
Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings conference
call for the second quarter of 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John
Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We're providing a slide presentation
to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet, and both the presentation
and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. In discussing certain
historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma measures because we believe
that these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different
periods. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures
in the presentation accompanying this conference call.
Please note that as reflected in the reconciliation of GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income in the press release
included in our 8-K filed earlier this afternoon, GAAP diluted net income per share for the six months ended June 30,
2016 was $0.56.

Daniel H. Schulman
Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that PayPal delivered another
strong quarter of financial results, achieving new milestones for the company on multiple fronts. PayPal generated
$3.136 billion in revenue, the first time we've exceeded $3 billion in a single quarter and representing 20% FX-neutral
growth, nearly a 110-basis-point acceleration from the first quarter and 70 basis points from a year ago. We exceeded
our guidance and delivered $0.46 of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, up 27% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP
operating margin grew by 110 basis points year-over-year to 21%. We generated $747 million in free cash flow, up
51% from a year ago.
Perhaps more importantly, we had strong performance across our customer metrics. We gained 6.5 million net new
active accounts, the largest organic quarterly gain in the past three years and up over 80% from a year ago. We ended
the quarter with 210 million active accounts, including 17 million merchant accounts, growing our base by 12%
year-over-year.
Given our first half results, we now anticipate our net new active additions will exceed 25 million for 2017.
Engagement once again increased, growing 10% year-over-year. Our customers now transact 32.3 times per year, up
from 29.4 times a year ago, and 31.7 times last quarter. Our growing base and increasing customer engagement enabled
us to pass another milestone as we processed $106 billion in payment volume, exceeding $100 billion in quarterly TPV
for the first time. TPV grew at a currency neutral rate of 26% year-over-year, accelerating 75 basis points from last
quarter.
Our volume growth was driven by our leadership in mobile. In the quarter, 34% of the payments on our platform were
made on a mobile device. PayPal processed approximately $36 billion in mobile payment volume in Q2, up 50%
year-over-year. This growth is largely driven by the exceptional and differentiated consumer experiences we enabled
on mobile devices. One Touch adoption continued to expand in the quarter with over 60 million consumer accounts
opted in.
Merchant accounts accepting One Touch now number just over 5.5 million, growing by 500,000 in the quarter. Venmo
users sent and received $8 billion in the second quarter, representing a 103% increase from this time last year as we
continue to achieve increasing network effects in the Millennial market.
Based on the strong trends we are seeing across the business, we are once again raising guidance for revenue and EPS
for the full year. John will share more details about our results and guidance during his remarks. Our performance is
driven by the cumulative effect of multiple initiatives. We have fundamentally re-tooled our technology and
infrastructure, leading to significant improvements in availability and developer productivity. We have meaningfully
improved our core experiences and expanded our suite of products.
Our overall scale is accelerating due to the network effects of our two-sided platform. There is clearly a macro secular
shift towards digital payments. And our customer choice results continue to exceed our expectations. We have
completed the rollout of Choice across our on-boarding, servicing, and checkout experiences in the United States and
over 13 million customers have opted into Choice. With the data from millions of customers over multiple quarters, we
are beginning to see clear trends resulting from our Choice initiative. Choice has both simplified and clarified our

customer experiences, which has meaningfully reduced the volume of calls into our customer service centers.
Despite our transaction volume increasing by more than 20%, our net call volumes into our global operations are down
year-over-year. The results of Choice, along with numerous other product improvements, will deliver significant OpEx
savings over the course of our three-year planning horizon. More importantly, customers who have opted into Choice
had meaningful increases in overall satisfaction.
As a result, Choice is driving a significant reduction in churn and a meaningful lift in overall engagement. And
consistent with last quarter, the impact on our funding cost continues to remain well within our expectations. Based on
the success of Choice in the U.S., we're pleased to be expanding this rollout into Australia, Canada, the U.K., and Japan
later this year.
Choice will also help to expand PayPal's presence in our customers' lives. These opportunities are driven by the
landmark partnership agreements we've announced with technology companies, financial networks, wireless carriers
and financial institutions around the world. In the second quarter, we continue to make excellent progress with our
partnerships. We continue to expand our relationship with Visa, extending our partnership into Europe. As most of you
will recall, last quarter we announced an agreement with Visa that covered the Asia-Pacific region.
Consequently, we now work around the globe with Visa. And as part of our network agreements announced last year
with Visa and Mastercard, we recently announced a new service that is designed to allow PayPal and Venmo users in
the U.S. to instantly transfer money to their bank accounts via eligible debit cards linked to their PayPal account.
Finding faster and more convenient ways for our customers to get funds into and out of their PayPal accounts is a key
part of our overall value proposition.
Throughout the quarter, we saw our relationships with issuers grow increasingly collaborative and productive. For
example, we are pleased to see leading issuers, including Wells Fargo and HSBC, actively marketing PayPal to their
customer base, encouraging their clients to link their cards into PayPal accounts. We also announced new strategic
relationships with JPMorgan Chase and, as of today, Bank of America, to utilize their token services and enable their
customers to easily integrate their cards into PayPal and seamlessly create a new PayPal account from their properties.
Furthermore, as part of our expanded relationship with Citi and Chase, we will make Citi ThankYou Reward Points and
Chase Ultimate Reward Points available in our PayPal Wallet to be used as a funding source for consumers shopping at
our 17 million merchants.
As I said on last quarter's call, it's hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies
across multiple sectors who many once viewed as potential competitors. We are confident these partnerships would
drive enhanced value to our mutual customers. The accelerating and extensive scale of our two-sided global platform
which allows consumers and merchants to transact instantly in new contexts, cross-operating systems, technologies and
platforms, creates a strong foundation and it's very attractive to multiple partners.
Our open technology platform has enabled expanded partnerships with Google, Apple, Facebook, and Samsung over
the past few months. These agreements benefit both PayPal and our partners by creating innovative consumer-focused
experiences that connect their combined billions of consumers to new buying experiences enabled by PayPal's powerful
platform.
In April, Google announced an extension of our partnership to make it easy for consumers to use PayPal as a payment
method in Android Pay wherever it is accepted, in store, in app, and online. In addition, Android Pay users on Google's
Chrome mobile web will be able to seamlessly pay as the millions of online merchants that accept PayPal simply by
using their PayPal account and fingerprint authentication.
Just like the deployment of One Touch, this great new checkout experience will be available to millions of PayPal
merchants without requiring any integration work from the merchant, further extending the value we bring to our
merchant customers.
Also in the quarter, Facebook announced additional commerce experiences with PayPal that will be available within its
Messenger platform. At F8, Facebook shared that over one million joint PayPal and Facebook customers have already

enabled our payments experience within Facebook Messenger. Earlier this month, PayPal and Apple announced an
extension of our iTunes integration, which means customers can now buy games, music, movies, and in-app purchases
with PayPal on their iPhones and iPads, in the Apple App Store, iBooks, Apple Music, and iTunes stores in 12
countries, including the U.S., Australia, and parts of Europe. We anticipate that this integration will expand to more
countries around the world in the coming months. This complements our existing integration into Siri and Apple
iMessage and marks a growing relationship with Apple.
Finally, we announced a strategic partnership with Samsung. Users of Samsung Pay in the U.S. will be able to use
PayPal to pay for purchases in stores using Samsung Pay's mag-stripe emulation technology, which is used at the vast
majority of merchants that accept cards. The totality of these partnerships reinforces the fact that we're becoming an
underlying open payments platform and wallet for many of the leading technology platform, OEM, and wireless
carriers around the world.
We continue to make good progress in rolling out Venmo as a payment option for PayPal merchants. As we shared last
quarter, we are now introducing the ability for U.S. PayPal merchants to accept Venmo as a mobile payment option.
Venmo users are now able to use Venmo at an expanded number of PayPal merchants, such as lululemon and Forever
21, and I'm quite encouraged by the early results. We expect that the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely
deployed across millions of our PayPal merchants by the end of this year, and I look forward to sharing more details in
the coming quarters.
The ability to deliver new consumers and enhanced sales growth to merchants of all sizes is a key benefit of PayPal,
especially as the world becomes more global and increasingly digital. As of today, this includes bringing the power and
reach of the PayPal platform to the expansive and rapidly growing Chinese consumer market. We are very pleased to
announce that PayPal has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Baidu, the leading Chinese-language Internet
search provider with approximately 700 million users.
This partnership allows Chinese consumers to pay with their Baidu wallet and PayPal at our merchants outside of
China. Beginning later this year, this partnership will provide Chinese consumers more ways to discover and buy from
PayPal merchants in the U.S. and will eventually expand PayPal's entire global merchant base outside of China. We
expect this partnership to drive significant demand and additional cross-border trade over the PayPal platform.
In addition to helping our merchant customers, maximize their opportunities in the age of digital commerce, another
key part of our strategy is helping under-served consumers join and thrive in the digital economy. This vision drove our
recent acquisition of TIO Networks, which adds bill pay functionality to our two-sided platform, offering consumers
the ability to access a digital network and benefit from the convenience and speed of digital bill payments. Last week,
we announced that we have closed our acquisition of TIO Networks, and I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome
Hamed and the TIO team to the PayPal family.
Three years ago, we set off to transform PayPal. Our goal was to create an open platform for digital commerce that
delivered innovative mobile checkout experiences that blurred the lines between physical, online, and mobile shopping.
We set off to create an integrated suite of services, experiences, and APIs that could extend the power of our two-sided
ecosystem to our merchants with little and often no integration work required. That vision has grown increasingly
important to our merchants in today's rapidly evolving retail landscape.
Our execution in support of that vision is yielding strong results and extending our leadership position. Our efforts to
place our customers front and center in everything we do is driving both scale and engagement on our platform, and has
opened the door to strategic and productive partnerships that have extended the PayPal experience from multiple
contexts in existing and new geographies. But we know we are still in the early stages of our transformation, and we
are just scratching the surface of the opportunities in front of us.
We are fully committed to delivering improved core experiences and additional innovative and comprehensive
solutions for our customers. Helping our consumers and merchants to navigate the rapidly evolving and expanding
digital payments landscape.
And with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to John.

John D. Rainey
Thanks, Dan. I also wanted to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another
great quarter. As Dan discussed, we achieved several notable milestones in the second quarter including, for the first
time, processing more than $100 billion of TPV and generating more than $3 billion of revenue in a quarter. In
addition, we saw accelerating growth in customer accounts, revenues, operating income, earnings per share, and free
cash flow.
Our second quarter financial and operating results demonstrate the momentum in our business and builds on the
strength of our recent performance. Relative to our expectations going into the quarter, our revenue and operating
income outperformed. On the top line, we attribute acceleration in our core to strong account and engagement growth,
enhanced user experiences that make setting preferences and choosing funding instruments intuitive, cross-border
initiatives as well as increased functionality that allows our customers to use our products in additional context.
In addition, though, foreign exchange rates continued to be a headwind in comparison to last year, they provided a
benefit relative to our plans going into the quarter. On the expense side, non-volume related expenses grew only 4.5%,
approximately 25% of the rate of revenue growth. Our team did an outstanding job managing cost, resulting in cost
performance slightly better than our expectations. At the same time, we continued to fully fund our key growth
initiatives. This level of expense growth demonstrates our ability to scale with minimal incremental costs.
Before I discuss the financial results in detail, here are some highlights for the quarter. Revenue was $3.14 billion,
growing 18% on a spot basis and 20% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP operating income grew 25% to $659
million and non-GAAP EPS grew 27% to $0.46. We generated $921 million of operating cash flow, and free cash flow
grew 51% to $747 million.
For the second quarter, our total payment volume was $106 billion, up 26% on a currency neutral basis, consisting of
U.S. payment volume growth of 27%, and the international volume growth of 25%. Our merchant services volume
grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $91 billion. Merchant services represented approximately 86% of our total
volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented approximately 14% of the total, compared to 15% in
the first quarter of 2017 and 17% in the second quarter of 2016.
P2P continues to be a meaningful contributor to TPV, representing approximately 21% of total payment volume. In the
quarter, active accounts grew 12%, and we ended the second quarter with 210 million active accounts. Active account
growth was driven by strength in our core PayPal business as well as growth in Venmo. The number of payment
transactions per active account on a trailing 12-month basis reached 32.3 with 6.8 billion transactions occurring on our
payment platform over that period. In the second quarter, transactions grew 23% to $1.8 billion. Revenue grew 18% on
a spot basis in Q2 and was the result of an 18% increase in both transaction revenue and revenue from other
value-added services. The revenue growth in the second quarter represents an acceleration of more than 100 basis
points versus the first quarter.
Transaction revenue growth was primarily driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, and revenue from other
value-added services was predominantly driven by credit. For Q2, our transaction take-rate was 2.58%, a decline of 11
basis points from the second quarter of 2016, and our total take rate was 2.95%, down 13 basis points year-over-year.
Approximately 75% of the decrease in both transaction and total take-rate was related to the increase in our P2P
volume.
Increased stability in our transaction take-rate in the second quarter is indicative of the balanced growth and the
strength we are seeing across our platform as well as our ability to monetize experiences where we demonstrate a
compelling value proposition for our customers. Volume-based expenses were up 29% year-over-year. Transaction
expense was $1.06 billion, up 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased funding costs across our core PayPal
platform.

As Dan mentioned in his remarks, the increased transaction expenses we have seen from Choice have been well within
our expectations. Further, we continue to see benefits on both the top line as well as cost improvements from lower
customer call volumes and servicing costs, validating our initial expectations. We are pleased to roll out these
experiences to additional geographies in Europe and Asia.
Transaction loss in the quarter was $185 million, or 17 basis points of TPV compared to 18 basis points of TPV in Q2
2016. Loan losses across our consumer and merchant credit products were $123 million, representing 26% growth, in
line with the growth of our receivables portfolio. Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our
expectations.
The net charge-off rate was 6.9% in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivables
balance, including both principal and interest, of $6.1 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolios and a total
reserve of $380 million.
Other operating expenses increased 4.5% to $1.1 billion, representing 35% of total revenue, an improvement of 465
basis points of operating leverage versus the same quarter last year. Both general and administrative and product
development costs were flat year-over-year, and experienced their lowest rates of growth since separation. Sales and
marketing expenses grew 10% as we invested to support our brand strategies and Choice experiences.
For the second quarter in a row, other operating expenses increased only $0.10 for every incremental dollar of revenue,
demonstrating the scalability of our platform. Strong revenue and cost performance resulted in 25% growth in
non-GAAP operating income to $659 million. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21%
compared to Q2 2016. GAAP operating income grew 16% in the second quarter to $430 million, resulting in a GAAP
operating margin of 13.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS grew 27% in the second quarter to $0.34 and $0.46,
respectively.
We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.4 billion. We generated $921 million of
operating cash flow in the quarter, and capital expenditures were $174 million, or 6% of revenue. This resulted in $747
million of free cash flow in the quarter as we generated $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.
Capital return is a fundamental component of our overall capital allocation strategy. Year-to-date, we have returned
more than $600 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $400 million
remaining on our original $2 billion authorization. As announced on our last earnings call, our board has also approved
an additional $5 billion buyback authorization. In addition to focusing on enhanced capital allocation strategies, we are
also committed to optimizing our capital structure.
As we've shared over the past few quarters, we're exploring alternatives to run our consumer credit business in a less
capital-intensive manner. We are encouraged by the discussions with potential partners. And based on the progress we
are making, the timing and structure of these alternatives are in line with our expectations.
While we continue to assess more efficient ways to manage balance sheet exposure to consumer credit, we're also
assessing strategies that will support the growth of merchant credit products. We continue to introduce and expand
financial services and tools to help small and midsize business customers start and grow their businesses. Since 2013,
PayPal working capital has provided in excess of $3 billion in funding to more than 115,000 merchants. PayPal
working capital is a strategic offering to PayPal which drives merchant sales growth, increases processing volume, and
reduces merchant churn rate. We will continue to invest in our working capital business to provide innovative financial
products to small and medium-size businesses.
I would now like to discuss our updated guidance for the full year 2017 as well as the guidance for the third quarter.
For the full year, we are raising our revenue guidance and now expect revenue between $12.775 billion and $12.875
billion, representing currency-neutral growth of 19% to 20%. At current exchange rates for the full year, we expect
currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in spot growth of 18% to 19%.
For the first half of 2017, non-volume related expenses have grown only 4.5%. We are pleased with this performance,
and it's indicative of the type of cost discipline with which we can operate going forward. This level of growth for our

non-volume-related expenses is sustainable given the manner in which we are scaling our business and the changes we
have made to our organizational structure. At the same time, this very measured approach to expense growth gives us
the flexibility to be opportunistic and make investments to drive our business going forward.
Given our year-to-date performance and our operating plans for the remainder of the year, we expect that our full-year
non-GAAP operating margins will expand relative to 2016. We are also raising our full-year EPS outlook by $0.05 at
the high-end and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.84. Further, we are increasing our free
cash flow outlook and now expect to generate in excess of $2.9 billion in 2017.
As Dan mentioned, we recently closed our acquisition of TIO Networks and have included an expected impact of $25
million in revenue for the remainder of the year in our full-year outlook with a negligible impact to our earnings. At the
high-end of the ranges we are providing today, our current full-year guidance represents an increase of $225 million in
revenue and a $0.10 increase in non-GAAP EPS relative to the initial full year 2017 guidance that we provided in
January. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.14 billion and $3.19 billion and we expect
non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.42 and $0.44.
I want to close with a few observations on the quarter and our full year outlook. We saw accelerating growth across net
new actives, TPV, and revenue in the quarter. Net new active accounts grew by 80% and, on a currency-neutral basis,
TPV grew 26%, and revenue increased 20%. Our merchant services growth has been consistently in the 30% range and
demonstrates we are continuing to grow our market share. And while growing our top line, we expect to maintain
disciplined expense growth, which allowed us to deliver more than 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin
expansion in the quarter. This performance gives us great conviction in our ability to deliver on our commitments for
the year.
With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: Thanks, guys, and good quarter. I had a question around the payment transactions per active
account. I know they were up 10% and that's still a very strong number. It was down a little bit relative to the last
quarter. I think it was up 12% and over the last six quarters prior to that it was up on average 13%. So I would've
thought, given Choice and all of the kind of reduced friction that you guys have had, that you might actually see that
number accelerating as opposed to decelerating in its growth. Is there any callouts in the quarter we should know
about?
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Dan, it's Dan. Nice to hear you and thanks for the question. So I'm quite pleased with our
progress on engagement. It is up 10% despite really what is an accelerating pace right now, which is kind of a
high-class problem to have. We are seeing tremendous adoption across merchants and consumers into the PayPal
franchise. As I mentioned, we think we'll exceed 25 million net new actives for the year.
In the past couple of years, we've taken our active user engagement almost seven transactions per user across the whole
base. And if you look under the covers, which we've done here quite a bit, the news is even better, because the majority
of our user engagement right now is coming from the core PayPal Wallet.
And in many places, before it was coming from the growth of Braintree and core PayPal, but now it is being driven the
majority from our PayPal core wallet, and that is a great news story for us. And if you look at our product growth and
our core PayPal franchise over the last several quarters, we've taken multi-year trends that have been drifting slightly
down in terms of their growth rate year-over-year, and we have bent those curves across pretty much every single one
of our core products, and they are now up and accelerating.

So that is a piece of really good news that you probably wouldn't see from the number in and of itself, and I kind of feel
like we're just at the beginning of this. We have One Touch that is driving engagement – that's driving increased
engagement and it's accelerating across the base. Choice is still new, but Choice engagement, when somebody opts into
Choice, that engagement is up quite substantially. And I am really pleased with what we are seeing from Choice. As I
mentioned, about 13 million plus customers that are in Choice now, that will grow and that will impact engagement.
We're obviously just beginning the journey to move into new context. Now we now have basically major agreements
with pretty much every major issuer, we've got agreements from the financial networks to utilize their tokens and
they'll start to move us, move more into an in-store environment as we go into next year. That will also drive
engagement.
You've got pay with Venmo. Right now, there are no engagement with Venmo, there's P2P, but we don't count that in
our engagement total so you'll see that drive up. TIO just came on. Our new partnerships with Facebook and Google
are going to start to kick in. That's really not in our guidance right now. Those things are going to start to accelerate and
drive our future growth as we look into 2018, 2019, 2020.
So we still have a goal to have a consumer use PayPal two times a week. That is our goal. Not to drive it once a week,
but to drive to two times a week. And I feel like with all the initiatives we have right now and the trending that we're
seeing that over our medium to long term, that's within our reach. So feeling pretty good about where we are in the
engagement side.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: Yeah. That's fantastic. Can I just ask one other quick one? You mentioned all these strategic
partnerships and they are plentiful. I'm wondering how you're viewing that from a trend perspective to bring down your
customer acquisition cost as we think about the future. Thanks.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Yeah. You violated the first cardinal rule of one question per – but it's okay. You got
away with it and I admire that.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: I'm increasing my engagement.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Exactly. I see that. So, listen, one of the things that I mentioned in my opening remarks is
we're beginning to see a tremendously collaborative relationship with issuers right now. We're seeing, I mentioned, two
that are marketing to their base to actively encourage them to link their cards into our PayPal account. And that's
happening because we're going to drive growth for them.
As John mentioned in his remarks, our [ph] MS (40:18) TPV – our TPV growth outside of eBay is growing at 30%.
And we are the perfect digital distribution channel for financial institutions, especially now that we've implemented
Choice and consumer will opt on how they want to pay and where they want to pay on that. And so, I think this
acceleration of our net new actives is coming at a lower cost to us. So it's really kind of serve a one-two punch that's
positive for us now especially as we look forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein.
<Q - Lisa Dejong Ellis>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I had a question about in-store and your in-store strategy in light
of the partnerships that you've signed. Can you kind of give an overall view of in which of these instances, like in
Android Pay versus Samsung Pay versus using the network tokens in your own wallet, you are able to generate

revenues for PayPal or envision that over time versus where it's just a strategy of driving more user engagement at the
POS even though it's not revenue generating?
<A - William J. Ready>: Hi, Lisa. It's Bill. So great question and you're exactly right that as you parse out the parts
there are places where we earn revenue, there are places where you think about it as engagement opportunity. And so
the places where somebody's paying in-store and they're using their PayPal balance, those are places where we would
make revenue on those transactions. And places where we are enabling the use of an issuer's card directly and we're
providing a pass-through token, we wouldn't earn revenue on those but we also don't have costs on those, and so we get
great consumer engagement but without costs on those transactions per se.
Also importantly, in addition to what we're doing with partners like Samsung Pay and Android Pay to drive into the
store, we're working with those same partners, particularly like Android Pay for example, where it's not just in-store but
that blends into in-app purchasing and online purchasing, and there's a lot of blurring of the lines of online and in-store
with things like buy online pickup in store where these cross-channel experiences are really getting to consumers using
a mobile device, but really engaging with the retailer and the store. You see us really, really delivering on those types
of experiences as well.
So we have a broad strategy that can both help the retailer engage across multiple fronts, drive engagement with the
consumer, and we have several of those that we monetize directly and some of those that are going to be a
pass-through, which would not generate revenue for us but would also not generate cost for us. So we have many of
those, like buy online pickup in store, paying with your balance, where we do generate revenue on those things.
And by the way, this is consistent with PayPal history, where we have historically had products such as P2P that were
free that we then monetize in other forms and so this is a strategy that we have employed previously and so we feel
really good about where we are on that.
<A - John D. Rainey>: And just to add to that, Lisa, first of all, nice to hear your voice, hope you're doing well. And
we spent a lot of time, as we've started to transition the company from being really single-product type of company to
being a platform company that offers a suite of services to both merchants and to consumers.
And what we've found and we've done a ton of detailed research and analytics on this, is when we add an incremental
service to a consumer, or even to a merchant, we see their lifestyle value basically double. And so if a consumer adds
P2P, we see they engage more, their use of PayPal goes up, the churn goes way down, and it is a gigantic benefit for
our flywheel and for our economics. And so the more products and services and experiences and more engagement we
can have with the consumer and the merchant, the better the LTV is for us. And that comes through as Bill said,
historically, as we've seen that with P2P and others.
We also have started in-store with trials – with Vodafone as we've rolled that and we've seen as people have used
Vodafone and PayPal in-store, they use PayPal more in app and online, because the distinctions between those things
are blurring, especially with mobile. And so, our ability to engage with consumers and drive that engagement is a good
thing both for consumers, for merchants, and for the economics of PayPal.
<Q - Lisa Dejong Ellis>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Hi. Thanks. And good quarter, guys. My question is with regards to the rise in active
accounts and the reacceleration of that as that has gone from 10% to 11% to 12%. Is that a straightforward relationship
with consumer choice? Is it possible to potentially estimate? Is there sort of an untapped number of inactive accounts
people who downloaded PayPal, but didn't use it, that can give us some idea of the potential to continue increasing
these accounts?

<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: I'll start, and then maybe Bill can supplement. So I would say kind of as I mentioned in
my remarks, there is no one single thing driving the growth of those net new actives, and as I mentioned, I said I think
we'll do in excess of 25 million net new actives. That would imply that we're going to do another, on average, 6 million
or so in the third and fourth quarter. So we see a continued strength in net new actives. That's coming as a result, and I
don't want to say this, but I will, of the great work that Bill and his product and engineering teams have done, great
work that Tomer Barel and the risk teams have done around improving our core experiences.
And as I mentioned, we are bending multi-year curves now and we are seeing now really nice year-over-year growth in
our core experiences. Availability – just things like availability, is up. That matters a lot. Latency is down, that matters
a lot. We've got a new mobile app there, we've got One Touch, we have Choice coming in. Choice is driving both a
reduction in churn, which helps net new actives, obviously, but it's also driving additional new adds because the
onboarding process is so much more streamlined. And then you also have partners that are now actively marketing
PayPal because together we're sort of allies in advancing digital payments and tapping into that growth.
And so, I think there is a number of things, and we also, obviously, with 210 million people now on the platform, we've
got maybe at a tipping point on these network effects right now where there are so many merchants on the platform, so
many consumers on the platform that it's a must-have for people, especially as they move into mobile checkout
experiences. I think what Bill and the risk teams have done in things like One Touch have really been an unparalleled
kind of a mobile checkout experience. Almost two times the conversion of the industry average. And so, I look at a
number of things that we've done over the course of the last several years and they're beginning to take hold in the
market and are really driving our results. And, Bill, would you add to that?
<A - William J. Ready>: I think you captured it really well just doing the points there. We have multiple new places
that customers are coming in, but as Dan described, we have, across nearly every major product area, revamped those
products over the last few years. And so we're seeing not only do each of those products tend to get more net new
actives for us coming in, we're driving increased engagement across each of those. As people come in through those,
they become more engaged on those products. And there's additional product that they can engage with, that also
deepens our relationship with those customers, really leading us to more of their daily lives.
So, just as Dan said, it is across multiple fronts, and quite noteworthy that it's across our core experiences as well and
we're deepening that engagement.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Yeah. If I just – I just have one last thing and then we'll be done with your question,
Ashwin. I wouldn't underestimate what could happen with Baidu, I mean, we are now tapping into that Chinese
consumer marketplace. And that is going to open up a whole new market for consumers to come onto the PayPal
platform, interact with our PayPal merchants outside of China and drive what we think could be substantial
cross-border traffic. And I talked about this, it's not just Baidu, it's Baidu and PayPal. So it's almost a little like we've
done with Android Pay, it's a co-branded experience, they sign-up to be a PayPal account from there. So there are a lot
of things that we're working on, a lot of things we still want to implement, but feel good about the current trend right
now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hi. Good results and momentum. I want to ask about the – maybe the partner pipeline. Just
any big partnerships out there still to sign and – in 2017? And maybe I'll ask about the acquisition pipeline as well and
your appetite to do deals.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Yes. So we've done, I think, 24 major partnerships in the last 18 months. And you've seen
this last quarter, it started to accelerate, actually. And it's accelerating because I think people are beginning to
understand the assets that we bring to our partners. We obviously bring a lot of scale to partners, and when you talk to
different platforms, whether it be Baidu or Google or Samsung, the ability to tap into 17 million merchants we have,

that long tail of merchants, that's a very difficult asset for others to replicate, and it's accelerating in its growth.
Now, if you look at other partnerships, you can add potential for pretty significant additional growth for them, whether
that's driven by mobile or what we can do on One Touch or TPV, that's accelerating. And as you know, we also control
the value prop end to end. There are very few players who do that there. There are some players that control a piece of
it, but very few players own it, including risk, customer service, brand, reputation, and we own all of that and parts of
the value proposition. And we've also changed our model quite a bit. We are an open platform and a suite of services,
both branded and unbranded, that's operating system and device and technology agnostic.
And so – and very importantly, we're a neutral third-party platform. So we don't compete with any of our merchants or
our partners, we're allies in advancing digital payments. So I think our positioning is really good within the entire
ecosystem to continue to partner. There are a number of other partnerships that are on the horizon and I think the more
we partner, the more people see that the benefit of doing that can be quite substantial. So, I think we announced enough
partnerships right now, so we'll save some for the next announcement. But I think we're really well positioned on that
front.
On the M&A front, because you got your two questions in there in a very subtle way, but on the M&A front, look, we
have a very strong balance sheet. John mentioned, we have $6.4 billion of cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We're
generating – now our guidance is over $2.9 billion of free cash flow for the year. So that's a competitive advantage for
us. There's no question about it, and we're very active in looking at a range of opportunities around the world, both big
and small. But, look, those opportunities need to tie in to our vision and our mission. They've got to accelerate our
progress either against a key vertical or a geographic expansion.
We'll do tuck-in acquisitions from a tech or a functional capability like a TIO type of thing, but we look at this through
the lens of do we build, do we partner, or do we buy? And the amount of work that Tomer and Bill have done on their
respective platforms whether it's risk capabilities or our full infrastructure. I mentioned the increased developer
productivity. We can put out a ton of releases, now we've got something like 30,000 releases in a quarter. I mean, it's
amazing the velocity of new functionality and innovation that Bill and his team are putting out into the marketplace.
And so what we used to have to buy at one time because it used to take us months to make a change on our website
because we had such a monolithic infrastructure, now there's a rapid velocity of very innovative services coming in.
The second thing is, we can partner now in ways that we never could partner before. Choice has enabled that. We have
a new philosophy about cooperating with people. It's created an environment that's gone from a very competitive one to
one that's much more cooperative. We have a ton of complementary resources that we can use with partners, and now
many times where we used to think we'd have to buy something, we can now partner on a commercial relationship to
go and do that.
And then, obviously, if we can't do any of that, we'll look at buy and we do that in a very disciplined manner. We've got
a certain amount of scale and capabilities. And so, you can expect us to continue to be acquisitive, but in a disciplined
fashion and within the context of what I just mentioned.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Condra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Paul Condra>: Right. Thanks. Yeah, afternoon, everybody. I guess, Bill, I just wondered if you can give a little
bit more detail on Venmo, kind of what you're seeing as you roll that out in terms of the way consumers are using it.
Are they potentially using a credit card? And then any merchant feedback, and just anything, any surprises or anything
unexpected just to kind of help us understand where you're focus is as you're scaling that product out.
<A - William J. Ready>: Sure. As we talk about, in prior calls, we spent quite a long time really making sure that we
had dialed in the customer experience so that Venmo would not just be another pay button but that the uniqueness of
Venmo it's really gets to great mobile payments as well as the social engagement, and we'd have that dialed in as we
took that from person-to-person payments into merchant payments.

We have been working through that for a year plus, and so we're really now in the place of taking those prior learnings
which we've got to feeling really great about, and we're opening that up to the PayPal merchant base. So the really
interesting thing that is happening right now is that we're saying for our Venmo users, we are lighting up PayPal
merchant, allowing Venmo users to pay a PayPal merchant notably without PayPal merchants having to do any work,
just like we rolled out PayPal One Touch, just like we rolled out Android Pay. And so, you're seeing us leverage that
very unique distribution capability to PayPal merchants again to go deliver Venmo consumers to those PayPal
merchants.
And so, we're in the midst of a ramp with that, but we're feeling really good about that. We not only had previously
proven out that consumers on Venmo really wanted to use Venmo for more things beyond P2P, we have a number of
merchants where we see really, really positive results in terms of how Venmo stacks up next to other payment
alternatives, and those merchants we feel great about those things. We're now really focused on how we take that from
where we are now with a handful of merchants to go take that to millions of PayPal merchants. And we started that
journey already, as Dan mentioned previously.
We've started to introduce that. We have merchants like lululemon and Forever 21 that are now there. We have
thousands of PayPal merchants now where you can use Venmo to pay and we expect we'll progress that towards the
millions of PayPal merchants over the coming quarters. So we're feeling really good about those things. But the –
would consumers want to do this, what was the interaction model, would they like it? Those are things that we've really
spent that prior year testing out. So now we're in the mode of just thoughtfully scaling that and we're feeling really
good about how that's going so far.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Thanks, guys. Nice quarter. Just following up on this acceleration in partnerships, Dan,
especially around the mega tech companies, such as Apple and Google, this past quarter. Can you touch on these
partnerships in a little more detail? But more just – does this underscore any type of deeper meaning around the
positioning in the payments ecosystem by any of these companies, just given there's always been a lot of questions over
the competitive threats from some of these names versus PayPal. Are they now more partnerships?
And then, John, just to sneak one quick financial one in. Pricing opportunities, I know that was a key driver potentially
in the quarter. Is it still a driver? Or it's supposed to be a – it could be a driver in the year. How much more of that to go
is there? How much of an impact in the quarter? And just maybe comment on that a little further. And again, thanks
again, guys.
<A - John D. Rainey>: Sure. Darrin, I'll start and then kick it over to Dan. As we've talked a little bit about this year,
pricing is an opportunity for us. We did announce a couple of corridors where we made price increases, and part of that
is reflected both in our financial results for the quarter as well as our improved guidance for the year. I will say that
we're very focused on really identifying where customers derive value enhancement as part of their experience and then
pricing to that versus just sort of arbitrarily going out and raising prices for something where there's no incremental
value that's perceived by the customer. And so, we had some targeted initiatives that we've done, and that's reflected in
our results as well as our guidance for the year.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Yeah. And, hey, Darrin. So I'll start off and then I'll turn it over to Bill. But I think there's
a real difference now with the partnerships that you've mentioned, major tech platform companies. I think, and none of
them really wanted to go into payments as an end to itself. It was a means to an end that they had. And so, it might be
more engagement on their platform, and that engagement could lead to key metrics that they want to drive, it could be
advertising, it could be other things.
And when we made the shift to being an open-payments platform as opposed to just being a button as a checkout
experience, and really opened our platform up through pretty sophisticated technological upgrades, through open APIs,

with the partnerships we have, with tokenization, and that kind of thing, we were then able to become really in many
ways an underlying payment OS for those tech platforms that enabled them to create the experiences that they wanted
to drive for their end-user. And so, that partnership is fundamentally different right now. It is has evolved greatly over
the last several years. I'll ask Bill to add color to that. But it's a very different conversation that we have now than we
used to have.
<A - William J. Ready>: Yeah. I would just add to that that, absolutely, payments was a means to an end, as Dan
described, and what we have demonstrated is that, through unique two-sided platform that we have and our ability to go
connect consumers and merchants around the world and do so in a single touch, makes us very unique in being able to
light up those experiences for those partners.
And so, not only did we make the strategic shift to say we want to be a more open platform to enable those things and
improve our experiences so that we could do things like One Touch to drive industry-leading conversion levels to
connect to those experiences, I think as mobile has matured and players have been able to see different alternatives in
the ecosystem and see what consumers have affinity to, what drives better conversion rates, I think we are
demonstrating consistently that the uniqueness of our two-sided platform, our ability to connect consumers and
merchants lets us drive connection between consumers and merchants of all types, or consumers and tech ecosystems,
in ways that others can't, or whatever their aspirations are, whether that's selling more apps or selling more devices or
driving engagement with their experiences, we're generally able to connect users to them and those experiences in a
lower friction way than anybody else out there. And that's why you've seen us really start to play a central role there.
And I think as more and more of these interesting new experiences proliferate, every time that happens, I think PayPal
is now positioned as a place where, of course, people would want to look first given what we've demonstrated we can
do on those things.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: We have time for maybe one more question, operator, and then I will wrap up the call.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to ask, lots of new partnerships. The Chase deal
in particular caught my eye. Thinking about the ability for PayPal to process through ChaseNet. Doesn't that materially
lower your funding costs with Chase cards going forward? And then just as a strategic bigger picture, maybe Dan, with
all these partnerships, are we about to launch a big in-store campaign or opportunity? Or is it going to be more of a trial
and error process? Thanks so much.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: Do you want me to go? Yeah. So I'll start off with that. Obviously we've worked closely
with JPMorgan Chase over the last couple of years, actually, as we've talked about the potential for how we might work
together. And I'm really pleased with where we came out in this partnership. We both see a lot of value in it. You have
two very strong companies lending what are really impressive assets to create great consumer experiences, including,
as you mentioned, processing through ChaseNet, which obviously does give the potential, we're not talking about any
deal terms one way or another, but potential for lower costs on that. So I'm really pleased with the comprehensive
nature of the partnership that we have with Chase. It took us time to work through all of the details of it. But I think
both of us feel really good about it, and really good about what we can drive coming out of that.
<A - William J. Ready>: Yeah, and I would just add to that, again, without commenting on the deal terms for any one
specific deal, the closer working relationship that we now have with the broader financial ecosystem, as you look
through a broad lens of how you think about costs, whether that's customer acquisition costs, or risk and fraud losses, or
all of these kind of things. We, as one of the largest drivers of digital transactions for banks and issuers and that being a
place that is one of the largest drivers of growth for banks and insurers, the opportunity for us to collaborate across a
number of fronts across the ecosystem is quite meaningful, we believe. And we see that across these partnerships that

it's not just about what the cost of processing a transaction, but how can we think about delivering better digital
experiences to customers, that has positive impact on customer engagement on customer acquisition costs, and how you
think about the lifetime value of a customer, risk, all these things. The opportunity to collaborate with the ecosystem
has many, many potential positives across a number of those things, and that is something we feel really encouraged by
in the conversations that we have and the relationships we're building.
<A - Daniel H. Schulman>: I think you just think about things like Reward Points. Discover, Chase, Citi have all
decided that utilizing Rewards Points within the PayPal platform to utilize those for purchases at our 17 million
merchants. I'd say that is a real significant differentiation for those particular financial institutions and their customers
who are using their instruments, but also for PayPal, because you now can utilize those Reward Points in a split
transaction. You have X number of Reward Points but maybe couldn't do that full transaction. You can now split that,
you can use those Reward Points to purchase 40% of what you're going to go do, and then the other 60% can be done
through whatever funding instrument you select as a consumer. That's a lower-cost funding mechanism as well for us.
So there are all sorts of things within these relationships that we have that drive enhanced value for our regional
customers that, if you parse through them, it's really quite significant and differentiated from where we were, certainly
a year or so ago. Now the in-store stuff, we obviously now have the ability to use industry tokens from Visa,
Mastercard, and others, and now we're working with each of the FIs to utilize their tokens for their particular
instruments. And so, you'll start to see that just naturally began to roll out. There really isn't much of a trial and error
per se on this.
We will have the ability for a PayPal customer or if they're opted into one of the bank services that's provided tokens,
we'll use the network tokens with that, and you'll simply be able to use that instrument seamlessly across where actually

experience without us having to do bespoke customization of software at the point-of-sale terminal. And so that would
just be a natural rollout utilizing existing POS technology.
