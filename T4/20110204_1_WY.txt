re-conversion. As we commented last quarter, the Cellulosic Biofuels Credit offsets income tax liability. We will carry
the credit forward.
Excluding these items, the company reported Q4 2010 net earnings of $52 million or $0.10 per diluted share. For the
full year of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1.281 billion or $3.99 per diluted share on net sales of $6.6
billion. Full-year 2010 earnings include $1.064 billion from income tax adjustments related to Weyerhaeuser's
conversion to a real estate investment trust. The financial data accompanying our earnings release has been redesigned.
We hope you find this new format useful and welcome your comments.
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes a GAAP reconciliation
of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to charts 4 through 10. Turning to chart 4,
changes in contribution to earnings by segment. This chart illustrates the change in contribution by business segments
from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We begin our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with
Timberlands, charts 5 and 6.
In the fourth quarter, Timberlands contributed $56 million pre-tax to earnings. The Q3 pre-tax contribution was $75
million. Earnings from non-strategic Timberlands disposition declined from $34 million in Q3 to $19 million in Q4.
Sales volumes declined 3%. Costs were higher due to seasonal downtime in the West and slightly higher fuel costs and
silviculture spending in the South.
Fee depletion declined 3% in fourth quarter as we continue to defer the harvest. In 2010, the fee harvest was down an
additional 10% from the already reduced level of 2009. Western log prices rose 4%, while Southern log prices declined
4%. Japanese log exports softened in Q4. However, log exports to China increased 10% in the quarter. Japan continues
to be our largest log export market.
Wood products, charts 7 and 8. Seasonably slower demand and continued difficult market conditions affected the
fourth quarter. Before special items, Wood Products lost $85 million. In the previous quarter, the segment lost $100
million. Log costs were slightly lower in the quarter, and SG&A costs decreased. Total sales realizations were flat in
Q4 with slight increases in lumber prices offsetting decreases in OSB and plywood prices. Lumber sales realizations
increased $6 per 1,000 board feet, or 2%, and OSB prices decreased $7 per thousand square feet, or 4%. Engineered
solid section and I-joist sales realizations were flat compared to Q3.
Lumber sales volume was down 8% and OSB sales volume decreased 5%. Volumes for engineered solid section
declined 13% and engineered I-joists volumes decreased 10%. Asset impairment, closures and restructuring charges of
$103 million pre-tax were recognized in the fourth quarter. These charges were for the rationalization of capacity,
which includes the permanent closure of three Wood Products facility.
Turning to Cellulose Fibers, chart 9. In the fourth quarter on a pre-tax base, Cellulose Fibers earned $138 million. In
the third quarter, the business earned $181 million. Costs increased and productivity was lower due to the impact of an
annual maintenance outage at the New Bern, North Carolina, mill. There were no maintenance outages in the third
quarter. Pulp shipment volumes declined 2% due to the timing of shipments. Pulp prices were flat in the quarter.
And finally, turning to chart 10, Real Estate. Before special items, WRECO contributed $13 million pre-tax to Q4
earnings. In the third quarter, the business contributed $20 million. The quarter included a $20 million charge for asset
impairment and restructuring. 606 single-family homes were closed in Q4, a 21% increase from Q3. The fourth quarter
is typically the highest quarter for closings. The average closing price rose to $439,000 from $400,000, due to mix. The
margins on single-family homes sold increased to 26.1% from 24.3% in the previous quarter, also due to mix. The
quarter included $6 million in land sales and related activity.
The backlog of single-family homes sold but not closed decreased to 439 units, a backlog of about two and a half
months. At the end of 2009, the backlog was three and a half months.
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?

Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Last year was one of continued market challenges, but also a year where
we enhanced our ability to return value to our shareholders and saw the benefits of the work we'd done to improve our
operations. The most noteworthy event of 2010 involved completion of our conversion to a real estate investment trust.
In the process, shareholders received a $5.6 billion special dividend.
Going forward, we are targeting a dividend pay-out ratio of 75% of funds available for distribution over the cycle. Our
board will determine and declare the actual dividend on a quarterly basis; but beginning in March, we anticipate paying
a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share or $0.60 per share on an annualized basis.
Converting to a REIT enhances our ability to operate and grow our core asset, the more than 6 million acres of
valuable, sustainably managed timberland that we hold, and to provide significant benefits to our shareholders.
Throughout 2010, market conditions required our business segments to adjust their strategies and their focus.
Timberlands continued to defer harvest to preserve the long-term value of our core asset.
As Kathy noted, harvest levels dropped 10% compared with 2009. We took advantage of our strategically located
Western lands and export facilities to grow Pacific Rim export volumes. Increased exports helped to offset weak
domestic demand, which is primarily linked to U.S. housing markets. In 2010, our export volumes grew 18%
year-over-year and export share of our total volume increased from 14% to 19%. Increases in shipments to China
slightly exceeded increases to Japan for the year, though Japan still represents over 75% of our total export volume.
Wood Products faced a highly volatile market in 2010, as prices rose sharply in the first four months of the year before
experiencing a precipitous decline beginning at the end of the second quarter.
As you know, on October 1, I asked Larry Burrows to lead this business. While performance is still unacceptable, our
focus on controlling costs, improving cash flow, and right-sizing capacity for our long-term needs has begun to show
some progress. Wood Products loss narrowed in the fourth quarter, even though that quarter is typically our weakest of
the year.
WRECO was one of the most profitable homebuilders in the country in 2010, despite another extremely challenging
year for the U.S. housing market. For the year, we increased margins from 18% to 24% by aggressively cutting costs
and leveraging the unique value propositions and local market knowledge of our experienced managers.
Our Cellulose Fibers segment set both earnings and production records in 2010. These achievements were the result of
our focus on meeting the needs of our global customers by improving mill system productivity and reducing operating
costs, actions that positioned us to take full advantage of strong market conditions for pulp.
As we mentioned in December, we expect similar housing market conditions for our businesses in 2011. This will
continue to present challenges for our Timberlands, Wood Products, and Homebuilding segments. In December, our
outlook for Cellulose Fibers assumed some weakening in pulp prices in 2011, but we're pleased that pricing so far in
2011 has remained relatively stable.
Despite continuing market challenges, I expect improved performance from our businesses due to progress that we
made in 2010 and our ongoing improvements, operational changes, and enhanced cost efficiencies. We expect to
continue to defer a portion of our timber harvest, although volumes will increase over 2010. In addition, we will flex
our harvest in response to market opportunities, including meeting the growing demand from the Asian export market. I
expect our Wood Products segment to be cash-flow positive. I expect that WRECO, our Homebuilding segment, will
continue delivering strong performance relative to its peers, and finally, I expect continued strong operating
performance from Cellulose Fibers.
I'll now turn the call over to Patty, who will provide our first-quarter outlook.

Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. The outlook comments for the businesses are summarized on chart 11 and
I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, export and domestic log prices are expected to increase
somewhat due to continued strong demand from China. Southern log realizations may be down slightly. Fee harvest
volumes are anticipated to increase seasonally in both the South and the West. We don't expect to incur any downtime
in the West as was the case in the fourth quarter. Costs will likely increase in the West due to higher road costs, but in
the South they should decrease due to seasonally lower silviculture costs.
Earlier today we announced the closing of the sale of approximately 82,000 acres of non-strategic lands in the West.
This sale results in a pre-tax gain of approximately $150 million in the first quarter. The transaction represents the sale
of the remainder of the storm-damaged whitewoods that we had on the market during 2010. We're pleased with the
sales price of approximately $200 million or $2,400 per acre, which is good value given the mix of species and age
classes. Before the effect of this sale, we expect that earnings in the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter.
In Wood Products, we expect that prices and volumes for lumber and OSB will increase over the fourth quarter.
Engineered wood realizations are likely to be flat. Manufacturing costs should be lower for all product lines due to less
downtime and obtaining the benefits of recent capacity rationalization and cost reductions. While the first quarter is
traditionally a seasonally slow quarter, we do anticipate the loss to decrease significantly compared to the fourth
quarter.
Market conditions for our Cellulose Fibers segment continue to be favorable. Global inventories for pulp were at low
levels as we entered the quarter. The weak U.S. dollar, strong Chinese demand and a steadily improving global
economy should result in continued strong pricing in the first quarter. Our pulp shipment volumes are expected to
increase modestly compared to the fourth quarter. Manufacturing costs will likely increase in the first quarter due to
higher fiber and chemical costs. Increased scheduled annual maintenance outages will result in higher maintenance
costs and decreased productivity compared to the fourth quarter. We expect earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to
be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
In our Homebuilding segment, we expect margins and prices to decline due to mix. As Kathy has already discussed, we
entered the year with a low backlog, and market conditions remain challenging. The first quarter is seasonally a slow
quarter for closings and we expect to close approximately 200 fewer homes than in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a
slight loss in our single-family home-building operations for the first quarter.
Now I'll turn to some overall financial comments. As we previously announced in December, we anticipate that the
board will declare quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid in March. This pay-out will be approximately $80
million. Following our December announcement, we were pleased that S&P issued a report raising the outlook for our
credit rating from negative to stable. We ended the year with strong liquidity, including cash balances of over $1.4
billion and an unused line of credit of $1 billion. We will be focused on renewing this credit line, which expires at the
end of this year.
Our scheduled debt maturities for 2011 are approximately $30 million, although debt maturities at the beginning of
2012 are over 700 million. Capital expenditures for the company totaled $234 million in 2010 before consideration of
cash received for government credits of approximately $25 million. For 2011, we expect to spend approximately $250
million. In addition, we expect to receive approximately $15 million of additional government credits for
energy-related products – projects at our Grande Prairie, Alberta, pulp mill. Net of these credits, our cash spend is
estimated to be $235 million.
We anticipate that we will have a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter primarily related to our Wood
Products segment. The amount will depend on market conditions and we will continue our focus of matching supply
with demand. During the first quarter, we will also make our semi-annual interest payments of approximately $130
million. We received the proceeds from the 82,000-acre timber sale yesterday, and those will help offset these cash
outflows.
Though economic conditions may be challenging in 2011, we are focused on increasing our financial and operating
performance and creating value for shareholders.

Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.
Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Patty. In summary, as I reflect on 2010 performance, I see improvement in all businesses shown overall by our
swing to profitability. Our 2010 results were positively impacted by actions that we took and improvements that we
made. Clearly, I'm not satisfied with where we are but we're headed in the right direction and are well-positioned to
produce improved operating results.
In 2011, our continued focus on improving what we control while being ready to take advantage of any uptick in
market conditions is the right strategy for achieving improved 2011 financial results.
And now, Kathy, we'll move to Q&A.
Kathryn F. McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations
Nicole, could we please open the floor for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Can you talk a little bit more about the restructuring activity in Wood Products and help us
understand the opportunity there, perhaps discussing the benefits from the closures that you've received and any
potential targets that we can kind of get our head around as we model 2011?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. So, within our Wood Products business, our
primary product lines, as you know, are Lumber, Oriented Strand Board, Engineered Wood Products, and then we have
a distribution business which is primarily focused on distributing and marketing our engineered product.
Our focus in Wood Products starts with a review of capacity utilization. That led us to take the impairments that we
announced in December, where we took a permanent closure in several facilities that we had shut down previously but
determined that at least in the next two- to three-year period we would not need that capacity. So our focus is on
managing our capacity to deal with today's level of demand in that that we anticipate in the next two to three years.
We're focused on improving capacity utilization; that will bring down our manufacturing cost; but in the shutdown of
those facilities, we'll also be saving some non-cash expense in the form of depreciation, but also security and
maintenance costs that are related to those facilities. In all of our product lines, we are focused on improving margins
both from improved pricing opportunities as well as continued cost reductions both through our operating and
manufacturing cost, but also in our SG&A.
We took G&A out in the fourth quarter. We expect to take out some more this year as well as selling costs. So, Gail,
our focus in Wood Products is to respond to the market that we have today, to be prepared to respond when the market
recovers, but in fact be cash-positive with the demand that we have today.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay. And are there incremental savings I see as you made the impairment decisions in
December there would be some savings that you expect to see in the first quarter from those?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, they will start to show up in the first quarter,
both SG&A as well as you'll see some reduction in depreciation and we should expect to see manufacturing costs start
to fall a bit as a result of higher utilization in the facilities that we are operating.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay. And can you give us a sense of what operating rates were in the fourth quarter?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You're going to have to give me a minute to respond
to that, Gail.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay, no worries.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Maybe while you look that up, just another generic question. I know it's a little bit early, but
can you talk about what you're hearing, obviously your WRECO's backlogs are pretty thin right now, just what you're
hearing about the spring selling season?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I'll talk about WRECO and then I'll come back
to our operating rates in our Wood Product facilities. With respect to the home markets, we and others entered the year
with lower backlogs than we had one year ago. That's an impact primarily of the Housing Tax Credit that was in place
at the beginning of 2010 that, as you know, went away at the end of April. So we're entering the new year and other
builders are entering the year with low backlogs.
Normally, the spring selling season starts to kick in following the Super Bowl weekend. So don't count on it this week
– but believe me, we're going to be looking for traffic signs and sale signs in our own homebuilding business, but I
think what we do is reflective of what other builders do.
So what we and other builders would expect to see is some pickup in activity, but traffic has been relatively anemic.
Home buyers are still challenged with qualification for mortgages if they are a first-time buyer. If they are a move-up
buyer, they are challenged by number one, the ability to sell their house. And secondly, a number of these move-up
buyers may have mortgages that are under water. So that makes the market relatively sticky.
And so as we look at 2011, we and others think of 2011 as a bit of a mirror image of 2010. So 2010 started out more
strong, ended up weak; we would expect 2011 to start out weak and then be stronger as we go through the year in order
to get to the numbers that are forecast by most economists for 2011 starts.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Sorry, the operating rates?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. In terms of operating rates in the fourth
quarter, in our lumber business, we were operating at about 60% of capacity. In our OSB business, we were operating
at 49% of capacity. In our engineered wood products business, it was more in the 30% range. So engineered wood
products, as you know, primarily go into new home construction. Lumber, we've got a number of different markets
including the repair and remodel market. OSB has some alternatives other than just new home construction but the
engineered is focused on new home construction.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you. And just one last quick question, I guess for Patty. Can you talk a little bit
about how we should think about the tax rate for 2011?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Gail. As you know, the tax
rate as we go forward is pretty sensitive to the blend of income in the REIT versus the TRS and, of course, the income
in the REIT basically is not taxable. So as we sit here today, we would look at the blended tax rate being something just
a little over 20% for 2011 as we go forward, maybe around the 22%. But it'll change depending upon how that mix
changes as we go out in the year, but that's our best estimate at this point.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You bet.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Pete.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: A couple of questions. I was curious – on the land you sold in Washington, can you
comment on the average age of the inventory?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would say, Pete, I don't have
the average age overall but the whitewoods that were predominantly on that land were more of the merge. There was
some Doug fir, but it's pretty, it's pre-merge that's on there. So it – the whitewood stands would be a higher age class
than the lesser amount of Doug fir that was there.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Okay. So is it fair to characterize it as mostly pre-merge or is that not necessarily
[inaudible]?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, there was – but remember
these are the storm-damaged lands that were damaged by the storm in 2007. So we had salvaged. This particular tract, I
think, didn't have as much as some of the others, but we did salvage a lot of wood off those storm-damaged lands that
we sold.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Okay, that's helpful. And Dan, I was curious if you could comment on shipping; remind us
what you have in terms of assets in that business, and does it provide a competitive advantage to your Pacific
Northwest timber as you look at the Asian opportunity?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have a shipping business, Westwood Shipping.
The primary business of Westwood is really container trade, Pete. And our largest log customer in Japan operates its
own ships into our West Coast operations, and so our logs are going out on their ships. As we ship to China and Korea,
some of that log volume goes out in container. Some of it goes out break bulk. We are not dependent on our own ships,
although some of them are used for that purpose. So it's not a critical strategic need for us as it might have been in the
past, given that there's a range of alternatives for exporting those logs.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Okay, that's helpful. Patty, do you – could you update us on the underfunded pension
balance at the end of the year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Our funded status has
improved year-over-year. Just going back to last year at this time, we were underfunded about $600 million on a PB)
[projected benefit obligation] basis and as we sit here today, we're just under $500 million underfunded. Now this
includes the liability for our non-qualified plans as well as our qualified plans and as you know, we don't fund the
non-qualified plans. That's about $200 million of that balance.
As we look at the underfunded status, it improved as a result, certainly, of the contributions that we made, also the
return on the assets that we have invested in those funds. So our investment return was probably on the order of around
$500 million. Benefit payments out of those plans were around $330 million.
And then the other big piece that moved in a negative way in terms of this funded status would be in the actuarial
assumption around discount rate. Now, the discount rate in the U.S., for example, we moved from 5.9 down to 5.4; in
Canada, from 6.1 down to 5.3. The interest rate assumptions increased the underfunded status by about $370 million.
So that was a negative factor as we looked at the funding.

those are the main swings in the underfunded status. One thing I would point out as knowledge, we look forward into
2011, the non-cash expense associated with these plans will change from – in 2010, we had a $47 million pension
credit as we amortized the actuarial assumption changes. As we go into 2011, that will swing to a $60 million non-cash
expense as we amortize the actuarial losses that are on our balance sheet today but they sit in other comprehensive
income. So as we amortize those through the P&L and expense, we anticipate about a $60 million pension expense.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: First question, just to make sure we have this right, you mentioned, Patty, a $60 million expense
non-cash for this year, what was it in 2010?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: 2010, it was for pension, it was a
$47 million credit.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: So, that will be a swing that we'll see sort of on an ongoing earnings of $107 million then?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. So remember that, as I said,
that's a non-cash charge that runs through the P&L. The other piece that you're probably interested in would be the
pension contributions that we anticipate in 2011.
I had said on the third-quarter call that we thought that we would be contributing about $100 million in 2011 to our
Canadian plans. That looks like it will be probably more on the order of $80 million as we finalized the numbers. We
don't have to make a contribution to our U.S. plans in 2011; any contribution that we would make would be – not have
to be made until 2012 but if we make a contribution at all, it likely will not be of any significant amount because our
U.S. funds, plans are just slightly underfunded. The other payout will be in our non-qualified plans, the ones that I said
that we don't fund and that runs around $20 million, pretty much year-to-year.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Gotcha. And Patty, as we look at that 107 swing, does that occur – that doesn't occur on the
corporate line, right? It's actually in the segments, and can you give us – if that's true – what the rough breakdown is?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. What we do for pension
expense, we take the pension expense through the corporate segment and we allocate out to each of the segments their
portion of the service cost. So they don't get the whole expense. They do just get the service cost going forward. And
the offset comes into the corporate line. So, for example, as you look on page nine, I think it is, of the analyst package,
we've mentioned that we had about $74 million of credit in the corporate segment in 2010. That $74 million is higher
than the number I gave you before because the offset to it is the expense that's charged in the segments. And we'll give
you a breakdown of that. I think it will be about – the charge that will go into the segment line is about $48 million. So
we'll charge expense of $48 million into the segments and then we'll offset that credit in the corporate segment to get a
total net expense of $60 million.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Gotcha. One quick one and as I ask it, thank you very much for this packet, it's very helpful. One
question is: in the Timberlands, you mentioned you sold or had HBU [highest and best use] sales, or land sales of $131

million in '10 up from $77 million in '09. And if we exclude the deal you just closed today, what is a good guess as to
the both land sales and just exchanges in the HBU sales in 2011?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, those sales – since they are
non-strategic – they come about as the part of upgrading our portfolio. So they are something they're not all necessarily
even HBU sales. They really are sales of timberland where we believe we can trade out of what we have currently for a
better value in terms of those exchanges. So I think as we look over the course of the last few years, if you back out the
sale that we announced for the 82,000 acres, it will probably be something less than what we have had on an ongoing
basis, and I think historically those run in the realm of around $100 million.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Dan, is it possible to get some sort of sense of the benefit that you think you'll get from this
pickup in Chinese purchases of logs and lumber, because it sounds like what they're buying is kind of below what you
typically try to sell.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It is below what we try to sell in lumber. So let me
take them in two parts, Mark.
In terms of logs, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a dramatic pickup in exports to China. It is still only about a
fifth of the volume that we're sending to Japan, but this has all happened over the last several years. For us, the pickup
in exports to China started as we started to harvest the storm-damaged woods on the west side of Oregon and
Washington following the December 2007 storm.
So at that point, they were taking storm-damaged wood as well as some of that was going to Korea. And over time
what we've seen is a steady upgrade in the value, in the quality of the wood that they're taking. It's still not of the same
grade as the Japan log. But there's been really a steady increase in both volume as well as the quality of the logs that
they're importing.
As you know, some of that's related to the slowdown in exports from Russia, but it seems like it's a combination of
slowdown in Russia and perhaps some other markets that may have been exporting into China plus a general pickup in
their economy. Still going into what we believe our industrial grades and industrial applications, concrete form work, et
cetera, but there's been a steady improvement.
With respect to lumber, they started taking lumber primarily out of British Columbia, field-damaged wood and that
continues to be the case. We are further away from the Coast in B.C. and so that's not a primary market. But the benefit
that we see is to the extent that any volume of logs or lumber that's being exported to China, on a marginal basis,
creates more opportunity for us in North America.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Yeah, that's very helpful. Second question I had is: just generally any thoughts about kind of
potential for more non-strategic asset sales in 2011, whether that's likely to be a material amount for you guys?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have some non-strategic assets that we've
identified. In the past, as you know, we had identified the railroads. We had identified some of this non-strategic
timberland. We evaluate opportunities all the time and our goal is to monetize them when the market's appropriate. But
I can't give you any guidance for specifics for the balance of this year, Mark.

<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And then the other thing I was curious about, just your specialty cellulose business, because
it seems like a lot of your competitors have been making moves here over the last 6 or 12 months. GP acquired a pretty
large producer and is converting to fluff. Rainier's looking at investing to kind of go up the value chain, and Domtar's
getting into fluff. How do you think about what you want to do in that business going forward?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We like the fluff business. We've got strong
customer relationships with customers that are growing globally that need the product that we produce. We have seen
some shift to fluff, as you identified, both with Domtar as well as GP. But at the same time, there is this increased
interest in dissolving pulp, with some manufacturers talking about converting some of their fluff capacity to dissolving
pulp.
So we view that as positive because there may be existing fluff that may be converted, and that will create some
opportunity for us. We have customer relationships globally, and we'll continue to seek out opportunities to improve
the mix that we produce in the overall margin that we're able to gain out of selling to those customers.
But the market is in flux a bit, as you know, with this heavy demand for dissolving pulp driven primarily by – I believe
we're about 140-year high prices for cotton.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. Could you see putting a lot more capital into the cellulose business?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I can't see putting a lot more capital in the near term.
We are investing to maintain the effectiveness of our mills. A lot of the capital that we put into our mills is targeted at
projects that will reduce costs, primarily energy. So we've got some green energy projects and those that will improve
our cost of production. But we're not anticipating any significant increase in capital spend.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And then finally, is it possible, Patty, to just help us kind of bridge on the maintenance in
that business as we go from fourth quarter to first quarter. It sounds like it's going to be up but I am not sure how much
it's going to be up. And then what kind of a drop-off we might see as we go into the second quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Mark. Let me start by
saying, as you point out, the maintenance outages are lumpy in that business. So last year, we had two in the first
quarter, three in the second, and then a shorter one in the fourth, which was our New Bern, North Carolina, mill. So as
we go moving from the fourth to the first quarter now, we will have two outages in the first quarter and those outages
will be longer and somewhat more extensive than the New Bern shutdown in the fourth quarter.
I think the way to think about it is that in terms of increased expense over what we spent in the fourth quarter for
maintenance spend at South, it will probably be on the order of, say, $25 million to $30 million additional maintenance
expense. And then we'll also have an impact of the – to productivity of those two mills being down and some additional
chemical cost. So I think that's the way to think of going from Q4 to Q1. And then in Q2, it depends on how many mills
will be down in Q2, but if it was similar to last year, for example, where we had three, we actually had more
maintenance in the second. But I don't have that maintenance schedule in front of me.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay, listen, I appreciated the level of detail today, and also that earlier release time.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You're very welcome and we've
really appreciated the comments and feedback that we've heard. So if there are some other things that we can do to
improve it further, please feel free to let Kathy know and we'll see what we can do.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay.

<Q - Mark Connelly>: Good morning. When we look at your changes you made in the home building offerings, you
made a lot of changes in price points and value propositions and it looks like that has paid off nicely when we hear your
comments and think about what's happened to margins. Can you give us a sense, Dan, of whether we're going to see
another shift like that this year, or should we be thinking of this as more of a slowly evolving shift in trends? Because
the last one was sort of a big discrete step change, I'm just wondering if we should be anticipating something like that
again.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You should not anticipate a significant step change.
This is really an ongoing process that all of our subsidiaries are engaged in, not just because of the market that we're in
today, but they've continued to adjust their value propositions over time. We do have an evolving market today and
there has been a shift to somewhat smaller product. Although ironically, our one operation in the Pacific Northwest,
Quadrant Homes, which is a first-time buyer homebuilder has actually upgraded their product in today's market and
that seems to be a more effective value proposition than their old one.
So what you see in the results is a function of, I think, our local operators are finding to – opportunities and competitive
niches in their own marketplaces, and it's also a function of the markets in which we operate, our land position, which
as you know is significant as compared to some other homebuilders and we've been able to capitalize on that in this
market.
<Q - Mark Connelly>: Okay. So, overall, you'd say that you're pretty happy with the propositions across all the
markets right now?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We are. These are all very competitive markets. And
now if you were to think about longer-term shifts in product type, I don't think we would see anything radical in
WRECO. There may be some greater shifts in some of the national homebuilders as they have downsized product and
everyone's searching for a formula that will make them successful and fundamentally make them profitable.
We watch that from the perspective of our Wood Products business because to the extent that higher-density product is
being built that has some implications for engineered wood products. Square footage changes have implication on the
amount of lumber and engineered wood products which is used in every single house.
<Q - Mark Connelly>: Sure, very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Mark.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you. First, one quick follow-up on the book tax rate, you gave us that, thank you. Is it
fair to say that your cash taxes would be a lot lower because of being able to use biofuel credits, et cetera? Can you tell
us what cash taxes would likely be?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Mark, you're exactly right.
We will utilize the biofuel tax credit going forward. So cash taxes for 2011, I would anticipate, would be significantly
lower than our book tax.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And then second, you talk about over the course of this cycle paying out roughly 75%
of funds available to the dividend potentially. Do you – should we be thinking about things like the Washington sale as
a part of those funds available or do you think of that as something separate, and then how about the other $100 million
or so of land sales that you would typically have in a year? Would that be something that would be included in your
thought process of funds available or not?

<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Let me think about or talk
about 2011. So as we set the dividend, talked with the board, and they determined the final dividend for 2011, we did
have knowledge about these asset sales at that point in time, and as we said on our dividend call, they were included in
the numbers in the consideration for setting the dividend in 2011. I think, as we go forward past that, the large numbers
– if we were to have additional non-strategic lands of a really significant amount – that we deal with that at that point in
time. We don't have any identified at this point.
In terms of an ongoing just normal timber sales that we do on a regular basis, those would be included in our funds
available for distribution; but remember that a lot of those we do with 1031 exchanges to avoid having to pay the tax on
them because, even though we are in a REIT for the next 10 years, we will have to pay tax on any timberland that we
sell. So I'd anticipate that just as a course of business to the extent we can, we would try to do those with 1031
exchanges.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And two real quick ones to you, on the timberland harvest for 2011, can you give us a
sense as to what you expect it to be relative to 2010 and maybe ...
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We expect it, yeah, we expect it to be up. You
would like a percentage, wouldn't you?
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: I'd love it.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't think it's up probably any
more than 10%, Mark, but let us take a look at that and get you a more...
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay, super. And then just one last clarification on the pension. If I understand it rightly,
since servicing costs probably stay roughly the same in 2011 to 2010, so for modeling purposes, effectively that $107
million swing would basically run through the corporate line. Is that the right way to look at it, and if so, what should
we use in order of magnitude for corporate expense for the full year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That is pretty close to the right
way to look at it. I think, Mark, we're going to be charging about, as I said before, right around 40 some, $40 million to
$50 million to the segments. So if you took the – and last year, I think, we had roughly the same number maybe just a
little lower than that, but it was in the low to mid-40s. So I think your analysis about all in quarter – or year-over-year
in the segment, it's going to be pretty similar. So, last year, for example, we had a net credit of $47 million. We charged
the segments about $42 million, I think, and so the additional credit that you see on the analyst package on page nine
for the corporate segment, I think was $74 million.
That $74 million also includes an offset of about $16 million. That's for the post-employment benefit cost. So you've
got two things going on there; you've got pension and other post-employment costs. And we don't charge the other
post-employment out to the various segments. So that would stay in the corporate. So going forward then into 2011,
we'll have about $60 million for pension and another $16 million again for other post-employment. Those will run
through the corporate line, and then we will also charge out to the segments about $48 million, I think it is, and that
credit will come into the segment line at corporate.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: So will corporate be roughly $20 million, $25 million a quarter in 2011 for everything?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: For everything, it will be about
$16 million for other post-employment benefits; and for pension, it will be about another $10ish million.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chercover with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Hey, everyone. Going back to the pulp business a little bit, your old Cosmopolis mill is now
coming back as a dissolving pulp mill, so when you see assets coming back, does it make you change your view on
whether to close or sell them and that could be applicable to building materials as well.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It hasn't changed our view with respect to the
Cosmopolis mill, in particular. Let me just talk about that – that was a business that we decided to exit. It was a mill
that took a significant amount of capital to maintain and operate over time. And we were pleased to sell it. That – the
impact of that mill coming back is actually positive because it creates some additional demand for fiber in the region,
and puts a number of people back to work in that community that – were long-time Weyerhaeuser employees.
As we look at other facilities, we look at the impact of the mill, if we were to sell it, becoming a competitor. So the
Cosmopolis mill is not a competitor of ours. If we were to be exiting other manufacturing facilities, including some in
the Wood Products business, we would certainly evaluate the impact on our position in the remaining facilities in that
sector and make a determination accordingly whether or not we wanted to sell it or shut it down.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Great, I was kind of hoping you'd go there. And second quick one, could you just confirm
that the 82,000 acres that you're selling was part of your 2011 expectations when you established your dividend policy
in December?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, it was. We had talked last year about the fact
that it had been on the market for a period of time. The last guidance that I provided about that was that we had
increased interest and we thought that we would have a transaction that we might be able to execute early in 2011. So it
was factored into our expectations when we provided our dividend guidance.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: I thought that was the case. Thanks very much.

Your final question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua Barber>: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your cash position given
what we've seen recently in the credit markets. Cash net of – or including the Hancock sale this morning seems to be
closer to $1.6 billion and you have some pretty modest capital spending targets for '11, and even taking into account the
2012 debt maturities, at what point – I guess the question is: what level of cash balances do you feel comfortable
running at for the next couple of years, and would you feel comfortable with your refinancing prospects in 2012, that
you're sufficiently comfortable using some of that cash today for other shareholder activities?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, as we go into 2011, I think
as we talked about on the Dividend Call, we knew that we would have this cash coming in on the sale. As we look
forward, the 2011 environment is pretty uncertain in terms of the housing market. And as we think about our cash
balances, we were very comfortable looking at dividending out pretty close to 100% of our funds available from
distribution in 2011. We're in the process of looking at renewing our credit line of $1 billion that expires at the end of
this year. So I think as we go forward, we'll continue to think about what the best use of cash is and how the markets
unfold in terms of economic recovery in 2011.
What we said in terms of the debt balance was that we thought that, given the cyclicality and the makeup of the
portfolio as we sit here today, that something under $4 billion of total debt would be appropriate. Now as you point out
on a net debt basis, we are there as we sit here today and that it really depends on what we do with our cash going
forward. But we're very comfortable that we can deal with those maturities, we're comfortable that we can deal with the
economic scenarios as they unfold and how much cash we will need will be a function of all of those as well as
renewing our bank credit line, which I think will be a very favorable development.

<Q - Joshua Barber>: Okay. One slightly different question: you had referenced before some increasing
manufacturing costs and chemical costs on the Fibers business. Can you talk a little bit more about that maybe in
percentage terms, what you're seeing there, and what the expectations are for the first half of the year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Expectations, Josh, are that those processes are
moving up a bit. In some locations we've got fiber costs also increasing. I don't have a specific percentage that I can
provide you at this point.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't have a specific
percentage for you, Josh. Part of the chemical cost increase also in the first quarter over the fourth quarter is a result, I
think, of additional maintenance because we tend to use additional chemicals when we take the mills down for
maintenance. So I don't know that that was necessarily a long-term chemical cost but it really will be a function of what
happens to oil prices as we go forward and how that impacts the rest of the chemical cost. So we don't have a
longer-term forecast beyond the first quarter for you.
<Q - Joshua Barber>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you.
Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. So as we close the call, I'd just like to summarize our key theme for the new year; and that is that, as we and
other builders enter 2011 with lower sales backlogs than a year ago, we'll need housing sales to gain momentum
throughout the year in order to reach forecasted annual levels. Our focus, therefore, in our Timberlands, Wood
Products, and WRECO businesses is to continue to improve profitability at today's level of demand while being
prepared to take advantage of our significant operating leverage if the pace of recovery picks up. In our Cellulose
Fibers business, we'll continue to focus on operational excellence while meeting the needs of our growing customers.
The closing of our approximately $200 million sale of non-strategic lands in the West that we announced earlier today
is a solid start for the year. And we look forward to building on this space with improving operational performance. We
appreciate all of your attention this morning and encourage you to follow-up with Kathy McAuley if you have further
questions. Thanks very much.
