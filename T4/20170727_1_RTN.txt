MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Jasmine and I'll be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay
proposes.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Jasmine. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call.
The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available
on our website at raytheon.com.
Following this morning's call, an archive of the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available on
the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then
move on to questions.

Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and
expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?
Thomas A. Kennedy
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our growth strategy continued to gain traction in
the second quarter. Revenue increased by 4.2% and was driven by demand from across our global customer base.
Overall operating performance in the quarter was strong and our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow results
were all ahead of our expectations. Because of these stronger-than-expected results, we are increasing our sales and
EPS guidance for the year. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
As our second quarter results show, we continue to see strong customer demand for many of our franchise programs.
With that said, I'd like to take the next couple of minutes to discuss the solid progress we are making toward adding
new franchises to our portfolio.
During the quarter, we were awarded a highly competitive contract for the engineering and manufacturing development
phase of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar program, also known as 3DELRR. This is again
based multifunction expeditionary radar for the U.S. Air Force that has been designed for export ability from inception.
Over the lifetime of the program, we believe this is a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for the company.
Beyond 3DELRR, we were also awarded $116 million contract in the second quarter for the risk reduction phase of the
Long Range Precision Fires program for the U.S. Army. Raytheon is one of two competitors selected for this phase.
Our solution is called DeepStrike, which doubles the firepower and extends the range over current systems by more
than 40% and will replace the current ATACMS system. With DeepStrike, we have an innovative, highly competitive
solution that significantly enhances the Army's long-range strike capability.
U.S. Navy is also looking to enhance its ability to address threats from longer ranges, including over-the-horizon strike
capability. To meet this demand, Raytheon, in collaboration with Kongsberg, is proposing the Naval Strike Missile.
This is a fifth-generation long-range, precision strike weapon that can find and destroy enemy ships at distances of up
to 100 nautical miles and is fully operational and in use today. And it meets or exceeds the U.S. Navy's
over-the-horizon requirement for survivability against high-end threats.
We expect the Navy's decision by the end of 2017. With this award, our goal would be to replace the existing domestic
and international inventory of Harpoon missiles with the Naval Strike Missile. During the quarter, we also made
progress on certain early-stage development technology that lays the foundation for potential future franchises. For
example, Raytheon and the U.S. Army, in collaboration with the U.S. Special Operations Command, completed a
successful flight test of a high-energy laser system aboard an Apache helicopter.
The demonstration marks the first time that a fully integrated laser system successfully engaged and fired on a target
from a rotary wing aircraft. In other areas of the company, particularly IIS, we have been successful on several
opportunities that leverage our core capabilities in cyber, analytics and automation. These capabilities are further
strengthened by our considerable expertise in advanced agile software development, rapid prototyping and sustainment,
which collectively the U.S. Air Force has referred to as DevOps.
Some recent successes include, in April, we were awarded a contract with an initial value of up to $375 million over six
years to sustain and modernize the Air and Space Operations Center for the U.S. Air Force. Under this contract,
Raytheon will maintain and update existing software as well as develop and deploy new software upgrades to improve
our Air and Space Command and Control Operations. This award also creates an opportunity to expand into other

areas, increasing the future potential revenue opportunity beyond the initial award.
In early June, we were awarded the Systems and Computer Resources Support contract valued at up to $600 million for
software support and sustainment to modernize missile defense and other strategic systems for the U.S. Army.
Raytheon will support the Army's efforts to design, test and deploy software updates for critical systems used globally
by U.S. combatant commands.
And in mid-June, Raytheon was reaffirmed as the prime contractor and systems integrator for the Department of
Homeland Security's Development, Operations and Maintenance program, also known as DOMino. With this award,
Raytheon will help protect the networks of more than 100 federal government agencies. It's a strong validation of our
cybersecurity capabilities. I would add that the last two of these three programs have been protested, which continues to
be the norm in today's environment.
Turning to international, last month, at the Paris Air Show, we hosted over 700 meetings with a wide range of global
customers. Having spoken personally to customers there as well as on other customer visits, I can tell you that demand
for our advanced solutions is strong and growing. And you are seeing this in our second quarter results where
international revenue increased by a solid 4.3% and international bookings comprised 35% of our total bookings.
One of the company's larger bookings in the quarter was a $619 million award for the restart in the Standard Missile-2
program. This award was funded by four international customers. Looking forward, we see the potential for even more
opportunities for Standard Missile-2. Other new international opportunities also emerged in the second quarter.
For example, in late June, the State Department filed Congressional Notification for a potential deal with Taiwan
valued at up to $1.4 billion, approximately half of which we expect to book within the next 24 months. These programs
include JSOW, torpedo, HARM missiles and Standard Missile-2s. This emerging opportunity reflects the continued
solid demand we're seeing out of the Asia Pacific region.
Over the past 13 years, we have increased our international revenue each year. To enable this, we have continuously
adapted our international strategy to best position the company for growth. For example, in May, I had the honor of
being part of the inaugural Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum. While there, I signed an MoU at a ceremony with King Salman and
President Trump to cooperate on defense-related projects and technology developments in the Kingdom. The MoU also
included a framework for Raytheon to establish a wholly-owned company in Saudi Arabia called Raytheon Arabia,
which will significantly build on our more than 50-year history in the country.
Turning now to Europe, we're making progress on multiple large international Patriot opportunities, including Poland
and Romania. In Poland, we continue to expect the total value of this opportunity to be nearly $5 billion, broken into
two phases. We're expecting an LOA for the initial phase to be signed by the end of this year at a value of over $1
billion, with a booking expected sometime in 2018.
The recently announced Romania Patriot opportunity continues to move forward as well and is also likely to result in
multiple awards. The initial LOA is expected by the end of 2017 for several hundred million dollars with a total
Romania Patriot opportunity expected to be in the $2 billion range. Beyond Poland and Romania, we see additional
Patriot opportunities in the region.
In summary, we had a strong quarter and continue to see a wide range of opportunities to drive future growth. I'd like to
thank the members of the Raytheon team for making it all possible quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year to delivering
for our global customers and shareholders with our focus on execution, performance and innovative solutions.
I'll now turn the call over to Toby. Toby?
Anthony F. O'Brien
Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the second quarter highlights. And then, we'll move on to
questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would
please turn to page three. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter with

bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second
quarter of $6.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04.
Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 4.2%, led by our IDS, Missiles and Space and Airborne Systems businesses.
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.89, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated
solid operating cash flow of $782 million in the second quarter which was better than our prior guidance, primarily
driven by the timing of collections.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 600,000 shares of common stock for $100 million, bringing the
year-to-date share repurchase to 3.3 million shares for $500 million. Also, as previously announced, we repurchased
$591 million in notes that were due in March and December of 2018. As a result, a non-operating charge of $39 million
pre-tax or $0.09 per share associated with this early retirement of debt was recorded in other income and expense in the
second quarter of 2017.
As a reminder, last year included the ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that resulted in a tax-free gain of $158
million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter 2016 financial results. Before moving on, based upon
our strong performance to-date, I also want to point out that for the second time this year we're raising the full year
2017 outlook for bookings, sales and EPS. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the
second quarter were $6.5 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $12.2 billion. Worth noting that on a trailing
four-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.09.
For the quarter, international was 35% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 34%. For the
year, we expect international to be about a third of total bookings. We've booked several significant awards in the
second quarter, including $690 million for Paveway and $619 million on Standard Missile-2 in our Missile Systems
business and $374 million on the Warfighter FOCUS Program at IIS.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $36.2 billion, up over $1 billion compared to last year's second quarter.
Approximately 42% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.
If you now move to page 5, as I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2017, sales increased by a solid 4.2% and
exceeded the high end of the guidance we set in April, primarily due to better-than-expected performance across
several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.
Looking now at sales by business, IDS had second quarter 2017 net sales of $1.5 billion, up 5% compared with the
same quarter last year. The increase in net sales for the quarter was driven primarily by higher net sales on an
international early warning radar program awarded in the first quarter 2017. In the second quarter 2017, IIS net sales of
$1.6 billion, down slightly from the same period last year, as expected.
Missile Systems had second quarter 2017 net sales of $1.9 billion. The 11% increase from the second quarter 2016 was
primarily due to higher volume on the Standard Missile-2, Standard Missile-3 and Paveway programs. SAS had net
sales of $1.6 billion. The 4% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on a domestic classified program.
And for Forcepoint, sales were in line with last year's second quarter.
Moving ahead to page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin in the quarter was
13.5% for the total company and 12.4% on a business segment basis. It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain
in the second quarter 2016 that I discussed earlier was worth about 260 basis points or 2.6 percentage points at the
company level. Excluding this gain, our margins in the second quarter of 2017 were consistent year-over-year. So,
looking now at the business margins.
IDS second quarter 2017 operating margin was strong at 16.8%. Last year's second quarter operating margin at IDS
included the TRS transaction, which was worth about 11.3 percentage points. IIS operating margin was down slightly
compared to last year's second quarter. The decrease in margin at Missiles in the quarter compared with the same
period last year was primarily driven by an expected change in program mix. We see Missiles operating margin
improving in the back half of the year.

SAS margin was up 30 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a
favorable change in program mix and other performance in the second quarter of 2017. And at Forcepoint, the second
quarter 2017 operating margin, as expected, was lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to planned
investments to expand the sales force capacity, increase the new business pipeline and improve brand awareness. For
the full year, we still expect their margins to be in the 10% to 11% range.
Turning now to page 7. Second quarter 2017 EPS was $1.89, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and
productivity, but lower than last year's second quarter due to both the $0.09 charge associated with the early retirement
of debt in the second quarter of 2017 and the $0.53 gain from the TRS transaction in the second quarter of 2016.
On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for sales and EPS to reflect our
improved operating performance to-date compared to our prior guidance. We have increased the sales range by $200
million and now expect our full year 2017 net sales to be in a range of between $25.1 billion and $25.6 billion, up 4%
to 6% from 2016. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.
Turning to share count, we've tightened our diluted share count to approximately 292 million shares for 2017, a 2%
reduction from prior year-end. We have slightly lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the improved tax benefit
associated with stock-based compensation, which, in total, is worth about $0.03 per share for the full year. We now
expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30.5% for the year.
We've increased our full year 2017 EPS by $0.10 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.35
to $7.50. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the second quarter as well as the slight improvement
to the effective tax rate.
As I mentioned earlier, operating cash flow in the second quarter was higher than our prior expectations due to the
timing of collections. We continue to see our 2017 operating cash flow outlook between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.
Similar to last year, our cash flow profile is more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter due to the timing of
program milestones and collections on some of our larger contracts.
And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business. We've increased the full year sales outlook at
both Missile Systems and IIS to reflect a combination of stronger bookings performance to-date and second half
expectations. Now turning to margin, we continue to see operating margin for the company to be in a range of 13.2% to
13.4% for the year.
Before moving on to page 10, we're now raising our full year 2017 bookings outlook to a range of $26 billion to $27
billion. This reflects a $500 million increase to the prior range and is driven by strong demand from our global
customers. This is the second $500 million increase to our bookings outlook this year.
On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the third quarter of 2017. We expect our third quarter
sales to be in a range of $6.18 billion to $6.33 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range
of $1.82 to $1.86. We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $350 million to $450 million.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regards to our capital deployment strategy, we
continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and are targeting returning approximately 80% of free
cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and
operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our
second half expectations, we increased our full year 2017 outlook for bookings, sales and EPS.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Tom, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some bigger picture strategy issues here
and talk about the new opportunities that you have in front of you and talk a little bit about the investments that you
think you might need to make for these new opportunities, both in CapEx and R&D going forward. And then just kind
of your teaming strategy at this point. Have there been any kind of changes to the way that you approach some of these
new opportunities and the way that you team with people, given the ever-changing competitive dynamics that are going
on out there? Thanks
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Okay. So, Jason, we've discussed this before in the past, but we do focus on our
four-pillar strategy. Obviously, our first pillar is to focus on where the Department of Defense is putting their emphasis.
And then one of the big areas there is Integrated Air and Missile Defense, ballistic missile defense. We're heavily
involved in that. And also in C5ISR, heavily involved in working those areas and winning significant contracts in those
areas also, along with just pure cyber and also electronic warfare.
The second area, which I believe is a new emerging area, is the area of high-energy lasers. I mentioned that a little bit
in our script and in the work we've done on a laser pod and put it on a helicopter. Why a helicopter? Well, a helicopter
has one of the worst vibration environments that you'd have to be in, in terms of using a high-energy laser system. So
we really wanted to stress our systems and its capabilities and show that that capability – the design that we had could
withstand the high vibration environment of a helicopter. We're also heavily invested in hypersonics. We recently won
a major program from DARPA called the Hawk program and so working on that very hard. In addition to that, also
working in the undersea area. So bottom line is pushing those areas significantly.
I think the other area, back to our franchises – I did mention one in my script, the Naval Strike weapon. And that is a
teaming arrangement with Kongsberg. We have teamed with Kongsberg in the past on major systems, major franchises.
The other major franchise is a NASAM system where we team with Kongsberg. And we've been very successful on
that in the nation's capital. Another major project is in Oman and in four other countries and have significant
opportunities for that system in both the Europe and also in the Middle East. And bottom line is that we're pressing on
all fronts, new technologies, existing technologies across – and developing and increasing the franchises we have.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And, Tom, maybe I'll just add, Jason, to your point about the investment related to CapEx.
We've talked about how we have seen an increase in our CapEx spending as we look to invest in ourselves to support
growth and efficiency initiatives. Looking forward, for 2018, we're not ready to give any outlook for 2018. We're in the
early stages of our planning process and we'll give more color on the Q3 call. But what I can tell you is sitting here
today, relative to CapEx, we could see some continued growth next year to grow the business and then start to see it
come back down and level back down to levels lower than we've seen in the last couple years as well.

And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Tom and Toby.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Peter.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Could you – on IIS, you mentioned in the press release the classified bookings of $555
million. It really seems like that business is really performing well and we're seeing that on the top line. Can you give

us any color like if it's just the mix of business or competitive pricing, like, in regarding kind of the op margins and the
opportunity to maybe to increase those? Or just maybe some more color on what's going on behind the scenes there.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yes. So, Peter, let me start. And then if Tom wants to jump in, he can. So we raised – I'll
kind of start at a high level, right. We raised the outlook or the guidance for IIS revenue this year. And this was due to
two things. We're seeing some increase to our continued demand, both domestically and international for training in
support of the Warfighter program. And the work on that current vehicle we expect to go well into 2018.
And additionally, Tom talked about in his script some of the recent competitive wins that you just alluded to as well, in
our cyber and C5ISR areas. And we do expect those will be starting to pick up a little bit from a volume point of view
in the second half. As it relates to the margins, IIS this year – they're on track on a year-to-date basis. And we see them
performing well in the back half of the year. We've got a range of 7.4% to 7.6%. We feel good about that.
From a longer-term perspective, you've got to keep in mind that almost definitionally they're a little constrained, right,
because they are the business in the company that has the highest amount of cost type work and the lowest amount of
international work. And just definitionally around that, you're going to see some constraints.
I would say under the current book of business, mix of business, there's opportunity to improve compared to the over
time – not year-over-year, but over time. And maybe an optimal margin for them would be 8% to 8.5%, given their
current book of business. But we are focused. As Tom talked about, we have a four-pillar strategy. A component of that
is international and there are some opportunities that the team at IIS is looking at internationally. If we could get a little
bit more traction there that potentially would bode well for margin expansion at IIS.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Rob.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Hi, Tom. I thought maybe we could talk about the cash deployment. You've given yourselves
a little bit of flexibility here saying 80% returned to shareholders and 20% presumably not being returned to
shareholders. What do you anticipate that money being spent on? I guess, it's M&A, but what are you seeing out there
in the pipeline?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, as you know, Rob, we have a balanced capital deployment strategy. And in that
strategy, number one is to invest in ourselves to grow the business. And we've been on a growth campaign here for over
four years. We're very successful on that growth campaign. We are winning quite a few contracts. And these are
franchise type contracts moving forward, which is going to significantly help us over the next five years relative to
revenue expansion.
So we believe we are making those right investments in a balanced way. The other, obviously, big part of our strategy
is total shareholder return to our shareholders. And so we are a strong proponent on the dividend and making sure that
we support that over the years. And the other area is and we did mention a little bit on the share buyback when
appropriate. We do make the shareholder buyback as part of this overall capital deployment plan.
But, right now, the focus definitely is on growth and expansion. Right now, the properties out there relative to
acquisitions in the defense market are kind of high. So we haven't seen anything attractive. But if there is something out
there that makes sense, we always look at them and determine whether it's the best value for us and, obviously, our
shareholders.

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And, Rob, I'd just add that the 80% is a target. I think if you look back over the last few
years, we were on average a little bit higher than that, not the 20% higher that you mentioned, but a little bit higher.
And the other thing that we have done more often than not is made discretionary contributions into our pension plan
when we think that it makes sense. And as we always do, we'll look at that later this year as well.

And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Hi, Rob.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hi. So DoD Secretary Mattis has been pretty clear that he wants to accelerate
procurement of precision-guided munitions in the 2018 budget. So I wanted to ask you in that vein, Tom, for a little bit
more color. You've talked about your various programs, but can you get a little bit more specific on the type of growth
in production rates that we're looking at for the various programs, like Tomahawk, SM-6, Paveway, SM-3, et cetera?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, number one is we're definitely in support of the Secretary of Defense's position
relative to getting the readiness level up of our forces. And one element of getting the readiness up is weapons systems,
including missiles and munitions and precision munitions. So we have seen an up-tempo definitely starting several
years back, but internationally. We are now starting to see a domestic uptick, obviously in line with the Secretary's
request.
We are working that. Turns out we do have the production capacity to continue to grow in terms of our missile
production. We've been working on that very hard here over the last three years, anticipating this need for a
replenishment of missiles and munitions and are prepared to support the Secretary in his strategy to significantly
increase the readiness of our forces.

<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Sam.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Missile Systems. Just looking at
where you are for the first half – I know you said you're confident that you can still get there for the year, but why will
margins step up so much? Are there milestones, risk reduction? Is there a mix change? What's happening to drive those
margins up in the second half of the year?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yes. Sure, Sam. I'll hit that. So starting with Q2 2017, Missiles margin was in line with
our expectations. As we talked about, it was lower than last year, primarily due to mix as well as the timing of some net
productivity adjustments. And on a year-to-date basis, their margin is in line with year-to-date 2016 as well. We do
expect sequential, right, to Q3 to Q4 improvement in the back half. We're going to be ramping up on some of our
production programs.
There are some major milestones and risk retirement assumptions in the back half of the year that are expected to
generate productivity from factory efficiencies. And also, we see some higher operating leverage and the benefit of that
flowing through in the back half of the year. So it's a combination of a couple, three things that are driving it. But we're

And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get back to maybe Rob Stallard's question
on capital deployment, but in an inverse way. Forcepoint, you've had it since 2015, and I think the CEO of Forcepoint
been talking about, longer term, the optionality of an IPO. Just curious, Tom, your view on what you've been able to do
with it inside the firm versus what its potential could be outside the firm. And, conversely, I know it's a couple steps
forward, but what would you do with the proceeds of kind of reclaiming the capital that you put into it? Thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: First of all, we have no plans at this time in place to do an IPO in the near future. And so
I'll take that off the table. This is a longer-term play for the company. And the overall focus and strategy for this was to
break out the value we have associated with our deep cyber domain capabilities inside the company. Since 2007, we
acquired 14 cybersecurity-related companies to give us the technology to protect ourselves in the cyber domain, to
protect our customers and also to protect the weapon systems and solutions that we provide. So we did that just to
essentially stay in the business and be a business leader in cyber secured systems that we deliver to the Warfighter.
As part of developing that technology, we believe we have some great opportunities to help the commercial sector. And
the reason for creating a Forcepoint company was to allow us to break out that value for the commercial world, but at
the same time help the commercial world in terms of protecting themselves. And, I think, right now, we're seeing a
significant advantage of having Forcepoint not only for ourselves internally. They've helped actually with some of their
solutions strengthen our cybersecurity within Raytheon, also with our supply chain, our business partners and now the
entire commercial space in terms of the industrial base for the nation.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Tom, and I'll just – relative, Myles, to your question, about if and when there was some
type of liquidity event, what will we do with the proceeds. I think the way for investors to think about that, we would
consider that under the framework of the balanced capital deployment that Tom mentioned a little while ago and that
we've been focused on here for several years.
Probably premature to give you anything more than that because it would also depend upon what's happening in the
market, in the overall defense environment, where the rest of the company is at, the outlook for the company. But
needless to say, what we would do is do and use those proceeds with creating incremental shareholder value, which, if
you go back to Tom's comments, that was the whole play in why we created Forcepoint. So that hasn't changed from
what our original objective was.

And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. So yesterday, Northrop talked of JSTARS' decision slipping into
the first quarter of next year and yet you have increased your bookings target by $500 million. Maybe give us some
color on the key potentials you think both domestic and international that could fall into this year and those potentials
that you feel are much more likely next year. For example, Lockheed talks of a potential THAAD order. Is that
something that's in your thoughts for this year or is that a next year opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Okay, Cai. Let me address that first and then I'll have Toby jump in. We are – have
significant opportunities, both on the domestic front, and I think, which is maybe a little bit different than some of our
peers. We have a significant amount of international, also, opportunities. And I mentioned them in my script.
Obviously, there's the Poland, the Patriot. There's the Romania Patriot deal. We have – and that's – all those deals are
late 2017, early 2018. We have significant other opportunities relative to – in IDS, for example, close to $6 billion of
bookings for the year and most of it related in the Middle East. Also have some other opportunities relative to C4I

internationally that we'll be bringing in this year.
And, obviously, in our Missile business, you saw the significant uptick there in demand, actually a prior question here
relative to Secretary Mattis, in increasing the readiness of our forces, needing a strong upside tick in terms of
procurement of missiles and precision munitions. So bottom line is that the demand signal has significantly increased
here over the last several years, but the increase is both on the international front and also on the domestic front.
And on the international front, you can see just through my script it's coming not just from the Middle East, but it's also
coming from the Asia Pacific. Remember, I mentioned Taiwan. And also we have uptick from South Korea and Japan,
and then also in Europe. I mean, we saw the Poland, Romania and there are several other countries in Europe that are
also looking to procure solutions from Raytheon. Bottom line is a very strong pipeline that allowed us to increase the
bookings for $1 billion this year over our initial plan. And moving out into 2018, we feel that there's a significant
strong pipeline to continue that growth through the next several years.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. And, Cai, I would just add, and Tom just mentioned, the $1 billion that we
increased this year, the $500 million you referred to, $500 million in Q1. That increase is 50%/50%
domestic/international, which plays along with what Tom just said. The other thing that's interesting this year we've
already recorded in the first half of the year, from a dollar value perspective, our two largest bookings with the Qatar
EWR back in Q1 and the Paveway orders that we talked about here in Q2.
So in the back half of the year, we don't have any big binary billion, $2 billion type of orders. And I think what that
speaks to is the strength of the portfolio across the businesses. We do have maybe a dozen or so different opportunities,
again, spread across the businesses in the $200 million, $300 million, $400 million or $500 million range. But that's
one thing that's a little different, I think, in a positive way, around the complexion of the bookings this year perhaps
compared to past years.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: And, Cai, I'd' just like to jump on Toby's last statement about the diversity of the pipeline
that we have. That's one of the things that we've been working on very hard here over the last four years, to increase the
diversity of our pipeline. So we're not reliant on any one or two or three awards to go make our plan or to grow the
company. And we think we have the most diverse opportunity pipeline that we've ever had in the history of the
company today.

And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Matthew Akers>: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Matt on for David. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Akers>: I was wondering – I think you've talked in the past about Patriot modernization opportunities. I
don't know. I think you've kind of sized what that opportunities that's out there. Maybe you could just refresh us and list
all of that.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah. Let me jump on that. I mean there's something called Configuration 3+ that we've
been working through and upgrading the 14 nations that have decided to procure the Patriot system. And so we're
working through those. We have about 41 fire units to be upgraded from there. And that is kind of about greater than $4
billion of opportunities out there, just on that. And that's just the upgrades. That's not buying new fire units. I think the
thing that we're seeing a little different than we saw in the past we're having these countries that have Patriot today
actually buying brand-new fire units. So over and above the, we call it, the configuration upgrade, they're buying
brand-new systems. That's one.

And the other one is we are moving forward and have developed a new radar for the Patriot system that allows us to see
much further, to track multiple targets simultaneously in a way we haven't been able to do before. But the bottom line is
to significantly upgrade the capability of the Patriot system. And all the countries that have Patriot today – this will be a
radar that they'll want to upgrade their system to, to provide enhanced capability against the evolved threat. So we see
significant opportunity here over the next decade relative to Patriot in configuration updates, the buying of brand-new
fire units, and now with the opportunity to upgrade with a GaN-based 360-degree AESA radar to significantly upgrade
the overall capability of the Patriot systems they have today.

<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: It's been a little more than a month now that we've – the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar
has been in place. A while back, we saw the F-15 orders still take place in Qatar. Given the importance of the Gulf to
you all, what do see right now as the risks there, politically? Any effect it's having on your business? And what do you
watch to see if it could be an issue?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'll take that on. As I have talked to, actually, the majority of the stakeholders or parties
involved in the situation, as you probably know, the administration has voiced its opinion relative to getting this issue
resolved within the GCC and is actually helping negotiate a settlement on the issue. Relative to Raytheon, we don't
believe this has any impact on our 2017 guidance. We believe that everything we have in play in all of our outlook here
is fine relative to any issue there. We have been awarded contracts from these countries during this period. And so we,
right now, do not see any issue.

<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Tom, Toby, Todd, good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: So, Tom, I'd like to follow up here a little bit more on your remarks you were talking about
a minute ago on international, the President, Saudi, and that every time you speak, things are getting better on
international markets. Now some of your competitors have noted the Trump administration acting as chief salesperson
for U.S. defense exports, also significant improvements in attitudes at State and also an improved regulatory
environment for defense. So I'm trying to get at the underlying causes for the enormous success you're having on
international markets and the strong pipeline.
I mean, are you already benefiting from an improvement in the regulatory environment? Is that causing you to be more
competitive internationally? Because of the administration's actions and based on your ongoing discussions with
customers, are you expecting more of these bundled deals going forward? And I guess you've already stated that you
believe that international growth is sustainable long-term.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Rich, thanks for the questions. Great questions. So let me start with this comment first.
When we compete internationally, when Raytheon competes internationally, we do not compete against companies. We
compete against countries. So, having an administration that supports industry in going after international business
changes the game. And we have an administration now that is significantly supporting international work for domestic

– actually U.S. industry. And that has opened several doors for us. Now we've been very successful before those doors
were opened. So it's bottom line just accelerating our ability to grow internationally.
And so that's why we're very positive about the future of the company, especially relative to the international business.
And we're also seeing, as was mentioned on another question before, a significant push by the Secretary of Defense to
significantly increase the capabilities of our military in terms of readiness, which puts a significant demand signal on
our missile systems, our sensors, precision munitions across the board. So Raytheon has a very healthy outlook for the
future and we're just building on the international foundation we put in place before and are able to accelerate now with
the support from an administration that does support international sales.

And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, Toby. I wanted to ask, the corporate and eliminations line, which is usually like
negative $20 million, it's plus $3 million. And I know it was plus last year, too, but it was one of the keys to your
guidance increase, lowering that number. So just wondering if you could explain that. And then just a quick comment,
since – why don't you provide, like, a net book-to-bill number to eliminate the issue that the bookings less sales never
gets added to the backlog? It always gets something else added. Or just provide some reconciliation of it. Thanks.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Thanks, George. I'll take care of your second question first and I'll maybe help you with
the reconciliation. We did have backlog adjustments in the quarter. They were about $135 million. So that hopefully
should explain the gap there between the bookings and the sales. Relative to the first part of your question on the
corporate-related expenses, there's nothing individually driving that, but we do see some lower expenses for this year
compared to when we started the year. But from a total year perspective, still maybe a tad higher, a little bit higher than
they were last year in 2016.

And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Seth.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Good morning. Toby, maybe could you talk a little bit more. You mentioned the potential for
pension contributions, the degree to which that is dependent on tax reform and how you think about that in two
scenarios, one, where we have tax reform and, one, where we don't? And also, given the strength of the balance sheet,
in a tax reform scenario to get the benefit of the deduction, is there an opportunity, maybe, to make a much more
significant contribution to the pension that would affect the longer-term cash flow profile of the company?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, Seth, I think, one thing, tax reform or no tax reform aside, right, we always wait
towards the end of the year to make a decision on what we're going to do with pension, right. We have a better idea of
where we think returns are going to end up, what's happened with rates going forward, et cetera. So that will continue
on.
Tax reform is a variable, but I'd also say after a lot of potential momentum earlier in the year, maybe not so much, I
think, as everybody has seen lately. But we will take tax reform into account when we make our decision and where tax
reform is and whether or not that has a favorable or unfavorable impact on what we do. Obviously, we don't know what
tax reform would look like exactly, so it's a little hard to specifically answer that question.
Obviously, sustainable tax reform that continues to support investments and high-tech jobs here in the states, we're all
for that. And that would improve – something meaningful would improve the cash flow outlook for the corporation
compared to everything else being equal. And if that happens, we'll update you guys. But, again, maybe a little bit of a

And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Tom, I want to go back to Forcepoint. I know it's the smallest
business unit, but it looks like revenues are a little bit on the light side. And could you talk about some of the
challenges you're facing in the market?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah. Let me just start off. When we talked about this earlier in the year, that this was a
year that we were going to restructure some of the – maybe you can call it the backroom for Forcepoint. We've grown
that from $250 million a year in revenue to $600 million. So we were stressing the backroom quite a bit relative to
being able to support a business of that size. So we did make a decision this year to take kind of a timeout to get their
backroom up and make the investments in the backroom to get them ready to go and accelerate here in 2018. And so
that was one of the things that we talked about earlier.
Relative to their product line, they are updating several of their product lines and integration. One of the big areas that
they're pushing heavily and getting a lot of demand signal for is in the area of data leakage prevention, DLP, combined
with the insider threat capability and working on that to get that product in an enhanced position for the marketplace.
So we're also doing that to help accelerate revenue in 2018.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I think, Howard, you didn't get into the numbers, but in my comments, I mentioned
how sales in the quarter at Forcepoint were in line with last year. That was lower than we were looking at going into the
quarter by about $10 million. I think if there's any good news there, that variance is really driven by timing of awards.
The thing, we had some, dozen or so, awards that moved from Q2 into Q3. We didn't lose those, so there's some good
news there. And think about half of those we've already closed on here in the first couple, three weeks of July as well.
So, a little bit of timing that the team's dealing with there and on top of what Tom said.

And could you just update us on kind of an expected margin trajectory in that business?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So we talked about back in our year-end call and in the first quarter call that this
year Forcepoint has about $25 million of expense included in their margin outlook related to investment, about 40% of
that in the first half of the year and about 60% in the second half, kind of, sort of, split 50%/50% between Q3 and Q4 in
the back half of the year. And then from a longer-term point of view, and consistent with this, that we expect continued
double-digit growth and double-digit margins from Forcepoint.

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Hi, Noah.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Back to Missile and the discussion of the inventory depletion and, I guess, drivers of that
business. So with the growth rate going into the low-double-digits in the quarter and then, I guess, the guidance for the
year implies that kind of stays there in the back half, should we be – I guess, how sustainable is that? Should we be
thinking about that as the growth rate into 2018? And then bigger picture, when you guys talk about a lot of the funding
there recently having been from inventory depletion and now moving to actual funding, the driver there being
readiness, are you actually able to quantify how far below normal levels, both the U.S. and our allies, are compared to
where they want to be?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Let me start on that last question. Number one is we actually cannot provide you an
answer on how low they are. That would be an issue we'd have with those customers. But I can tell you there is
significant demand signal being driven by the up-tempo that is going on around the world today. And so that's driving,
number one, the overall replenishment for the United States and its coalition partners around the world. And so we're
off driving that.
One thing I would like you to also bring to bear here is that missiles does not just do precision munitions. They also do
missiles for ballistic missile defense. They also do air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, surface-to-surface
missiles. And so they have – the demand signal is across their entire portfolio. The precision munition is one aspect of
it, but we're also seeing strong demand. I think we just mentioned it. We just opened the Standard Missile-2 line again,
driven by four international customers' demands. And then we're seeing additional demands now from other
international customers for Standard Missile-2s around the world. So the bottom line is Missiles has a very healthy
pipeline that is increasing. So we're very, I'd say, up on Missiles over the next five years.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And, Noah, just to touch a little bit on your comment about 2018 growth and all. So we're
not going to get into any details here on 2018, but I can tell you, we do expect continued growth for Missiles. And
maybe what I could point you to that help support that is if you were to go back and look over the last couple of years
at the Missiles book-to-bill, last year, it was about 1.13. It was almost 1.3 in 2015. Here in the second quarter, they had
1.48. And we expect for the total year this year, they'll be well over 1, which, again, supports the continued growth for
the Missiles business.
