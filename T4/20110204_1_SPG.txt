During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G.
Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings
release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This
package is also available on the Simon Web site in the Investor section under Financial Information Quarterly
Supplemental Packages.
Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.
David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. We'll go through some highlights and then open it up for Q&A. First of all,
FFO, as adjusted without the impact of our non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter, increased 8.4% from the
fourth quarter one year ago, which was $1.66 to $1.80 per share. We reported FFO of $1.78 per diluted share for the
quarter, which exceeded the First Call consensus estimate by $0.04. And I'm pleased with this performance, which was
accomplished, despite the following fourth quarter items.
We recognized transaction expenses of $6.4 million, or $0.02 per share. We recorded an impairment charge of $8.2
million, or $0.02 per share, for an investment in a development project in Italy that opened in November of '07; and
Opry Mills remains closed after the flood in 2010. The negative impact to FFO for the quarter from Opry Mills was
approximately $6.4 million, or $0.02 per share. And this loss will continue for the balance of 2011, for a loss of
approximately $0.05 for the total of the year until we rebuild the center. FFO, as adjusted for the year, was $6.03 per
share, as compared to $6.01 in 2009. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.80 per share, which was 33% higher than
the dividend at this time last year.
I'll talk about NOI now, malls and Premium together, which contributed approximately 90% of our domestic NOI.
Comparable sales, and I should say that these statistics do not include Prime Outlets, to give you a sense of
comparability. Comparable sales on a rolling 12 month basis were $494 per square foot, up 9.3% as it compared to
$452 per square foot at '09 year end. Occupancy at year end this year, or actually in 12, I'm sorry, 12/31/10, was 94.2%,
which sequentially was 60 basis points higher than 9/30 and 80 basis points higher than a year ago.
At year end, the releasing spread for 12 months was a positive $1.15 per square foot. We continue to see gradual
improvement in deal flow and in the pricing of our space. On a same-space basis, our 2010 releasing spread was a
positive $2.71 per square foot. Comparable property net operating income growth was 3.4% for the quarter, 2.9% for
the year, and recall last year we had a positive roughly 1% growth, so we had growth on top of comparable NOI
growth. The drivers of the increase in the NOI for the fourth quarter were higher occupancy and higher sales. Our
operating profit margin is 150 basis points improvement to 70.6%, which we continue to believe is at the top of the
industry.
Just wanted to give you a quick update on Prime, we closed on August 30th. Operations and back office functions have
been successfully integrated. The rebranding of the centers to Prime Outlets name is complete and the portfolios
continue to perform better than we expected. Occupancy for the properties was 95.4% at year end versus 94.7% at 9/30.
Sales were $423 per square foot at 12/31 versus $406 per square foot at 9/30.
Capital markets, quickly, we closed in the fourth quarter four new mortgages totaling $662 million at a weighted
average rate of 4.47% and a weighted average term of 9.5 years. December 31 we had approximately $1.1 billion of
cash on hand, including our share of JV venture cash, joint venture cash, and our availability on our corporate credit
facility was $3 billion, for a total liquidity position of approximately $4.1 billion. We successfully and deployed –
profitably deployed $3.2 billion of cash in 2010 to grow our business through acquisitions, redevelopment and new
development and strengthened our balance sheet by deleveraging and lengthening maturities.
Development, quickly again, we completed expansions at South Shore Plaza, The Domain, Houston Premium Outlets
and Toki Premium Outlets, started construction on new Premium Outlets in Merrimack, New Hampshire, South Korea

and Malaysia, and opened two shopping centers in Italy. In addition, we completed more than 35 anchor/big-box
replacements, all in 2010. And we have been very successful in our efforts to re-tenant department store and big-box
spaces and have 30 new approved anchor or big-box stores with openings scheduled in 2011 and 2012.
Construction has or will commence in 2011 on six significant redevelopment projects, including Fashion Mall at
Keystone in Indianapolis, Las Vegas Premium Outlets, South Pheasant Lane Mall, Southdale Center, Southridge Mall
and the University Mall in Pensacola. We have also reinstated our modernization program and have projects planned at
up to 18 malls over the next two years. During 2011, projects will be completed at Coddingtown Mall, Fashion Valley,
Great Lakes Mall, Orland Square and Plaza Carolina.
Our 2011 budgeted capital spend on new development, redevelopment and modernization projects in the U.S. and
abroad is approximately $500 million. The details on costs, returns and timing of the projects, of course, are provided
thoroughly in our 8-K reporting package.
Guidance, let me just talk about that for a second. We provided 2011 FFO guidance of $6.45 to $6.60 per share. At the
mid-point of the range, this would represent growth of approximately $0.50 per share, or over $175 million of
additional FFO in 2011, as compared to 2010 FFO, as adjusted. I know we are characterized as being conservative from
time to time, but to put that number in perspective, well over half of the public REITs in the U.S. generate less than
$175 million of FFO on an annual basis. So one year of growth, and we are we beating that number. So I'd also like to
point out we expect 2011 to result in an all-time high for SPG in terms of its earnings, and given all the capital raising
and balance sheet activity that was completed in our industry over the last couple of years, I believe that we are one of
the few REITs that can make that statement.
Before I open it up for Q&A, I'd like to just add a few concluding comments and just give you the following thoughts.
First of all, some of you have mentioned concern about our ability to continue to grow in light of our current size and
certain transactional outcomes. Let me emphasize, we are not concerned. No one in our industry has done a better job
of growing their business than we have through good and bad economic cycles, and I don't expect that to change.
We are aggressive in our pursuit of opportunities to profitably grow our business. Our financial strength affords us the
luxury of pursuing transactions that most of our competitors cannot even contemplate. And we will continue to pursue
opportunities that can enhance our franchise. We've also demonstrated discipline. When the opportunity ceases to make
sense for us, we can and will walk away. We have been excellent stewards of shareholders' capital, having successfully
completed $28 billion of acquisitions since our IPO in 1993. And during that period of time, we've delivered, on
average, an 18.4% return to our shareholders. In addition, let us not forget that we did close on a $2.3 billion
acquisition of an outlet portfolio just five months ago, the largest real estate transaction completed in 2009 and '10.
And speaking of the outlet business, there has been some market chatter that we should spin this business off or
somehow break up the company. And let me just give you these following thoughts. The multiple platforms of our
business are very synergistic, as they enhance tenant relationships, result in cross-fertilization of tenants and lead to the
best use of development land, among other things. I think this is best illustrated by sharing some numbers from our
outlet business, pre and post the Chelsea transaction, acquisition, in 2004.
As we will recall, as a stand-alone public company, Chelsea was very well regarded by the Street and considered a
best-in-class performer. In the five years prior to our acquisition, Chelsea delivered an average comp NOI growth of
5% per year, average growth in base rent of 2% per year and positive releasing spreads of 13% per year. All of this was
done with a corporate overhead spend of approximately over $50 million.
We have now owned the portfolio for six years, and during that period of time, comp NOI growth has accelerated to
7.5% annually. Average base rent growth has grown 8% annually and releasing spreads have averaged a positive 32%
annually. We've developed 11 new Premium Outlets in the U.S. and abroad and expanded several more. We have
introduced many new retailers to the outlet sector. We have increased sales at the center by enhancing the actual
product, physical product and the tenant mix. Gross EBITDA of the portfolio has grown a factor of 2.7 times since the
acquisition, frankly, a remarkable feat in the real estate industry. And our outlet business overhead, about half of what
it was six years ago.

The value creation from Chelsea acquisition speaks for itself, and this is attributable to the management expertise we
brought to the business, as well as a result of synergies in income and cost savings that we brought to the platform. And
let us not forget that our regional malls delivered sector-leading NOI growth during this period of time. With the
addition of Prime, we expect our outlet business to continue to grow and be synergistic with our other platforms. As we
have said in the past, we consider ourselves a retail real estate company and not just a mall company.
We have articulated a well developed and thoughtful strategy 17 years ago when we went public, to own highly
productive, high quality assets all along the retail real estate spectrum. We have stayed true to that strategy and it's
continued to serve us – and it will continue to serve us well.
And finally, I'd just like to say we are more than happy to stack our record up as a public company against anyone, and
we are very excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond. And, with that said, we'll open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi. Please
proceed.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Hey, good morning, it's Michael Bilerman here with Quentin.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're honored.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Oh, thank you. David, I want to go on just on those comments about being a retail real
estate company. I can remember back to that initial merger call that you had on the Chelsea deal. And I think you billed
yourself at that point, that was the first time of saying I'm – we're a retail real estate company. And I think it came up
on that call of, how do you view the shopping center business, which you have a few billion dollars in the company
today, but how do you see that fitting in? And with more limited opportunities on the mall side, at least domestically,
and already fully consolidated in the outlet business, how does that next leg either grow or contract within the overall
scheme?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, interesting question in that it has not been a
growth business for us, but there is benefits to being in that business, because there's still a significant amount of
cross-fertilization with the retail community. So in that sense, it's important to have a leg in that business. Additionally,
the vast majority of those centers are in mall -- right near malls, adjacent to the malls that we own and/or in markets
that we have a strong presence in, like Orlando, or Austin or down on the border of Texas.
So we still consider it to be synergistic. We've never been that excited about growing it through acquisition. I don't
think that's going to change, other than there may be a couple here and there because of our regional fit with a center
might make sense. And we also view ultimately, it does provide us some optionality if we ever wanted to grow that
business beyond what it is today. Rick, I think you can add anything, if you'd like to.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing that I would add is that we have certainly been opportunistic in that
business and built a number of shopping centers that were incorporated into other projects we've done, and that's
another important reason to keep that expertise within our platform, so we can take advantage of whatever development
opportunities present themselves.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Right. And I think, David, the comments about spinning off the outlet business, I think
when people look at your multiple and your multiple is below that of shopping centers and the lone outlet company
that's there, and you're trading in line with the regional mall peers, there seems to be a sum of the parts value that's not
being captured in your valuation.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, all we can do is continue to do what we
do. I think if anybody should be given the benefit of the doubt, it's us. I mean, the numbers that we were able to

produce with the outlet business as part of our franchise are unprecedented in real estate. And what can I tell you? We'll
continue to do what we do. But I don't see that business standalone being able to produce the results that it can as part
of our company.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Just one last thing on Capital Shopping Centres. After the vote, I think the CEO, David
Fischel, is quoted in the press as saying that he was glad that the distraction is over, referring to Simon. So I guess,
even though he got a better deal for his shareholders, it didn't matter. As you as a shareholder now or still, can you just
comment about what you're going to do with your stake?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me – you know, I wrote – one of my
friends in the industry sent me a bunny – have you ever seen these bunny movies? They're basically – they're done by
little animated bunnies, but they take a movie and do it in 30 seconds. So I wrote some notes about CSC that I thought I
would just share because it was a lot of press and with the Takeover Panel rules, you can't really talk to the press and
the analytic community about it. So if I could, I'd like to just address it in totality, and this will be, I hope I can do it in
30 seconds. But you can go on YouTube and do bunny movies and pick your favorite movie and you could probably
watch it in 30 seconds. In any event – and I'm not, that's not paid advertising, by the way. I have no idea who does
bunny movies. But we – let me give you my 30 second summary of CSC.
First of all, we've been a supportive, passive shareholder for three years, despite their underperformance. We always
considered our stake as an option if and when they decided to sell. The Trafford sale we thought had two problems:
price and structure, in terms of issuing shares at a discount, which handed control to Whittaker. We asked them to
restructure the deal. They wouldn't, despite the market's poor reaction to the deal. Based on our view that they were
handing control to Whittaker, we decided to make an indicative offer that was subject to due diligence. We would've
never bought the company without due diligence. Management refused to provide due diligence, regardless of whatever
take-out price we would've come up with, which reinforced our view that they were completely entrenched.
They responded with a restructure of the Trafford deal, which we forced, put out a ridiculous indicative value range,
further demonstrating managements' focus on entrenchment. The CEO in the press said that we were a nuisance, even
though our presence forced a better deal with Trafford and benefited their shareholders. Chairman said that the
shareholders are one of many things they consider as fiduciaries, but not at the top of the list. We never made a firm
bid. Company relied on South Africa's shareholder base, which has many different agendas, given they're wanting
exposure outside of South Africa. And we're looking forward to them reaching their indicative value of 625p.
Sounded like more than 30 seconds, but in a nutshell, that's our view of CSC.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: So you sold your share or you kept your share?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We continue to own our shares at this point.
[audio gap]
<Q>: Good morning. Can I just ask one question just in terms of occupancy cost ratios; obviously, some of your peers
have had a big focus on where their occupancy cost ratio is and how much upside or otherwise is in their portfolio. So
can you give us and break out the mall and the outlet occupancy cost ratios for the year end December 2010?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We have them, but we don't break out those
statistics, and Rick is pointing to me the number for the combined portfolio is 12.9% at year end 2010, and year end '09
it was 14.1%.
<Q>: Got you. Okay. Thank you.

And our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Good morning. Bunny movies, I didn't see that coming up on this call today.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know we're trying to liven this up. But if
you've watched them, they're actually kind of funny.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Well, I'm going to have to check it out, I guess. On the guidance, I mean, could you give any
more details, because I'm thinking about the way you might sync [inaudible] NOI or lease spreads and occupancy
evolving over the course of the year?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think it's our nature to obviously, the Milton
Cooper view of the world is certainly our view. I would say that second, that the comp NOI growth that we are looking
toward this year is comparable to what we had in '10. We do have this $0.05 problem with Opry Mills. So it's not a
huge thing. It's a temporary thing. We do expect to build – rebuild that center and get it, not for '11, though. We hope to
get it done by early '12. And, look, I mean, in '10, we had some benefits of bad debt expense and so on, but I think
we're looking for a similar number.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Yeah, because on the lease spreads, if I look at the – your – I guess, what, mall and Chelsea
expiring rents at $33 this year versus what looked like $38.50 last year, is there anything that, if we're not – is there any
reason that I shouldn't believe that your spreads are going to go up? Or is there some non-comparability of the type of
space that is expiring in '11 versus '10?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I think we're moving in trajectory for '11, I
think in the right direction about spreads. So I don't think there's anything unusual there.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Hey, Paul. This is Steve. I just had a couple of comments. David mentioned bad debt. We
have literally no bad debt experience or bad debt expense in '10 for a company with $4 billion of consolidated revenue.
I wouldn't expect that to recur in '11. I also think we have, as David I think mentioned in the call text, we improved our
margin 150 basis points this year, on top of an improvement last year. Some of that was done at the operating expense
line for sure, and I don't think that level of savings at the operating expense line is going to recur in '11.
And then the last thing I'd mention, while it's not part of the comp NOI, if you look at the Other Income schedule in the
8-K, we had a lot of lease settlement income in 2010 and we're just not planning for that to recur in '11. We're looking
at a more historical level.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay, great. That's helpful. Another question just maybe for Rick; as you're talking to retailers
about 2011, I mean, how often and to what extent is there concerns about margin compression coming up in rent
negotiations? And is this – I mean, do you see this being -- how much of a headwind do you see this being as that starts
to bite later in the year?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The rent negotiations with retailers haven't changed in 30 years. They're going to seize
upon whatever facts are currently out there to argue for lower rents, and we're going to seize on whatever facts we can
to argue for higher rents. And right now, we're still seeing firming demand. There is very new little development.
To the extent that the retailers are looking to grow and an increasing number of them are, given their cash flow
generation and profits, we're going to hopefully have the ability to increase our rents as our occupancy moves up. But
that is certainly something they are focused on and legitimately so. It's out there.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: So you think it's just too early to get a feel for how it might play out?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah, I believe that they're going to have to deal with that on their cost of goods sold side
of their margin and we're going to be looking to increase our rents in line with how our sales evolve.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay, great, thanks.

And our next question will come from the line of Christine McElroy with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: I'm on the line with Ross, as well. We've seen a few more department store closings and
floor plate reductions in the last six months or so, and then with the changes at JCPenney and Dillard's, you have
investors speculating about monetization of real estate in the department store space again. What would you say your
appetite is for getting space back today, just generally speaking? I know every situation is different. And can you
provide your general thoughts about department store consolidation and expansion over the next few years?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, let me unpack it. One, as David mentioned in his comments, the demand for our
anchor and big-box spaces is accelerating. If you look in our 8-K, we've listed all that we've added. We had a very
robust program in '10. We've shown you in the 8-K those that are currently totally nailed down for '11. We have almost
double that amount in the pipeline and when we're – if we get spaces back, we're going to be in a position to bring in a
number of retailers and we've demonstrated a pretty broad array, including Bed Bath, Best Buy, Target, Kohl's,
theaters, health clubs. There's a lot of demand for space. Again, there's not a lot of new development.
I don't know that I would agree with your categorization of growing department store closures, because if you look at
the announcements, Macy's on their entire fleet, I think, announced three; Penney announced six. I mean, these are
minimal closures and very much reduced from the percentages of store fleet that we were looking at several years ago.
So we really don't see that coming down the pike.
And the last thing I will tell you, is historically we have done a very good job of redeploying the department store space
that we've gotten back from companies like Mervyns and the May/Macy's consolidation, Lord & Taylor, Parisian and
we make them better.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I just would add that I don't think there's any
market at all, that where a self-managed – I have no inside knowledge of this, obviously, but I don't think there's any
market at all about a self-managed, one-tenant REIT that's going to go access the public markets. I don't see that
happening.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: And then just, Rick, following up on your comments with regard to the $500 million of
spending that you're projecting in 2011 on development, redevelopment, expansions. What kind of returns are you
underwriting?

<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi.
<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: David, when you think about external growth opportunities, how much more closely are you
going to be looking at the JVs within your existing portfolio and buying out the potential partners? That would seem
like a easy potential avenue of growth for you.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It can and has been historically. And we're – it's a
function of price and value. And we did some of that last year, Ross, as you know. Houston and unfortunately, Opry,
that's a little unlucky with Opry. But – and the Great Mall of the Bay Area, which is a very good asset. So I do think

<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: Why, if I understood this correctly, why isn't there business interruption insurance at Opry?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: There is, but we're in the middle of a dispute with
the insurance company. So we took a conservative approach to it.

And your next question will come from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Jay.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: David or Rick, could you just touch on the leasing spreads again? I know you've seen
the rebound in tenant sales, but do we need to see the retailers expanding again to really drive the spreads or can you
comment a bit on it? Do you think it's – it's sales alone that can drive higher rents?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It should ultimately. I think – I think, again, it gets
to a little bit of the property type, where the demand is. But certainly sales moving in the right direction help. The
demand at the better properties is obviously fueling that, and hopefully with the economic stability that seems to be in
the system, I think the more moderate centers will have the ability to flatten the rent. We did, there's no question we
had a handful centers that actually had negative rollovers due to the economic scenario, and we're starting to see a little
bit more stability in that lower group of centers. So -- and that will be important because that does have some impact on
our spreads.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Okay. And then you mentioned obviously the firming economy, but if you think about
external growth, do you re-think U.S. strategy versus looking internationally?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think we've got a lot to do in the U.S. this
year. We're very excited about all that's going on with the properties in terms of redeveloping them, transforming a
number of them. We are really busting hump on that effort. So I'm very pleased with that effort, and we're making
tremendous inroads. A couple that frankly, a year ago I didn't think we had a shot at doing, we're going to start this
year. A couple of them are the Mills malls, which include Southdale and Southridge. So I think the effort is really, I've
been really happy that we're really humping on that front. So we've got plenty to do there.
And you know, Jay, the bottom line is we'll always look both domestically and internationally, externally. We don't
need to do anything to do a deal for a deal's sake. There's no one that's done more deals than us. Yeah, we haven't
always gotten the deal. Sometimes we didn't get it because we didn't want to pay more. And sometimes we didn't get it
because we were dealing with entrenched team and we didn't think it was worth a scorched earth tactic to try and get it.
We felt, well fine, if that's what you want, we'll move on. There's nothing that can keep us from growing. Don't have to
do deals, we've got plenty of properties here to make better, and we're very focused on doing that.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Okay, and then just in terms of dispositions, I know it was asked earlier about shopping
centers, but as you think about some of your B malls, do you see pricing as attractive and I guess, given the capital

that's out there today?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't think it's come yet, but it seems to be
maybe around the corner that some of those assets, some of that market might be there. So I think '11 will be a
developing year in that area. I think like many of our peer, I'm sure there's going to be a focus on narrowing the focus a
little bit by culling the property portfolio. We'll participate in that, but we want to see a little bit more firming of the
values in that category. And not yet, but it seems to be headed in that direction.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: And then just finally on the Gap, I know there's a new executive. Do you see any shift
in strategy? And I guess what sort of conversations have you had thus far?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We have constantly monitored their performance for a very long period of time. They have
been a net loser of square footage in closing under-performing stores. It's obviously a big relationship, one that we are
incredibly focused on at David and my level, and spend a great deal of time on it. We obviously hope for them to be as
productive and as good a retailer as they can be, because that only helps our properties.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And look, all I can tell you is that the -- their outlet
business has been extremely strong, so with the new executive running the Gap, I think that's obviously a positive, at
least based on what we've seen out of the outlet business.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Okay. Thank you.

And our next question will come from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Thank you. In your Supplemental, it mentioned that two centers are being de-malled. Could you
describe those efforts?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. One is University Mall in Pensacola. We're
basically going to create a box environment with Sears and Penney as our lead anchors, continuing to be our lead
anchors there. The other one is in Nanuet where again, we will be de-malling that, and bringing in more of the kind of
higher-end retailers, still will be anchored by Macy's and Sears. We would hope to bring a high-end food provider,
supermarket essentially, and some of the better specialty tenants.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: And do you have a sense of what returns might be on the de-malling process?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: They'll both be double digits. Both of these are
basically producing negative or de minimis cash flow right now. So if we look at the incremental investment based
upon -- and the return now, I think they'll both be double digits.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Oh, great. And then I just had a question if you had any feedback from your Blackberry and
iPhone apps for the malls and where you might be going with that program?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The feedback has been encouraging. Obviously, they're relatively new, but that certainly is
a very significant focus and highlights one of the remarks David made in his initial comments. We are uniquely
positioned to be able to dedicate both the human and the financial resources to be sector-leading in this. I think we have
done so historically, and we are committed to do so in the future. It's a highly important component of how we manage,
market and maintain our properties, and we're going to be devoting increasing time and money to introducing even
more programs in that regard.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And I would just say the people that do follow us on
social media, on the social media side, are our best customers. They really like the fact that we're able to talk to them
about promotions and offerings from the retailers, and it's really influencing some behavior. So this whole area of

basically trying – our vision here, just like we had the vision of being a retail real estate company, our envision with the
mall is to really turn it into a smart box, one where technology can enhance the shopping experience, create more
efficiency out of it, and I think we're just on the cusp of that. We're working with a number of retailers that see the
same vision that we do, obviously trying to put all the retailers on the same platform.
If you think about the mall in a sense, what makes the mall great, it's all the retailers together in one platform. In that
case it's the physical. We really want to move the mall environment, from a technology point of view, on that same
platform as customers interface with what's going on in the mall. And you know, is going to take time, but I think if we
can show that value to the retailer, then by creating that platform, it's going to enhance the shopping experience for the
consumer, and that's what we're after, for sure.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Yeah, I guess I was also interested, because I read that six times the amount of Internet sales
were purchases that were influenced by the Internet but still done at bricks and mortar.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: There is an undeniable link. I think the movement
toward -- from your desktop to mobile is a great opportunity for the physical-based environment to take that mobile and
enhance, when they're walking the physical or adjacent or near the physical environment. So the fact that they've gone
mobile and move toward mobile, if we can bridge that to the physical world, I think it's got a lot of benefits for us.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: As an industry.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: As an industry, not just us. But we're going to be
pushing it hard.

And our next question will come from the line of Alex Goldfarb was Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Alex.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Just circling back to Capital for a minute, just to help us domestic folks here, can you give
a sense of what the British and the South African shareholders were saying? Were they more, because I think you
would talk to them, were they more NAV-focused or the equivalent rent, that mark-to-market focused? Or was it more
a sense of, if we sell this, we're not sure where we're going to reinvest the proceeds and therefore we'd rather just hang
onto capital rather than having to deal with try and reinvesting. What were the big...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, I think you've got to really – the UK shareholders were very similar to what I would
say the U.S. shareholders look, too. So there wasn't a great difference there, and we, again, our feedback from the UK
shareholders was that we were – they were disappointed that the company wouldn't give us due diligence to decide
whether or not we wanted to make a firm offer. And I think the UK shareholders have a very similar mindset to the
U.S. shareholders, and they viewed the Trafford deal in many respects as a change of control and they wanted to look at
their financial options.
The South African shareholders essentially started that way and – but they were also highly influenced that there is an
exemption that they get by owning Capital Shopping Centres. It's exempted from the limitation that they have in terms
of being able to make investments outside of South Africa, so there was some of that. On the other hand, some were
more clinical. Their mood ebbed and flowed, but clearly, having exposure outside of South Africa was important to a
number of them.

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You mean Indianapolis?
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Exactly. Well, we certainly have our fair share of snow here out east, but it sounds like
you guys got a doozy out there. As far as Canada, what are the – I mean, obviously, Kimco entered there a while back
and obviously, there's been another announcement more recently. What do you think the challenges of entering that
market are or why do you think we haven't seen more U.S. retail REITs head up there? Is it just the returns? Is it trying
to get land? Is it maybe something in the leasing environment that it's a little bit different than here? What are the
challenges for up there and what do you see?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well look, I think – I think frankly, a number of
retail REITs were just focused – the last couple of years have not been easy, right? So I think it's more that. I think the
Canadian market certainly has developed more – it's more of an interest to our U.S. based retailers than it used to be.
But it's not huge. I mean, they're not a number – there's not -- it's not pervasive, it's not every U.S. retailer's up there,
but it's growing and growing. And so I think it's just other priorities, Alex, primarily I think demand has improved.
And then ultimately, I would just say just from our perspective because we reviewed the market for -- on and off for a
number of years, finding the right site at the right value is not overly easy. And you want to go to, you want to start – if
you're going to do it, you want to start in Toronto, so to – essentially would be the best place to start. And it's just not a
lot of great sites at appropriate values to justify it, but it's -- long-term, I think it's a good market for potentially future
retail development, including outlets.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: So as far as returns though, would you underwrite Canada to be – is it the same returns as
the U.S.? Is it lower returns? Is it higher returns that you would want?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think land value there will be more
expensive than land value here in the cities that you'd want to build outlets in. And rents, we'll be able to offset that, so
you may end up with similar returns.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie. Please proceed.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Oh, thank you. So I just had a couple of questions regarding your leasing strategy. So in light of
sales, sales per square foot increasing towards $500, and in conjunction kind of low occupancy costs, how quickly –
can you give us a sense of how quickly can the occupancy costs go back to the historical levels? And when you're
sitting down with a tenant, and during leasing negotiations, do you typically find, or have in the mindset to find a rent
that is like 15% occupancy costs? Or do you actually embed any future growth in tenant sales?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Let me just answer the first question. Obviously, we would very much hope that they are
going to continue to move up. We have a very nice problem in that our sales are growing at 9.4% a year. Don't forget,
we only roll a certain percentage of space every year, so it takes some time to make up that ground when you have
good sales growth. In terms of our negotiation, every negotiation we have is driven by what's the quality of the mall?
What's the type of tenant use? And what is the quality of the space within that mall? And those three things drive how
we price our space and we are constantly trying to get the appropriate market rent.
When tenants complain to us that our rents are too high, we point out that we don't set the market, the tenants do. And
if you look at our occupancy, obviously, there are people that still believe they can take a lot of money at the rents
we're charging and we're going to constantly keep pushing that rent.

And the other point I want to make, because David emphasized this, all the capital we're spending in our portfolio
renovating properties, modernizing them, adding anchors, adding department stores, expanding them, are only making
our properties more valuable to the retailer, because they're increasing the total sales we have and the productivity of all
the other tenants. So not only do we get the returns that David talked about, but we get the incremental benefit of
having a much better shopping environment going forward as we go to release space rolling over there.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: And I've got a follow-up, so in your same-store leasing stats, you mentioned that the uptick in
leasing rents per square foot is $2.71 in the same space. What is that on a percentage term? And last question, is your
guidance for 2011 lowered by the impairment charges that you expect in Opry?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It is lowered. It's not impairment. It's basically,
we're – it's really were incurring interest expense with no income, okay? So we have no cash flow right now at Opry
Mills. So it's not an impairment charge. It's actually a negative cash flow drain until we rebuild it. I'm not sure how
much of the same – what percent of our leasing spread or our leasing data is just same-space. Is that what you're
asking?
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: I think in your opening comments you mentioned that the leasing spreads, it was positive $2.71 or
so? It's all sort of same-space. I was just wondering what that means in percentage terms?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Same-space is actually literally, this space – a lot
happens in malls where you, our spreads as we traditionally had done it is just ending versus new in totality. We tried to
narrow it down. I don't know if we have the exact percent of what same-space is, but we certainly can get that to you. I
don't have that in front of me.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: And I promise, last question, can you disclose what the tenant sales per square foot was in the
quarter – not, 2010? Or not – yeah, not, 2010?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it is in the – what the – it is...
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Not the average for the year, but for the quarter?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You mean the...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Quarter-over-quarter, the sequential growth in the fourth quarter, it was 9%.

And your next question comes in the line of David Harris with Gleacher & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - David Harris>: Hey, David, what else can I say but touché?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We want a retraction.
<Q - David Harris>: That's a high price to ask. $0.5 billion of development -- redevelopment is a pretty small beer on
a company with a $60 billion gross asset base. Any comment there as to where you're going in the next few years?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's what makes us unique is we still care
about $0.5 billion. So, look again, remember just take a step back having lived through '08, '09, and a good chunk of
'10, we just have geared up on this. And so to create the deals that we're actually going to be able to spend that money
when it takes some time to get that going, is not a small feat. And as Rick said, it is going to produce incremental NOI
growth. It's not insignificant.

So in the scheme of things, it may not seem like a big percent of our total asset base, but it is extremely cash flow
positive. Plus, all the other residual benefits of making a property better in the long run is very, very important. And I
would hope that with time, we could crank this up. But it's a very, very good, solid start to having essentially just
rejuvenated this program, in mid – really, in the fall, or – I'm sorry, in the early spring of '10. So it's a good start. What
the number is? I think it's going to be up to how creative we'll be, and I can't pinpoint it other than we've got a lot on the
drawing board that we're hopeful about, and I think we'll just see where it takes us.
<Q - David Harris>: Is it typically a 12 month lead in to this sort of stuff?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It does, especially if you're trying to secure anchor
involvement in it. And entitlements are not, they're not easy to get, even in today's environment.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. I've got a question for Rick. I looked at the TIs, Rick, and the 8-K and compared them to
where they were for the 12 months ending December '09. It looked like there was a pretty sharp increase. Is there
something going on in terms of the leasing or where we're at today, is that a fairly good run rate?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, we, frankly, the most important happy fact is that we've leased dramatically more
square footage, and as we are doing more and more deals, we're spending a little more and more allowance. But when
you look at that number, it is on a per square foot basis, pretty consistent.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah, David, this is Steve. The only thing I'd say that might tweak that a little bit, Rick and
David both alluded to it earlier, we're doing a ton of box activity, where over the last couple of years there had not been
as much. So that may influence it some, as well. But I think Rick's right. If you just think about the ordinary regular 7
to 10 year lease, the economics of that in terms of what the tenant allowance is hasn't really changed.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. And the box, just, Steve, is it higher or lower?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's probably lower on a per square foot basis, but
dollar amounts there, because they are bigger spaces, it's more money.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. And then...
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And if you look, I think Steve is 100% on. If you
look at probably '09 box activity to '10, you'll see the dramatic uptick.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. Final question for you, Steve, nice bond trade in '10, any chances of replicating that as we
look into '11 and the refinancing market?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, David, I would say this. I hope so, but if you recall, by virtue of the two tenders that
we did in '10, we significantly cleaned out our bond maturities in '11 and '12. And in fact, we've got under $400 million
a year coming in each of those two years. So we could be very opportunistic. We certainly are looking at the market.
We're paying attention to it, but the activity that we'll do in the bond market in 2011, if any, will be opportunistic.
<Q - David Harris>: Run a slide rule over converts at all?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't see it right now.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah. I confess, it may be the single largest file I have in my office, because of all the

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I can tell you that what we – we're going to
exceed our underwriting.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: And what was that?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Come on. These are tough questions.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Nate, we told it was a going in 8% cap.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're going to exceed our underwriting and I think
the re-merchandising success that we've had with our other outlets will take some time. But we would hope to get it on
our par with our other outlets. So we see that opportunity for sure.

<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Are you looking at 5%, 7%, 10% growth in '11 from that?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, certainly from our underwriting, we're above
5% and probably close to your other number.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay. Thanks. And then just looking back at the recent holiday season, a lot of talk was about the
strength coming out of the luxury and the higher-end retailers. Can you talk about how that's playing out in your
portfolio?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We've seen the same trends. Obviously, some of that was just a function of rebounding off
of depressed levels in '09, but clearly I just saw Estée Lauder reported yesterday and their better brands had better
performance than their more moderate brands. And I think you can see that across the landscape, that the better
consumer has come back stronger. And we're seeing that, as well, in our properties. The other thing that's really been
very apparent in our properties is that the centers that benefit from tourism are being incrementally benefited with
above portfolio sales growth because the tourist is back substantially, and that obviously, is also helping.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: All right. Thanks. And then just quickly when you talk about Canada, having reviewed it, I'm
sure you've been focused on it for a while, how many centers do you see the country being able to support in terms of
the quality of a Chelsea type of center?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The outlet – on the outlet side?
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's hard to say. I think, the -- Don Mills has been
successful, so I do – there, as an example. Obviously I think getting one or two built in kind of the major markets, there
are not many but if they're there, that's got -- an option. It's hard to say, but it's certainly more than a few. And it really
– a lot of that just depends on how the early couple go and whether they produce the results that they do.
Now the fact is, the Canadians, with the strong dollar, love to come to the U.S. to shop. And I do think that still is an
opportunity for them that may limit some of the potential growth, just because they do have that advantage, vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: All right, thanks.

And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Jim Sullivan>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Jim Sullivan>: I have two questions for you. First of all, on the same-store NOI outlook, when we looked back at
the prior cycle and I'm talking about a cyclical rebound in the economy post 2002, and it was pre the Premium
acquisition and the converging all the reporting data, but when we looked at the mall sector, on a multi-year basis, '02
to '07, same-store NOI growth averaged about 5% and sales productivity was fairly comparable over that period of
time, the sales productivity growth. I know there was a significant contribution from the growth of specialty leasing,
the RMU phenomenon, and – but looking at where you are now, historically if we think about the cyclical rebound in
the economy and retail sales, is there any secular reason why the growth rate would not match that kind of level going
forward?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the answer to that is yes. And it's
primarily because the shock to the system this time around has been dramatic and it's impacted the consumer probably

psyche more than the last downturn. And I think it's just going to take, it's going to be a very gradual ramp up. And the
employment side is probably more tenuous here, though the better income side with the difference here though, the
better income participant in the economy is more employed than maybe the last time around. But I just think the shock
to the system is a little bit – there's more uncertainty coming out of it, clearly, than there was last time. So I would be a
little more cautious.
I don't think there's anything fundamental in the supply and demand scenario or anything else out there that could keep
that from happening. But I just think the size of the economic dislocation here has been so great, and there's still a lot of
uncertainty. You've got state budget issues. You've got the municipal market. You've still got unemployment. You've
got inflation may or may not be here. So there's just a lot of noise here that I think may keep the recovery more muted
than it might otherwise be.
<Q - Jim Sullivan>: Okay, fair enough. And the second question, too, really revolves around the -- a lot of the
commentary about department stores and underutilization of department store pads. You addressed the one solution to
that, which is the spin-off lease-back alternative. Other people have talked about monetizing the square footage by
converting the use to something else. Now the question I have, and it really is I guess this is partly a legal question, but
with the presence of operating covenants and reciprocal easements, doesn't that mean that any monetization of those
pads that involves a conversion of use has to go through you guys?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Jim Sullivan>: Have you had any discussions with any of the department stores on some of those under-utilized
under-productive spaces?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: There look, the company that has been making certain efforts in that regard has been Sears,
where they've done a couple of areas where they've been able to do a partial use in part of their space. But again, as
David alluded to earlier, the single best, most profitable use for these boxes is as a performing department store in a
chain. If you put the multiple of EBITDA on stock price, it usually dwarfs the real estate value of that box for any other
use.
And I think that's why you've seen historically over time relatively few closures and why you see stores working now
that the environment is more stable, working to find new opportunities to build stores. And we are going to hopefully
have a number of announcements over the next six months of department stores being added to our properties because
they're looking to grow. And that's a very productive way to grow their top-line and their bottom-line.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, and I would just say, Jim, the biggest
discussion we have with them is what price we're willing to buy it and what price they want to sell it. They don't want
to be – very few of the – certainly the department stores want to ultimately be in the development business and that's
where most of their boxes, if they're connected to a mall, they end up being in the development business, and that's not
a core competency.
In many of those, most of those cases, they're selling it to us or some other developer. And the landscape frankly, is
littered with some bad deals where they sold and developers tried to buy it at certain prices and they didn't get the right
value. We have not had that experience. We've actually been pretty good at what we've bought and being able to
recapitalize on it.
<Q - Jim Sullivan>: Good. Okay. Thank you.

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Ben.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Morning.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: David, I have a question on the domestic outlet strategy. Clearly, the space is getting a bit
crowded and it's kind of interesting to see what's happening in the Houston submarket with you, Tanger and maybe
even Taubman competing to get an outlet center built there, and since we could see this happen going forward, can you
talk about how retailers evaluate the different opportunities that they have? Is it based on rents and location only or is
there anything else that might differentiate your site from say, Tanger's?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't want to speak for the retailers. But let's
assume, I think they – I'll say it very generically. They tend to go where they think the best site and/or development's
going to take place and I'll leave it at that.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: I mean, is it going to be similar to what we saw with the Lifestyle centers where they tend to
move as a group? And once you or Tanger has some of those key tenants, then it's pretty much a done deal on which
site basically wins that market? Is that your expectation?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, yes, I think you'll see some of that, Ben.
You'll also – sometimes sensitivity plays a role into it, certainly on the outlet side, with respect to where their
full-priced stores are located. So it's kind of location, development, and there's certainly part of that when you get the
momentum in a deal, the retailers see that and then they tend to go where they think the development is going to get
done. But a lot of it's the site.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. And just final question...
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But I will say this, I think – I don't think you'll see –
I think we're all very experienced developers. Houston, as a good example with Taubman and Tanger and us, were all
looking in a submarket. I think we're all very competent developers and my guess is whoever's successful, there's not
going to be two of these. They'll ultimately be one. And so I don't see it so much like the Lifestyle group where you had
a bunch built because there was so much money. I think the guys that are in this business understand they may win
some and lose some and go on to the next opportunity, as opposed to two going up at the same time. I don't see that
happening.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay, and then at what point do you guys potentially bail on a project? I mean, is a high single
digit returns still satisfactory for you guys, like a Galveston project? Or is that too low, given what you've gotten in the
past?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it would be too low for us from a
development point of view. I'd still – if we're not in the double-digits, we would not build.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: But fair to say that lower than like the mid-teens that you used to get just a few years ago?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you know, it might be lower. We tend to look
at most of our new stuff in phases, so the initial phase could be the low double digits and then ultimately the rebuild
phase, we're in the mid-range. I don't think that's changed that much, but there is more competition so it may have some
impact on that. But again, if we felt like we're building below low double digits, we would not build.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Michael Mueller>: Yeah, hi. Just a couple of quick ones here, on the six major redevelopments you're talking
about kicking off this year, what's a rough dollar cost of that?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think all together we're in the $500 million
range. Those will be, again, a lot of this is going to be spread over '11 and '12.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But if you were just to look at – we don't really just
-- I don't have those six right in front of me.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We can certainly give that to you, but overall, when
you look at everything, it's around $500 million, our share.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: And is that the spend or is that the total expected cost?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's just for spend this year.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And a couple of those clearly will have carryover in
'11. But we could get you those exact numbers.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay. That would be great.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And then obviously those will be in our 8-K when
they start construction.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Sure. Secondly on guidance, I may have missed it, did you mention what the occupancy
assumption was to get to your same-store guidance?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's pretty – we did not. We decided to be less
granular on our guidance this year than the last several years. You should not be worried about that. That doesn't mean
that we don't have obviously, all the confidence in the world of delivering that guidance, but we just felt like it was
more important to look at the totality of it than any one particular statistic. But I think in generally speaking,
occupancy's up marginally in our model.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Got it. Okay, and then last question, I'm sure this isn't in guidance, but are you expecting to
put capital to work in terms of acquisitions this year?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's not in our guidance.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Yeah, I'm sure it's not guidance, but is it the expectation that you're going to be able to find
some acquisitions this year?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You never know. I just would say you never know.
I'm sure there'll be opportunities, but we'll just see how the year transpires.

<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. David, I think about a year ago you talked about Lifestyle centers that you had
looked at probably about three dozen, and you couldn't find at the time any that were worthy of an investment. With the
environment having changed the way it has, do you think that any of those or any Lifestyle centers might turn out to be
a decent investment going forward?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. It's a good question. We continue to scour
that minefield of broken Lifestyle centers, and frankly, we still are having a hard time finding a couple of crown jewels,
not to say there might not be one or two, but, Rick – I mean, we just haven't seen it. We just haven't seen it. The
demand there, to go, you've got, Cedrik, most of those are the ones that we look at are all on co-tenancy, all have
kick-outs, and they all need lease-up, and they're just not performing. And some may be good long-term real estate, but
the demand frankly, for those kind of centers has not, as far as we can see, has really not picked up. Rick, you...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that's right, and if you – the ones we've looked at frankly, we've seen NOIs that are
in the offering brochures, and we underwrite it based on potential decreases to that NOI because of sales levels and
co-tenancy, we're coming up with fractions of the NOI, even in the offering book. Now maybe we're conservative, but
we've got so much we can do at better returns in our portfolio, it's very difficult to take a reach and try and buy
somebody else's problem.

maintenance of the status quo?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't -- nothing – nothing really that I'd seen. Rick,
what do you think?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Look, they're now actively leasing and they have direction, but candidly, last year and the
year before, they were trying to actively lease, as well. So we've competed with them for a very long time, and we'll be
competing with them going forward, and we intend to hopefully continue outperforming them.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're happy to help them, too, if they need any
help.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. I'm sure. Rick, if you look back over the last couple of years, now obviously we're in the
new chapter for General Growth. Is there any sense that you have that they really did get distracted and lost some
competitive status in the marketplace? Or did that -- is there something we kind of view from 30,000 feet and we
wonder about, and operationally it really didn't make much of a difference?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I couldn't really tell you that. Look, the last couple
of years we were all very focused on a lot of exterior forces. We're just focused on trying to grow our business and
really didn't spend a lot of time focusing on that.
<Q - David Harris>: Is it in the new concept area that you kind of more act as -- not only just for General Growth, but
also with the other big competitors in the space? Is it really on the new leasing side? It's not obviously on renewing
existing leases in established centers that you're really going head to head with them?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, actually, with General Growth we have very,
very little property overlap, and I think we mostly, frankly, compete with our peer group in the eyes of the analysts and
investors. The competition at the property level is overblown for any of us. We certainly – I mean, we're all trying to
get the fair share of retailers open to buys, but I'd say the biggest competition is frankly, in the eyes of investors, not so
much day-to-day warfare at the property level. Sure, there's some malls that we overlap with a few of our peer group,
but it's mostly at the corporate level, not so much on the retail, day-to-day level.

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Fenton with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Andrew Fenton>: Hey, I just had a global question for you. It's interesting, on Simon calls, it always seemed like
the questions lead to acquisitions, and in two – your two large cap global peers, both [inaudible] and Westfield, actually
shrank their balance sheets through two different transactions, in a view to increase their ROE. Have you ever thought
of doing something like that?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think there was some reference to it about
maybe we should spin this off or that off. We actually like what we've built here. We've had better growth, so I think
part of the response that you may be seeing is that the growth profile of those companies may be different than ours.
We haven't had that issue. And we're also primarily focused in the U.S., whereas certainly Westfield has a couple of
different footprints. So we don't – we think we're a different – we're in a little different boat than those are. I do think,
as we've said, we'll certainly look to sell assets over time if the market gets better, that don't fit our long-term view. But
beyond that, we don't see any real change or need to, given our growth profile.
<Q - Andrew Fenton>: I guess their pitch is you get some assets that eventually get mature and then you can get a
much better return on the stuff that you – that have some remaining redevelopment or potentially has NOI upside. Do

you have any part of your portfolio where you feel like Simon's worked it and the upside isn't as big?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, certainly with the vast portfolio we
have, we have a handful of centers like that. And like I said, I think if the market stabilized for those kind of centers
from a value point of view, it's conceivable that we could sell more assets than we have. We've actually over the years
been a very -- we've never been afraid to sell assets. So we've sold a couple of billion dollars, if not more, assets over
our period of time. So I think if the market gets better, we'd certainly look to do that. I don't think that, that necessarily
needs to take the form of some kind of corporate restructuring, but it's always good to prune your portfolio if you can.
