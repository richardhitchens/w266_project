question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by
Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Scott Leinenweber
Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the board and Chief
Executive Officer, and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our
website at abbott.com.
Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts
the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange as well as
current year and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's Vascular Closure businesses, which were
divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude's historic sales related
to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott's presentation.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning.
Today we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.62, which exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects
double-digit growth. Sales increased 3% on a comparable basis in the quarter, and we continue to expect accelerated
sales growth in the second half of the year. We started the year targeting double-digit EPS growth, and we're adding to
it today by raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.45 to $2.48, which represents 13%
growth over last year.
Halfway through the year, we're on track with all of our key priorities. The integration of St. Jude continues to go well,
and we're right on track with our deal model and projected synergy targets.
We're also right on track in terms of our new product launch expectations, which includes bringing our
MRI-compatible rhythm management devices to the U.S. During the first half of the year, we received FDA approval
for our MRI-compatible pacemaker, and we've completed regulatory submissions for our MRI-compatible defibrillator
devices, including submission of our CRT-D device in June.
We have also seen significant growth contributions from several recently launched products across our portfolio, which
I'll highlight as I summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian. I'll start with
Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by strong performance in core
laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. This business, which is already a global leader and growing faster than its
market, is in the early innings of significantly enhancing its competitive position with the launch of Alinity, a highly
differentiated and innovative suite of new systems across all areas where we compete.
During the quarter, we achieved CE Mark approval for Alinity hq, our new hematology system, which quantifies
different types of blood cells to help diagnose blood-related diseases. This represents the fifth new Alinity system
we've launched in Europe since November of last year, and we'll continue this launch cadence next year by bringing
these systems into the U.S. market.
In Nutrition, sales grew modestly in the quarter. Internationally, as you know, market conditions are expected to remain
challenging in China over the near term in advance of pending regulatory changes in that country.
Outside of China, we've seen some softening in a few international markets. While volume continues to grow at levels
consistent with historical trends, pricing power, which had previously contributed to overall market growth, has
moderated. As a result, we lowered our full-year Nutrition growth guidance earlier this year, and we now expect the
global nutrition market to grow in the low to mid-single digits over the longer term, which is still a healthy growth rate
for a market this size.
We remain focused on outperforming the market with our well-balanced portfolio of leading brands, which we are
achieving in U.S. pediatric nutrition, where sales grew 8% in the quarter, as we continue to capture share with recently
launched infant formula products as well strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in China, Russia, and
several markets in Latin America, including Brazil. During the quarter, sales were impacted by channel dynamics
associated with the implementation of a new goods and services tax system in India. Excluding this impact, EPD sales
would have grown high single digits overall, in line with our previous guidance.
This business is fulfilling the vision we had when we created it. There is no other business like it in the world. We're in
the right countries and the right therapeutic areas, and our unique model is driving consistent above-market
performance in the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.
In the Medical Devices, sales growth was led by continued double-digit growth in electrophysiology, neuromodulation,
and diabetes care, as well as high single-digit growth in structural heart. In neuromodulation, sales growth of nearly
50% further strengthened our leadership position in the fast-growing market for treating chronic pain through spinal
stimulation. Our strong growth in this market has been led by recently launched products that offer improved pain relief
and fewer side effects.
In structural heart, sales were led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the
minimally invasive repair of mitral regurgitation. In June, we completed patient enrollment in our trial to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of MitraClip in patients with functional mitral regurgitation. We expect the final results from
this trial around this time next year, which could result in a significant expansion of the U.S. market opportunity for
MitraClip.
In electrophysiology, which achieved another quarter of double-digit growth, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval
of our Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor during the second half of the year. And in heart failure, we continue to
anticipate U.S. approval of HeartMate III later this year.
I'll wrap up Medical Devices with diabetes care, where international sales growth of 25% was driven by FreeStyle
Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. During the quarter,
Libre achieved regulatory approval in Canada, and we've continued to achieve national reimbursement status in a
number of countries, most recently France and Switzerland. Today, roughly half of our Libre sales come from patients
with full or partial reimbursement.
And just last week, we announced an agreement with Bigfoot Biomedical to develop and commercialize diabetes
management systems. This collaboration will help bring these best-in-class technologies to more patients, with the goal
of transforming the way diabetes is managed.
So in summary, we're on track with all of our key priorities, including growth contributions from recently launched
products and the achievement of important regulatory milestones across our pipeline. The integration of St. Jude
continues to go very well, and we're on track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And we're raising our full-year
adjusted EPS guidance range, which continues to reflect double-digit growth.
I'll now turn the call to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?
Brian B. Yoor
Okay, thanks, Miles.
As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a
comparable basis, which is consistent with the guidance we previously provided.
Turning to our results, sales for the second quarter increased 2.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the transitory
impact of the new goods and service tax system implementation in India, which lowered our sales in our Established
Pharmaceuticals, total operational sales would have grown 3.7% in the quarter, which is in line with previous guidance.

Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on total sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2% in the quarter. As
you know, exchange headwinds have eased somewhat since the beginning of the year. I'd note that the majority of the
lower foreign exchange impact on our sales have been driven by strengthening of the euro and other developed market
currencies. And when these particular currencies move, the fall-through impact on our results is relatively modest,
taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.8% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment
was 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 30% of sales.
Before I review our financial outlook, I'd note that our sales and adjusted earnings per share forecasts do not include
any contribution associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2017,
subject to certain closing conditions. As previously communicated, we will provide an update regarding the expected
financial impact of this transaction at a later date.
So turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.43
to $2.53. We continue to forecast full year 2017 operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. And based on current
rates, exchange would have a negative impact of around 0.5% on our full-year reported sales, which is modestly lower
than the negative exchange impact of around 1% back at April rates. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of
somewhat above 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5%, and SG&A expense of
approximately 30% of sales.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.66. We forecast
operational sales growth in the mid-single digits, and at current rates, expect exchange would have a negative
year-over-year impact of around 0.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 59.5% of sales,
adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense around 29% of sales. Finally,
we project specified items of $0.35 in the third quarter, primarily reflecting intangible amortization and expenses
associated with the St. Jude acquisition.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter comparable operational
sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast double-digit sales growth. In Nutrition,
we forecast low single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits. And
finally, in Medical Devices, for cardiovascular and neuromodulation, we forecast sales to increase double digits across
our combined high-growth areas of electrophysiology, structural heart, heart failure, and neuromodulation, which will
be partially offset by sales in our foundational areas of rhythm management and vascular, which we forecast in
combination to be down low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. And in diabetes care, we forecast double-digit
sales growth.
With that, we will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you for taking the questions, maybe a couple quick ones to start with. First, the FX
delta since the start of the year, Brian, what does that mean to EPS? I know you moved your guidance a couple cents. Is
that the full impact of the EPS swing from FX, or is there a greater impact, are you giving yourself some more cushion?
And then second, Miles, can you spend a minute on the adult nutritional business? We focus so much time on pediatric,
but the U.S. adult business has been disappointing so far this year. I was hoping you could spend just a few minutes
talking about why that is, and what drives a turnaround? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, Brian, you want to talk FX first, and then?

<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Mike, I'd say that the [ph] Street (15:02) that we acknowledged in the first half, maybe $0.02 to
$0.03. And, could there be a little more? Yes, if rates continue to hold. It depends on the mix of currencies, but right
now, we're not factoring that in, because it's getting down to a level of precision that, for a penny or two, we're just not
ready to project that yet, as we don't want to necessarily forecast the mix of currency changes the rest of the year.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Then U.S. adult nutrition, I agree with you, Mike. We're disappointed too. And I'd say
what we're seeing here – first of all, I commented in my remarks that we're seeing softening markets worldwide here, at
least in a lot of markets. And as I've looked at a lot of the data, first, the volume rates are all still there. It's mostly loss
of pricing power in some of these markets, and we see the same phenomenon in both ped and adult nutrition.
In the U.S., it's a little different version than other markets. In the U.S., we're seeing a fair amount of intensity around
private label competition, and every few years this will happen. We've got a competitor in the U.S. in Nestlé that is also
feeling the same pinch, as we look at our market data. We know that the competition right now is private label, and
there's been changes in the way private label is being marketed, I guess, on the shelf and so forth, in terms of its
positioning, proximity to our brands, and so on. So we're seeing some of the impact of that.
It's something we're addressing. Every few years, we see private label crank up, and then it subsides again. Right now
we're having one of those years when we see a lot of intense pressure on that particular segment, and that's taken some
of the growth off that. Last year and the year before, both we and Nestlé invested in the category. And when any of us
invest in the category, all of us benefit. And as soon as that larger investment subsided, the private label cranked up and
went right back at it. So it's an ebb-and-flow thing, but it's definitely taken an edge off the growth that we've seen
historically. We're aware of it. We know it. We're taking the actions we think we can and should to mitigate it and deal
with it and try and correct it and so forth, but that's where the intensity of that is coming from.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay, and just one quick follow-up on Libre. You didn't give us much of an update on the
U.S. I know intra-quarter, Miles, and we had talked about this. You started a couple of trials to confirm the accuracy of
Libre to the FDA. Does that mean that approval is likely more like year-end or early next year? And do you have any
sense whether the FDA has gotten comfortable with the idea of a factory-calibrated device?
<A - Miles D. White>: There has been a lot of conversation back and forth with the FDA. We've explained to the FDA
how the factory calibration is done, and I think that conversation has gone well. I never want to predict the FDA. I
think we have what we consider to be a fairly proprietary process for this factory calibration, so it's not something we're
anxious to share widely, and it's unique. So I guess I'm not surprised that it needed further discussion, but I think that's
gone well.
I don't know that I can predict at all, Mike, when the FDA will come to a conclusion of its process. It was submitted
almost a year ago, so we're coming up on a date here, an annualized date. But I don't have any evidence that says gee,
it's going to be year-end or longer, so I don't know that I can – I certainly wouldn't say that because that may not be
true. So I don't have that kind of an indication. And I'd say look, there's good active ongoing dialogue back and forth.
That's always a good sign. It's the right kind of dialogue. I just wouldn't forecast it; I just don't know.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay, understood. I'll let some others jump in. thank you, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: You bet, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Thank you, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So the first thing I wanted to
explore was you mentioned in your opening remarks thinking about your MRI-safe device approvals in the U.S. as
being on track. And I was hoping you could talk about not the submission, but what's going on with Sylmar, any
progress you've made there, and confidence that you can get timely approvals just given what we've seen with the
warning letter.

<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, no problem. Thanks for the question, Matt. First of all, with regard to Sylmar, we're
making good progress, and I don't mean that just in a generalization. We had a very detailed plan that we shared with
the FDA of course after we received the warning letter. The good news is, as I mentioned in a previous call, we've been
in Sylmar with the St. Jude management since August of last year. And St. Jude was very open to us and allowed our
quality operations, GMP [Good Manufacturing Practice] people, and so forth in to participate with them. So we've been
working with them on a lot of issues, questions, processes, and so forth in Sylmar for a year now. And that is a huge
positive because it gave us a real running head start on things the FDA observed when it did its inspection earlier in the
year. So that gave us a big leap.
So we had the ability to put before the FDA a very comprehensive plan of corrective actions, remediations, et cetera, at
the site. And that plan is nearly complete. So we're coming up on – will it put all the things in place, change processes
and so forth that we needed to change? That's all positive. We'll be updating the FDA on that in the coming weeks. I
won't give you a specific date because I don't want to create a trigger here. But I'd say look, at this point, we're
absolutely on schedule with our own pace, and it will seem as if we did it rapidly. The fact is it will be about a year in
all by the time we're done here. But relative to the timing of the warning letter itself, it will seem like a rapid
turnaround, but there was quite a lot of work before that inspection that took place.
So we're getting to the completion of that comprehensive plan we put in front of the FDA, and we'll have dialogue with
them. I'm very optimistic about what we're doing with Sylmar. I'm very happy with the progress of our team there, so I
feel good about that. And as I said in the last call, I have no reason to change in a meaningful way the expectations
around a couple of key product licensures of products that come out of that facility.
And I know that there's a fair amount of question about will they be impacted or not? I think I'd have to say look, they
might be impacted by a couple of months, but in a meaningful way, I don't think so. And so I'm not willing to change
those launch dates for the purposes of projecting or modeling or anything yet because, to be honest, we don't know.
We've not had a conversation with the FDA specifically about that. I know that the review side in Medical Devices has
continued to review all of our products that are in for licensure on the same pace anyway, and I know what that pace is
and I know where the standing of those products is, and it's all very good. So at the end of the day, I think the agency's
reaction to the remediation actions and so forth will obviously influence it. It clearly has the ability to license those
products if it chooses to, and we'll wait and see.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great, thanks for the feedback on that. One other area I wanted to ask you about that's been
very active is in Diagnostics with the Alinity launches outside the U.S. I guess the core of my question is I was
wondering when you think we might start to see a pickup in OUS growth from those launches. I know it's kind of a
slow battleship that's turning here through your installed base. So when can we actually see some pickup, and how
much might that be?
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, let me just correct one thing that you might have inadvertently said. You said when will
we see the growth in the U.S. The U.S. won't start launching until next year, but they've in effect been licensed and
launched in Europe, so let me respond to Europe. Frankly, the question you're asking is the same one I keep prodding
our management with, and I do that just to keep their feet to the fire. The launch itself is going well, and customer
response has been very positive. We're taking what I would call it a fairly systematic and careful and methodical
approach because when you launch new systems, you don't want your customer to have to debug something in the
field. You want it to go to the field and work day one. And the history of launches of instruments in diagnostics in
general as an industry has not been that.
As you may know, I used to run that business years ago before I was the CEO of the company and was responsible for
R&D at one point. When we launch systems, you get so much data, so much use early on from your customers, more
than you could ever get in clinicals, that you tend to find all the little bugs you missed in development. And so when we
launch products or systems in Diagnostics, you've got a big installation, a big changeover from their current systems
and so forth, so it does take time. And because those early installations are where you do a little bit of your learning,
you want it to go well.

So I would say I'd give them that slack early on in the launch in terms of early, slow, methodical, careful, whatever.
And yet there's actually been really good order activity, really good uptake. We're on track I'd say with members of
closed accounts, instrument placements, et cetera. We're getting some pretty nice size closes. We're getting some pretty
– I'd say great reference accounts in all of this. So while it starts a little slow, I think we'll see that order rate pick up.
We'll see it in Europe. In 2018, we'll see clearly some impact there. A lot of our early installations will have heavy
cannibalization of existing systems and existing volume, but we're getting new accounts as well. And I like the mix of
what I'm seeing both in experienced Abbott customers and those where it's a competitive takeaway and so on.
So I think the launch is going well. I think it is going to be hard to see for a little bit here, at least in 2017. We're trying
to figure out how we show you investors the success of that launch and how it's going without giving away a lot of
competitive information to our competitors and so forth. That's a little bit of an issue, or at least a challenge
communication-wise. But I'd say that launch is going really well and I'm pleased with that. It's one of those things
where it's a slow-motion launch. It's not an instantaneous kaboom, but it's a rolling launch where you're going to see
rolling impact which picks up more and more momentum over the next couple of years, and you'll see that.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great, thanks for the color, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Frederick Allen Wise>: Good morning, Miles. Let me start with Alere, which seems to be marching toward
completion here, a couple things. We saw an asset sale announced. Is that it? Is there more to come? And maybe I
know it's early and I know you would like to be conservative. But can you just help frame in the most general sense? Is
it fair to assume that Alere is neutral this year to EPS? How do we think about it just directionally broadly in 2018? Is it
neutral? Is it accretive? Is it dilutive? Just any color would be really helpful. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, good. Thanks, Rick, for the question. I assumed somebody would ask that. A couple
things; first of all, there is one more asset sale that has not been made public. It was one that was required by the
regulatory bodies for antitrust purposes and so forth. And we've got a good buyer, a good price, et cetera. The other
party just hasn't said anything publicly, so we don't want to say it if they haven't said it. But yes, there is one more. It's
modest in size, but it's on track and I don't see any hiccups with it or anything. It just hasn't been made public, and I
expect that that will be soon, and that's progressing really well.
I'd say we're very happy with the status of divestitures for antitrust purposes, where that stands. We're happy with the
buyers. We're happy with the price. We're happy with the transition plans and so forth. That's all good. We are, in fact,
I'd say racing toward a close. I'm anxious to get it finished, and I'm quite confident that it will. At this point, I'd love to
have one of those surprises you didn't expect where all of a sudden, regulatory bodies approved it and you weren't
ready, but we're ready. And we've named our transition team internally here at Abbott and how we're going to manage
it, how we're going to integrate it, and so forth. Those plans are all very well underway, and so we're prepared for that
and ready to go.
With regard to this year, I have indicated and I would continue to indicate neutral. I wouldn't plan for any accretion. I
think because this particular deal has gone on so long, I'm reluctant to make projections about accretion, as we're into
the second half of the year. And if the deal doesn't close until September as is currently projected, that gives us all of
about three months with the business in our hands. And so at that point, I think look, I don't know that I could project
any accretion. I'd like to get the business on the path to integration as rapidly as possible in anticipation of rolling into
2018. And so what I'm communicating and the guys are communicating here is assume it's neutral, assume there's no
accretion in 2017, and the question then rolls to 2018.
And originally, I think we estimated – this is probably well more than a year ago now when we first announced the
acquisition of Alere, we had estimated I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.11 to $0.13, something like

that, of accretion for the first full year. At this point, I have no reason to change that, however, and no negatives that I
would tell you cause me pause. And I don't intend to be conservative for cuteness or sandbagging or anything else. But
I would say I want to get the business in our hands and evaluate that more directly than we've been able to over the last
year and a half.
So before I reconfirm, with any precision or any estimate, accretion for 2018, I want to have a few months with the
business in our hands so we can reconfirm for ourselves while managing the business, synergies, sales rates, all that
sort of stuff. Because when we gave that first estimate of accretion, we had not taken into account the divestiture of the
triage business or the pieces we had to divest for antitrust, and they had not, at that point, lost the Arriva business with
CMS in the U.S.
So I'd like to see, during the first few months when we have this business, what we've really got before I give any kind
of accretion estimate for 2018. I do expect that it will be accretive. I just don't know exactly where. I don't mean that to
be an indication of gee, it's likely to be less or whatever. I'm not even prepared to say that. I'd just like to be able to
evaluate it with it in our hands, because we are well beyond deal model in terms of timeframe for close here. So I think
we've got to have it in our hands so we can make those estimates more directly.
With regard to Arriva, we're looking at whether or not we can restore that, and at what level of restore that's standing
with CMS. That makes a difference in our estimates. There's a number of things that would make a difference in how
we evaluate the ongoing performance of the business and the timing of that. So we've got a few moving parts on Alere
before I can be – even give you a range of accretion. But I would tell you that I expect it to be accretive. And at this
point, I'm not prepared to change what we already put out there as an estimate a little over a year ago.
<Q - Frederick Allen Wise>: That's very helpful. And just on a separate topic, one of the compelling aspects of
combining St. Jude and Abbott on the device side does seem to be – or would obviously be the compellingly broad
portfolio. Can you talk, Miles, a little bit about the progress you've made on the contracting side dealing with large
hospitals, large integrated delivery networks, GPOs [Group Purchasing Organizations], et cetera, presenting the whole
bundle, just progress you've made broadly since post-merger? And do you see that contributing to growth in 2017 and
2018, that aspect of the story? Thank you very much.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, thank you. I'll tell you what; since we announced the acquisition a year ago, St. Jude had
already started to make changes in the way it approached large national account type organizations in the United States,
and we with them took that further. There were some promotions, management hires, new changes in the way we went
to market at St. Jude. We contemplated, call it, the full offering across our product lines. And I'd say we've made
terrific progress internally in our approach at St. Jude. We have had some success. We've had a lot of positive reaction
from customers in general, positive reaction to Abbott, positive reaction to the breadth of the product line, positive
reaction to St. Jude's pipeline and the products that are coming. So I'd say, all in all, I think all that's been really good.
I also would stress. A lot of times, when people refer to bundling with large national accounts, hospital groups and so
forth, there's a presumption of, one product line subsidizes another and there's leverage in that. And while that's true
and can be true, there's also a greater positive synergy of the full offering, the full-service level, and the service an
account gets across product lines. And as you know, these large integrated health groups, they don't want to deal
necessarily with five or six suppliers in a given area. They'll generally deal with two or three.
And we're finding that, in the mix and the breadth of our portfolio, one of the places that really benefits us and St. Jude
is that it's very easy for us to be one of the two. And it's a lot easier when you've got the broad product line, when
you've got innovation with those product lines, when you've got a good compelling medical and value proposition, and
it's not always about just subsidizing.
And so, I find that with the mix – and this is one of the strategic reasons we wanted this acquisition – I find that the
breadth of that product line, the innovation across the product line, the depth of products, that full offering makes us
extremely competitive. And I think, both from a medical and a value proposition standpoint. So we definitely see that. I
think we will see that increasingly over the course of 2017, 2018, and beyond. I think, if you just look at the dynamics
in the Medical Device business at large, the consolidation that's taken place across a lot of product lines has been well

documented and talked about for several years. I think this puts us in a really strong position in the field.
Now, as we look at our product line, of course we and other competitors think there's holes. Well, we need this product
or we need that product, but I'd say small holes that all of us, one way or another, are always looking to fill, either
through our own R&D or other M&A activity. But I feel like we're very, very competitive in all regards now, and that's
a good positive.
<Q - Frederick Allen Wise>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. My first question is on the cardio and neuromodulation line. It
came in better than expected, and I've got to believe that's a function of St. Jude. So, Miles, can you comment on how
St. Jude performed in the quarter? What was the growth rate that the St. Jude business in total delivered in the second
quarter? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, Glenn. Thanks. St. Jude, if we carved them out as standalone, was up about 4%. And if
you recall, before we acquired St. Jude or before we announced the deal, its prior four years had been flat. And we
discussed how we thought over that period of time they'd made great investments in their product pipeline across their
businesses. Their internal organic R&D I thought had been very productive and very successful; so had they. And it
was a point of quite a bit of let's call it negotiation during the deal process. They had rather robust forecasts for their
sales going forward, and of course that ultimately is part of the whole negotiation.
I would say this. Their representation about their pipeline I thought was valid and proves to be. And as I've said before
both in the calls we've made about the deal itself or in our quarterly earnings calls, our forecast, our deal model was
built on the expectation of sequential improvement in their sales going forward due to, first of all, correcting the
MRI-compatible issue, which is well underway, and then the launch of a lot of new products, and we're seeing that.
And then frankly in our own deal model, we had pretty much aligned it with what analysts collectively viewed as how
St. Jude would look going forward. And so far, the expansion of the growth rate and its sequential performance quarter
to quarter has been on our deal model and is steadily growing. And we estimated in our deal model they'd get up to
4.5% – 5%, something like that. And this quarter they were at 4%, and each quarter is successively better than the last.
We're seeing improvement in CRM and we're seeing share recovery with the low-voltage pacemaker.
As I mentioned, I guess it was at the end of the first quarter, St. Jude we estimated lost about – I think it was 7 points of
share in the low-voltage pacemaker business last year between April and December. And in the first two months or
three months here of launch with the MRI-compatible claim, they've regained four of those share points already.
So we're seeing quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement in share in CRM. You can see it in the growth rate comps.
It's getting better and better quarter to quarter. We expect that to continue. New product launches are occurring
according to expectation. I think the whole thing is remarkably going according to our deal model, according to our
forecast, and according to what we told analysts. And right now, I think a quarter at 4% out of St. Jude is a pretty good
thing.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Yes, I agree. And then just I don't know if you or Brian have these numbers. But just as a
follow-up, would you be able to give us your U.S. and worldwide pacing growth and U.S. and worldwide ICD and
CRT growth? Thanks.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: I don't think I can do that right this minute. You prepare a lot of things for these calls, but that's
one thing I don't have at my fingertips.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about how to
think about Q3 given some of the one-time items in Q2, and then I have one product-related question.
So I think it was 2.9% growth in Q2 on a comparable pro forma basis, but I think you had an 80 basis point hit from –
headwind from EPD, and I think you had about a 50 basis point hit in vascular from the royalty. So is a starting point
really about 4.2%, 2.9% plus 1.3%? And do we get back the 80 bps or about the $50 million lost in EPD from the
general services tax Q3? And I had one follow-up.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yes, I'd say a couple things. First of all, what you described there are the ins and outs going into
the third quarter. You're right and that's a good assessment. Your assessment of – I think it was a little better than 4%, I
think that's a good assessment too.
With regard to EPD, this goods and services tax in India, as I think others have already noted, clearly impacted the
second quarter. I think it's been hard for everybody to forecast how it's going to come back in the third quarter. In the
first couple of days of the quarter, we saw clear response to restocking by distributors, and then it softened for a couple
of days, and then it came back again for a couple of days. So we're seeing it restore. Whether we'll see it completely
restore in the quarter, I don't know, but so far so good. It's going according to what we projected. Whether it will come
back full dollar per dollar, I don't know, but so far it looks that way. And I'd say so far, projections look good that way
to truly be a quarter-to-quarter shift, and that's kind of the experience we're seeing thus far.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. And then, Miles, XIENCE has been an amazing product. But given
the issues with Absorb, do you feel – what is the pipeline, the long-term strategy there? Do you feel you need a
drug-eluting stent with a bio-absorbable polymer similar to Boston Scientific's SYNERGY, which seems to have been
successful? Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thanks for the question. I'll tell you what; Absorb has become very much a niche product,
that's for sure. I would have wished for it to be a lot bigger than that, but XIENCE remains best-in-class stent. That's
still true. Do we need a bio-absorbable coated stent? I'll tell you, I think the bigger issue is I think we need an even
more deliverable stent. The issue right now with physicians is deliverability, and I think that's been one of the
hallmarks of Boston's SYNERGY stent is the deliverability. So I think the issue is more the deliverability than the
coating, and we'll launch early next year SIERRA, the next generation of XIENCE, which will address that. So that's
what I think is our single most important focus right now.
Do I think long term that there are still improvements and performance improvements and so forth to make in stents,
whether it's coating or material or deliverability, et cetera? I do. I'm not going to detail what that plan is from our
standpoint, but our next focus in stents is primarily that deliverability with SIERRA.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes.

<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Thanks very much, Bob Hopkins here, I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question. So I'll
start with a product question. I just want to be clear on MRI, the outlook for MRI, say for ICDs. What is the latest
official guidance on when you expect that to come to market? And do you have a sense for whether you'll need the
warning letter to be lifted to get that through?
<A - Miles D. White>: The warning letter doesn't have to be lifted. The FDA has the ability, if it chooses to, to license
it if they're satisfied with remediation actions and so forth. They always have that ability. So it's not dependent on a
particular formal lifting of warning letter. At the same time, the FDA always has the right to decide what it wants to do.
And I'd say with regards to expectations at this point, we've said second half or year end, and I think that's probably, for
right now at least as modeling and planning purposes go, probably a fine assumption. I can't be more specific than that
because I can't read their minds and don't want to forecast them and put them in a tough spot. So I'd say as far as
modeling goes, model second half somewhere and year end, but I don't know that I can give you anything more precise
than that.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Okay, no, that's helpful. That's 2017, obviously, right?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: And then one other, Miles, bigger picture question on the outlook for revenue growth for
Abbott. Because when you look through your results here this quarter, one thing you notice is that if you look at your
different businesses, there's a very wide range of growth rates, with some businesses like neuromod just doing
extremely well and others struggling a little bit. As we think about 2018, there are some strong incremental drivers of
growth and there are some things like neuromod that will probably slow a little bit. So when we net all that out, do you
think as we look forward into next year that you can again start to talk about Abbott again as something better than a
mid-single-digit revenue growth company?
<A - Miles D. White>: I think that depends on a whole lot of things, including the businesses. I think it depends on
what's happening with global markets, et cetera. That's always our goal. In our goal, we always start every year with the
notion that we're going to grow profits double digits. And to do that, you've got to have fundamental revenue growth, as
you know.
And as we look at the mix of the business, I think the observation you make is correct. I'd love it if everything grew
like neuromod, but it doesn't. there are some of these businesses that I'd say are much more mature, like CRM, and
even the stent business, much more mature. The good news about those businesses is they're extremely profitable and
they generate high cash flow. So in the mix of our portfolio, that's positive. That's a good thing. On the other hand, if
you're maintaining a growth profile, you've got to have a lean toward growth in the mix. And we've got a pretty good
lean toward growth I'd say of late. The one that's got my attention from a longer-term perspective is Nutrition,
particularly internationally. And what I've seen there is a slowing.
Now I think that business longer term or at least on a stable basis for now looks like it's going to be a low to
mid-single-digit business, call that 3% to 5%, something like that, 3% to 5%, but that's a mix. There are some countries
that are 1% or 2%. There are some countries and geographies that are double digits. The global volume growth in that
business for infant formula, for example, tends to be 3% to 3.5%, and the biggest change in the growth has been price.
Not that the price has come down, it just isn't going to go up much. And I think that that's perhaps indicative of some
maturing in some of those markets. We're looking at that pretty closely right now.
So as I forecast it, interestingly enough, it's also very profitable, and a high cash generator. And as I've talked about
Nutrition in the past in the mix of Abbott Laboratories, it's been one of the biggest cash generators in the company for a
long time. I used to refer to it as the bank, as it funded a lot of M&A. So it's a very healthy business that way.
I think our questions right now are assessing the shift of market tone. China, for example, is actually much more stable
than the last 12 to 18 months. I like what I'm seeing in China right now. We still have the government regulation
kicking in, and it's impacted competitors. There's a lot of reaction to the shrinkage of the number of SKUs in the market
and so forth, and we've talked about that. But as far as what we're seeing in 2017 here, we're performing according to

our expectations. I think the comps obviously get better here in the second half. We'll see.
So as I look forward, yes, it is our goal to be a healthy grower, to be able to generate that double-digit bottom line
growth. I think that we've got to continually look at the mix, as you suggest, how many growers we've got. As you
observed, the growth rate of something like neuromod will come down simply because it gets bigger in the base, but its
actual raw dollar growth, I don't see changing for quite a while. So I think that's a plus, and I think we're seeing
improved growth in other areas.
So, I know there's a lot of ins and outs there. But, at the end of the day, we're always looking to build our company,
grow the company, expand the company, gain market share for the company. And the acquisitions of St. Jude and
Alere were part of building that core leadership base in the businesses that we're in to continue to drive that growth, and
the goal hasn't changed.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Thanks very much for the response. I appreciate it.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: We'll take one more question, operator.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Brian, just a couple quick ones for you, and then one strategic one for
Miles. So just a couple incremental financial questions. The incremental change to gross margin in the guide, the 50
basis points, what was driving that? And then, as you just think about the pacing in the back half of the year, obviously
you're guiding to improvement in the third quarter. Is the right way to think about it the back half is going to be
mid-single digits and obviously better than the first half, or do you think the business gets a little better in the fourth
quarter, from an organic growth perspective, than the third? And just a quick one for Miles after that.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: I think, to your last question, you will see sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. There's a lot
of items that Miles talked about in the acceleration, including new products and just the momentum of our business, so
I think that's a fair assessment.
With respect to the question on gross margin, our operational improvements in gross margin underlying continue to be
there, that we've talked about before. You do get a little noise around the mix of FX and what that does, and that's just
simply math there. Nothing has changed about our aspirations to continue to expand our gross margins on an
underlying basis, probably 50 to 75 basis points on that, David.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay, thank you. Then, Miles, just thinking about the strategic importance of the Bigfoot
announcement, I don't want to make too much of a single announcement. But is this just a natural extension of building
the brand and the reach of Libre and CGMS, or does it suggest an interest in pumping? Or maybe, said another way, do
you think to win in diabetes going forward, you need to have an integrated pump and sensor under one roof? Thanks so
much.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, thanks. No, I'll tell you, in the grand scheme of things with diabetes care, I don't think
we need to have a pump. But I think there's a strategic – what would I call it – change happening, or that will happen
over the next couple of years in the market, particularly for Type 1 diabetics and for multiple daily injectors, which
could be Type 2s that are insulin-dependent.
And what's interesting about Bigfoot is, they're taking a different approach to the ease and the integration of what those
multiple daily injectors have as solutions to manage their disease, separate from pumping. And it's a fairly clever
service and approach that I think will create, not just an alternative that makes the management of the disease, or
management of someone's insulin easier, but I think the value proposition of it is going to be pretty compelling. And I
think that will change the competitive dynamics in that realm that is pumping.

The penetration of pumps or pumping relative to the market size of multiple daily injectors is really quite small. You'd
say wow, there's a lot of potential for further penetration. The question is the value proposition. A lot of times, the
reason it hasn't penetrated further is, it might be too costly, or viewed that way.
And I think what Bigfoot is doing, if I could comment on it from a distance, because I've never had a conversation with
them myself, is, they've come up with a pretty unique value proposition that not only is good from the standpoint of the
patient or even the payer, but also, just in general in the cost of managing the disease for a diabetic. I think it's a pretty
interesting use of technology to make it simpler, easier, and affordable.
I probably sound like a brochure for them, but I just think that their approach is interesting. And in our case, the
technology that is Libre is a component of that and a fairly compelling piece of it that expands the use of Libre beyond
what Libre can even do today. And then beyond that, there are other expansions and improvements to Libre that aren't
just in that segment. But I think that the sensor technology and the nature of the way Libre works has a lot of
applications beyond how it's used today, and the Bigfoot approach is just one of those. And I think it's a pretty unique,
compelling idea that puts Libre as a part of the competition in that pumping or multiple daily injector world that is a
great opportunity for us, and I think it further enhances the management of the disease for patients.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Great. Thanks, Miles.
