Thomas Patrick Joyce
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a good start in 2017. During the first quarter, our two most
recent larger acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, performed very well. We drove share gains in a number of our operating
companies and achieved high-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We also continued to reinvest in our
businesses is to enhance our long-term growth trajectory. And we feel well positioned to benefit from compelling
market drivers across the portfolio.
Today, you will hear a number of examples of how our focus on innovation and key commercial initiatives enable us to
provide customers with new technologies and solutions that they need to improve critical processes. By prioritizing this
targeted reinvestment, we believe that we can strengthen our competitive advantage and better position our portfolio for
sustainable long-term outperformance.
Turning to our first quarter results, sales increased 7% to $4.2 billion, and core revenue grew 2.5%. The impact of
currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 6%. Geographically,
revenue in the developed markets was up low-single digits. High-growth markets grew at a mid-single-digit rate led by
continued strength in China and India. Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from
last year.
Our core operating margin declined 15 basis points, and reported operating margin declined 80 basis points to 14.8%.
These declines were primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions, incremental growth investments, and the impact
of foreign exchange rates. In terms of M&A, we announced two acquisitions for nearly $100 million, both of which are
subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.
As we move through the year, we will continue to focus primarily on small and midsize acquisitions. First quarter
adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.85, which represents an increase of 8% over last year.
Now, let's take a more detailed look at our performance across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up
4% and core revenue grew 3%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.2% and core operating margin
increased 165 basis points. This strong margin improvement was broad based across the platform, including Pall, and is
reflective of the team executing well using DBS. At Beckman Life Sciences, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit
rate.
Ongoing strength in our flow cytometry and particle counting businesses was modestly offset by declines in
centrifugation. Developed markets were slightly softer mainly due to the timing of certain projects, while strong
momentum continued in China where local investment in research and biopharma drove another quarter of sustained
growth in the region. Beckman reinforced its commitment to innovation during the quarter with the launch of the
Biomek i-Series automated workstations. This new automated liquid-handling platform provides consistent sample
preparation with greater efficiency, adaptability, and reliability. The Biomek i-Series launch is the culmination of a
focused R&D process which included obtaining extensive voice of the customer and during which the team worked
with end-users around the world to identify vital features for a new platform.

One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen. And by better understanding our customers,
Beckman was able to deliver market-driven innovation and ensure that new products like the Biomek i-Series will
provide critical solutions for scientists' evolving needs. Core revenue at SCIEX was up low-single digits, driven by
growth in Western Europe and China. We saw a good demand in the pharmaceutical end market across all major
geographies, with particular strength in China where heightened regulations around generic drug production are
generating greater demand for testing.
Leica Microsystems delivered high-single-digit revenue growth, as all major regions and product lines showed positive
performance. North America and Western Europe were driven by several key project wins, particularly in our confocal
and surgical businesses.
Pall's core revenue grew low-single digits with mid-single-digit growth at Pall Life Sciences led by gains across our
biopharmaceutical business, particularly in single-use technologies. Pall Industrial's core revenue was down slightly
versus a tough prior-year comparison. This was largely the result of a sizable project in the Middle East in the first half
of 2016. Our microelectronics and aerospace businesses continued to perform very well, and we saw signs of
stabilization across a number of our industrial and process end markets. We were also encouraged by strong bookings
throughout the quarter.
We're well positioned in our biopharma business and expect that we will continue to benefit from the long-term trends
in this end market, including the shift from small to large molecule drugs and the increasing proliferation of single-use
technologies across biopharma production processes. A great example of Pall's leadership in this space was on display
at the INTERPHEX Biomanufacturing Trade Show in March where we featured a number of recent innovations like
the BioSMB continuous chromatography system and the Cadence Acoustic Separator, which are helping customers
improve the efficiency of their bioproduction workflows.
Turning now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 17% and core revenue increased 2.5%. Reported operating
margins declined to 11.6% in part due to recent acquisitions. Core operating margins decreased 240 basis points and
were negatively impacted by the strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies
along with incremental growth investments in R&D, service, and commercial initiatives.
Radiometer's core revenue grew high-single digits with positive results across all major geographies. Our blood gas and
AQT product lines continued to perform well, and double-digit instrument sales helped to expand Radiometer's
installed base and drive strong recurring revenue growth.
At Leica Biosystems, core revenue increased at a low-single-digit rate led by growth in the developed markets and
China. Advanced staining performed very well across both instruments and consumables while our core histology and
tissue acquisition product lines declined.
Core revenue at Beckman Coulter was up low-single digits with strength in high-growth markets partially offset by
weakness in Western Europe and North America. Our business in China delivered another strong quarter as meaningful
installed base expansion in the region contributed to healthy recurring revenue growth.
Cepheid is off to a great start and achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Through the thoughtful
application of DBS, the team has implemented numerous process improvements to increase productivity since the
acquisition. These initiatives have already generated meaningful operating margin expansion, and we are very
encouraged by this early progress. Cepheid also received FDA clearance for its Xpert Xpress Flu and RSV respiratory
virus tests in March. Both of these tests deliver molecular results in as little as 20 minutes, twice as fast as their
predecessors and with comparable accuracy. The first 24 hours of flu and RSV symptom onset is a critical window, and
the Xpress test's faster turnaround time enables clinicians to access reliable diagnoses and targeted therapies for their
patients that much more quickly.
Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported and core revenue growth was roughly flat in the first quarter. Core
operating margin declined 85 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 13.6%. This margin decline was
largely driven by weakness in our higher-margin traditional consumables business. Solid demand continued for our

specialty product lines including orthodontics and implants. And we saw positive growth in our equipment business.
We anticipate the weakness across our traditional consumables business will persist in the near term, leading to similar
growth rates in Q2 as we saw in Q1 for the overall dental platform.
In the meantime, we will remain focused on enhancing our dental portfolio's foundation for long-term growth. Recent
cost structure improvements have facilitated reinvestment in the business to drive growth through commercial
initiatives and through innovation. At the International Dental Show in March, we featured more than 10 new products
from across our dental platform, including the SMARTmatic handpiece and the KaVo OP 3D Pro panoramic X-ray
imaging system. We also featured DTX-Studio, a single digital software platform that connects a dental office across
its entire workflow from diagnosis to design and patient treatment. These innovative technologies enable an entire
dental team to work more effectively, and most importantly, support better treatment outcomes for patients.
Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Both reported/core revenue were up 4.5%. Reported
margins were 22.7% with core operating margins up 60 basis points due to broad-based DBS execution across the
segment.
In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate driven by positive momentum in our marking and
coding equipment and related consumables businesses across all major geographies. We also saw increased demand for
our packaging and color solutions products.
In March, we announced the acquisition of Advanced Vision Technology, or AVT, a leader in automatic print
inspection, process control, and quality assurance with over 7,000 systems installed at customer sites worldwide.
AVT's in-line print inspection systems are used by the world's top packaging and label converters to improve product
quality and operational efficiency, and the business is highly complementary to X-Rite's color inspection capabilities
and Esko's packaging workflow. We believe that this combination of solutions will enable us to better serve our
customers by simplifying their management of complex packaging value chains. And we look forward to welcoming
the AVT team to Danaher.
Videojet continued to outperform in the quarter, delivering mid-single-digit core revenue growth as the business grew
across all product lines and most major geographies. Videojet's service offering delivered another great quarter, and the
team's focus on life cycle service initiatives continues to enhance customers' experience with greater productivity and
more uptime to help reduce their operating costs.
The application of DBS to Videojet's equipment sales and service approach continues to drive higher service contract
attachment rates at both existing and new accounts. Core revenue at both Esko and X-Rite was up low-single digits.
And a number of new products we introduced at the drupa trade show last summer have gained good traction in the
market.
Finally, turning to water quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate. Throughout
the first quarter, we were encouraged by the improved momentum across our more industrial-oriented businesses, and
we believe that we continued to gain share relative to the market across the entire platform.
At Hach, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was supported by growth in North America and Western Europe of
improving order trends that we started to see through the end of last year. In the high-growth markets, China performed
well while Latin America and the Middle East declined. Solid growth across most of Hach's major product lines was
led by instrument sales as we expanded our installed base. For decades, Hach has pioneered in advanced chlorine
analysis for municipal and industrial water treatment. The team continued to build on a long tradition of innovation and
new product development with the recent announcement of the CM130 Chlorine Monitoring System, the
first-of-its-kind cleared by the FDA for use in the medical field.
The CM130 automatically tests chlorine levels at dialysis centers every 5 to 20 minutes, providing frequent analysis
and immediate notification of high chlorine events via remote indicators in the patient treatment area. It was developed
in collaboration with one of the leading dialysis providers in the U.S. and is a tremendous example of how Hach
partners with customers to deliver connected instruments that provide actionable insights and decision support.

In our water treatment businesses, both Trojan and ChemTreat achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the
quarter. Growth at Trojan was driven by key project wins in Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America. And
ChemTreat's growth was led by gains in both North and Latin America, which were largely driven by incremental
improvements in the oil and gas sector.
So, to wrap up, this was a good start to the year. Pall and Cepheid both performed well. We drove share gains at a
number of our operating companies. And we continued to reinvest in our businesses in order to enhance our portfolio's
growth trajectory. There are compelling secular market drivers across each of our five platforms, and we feel very well
positioned to take advantage of these going forward. At the same time, we see tremendous opportunities to enhance our
growth and margin profile through focused execution across the portfolio. And with the Danaher Business System
continuing to serve as our foundation, we believe that we will be able to deliver long-term outperformance for
shareholders.
We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.95 and $0.98 which assumes second
quarter core revenue growth comparable to the first quarter of 2017. We continue to expect full-year 2017 adjusted
diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95.

Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracy, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Maybe I'm a little dense, but can you help walk through the diagnostic core margin delta? So,
it's down 240 basis points, and you said some of that is currency. Can you help us understand how much of that is
currency?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Well, we know you're not dense. So, let's start with that.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I might be. Haven't had my coffee yet [indiscernible] (21:03).
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: And it's early. Scott, starting with the FX impact, which is in the neighborhood of 100
basis points of impact year-on-year, really has virtually everything to do with the year-on-year strengthening of both
the U.S. dollar and the yen, especially the yen through the first quarter. If you think about our diagnostic business, we
manufacture a great deal of our product in the U.S. and in Japan, particularly at Beckman Diagnostics.
But with revenue spread as globally as it is, the high cost impact of the impact of that currency, given the strengthening
of both those currencies, had an impact on that ratio between where our cost structure is from a manufacturing
standpoint and where those revenues are ultimately translated. So, that's the core of the FX impact. In addition to that,
obviously growth was a little softer, that largely came through in March, somewhat at Beck Dx in North America
certainly and a little bit of Leica Biosystems in the high-growth markets.
So, the slightly lighter core growth in a business that has a high level of recurring revenue certainly had an impact, and
we're probably talking about in the neighborhood of 75 basis points of impact there. And then, we did have a little bit
of a mix impact at Beck Dx with a couple of larger automation-related deals shipped in the first quarter and when we
have a high level of automation equipment associated with both those projects that tends to be a little bit of a margin

headwind. That's ultimately, over time, good news for us. When we sell automation with the equipment, that
automation gets bolted to the floor and that becomes an outstanding long-term account situation because obviously it's
a very sticky situation when you have that much equipment wired to an automation line running high volume recurring
revenue. So, those are the major components there, Scott. Hopefully that's helpful.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah. No. It is. Sounds like some timing issues there. So, okay, I probably asked this question
multiple quarters, but on dental, you get a sense of whether there was inventory destock at the distributor level or
whether the end markets just soft there or is there any price pressure there? I mean, how do you – just trying to
reconcile flat revenues and down margins when you've been taking costs out of the business.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah. Well, we – you have a little bit of both the major factors that you pointed to at
the outset there. Definitely, you have some softness in the end market. That phenomena began in the latter part of
certainly second half of last year, and we think it continued here in the first quarter. But when you have that
phenomena, obviously the channel becomes that much more concerned about inventory levels and is going to try to
bring down inventory levels commensurate with how they think that end market as a sell-through is happening. So, you
have a combination of both those factors that to some extent, from a manufacture perspective, compounds themselves
somewhat.
The phenomenon is generally oriented towards the North American market, a little bit in Europe, but more North
American in terms of its impact. And it's primarily around the traditional consumables market. And so, when you have
that impact, obviously on the consumables end of our portfolio, that's where a significant impact comes through on the
margin side.
Now, on the good news side, if you look at the parts of the portfolio, and it's a good deal of the portfolio that is not in
the traditional consumables end of the product lines and does not go through distribution, those product lines generally
perform very well. Ormco, our orthodontic business, continued to perform well. Implants in Nobel that – both those go
direct, were both low-single-digit, mid-single-digit quarter performances. Equipment was up low-single digits broadly.
So, I think there's some positive things there, but they were outweighed by that impact of the traditional consumables
business, and obviously, the commensurate impact on the margins.
We feel very good to your point about the cost that we have taken out in the business. You saw a very good margin
improvement throughout the course of the last 12 to 18 months. We continue to take costs out of the portfolio. But at
the same time, you've heard us talk about the Danaher playbook, we are continuing to invest in that business. We
believe that the long-term growth drivers are there. And so, I think it's important that we continue to focus on ensuring
that we are well positioned commercially across a number of geographies and that we're continuing to invest in
innovation. So, it's a tough balancing act, but we believe it's right for the long term.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Thank you, guys, and good luck to you. Thank you.

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Good morning, Ross.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Hey, Ross.
<Q - Ross Muken>: So, I just wanted to talk first maybe a bit about Cepheid. It looked like when I teased out, the
number was quite a very strong start to the year for them relative to what we were expecting at least. As you look at
sort of the pipeline there and your channel opportunities and you start to understand what's some of the new products,
the momentum of that business could have. Obviously, you've talked about 10% plus, seems like there was much more

of that in Q1. I guess, how are you thinking about the variety of drivers? And then, what drove some of that
outperformance or what appears to be in this quarter?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Thanks, Ross. Yes, we did have a very good quarter at Cepheid. We're extremely
pleased with how that business has performed and how the team has come together and adapted to the Danaher
environment, it has utilized the tools of the Danaher Business System to drive improvements, not only in terms of the
way they're driving business commercially, but I think importantly, the way they are taking cost out of various areas of
the business and redeploying some of those savings back into investments for growth. And we're starting to see the
impact of that, obviously, across the top line where we talked about double-digit growth and meaningful margin
improvements as well. Now, margin improvements that are in the double-digit range for sure.
So, in terms of what's driving that growth, it's pretty broad across the portfolio. Infectious disease, sexual health
continue to perform quite well. Hospital-acquired infections, while growing a little bit more modestly than the rest of
the portfolio, we think are in a very sustainable position over time. And we're very encouraged by the investments that
are being made around advancing the menu and as well as the new instruments that come out. So, I think the business is
off to a great start. We've seen some good performance, and we very much expect that to continue.
<Q - Ross Muken>: And maybe just a follow-up on China. Seems like that market continues to be white-hot and sort
of the demand is greater than many were sort of estimating 3, 6, 12 months ago. I mean, how do you think about the
duration? There's so many moving parts at the macro level there. I mean some of the underlying drivers in the health
care businesses seem pretty secular. But on the cyclical side, how are you thinking about how much longer that market
can kind of continue to accelerate and then maybe remain elevated?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: We feel very good about how we're positioned in China, Ross, across really each of the
five platforms. Our diagnostic platform continues to perform very well and we continued to invest there. We see that
growth coming through really across the board, Beckman Diagnostics, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems. And now, as
we're investing more aggressively in Cepheid in the high-growth markets, China will become an increasingly important
part of Cepheid's geographic profile. As you know, they've been underpenetrated in a number of those markets.
Our dental business, Ross, continues to drive consistent double-digit growth each quarter and has for quite a period of
time. We think the underlying drivers in the dental market as well as our outstanding execution and the breadth of
portfolio speak well to the long-term potential in dental. Life science investments continue to be a priority for the
Chinese government. While those can sometimes shift occasionally between end markets, for example, from the food
market to maybe primarily basic research, in general I think the underlying drivers around life sciences are quite good.
Water quality, I think we all have an appreciation for the challenges around the environment in China and the Chinese
government has continued to make the environment, in water in particular, a priority. And we've seen some good
performance, so far, this year from our water quality business in China. And PID, I think, also is well positioned.
So, across the portfolio, we feel great about the Chinese market and the opportunities we have there for sustained
double-digit performance.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Very helpful comment.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And Ross, as Tom noted, the acceleration from some of the high-single-digit growth last year
to the double-digit growth we saw in the first quarter was more the breadth – wasn't that the health care business got
stronger, it's more that the consistent double-digit growth across all of the five platforms.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Ross.

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hi, Tycho.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Tom, I want to start with biopharma. We've got some mixed
data points. Certainly, the CROs have gotten in trouble, and we've even heard from Sartorius and then – some of the
other European companies about some softness. So, given mid-single digit growth in Pall Life Science for you guys,
can you maybe talk to some of the trends you're seeing and what you're hearing from customers? Obviously, there's
been more noise on drug pricing this week with [ph] J&J (32:06) and others kind of calling that out.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Sure. Tycho, we play such a vital role in the biopharma manufacturing process at
a relatively low cost to that manufacturing process. The filtration as a component of the overall manufacturing costs is
relatively modest, arguably even marginal. But the value is so high that we think filtration is a very sustainable position
across biopharma over the long term. Relative to the overall trends, I think both the high growth of large molecule
drugs today that are in the market as well as the pipelines being skewed towards large molecule drugs both speak well
to the long-term growth trajectory of biopharma.
There's no question that's where all the investment is going over time. And filtration is used more intensively in large
molecule drug production than in small molecule drug production. So, I think when we look at it from a macro
perspective, we still feel very positive about how the biopharma, particularly manufacturing rates, will be sustained
over time and how that will benefit Pall, and frankly, others of our life science businesses that participate in that
market. So, certainly, some concerns about that relative to drug pricing, but we think we're relatively well positioned in
terms of the impact there.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: And then, can you maybe comment on SCIEX up low-single digit? I know only 40% of
that business is biopharma, but can you maybe just talk about the trends for that and what your outlook is for the
remainder of the year?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. SCIEX business has performed exceptionally well over a long period of time. We
did post low-single-digit growth here in the quarter. We have a pretty big service business at SCIEX, and that was
impacted a bit by the one less selling day. So, our outlook is pretty consistent with our past performance, more like
mid-single-digit growth in Q2 and beyond. From an end market perspective, pharma was an excellent growth driver
during the course of the quarter, double digits led – it led the way at double-digit growth. Applied was more flattish but
finished the quarter a little bit better, so the growth rate, the order rates were improving through the course of the
quarter.
China is a very good market there for us particularly in the applied markets, meaning food and environmental. We have
had a bit of a tough comp on the clinical side, given some of the changes in physician office lab reimbursement and so
on. And academic has been a tough comp as well. So, those were a little bit of the pluses and minuses. But in general,
as we look forward, given the one less selling day of the service business, how we've seen the installed base grow, the
order rates, we feel good about SCIEX in the quarters ahead.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask one last clarification.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: On Pall Industrial, you had the Middle East project you called out for Pall Industrial.
Would Pall Industrial have grown excluding that?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yes. In fact, orders were up mid-single digits in Q1 for Pall all up, as opposed with the
low-single digit on a revenue basis because of this prior-year equipment install that we had in the Middle East both in
Q1, and we'll also have a piece of that in Q2 as well.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Tycho, maybe one last point. I know you didn't ask about it, but probably just a quick
mention relative to Phenomenex, which was an acquisition that was led by the SCIEX team, and that business is off to

And we'll go next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hey, Derik.
<Q - Derik de Bruin>: Hi. Hey, I'm going to follow up on Tycho's question there. So, any signs at all in the U.S.
academic market in particular that there is any hesitation in terms of ordering or wanting to spend money just given
some of the uncertainties in Washington around funding?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Derik, peering into the psychology is a challenging thing for me. We've seen what's
going on in terms of the proposed budgets and so on. So, I think there has to be a little bit of concern and hesitation out
there, but it's not like we can point to something very specific that's impacted our order rates. In terms of NIH funding
specifically, we don't – as I think you probably know already, we don't have a very high degree of direct exposure to
NIH funding. Less than 5% of our life science sales comes directly from the NIH and somewhat more than that
indirectly.
But when you step back and you look at our life science business, approaching half the business is in -goes into
pharma, mostly biopharma and applied, food and environmental. And then, of course, you have actually some more
industrially-oriented exposure in our life science business. And so, our academic and research exposure is probably
sub-20%. And yes, I think there's some hesitation out there, but I can't point to specific projects. Interestingly, I think
maybe one counterpoint would be Leica Microsystems had a terrific quarter. And those products, particularly confocals
can be the types of high CapEx expenditures that can give some folks pause in the academic and the research area. And
we saw a good growth there over the course of the quarter, so a little bit of a counterpoint that would make for
uncertainty.
<Q - Derik de Bruin>: Yeah. And just one follow-up on this. R&D expense in the quarter is 6.4% of sales. How
should we look about this rolling across for the rest of the year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, part of the step-up was organic. And part of it was now the inclusion of Cepheid in the
number. But we should be in that sort of ZIP code through the year.
<Q - Derik de Bruin>: Okay.

consumables off the mat. But you also mentioned several times investments in innovation and commercial initiatives.
Are the investments you're making or the payoffs going to ramp from those types of things, you have visibility into
that? Just wondering sort of the path from 2.5% up to 4%.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah. Shannon, you've hit on it – a number of the key drivers even within your
question. Clearly, the acquisitions will have some impact. As Cepheid and Phenomenex coming to the core later on this
year, we would expect to see some impact there. Yes, absolutely, we would need to see some improvement in the
dental consumables market. As we've said in the past, these types of slowdowns tend to right themselves over time,
both in terms of the channel inventories as well as the overall sell-through, if you will. So, I think we will see some
improvement there, probably not in the second quarter, but more likely in the second half.
And yes, we've made – we've continued to make investments. Derik asked us about R&D as a percent of sales. We
continued to invest in R&D as well as in commercial initiatives. And we do see payoffs there. We've seen them in the
past. We've seen, for example, at SCIEX where we've increased R&D as a percent of sales from 7% years ago around
the acquisition now they're up to 10%, and where the flow of new products has been dramatically increased, and that's
led to the sustained growth rates and the improvement in share gains.
I think Videojet is another tremendous example of where – that not only the power of DBS, but the investments in
R&D and commercial initiatives globally have expanded their service offering, their remote capabilities. We often refer
to them as the life cycle initiatives that have driven better service contract attachment. We've seen mid-single-digit
growth with Videojet consistently over a seven-year period, and that's the impact of work that was done a number of
years ago in terms of new products and commercial investments.
So, as we get to some of the more investments that are making more in a near-term basis, it'll take time for those to pay
off, but it's clear the investments that we've made in the past have had real impact. So, that's what gives us confidence
that over time – and over time is longer than a couple of quarters, even though we do expect to see a ramp in the second
half of the year, but we know these investments pay off in time.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. And then, just on cash flow, operating cash flow is down a little bit
year-over-year and the CapEx was up. Maybe just a little color on the dynamics of both of those components.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Shannon, the primary driver in the operating cash flow is really just the timing around tax
payments. Our tax payments were $60 million, $70 million higher, Q1. As you remember, we had relatively modest tax
payments the first three quarters of last year, and then very, very heavy tax payments over $400 million in the fourth
quarter. So, I think you'll see more normalization of that as we go through the year. I think we're set up for, again,
high-single-digit 10% sort of growth in free cash flow for the full year. The CapEx increase, primarily the new
acquisitions, Cepheid and Phenomenex, and again, just some timing issues as well.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Shannon.

We'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Good morning. I want to start by going back to Pall. Mid-single-digit life science revenue
growth is good but weaker than we had it in our model [ph] and the moderation (43:29) below recent trend. I just want
to be clear that you would attribute the moderation in growth to a tougher double-digit revenue growth comparison
rather than any change in market conditions. And relatedly, what assumptions for Pall growth are embedded into
guidance for the balance of the year, especially given some of the strong bookings commentary that you shared earlier
in the Q&A?

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Doug, that mid-single digit growth at Pall Life Science really had some impact of
the one less selling day, so that's probably the first impact that we would point to. Overall, we see that market, as I've
mentioned earlier, is continuing to have great underlying and very fundamental drivers. Utilization of filtration
continuing to be an important part of large molecule drugs. So, we don't see anything that would suggest that there'd be
any moderation in that business. And in fact, we'd see it as being a pretty consistent performer over time. So, we feel
good about that. Doug, remind me, I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question [indiscernible] (44:40).
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Maybe I'll – he's asking about what's embedded in the guidance for the full year. We would
expect comparable low-single-digit growth in the second quarter, again, absent the project that we shipped half of it in
the first quarter, half of the equipment in the second quarter of last year. We'd expect to be mid-single digits. We'd
expect order growth closer to mid-single digits in the second quarter. And we think that tees us up from
mid-single-digit growth at Pall in the second half of the year.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Okay. And that's a good segue to, I guess, my follow-up. Your guidance for the second quarter
for core growth is around 3%. This is against the slightly more difficult year-over-year comparison versus what you
faced in the first quarter. Can you help us tease out in which segments or end markets you expect growth to improve in
the second quarter versus what you saw in the first quarter?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, Doug, I think what we said in the script is we expect growth comparable to what we –
core growth comparable to what we had in the first quarter. And looking across the four segments, we would expect
roughly similar performance for each of the four segments in the second quarter.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Okay. Last real just quick one. Did flu contribute meaningfully to Cepheid's growth in the
quarter? There's some commentary out there and some data out there that suggest that that could have been an outsized
driver in the quarter. Could you comment on whether that was the case? Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Fluke?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Flu, not fluke.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Flu. Oh, my God.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: [ph] Flukey (46:16).

thought that you had thought.

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sorry. If there was a pregnant pause there, now you know why.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Influenza. Influenza, sorry.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Influenza. You're right. Obviously, the publicly available market data on flu, it was "a
good flu season." I am not sure I would describe it as an outsized impact but in general, it was a good flu season and
that contributed to the overall drug.

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sorry.
<Q - Steve C. Beuchaw>: So, I have an easy one for Dan. And then, I'll apologize, I have a more complicated one for
Tom.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Okay.
<Q - Steve C. Beuchaw>: The easy question for Dan is, hey, Dan, can you just help us understand, and you've alluded
to this a little bit in discussions around service and around Pall, where the selling day impact in the quarter might have
been more or less significant across the businesses? Just so we can tune up the models appropriately.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure.
<Q - Steve C. Beuchaw>: And then, the question for Tom.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Go ahead.
<Q - Steve C. Beuchaw>: The question for Tom is you're uniquely qualified to think about multi-layered distribution
strategies across the businesses, given your experience, not just at Danaher but at what is now Fortive. And so, I
wonder how you're thinking as you work with your – particularly, your Life Sciences and Dental teams about
e-commerce. It seems to be one of the more important questions that management teams in the space are thinking
about, I mean what's the right time to use e-commerce as a way to get closer to customers and potentially to think about
it as a lever to improve margins in those businesses. So, I wonder if you could give the wisdom of your experience
across the businesses that you might be sharing with those management teams as they think about how and when to
become more active with e-commerce partners. Thanks a bunch.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Thanks, Steve.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: I will take the first one.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: So, Steve, I'll take the first one and then Dan will come back to you on the impacts of
the selling days and so on. Thank you for the comment. I'm not sure how uniquely qualified I am, but I do have some
perspectives for certain about how we think about layered distribution strategies, or you might say, multi-pronged
distribution strategies across each of our platforms. You asked about life sciences and dental, but let me talk broadly
first. When we think about e-commerce, when we think about selling directly to customers through either our own
portal or someone else's portal, we think about how customers want to buy. That's first and foremost.
There's no point in having an e-commerce strategy if you've determined the customers have no interest in buying that
way for a variety of different reasons. So, the typical characteristics of products where we've had great success
strategically using e-commerce have been lower dollar value products, high-usage high-turn products, products that are
ordered somewhat routinely that require somewhat limited or more limited technical support and certainly more lower
levels of service. So, when you have products like that, customers generally want it to be easy to buy.
And a great example of that for us is our Hach business. The Hach business sells to municipalities and industrial
facilities. We install an instrument, and then there's a routine level of usage of consumables that the customer is really
familiar with. They're relatively low-cost consumables, but they're high-value consumables. Customers super familiar
with them, so they don't need a lot of technical support and they don't need any service. And as a result of that, Hach
has grown their e-commerce business high-single digits to double digits consistently over, frankly, as many years as I
can remember. Admittedly, we started off a small base a number of years ago. But we continued to invest there. I think
that's a great example of where we've used it very strategically and aligned e-commerce with the way customers want
to buy.

Now, if you go back to some of the areas, specifically in your question, there's a whole bunch of products in our life
science platform where e-commerce isn't terribly well suited to procurement of a confocal microscope from Leica
Microsystems or a mass spectrometer from AB SCIEX. But clearly, consumables for our flow cytometry business
would be a great example. In the dental platform there are lots of opportunities for e-commerce. What we've generally
found is that the channel, as it exists today, particularly in North America, provides those e-commerce capabilities.
Whether you're talking about Schein or Patterson, or Benco or any one of a number of others, they do quite a nice job
with relatively low-cost, low-tech, quick-tearing consumables on an e-commerce basis. And so, one angle is to align
yourself strategically with distribution that has that capability, and in other case, it may be to have that capability
yourself if you are the right player and you're the destination of choice. So, those are some of the ways we think about
it, Steve. Hopefully, that gives you some insight in terms of the way I think about it.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, in terms of the days issue, it really impacts our consumables business, so the 35% of
our business that's instrumentation and equipment, we typically don't see an impact when we have a change in a day or
two in the quarter. But across Beckman Diagnostics and dental consumables, Videojet, Hach, Pall, filtration where they
are shipping consumables on a daily basis, we tend to feel that. In the first quarter, our equipment sales were up 2.5%.
That's been pretty consistent the last couple of quarters. But our consumables which tend to be maybe 100 basis points,
50 to 75 basis points better than that the last couple of quarters, they were also 2.5%, and we think part of that impact
was because of the days.

And we'll go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hi, Isaac.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Hey, guys. How are you? Sorry.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Great.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Thanks for fitting me in.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: No problem.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Yes. Thanks. I had a question on the diagnostics business, I was wondering for a bit of an update on
the Cepheid Omni platform. And the reason I ask is, you know that CLIA Waived market is a huge opportunity. It's
still very early, but it does look like you have a couple strong first movers making progress here. I think Roche recently
got theirs going as well. So, just curious kind of when you put all that in context, how important that platform will be in
sustaining the double-digit growth you're seeing in that franchise over a longer-term period.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Post-acquisition, where we've really gotten up close and personal
with the Omni platform, we're very excited about its potential. We think it has exceptional opportunities to extend the
already well-characterized Cepheid menu to lower-volume environments, to the physician office labs and closer to the
point-of-care certainly at what we think will be an attractive instrumentation cost level as well. We've gotten a chance
to work directly with the R&D teams and the product management teams that are on Omni right now, and we're very
confident in the potential of that platform.
I think realistically, there were a couple of things that we wanted the team to shore up technically around their product
and a couple of things that we wanted to make sure we're in place commercially as well. And so, right now I think
we're looking at probably the early part of next year, maybe even as early as first quarter next year for that launch just
to make sure that we have that in the best shape possible.

<Q - Isaac Ro>: Great. And then, just maybe a follow-up on your earlier comments regarding the dental business, just
trying to kind of [ph] weight (55:29) which of the two factors here are maybe more important to driving better top line
growth. Is it end market performance or is it maybe more of an internal kind of product line sort of issue? And I know
you guys have made some changes there over the last year, so I want to be patient. But just sort of curious if it's a
market environment thing or more of a Danaher thing.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Well, I think in the area where the softness has been most acute, the traditional
consumables business, it's really a combination of seeing some better sell-through that's a function of just the overall
market, as well as the channel being comfortable that they've rightsized inventories and have sort of lapped over that
adjustment. So, I think those are probably the most important things on a near-term basis.
I think from an internal Danaher perspective, our goal is continue to invest in innovation in the traditional consumables
side as well as to continue to improve the performance in the businesses that quite frankly are already performing quite
well at a mid-single digit rate, like Nobel and our equipment business particularly with the investments that we've made
in digital dentistry, where going back to a question that was asked earlier about investment levels that we've made,
we've 2x-ed the number of software engineers that are focused on digital dentistry across the platform. And I think
that's an example of something we're working on internally that's an investment that will pay off over time.

And we'll take our last question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just had a couple of cleanup questions here. For the Fortive
spin for Dan, is there anything to call out regarding shared service agreements and anything on – or might be some
remaining stranded costs?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: They're relatively – we're pretty far being completed with that. There are a few small services
back and forth, but I think either side there, relatively de minimis.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Got it. And then, any comments on what the product line transfer from life sciences to
environmental are?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That was the Pall water business.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Ah, so, we've been waiting for this. Is there anything in terms of new product launches? There's
been discussions at some of the trade shows that you're launching a mobile water treatment truck-based, should we be
looking for that in the near term?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Deane, good morning. It's Tom. Thanks for the question. It's early days. We literally
just transferred the responsibility for that product line here in the first quarter over to the water platform. And so,
almost as if it were a newly-acquired business. That team is going through – I'm not sure I'd say 100-day strategic plan,
but they're looking at that business strategically in trying to figure out where the right investments are across that
portfolio. There are a lot of different opportunities there, but we have to be selective about those. It's not a huge
business. It's sub-$100 million, but it does need some work. And making the right investments from a product
standpoint is going to be important there. So, it's a little too early to say, but maybe in a quarter or two, we can give you
some more insight.
