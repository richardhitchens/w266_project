I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan.
Timothy J. Sloan
Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today.
The benefit of our diversified business model once again resulted in strong financial performance. Our team members
are committed to putting our customers first and helping them succeed financially, which is demonstrated each and
every day all across our company. Here are just a few examples. We continued to improve customer experience and
loyalty scores in retail banking. Our debit card purchase and transaction volumes were industry-leading. We had record
client assets in Wealth and Investment Management, and we originate more ACH payments than any other financial
institution.
Let me briefly summarize our financial results in the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.8 billion, up 5%
from a year ago; and EPS of $1.07 a share, up 6%. We produced $22.2 billion of revenue with recorded net interest
income, up 6% from a year ago. Average earning assets grew 5% from a year ago; average deposits were a record $1.3
trillion, up 5% from a year ago. We had very strong credit results with a net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points,
the lowest level I've seen during my nearly 30 years at Wells Fargo, reflecting our consistent risk management.
Our efficiency ratio was 61.1% in the second quarter. While it improved from the first quarter, the efficiency ratio is
still too high. Operating at this level is just not acceptable, and we are firmly committed to the goals we provided at
Investor Day. As John will discuss later on the call, we are making progress on our ongoing expense initiatives, which
target $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2018 that will support our investment in the business, and an additional
$2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2019 that is expected to go to the bottom line.
And while we are focused on reducing expenses and improving efficiency, we're continuing to invest in our businesses
and, in particular, technologies that make it easier for our commercial and consumer customers to manage their
finances.
During the second quarter, we rolled out Zelle, a P2P payment platform for 28 million digital customers, provided
enhancements for our Treasury Management customers to streamline and automate accounts receivable, launched a
chat bot pilot for Facebook Messenger, began the rollout of new streamlined mobile checking account opening
experiences for our customers, and launched a new service for commercial card customers that allows them to upload
and manage receipts with their mobile device.
At the end of the first quarter, we were the first large bank in the U.S. to offer card-free access to all of our ATMs, and
our customers are excited about this added convenience. As of last week, our customers had used the new card-free
ATM access code over 1 million times.
We're also focused on improving the operating performance of the company by increasing our emphasis on core
banking products and services that we believe are most relevant for our customers and provide the best financial returns
for our shareholders. As part of this effort, last year we sold our crop insurance and health benefits services businesses
and we recently announced the sale of our commercial insurance business, which is expected to close in the fourth
quarter, and our Shareowner Service business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.
Importantly, during the second quarter we continued to make progress on rebuilding trust which remains our top
priority. Let me update you on a few actions and milestones. This week, we received preliminary court approval for the
$142 million settlement agreement for a class-action lawsuit concerning retail sales practices, including providing an
avenue for customers whose credit was harmed to seek compensation. We expect this settlement to resolve
substantially all claims and 10 other pending class actions.
Over the past 10 months, we've been very comprehensive in our approach to customer outreach and remediation, and
these efforts are ongoing. This preliminary approval, which covers the period beginning in May of 2002 through April
of 2017, is a significant step forward in our efforts to make things right for our customers.

Our team members completed a company-wide third-party culture assessment in the second quarter which provided
them the opportunity to share feedback about Wells Fargo's culture. We are processing these results, and the goal is to
identify both positive attributes and potential weaknesses, so we can take actions that will strengthen our culture.
We launched our new nationwide marketing campaign, Building Better Every Day, which builds on our commitment to
creating a better bank for our customers, our team members, communities, and investors.
We still have more work to do, including the completion of a third-party review of our sales practices in the
Community Bank as part of meeting our consent order obligations, as well as a voluntary review of accounts from 2009
and 2010 to determine possible unauthorized accounts and associated harm, which we expect to complete by the end of
the third quarter. However, I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm confident we're on the right path.
Our recent CCAR results are just one indication of that. As part of our 2017 capital plan, we expect to return more
capital to our shareholders including increasing the third quarter common stock dividend to $0.39 per share, subject to
approval by our board of directors. The plan also includes up to $11.5 billion of common stock repurchases on a gross
basis during the four-quarter period starting in the third quarter of this year. This is an increase from the $8.3 billion we
repurchased during the four-quarter period ended June 30.
Before I turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to again highlight the efforts of our
271,000 team members who work hard each and every day to fulfill our vision of helping our customers to succeed
financially, which results in such strong operating performance for our shareholders.
John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone.
As Tim mentioned, we earned $5.8 billion in the second quarter, the 19th consecutive quarter of generating earnings
greater than $5 billion. We believe this outcome reflects the benefit of our diversified business model during a period of
continued modest economic growth and uncertainty regarding future interest rates.
Tim described most of the year-over-year results that we show on page 3, so I'll just highlight the decline of 82 million
common shares outstanding over the past year, reflecting our strong capital return through net share repurchases.
Turning to page 4, let me highlight a few notable balance sheet trends. Driven primarily by the expected decline in auto
loans, which were down $2.5 billion from the first quarter, total loans declined $982 million from the prior quarter. As
we've discussed previously, we've tightened credit underwriting standards in auto, which has reduced our origination
volume down 17% from the first quarter. Cash and short-term investments declined $43.5 billion, reflecting a seasonal
decline in deposits and the pay down of wholesale funding. However, we still maintain strong liquidity levels and could
deploy tens of billions of dollars and remain LCR-compliant.
Investment securities increased $2 billion in the quarter. We had approximately $37 billion of gross purchases in the
quarter, the majority of which were agency MBS. These purchases were largely offset by run-off and the sale of
approximately $15 billion of lower-yielding short-duration securities. The $17.6 billion decrease in long-term debt was
primarily driven by the prepayment of Federal Home Loan Bank advances.
Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call, so let
me just highlight that our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 27.7%. This included discrete tax benefits totaling
$186 million, or approximately $0.04 per share, primarily as a result of our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance
Services. We currently expect our full-year 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 29%.
As shown on page 6, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 10 basis points in the quarter, the sixth
consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields. We had modest average loan growth from a year ago, up 1%, and average

loans declined $6.7 billion from the first quarter. H8 data continued to indicate that there was softness across the
industry, but there are also specific actions we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline which have caused
our growth to slow. Let me explain the primary factors impacting our loan portfolios in some more detail.
Starting with Commercial, C&I loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter. We had growth across a number of
businesses including $1.1 billion in Government and Institutional Banking, $605 million in Wells Fargo Commercial
Capital, $469 million in Global Banking, and modest growth in the Middle Market. The growth was partially offset by
a $620 million decline in Financial Institutions from actions we've taken to lower exposure in certain emerging markets
and decreased demand.
Capital Markets activity has resulted in pay downs in Corporate Banking. It's interesting to note that Wells Fargo
Securities was involved in some capacity in all of the Capital Markets activity associated with the pay downs of these
loans in Corporate Banking, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model.
The size of our oil and gas portfolio stabilized and we had $12.7 billion outstanding at the end of the second quarter.
Commercial Real Estate loans declined $982 million from the first quarter. While we remain the largest CRE lender in
the country, our growth has been modestly below that of the industry for the first half of this year. We have remained
disciplined in adhering to our underwriting standards in a competitive market.
We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on page 8. This portfolio declined $11.1 billion from a year ago, primary
due to $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans and $4 billion of lower auto loans. Let me explain the $1.9 billion
linked-quarter decline in the consumer loan portfolio in some more detail. Our first mortgage loans increased $1.9
billion from the first quarter, reflecting $7.3 billion of growth in nonconforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the
continued run-off of higher-yielding legacy portfolios including the sale of a $569 million Pick-A-Pay PCI loan
portfolio.
Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected, as pay downs more than offset new
originations. Our credit card portfolio increased $563 million from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. Our auto
portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the first quarter.
As a result of tightening underwriting standards, the quality of originations has improved with a quarterly average
FICO of 719 at origination in the second quarter, up from 696 a year ago. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we're also
making a number of organizational changes in this business, including a new leader, as we focus on improving
execution and efficiency through increased standardization and centralization. We expect auto loans to continue to
decline in the second half of this year.
Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $339 million reflecting seasonality in our student loan portfolio
and a $190 million decline in personal loans and lines. While consumer loan growth will continue to be impacted by
the actions we're taking in our auto portfolio and the expected run-off of legacy junior lien mortgage loans, we are
making some modest changes to generate new loan originations, including offering interest-only jumbo mortgage loans
to high-quality borrowers and testing credit card offerings through our digital channels
As highlighted on page 9, average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $64.5 billion, or 5%, from a year ago, and up
$2 billion from the first quarter. Our deposit beta remained low with our average deposit cost up 4 basis points from the
first quarter. While we've implemented some incremental commercial deposit repricing in line with the market, we've
not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits as we've seen very little
market response in these categories, with the majority of our peers holding rates steady. We continue to monitor the
overall market and we expect deposit betas will be more responsive as we move further into the rate cycle.
Net interest income was a record $12.5 billion in the second quarter, up 6% from a year ago and 1% from the first
quarter. The increase from the first quarter reflected the benefit of the repricing of earning assets due to higher
short-term interest rates which exceeded the associated cost of repricing liabilities. We also benefited from one
additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.9%, driven by higher short-term
interest rates, disciplined deposit pricing, and a reduction in long-term debt, which were partially offset by the impacts
from lower loan and investment securities balances.

As we've previously stated, we expect NII to grow in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2017. The rate of
growth during the second half of the year will be dependent on a variety of factors, including the level and slope of the
yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.
Non-interest income declined $743 million from a year ago, driven by lower market-sensitive and mortgage banking
revenue. While non-interest income was down only $16 million from the first quarter, there are a few business drivers I
want to highlight. Deposit service charges were down $37 million from the first quarter, reflecting a higher earnings
credit rate for commercial customers and lower consumer and business checking service charges. Over the past few
months, we've made a number of changes to help our customers avoid unexpected overdrafts, including the
introduction of a zero-balance email alert that's sent intraday when a customer's available balance is zero or negative,
which our online banking customers receive automatically.
Card fees were a record $1 billion, up $74 million from the first quarter, reflecting a 7% increase in debit card
transaction volume and a 12% increase in credit card purchase volume. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined
$80 million from the first quarter. Residential mortgage origination volume increased $12 billion or 27% from the first
quarter on higher purchase volume, reflecting seasonality and a strong purchase market. However, originations were
down 11% from a year ago, reflecting lower refi volume. According to MBA data, the industry is projected to decline
15% for full-year 2017 from the slowdown in refinancing.
Applications were up 41% from the first quarter, and we ended the second quarter with a $34 billion unclosed pipeline.
The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 124 basis points in the second quarter,
down from 168 basis points in the first quarter. Approximately two-thirds of the decline was due to competitive pricing
in both the retail and correspondent channels, while the rest of the decline was driven by a mix shift to a higher
percentage of correspondent channel originations, which have a significantly lower margin than retail originations. 55%
of our originations in the second quarter were correspondent, up from 50% in the first quarter and 44% a year ago.
While it's still very early in the quarter, we currently expect similar industry pricing and mix trends.
Finally, our other income increased $249 million from the first quarter and included a $309 million gain on the sale of a
Pick-A-Pay PCI loan portfolio.
On page 12, we provide details on trading-related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest
income. Trading-related revenue was down $151 million or 15% from the first quarter. Trading-related net interest
income increased $51 million. However, non-interest income declined $202 million from the first quarter on lower net
gains from trading activities. $81 million of the decline was from lower deferred compensation plan investment results,
which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. The decline also reflected lower market-making trading results,
losses from RMBS and equity-related activity, which was offset in interest income and lower CVA and DVA.
As shown on page 13, expenses declined $251 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by the seasonal decline in
compensation-related expense. As Tim mentioned earlier, while our efficiency ratio improved to 61.1% in the second
quarter, it's still too high. We currently expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the second half of the year and expect
our full-year efficiency ratio to be 60% to 61% in 2017. This estimate does not include any potential non-recurring
expenses, including reasonably possible but not yet accrued litigation expenses.
At Investor Day, to help analyze our expenses, we divided our non-interest expense line items into six main expense
categories. We've used these same categories to describe the expense drivers on a linked-quarter and year-over-year
basis, starting on page 15.
The 2% decline in expenses from the first quarter was driven by a $570 million decline in compensation and benefits
expense from seasonally lower personnel expenses and lower deferred comp expense. We also had a $52 million
reduction in infrastructure expense on lower equipment expense from typically high first quarter software licensing and
maintenance costs. Partially offsetting these declines was $266 million of higher third-party services expense. This
increase reflected higher spending, primarily related to technology, consent orders, resolution and recovery planning,
and legal expense. We currently expect these costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter before declining in
the fourth quarter.

We also had higher non-discretionary running-the-business expenses. This increase was primarily from $68 million of
higher operating losses in the second quarter, driven by higher litigation accruals. As we usually do, we will include in
our 10-Q filing an update on the high end of the range of reasonably possible potential litigation losses in excess of our
accrued liability for the quarter. But based on the information currently available, which may change between now and
when we file the 10-Q, we expect the high end of the range to increase by approximately $1.3 billion due to a variety of
matters, including our existing RMBS-related regulatory investigations.
On page 16, we show the drivers of the year-over-year increases in expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses
increased $339 million, driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and a 1% increase in FTE. Third-party
services expense also increased $339 million. Approximately $110 million of this increase was sales practice-related.
Non-discretionary running-the-business expense increased $185 million, which included a $94 million donation to the
Wells Fargo Foundation and a $73 million amount of higher FDIC expense due to the special assessment implemented
last July. Partially offsetting these increases were $152 million of lower revenue-related expenses, primarily from lower
commissions and other incentives in mortgage and wholesale banking. Discretionary running-the-business expense
declined $60 million on lower travel and entertainment, postage, and advertising expense.
We continue to make progress on efficiency initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion
annually by year-end 2018, with the full-year benefit starting in 2019. As we've previously mentioned, these savings
will be reinvested in the business. However, there are timing differences to consider. We've significantly increased our
business investments in the last few years. And while we've made a lot of progress on the work that needs to be done
on these initiatives, most of the expense savings are in the earlier stages of being realized.
As we show on page 17, the largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization. We list a lot of great
examples of the efforts we're making, which we expect will save $1.3 billion annually. Let me highlight just a few.
Approximately 113,000 team members across the company have been realigned over the past 18 months as part of our
centralization and optimization initiative. Operating costs in human resources have already been reduced, by 12% since
the beginning of 2016, and we've reduced the number of marketing agency vendors, resulting in a12% reduction in
quarterly agency fees from a year ago also.
On slide 18, we highlight the other areas of the $2 billion expense initiative. Through aggregating demand and staffing
to create certain capabilities in house, we expect to save approximately $200 million related to third-party services
expense. During the first six months of this year, we've closed 93 branches, including 54 in the second quarter, and
we're on track to close 200 branches this year. As we disclosed at Investor Day, we plan to close an additional 250
branches next year. As a reminder, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closures due to the
initial closing costs. So therefore, most of the expense benefit from the 200 branches we close this year will not be
realized until next year.
We also expect to save approximately $150 million in infrastructure expense through continued site consolidation
outside of our branch network, and we're on track to reduce 2 million square feet this year. We expect to save another
$200 million through other initiatives, including reduced travel expense. As we discussed at Investor Day, we expect an
additional $2 billion in annual expense saves by the end of 2019. These savings are projected to go to the bottom line.
Turning to our business segments, starting on page 19, Community Banking earned $3 billion in the second quarter,
down 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the first quarter. Our branch network is now below 6,000 for the first
time since our merger with Wachovia at the end of 2008. As we discussed at Investor Day, we're making a shift in how
we report activity to highlight metrics we believe best show how we're managing the business today and are most
important to our long-term success.
As we show on slide 20, existing customers continue to actively use their accounts. Branch and ATM interactions were
up 3% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and were down 3% from a year ago. The decline from a year ago
was primarily driven by customers migrating to our digital channels with digital secure sections up 5% from a year ago.
Our 27.9 million digital active customers are increasingly using our award-winning online and mobile capabilities.

For the first time in May, we had more mobile active customers than online active customers, and we continue to invest
in our mobile capabilities, including, as Tim highlighted at the top, the ability to open accounts through mobile.
Primary consumer checking customers increased from a year ago. Although the rate of growth has continued to slow,
active consumer general purpose credit card accounts were up 2% from both first quarter and from a year ago.
On slide 21, we highlight balance and activity growth, which drives revenue. Average consumer and small business
banking deposits grew by 5% from a year ago, debit card purchase volume increased 6% and average consumer general
purpose credit card balances increased 7% from a year ago. Our team members continue to focus on what we know is
most important, providing outstanding customer service. This effort has resulted in the overall satisfaction with most
recent visit and customer loyalty scores in June, reaching their highest levels since August of 2016, and overall
satisfaction scores were higher than a year ago.
The Community Banking team continues to work on making changes that will further improve the customer and team
member experience. We're investing in training leaders throughout the country during coaching events that started last
month. During the second quarter, we had our first payout under the new compensation plan for Community Banking
team members with a 90% participation rate. More changes to the way we do business will be rolled out during the
third quarter that further support our priorities through simplification, collaboration and innovation.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from a year ago and up 13% from the first
quarter. These results included a tax benefit resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services. It's
also important to note that prior-year results included the $290 million gain on the sale of our Health Benefit Services
business.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $682 million in the second quarter, up 17% from a year ago and
up 9% from the first quarter. WIM had positive operating leverage on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.
Revenue increased 7% from a year ago with a 21% increase in net interest income and a 2% growth in non-interest
income. Average loans grew 7% and average deposits increased 3%. Deposit growth was impacted by seasonal
tax-related outflows, as well as brokerage clients moving more of their cash balances into other investments.
We highlighted last quarter that, in March, we had our first $1 billion month of closed referred investment assets from
the partnership between Wealth and Investment Management and Community Banking since the sales practices
settlement. Twice during the second quarter, we achieved $1 billion of monthly closed referred investment assets, a
result of effective partnering between our bankers and financial advisors. WIM total client assets were a record $1.8
trillion, up 8% from a year ago, driven by continued positive net flows and higher market valuations.
Turning to page 24, net charge-offs decreased $150 million from the first quarter, with 27 basis points of annualized net
charge-offs, which are at historically low levels. Commercial losses declined $68 million from the first quarter driven
by continued improvement in our oil and gas portfolio, where losses declined $81 million linked-quarter.
Consumer losses declined $82 million with lower losses in auto, consumer real estate and other revolving credit and
installment portfolios. Our consumer real estate portfolios, both first and second-lien mortgages, were actually in a net
recovery position in the second quarter, demonstrating the significant improvement in the residential real estate market
and the quality of loans we've put on our balance sheet.
Nonperforming assets continued to decline, down $827 million from the first quarter, with improvements across all
commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios, as well as lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve release
of $100 million, reflecting continued strong credit performance.
Turning to page 25, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.6% in the second quarter
and we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Our net
payout ratio was 63%. As Tim mentioned, as part of our 2017 capital plan, we expect to return more capital to
shareholders over the next four quarters including up to $11.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases.
Based on our updated TLAC estimate as of the second quarter we've exceeded our expected minimum requirement of
22% largely from lower RWAs and continued debt issuance. However, we continue to issue eligible TLAC to fund

In summary, our results in the second quarter which included a 1.21% return on assets, an 11.95% return on equity and
14.26% on return on tangible common equity demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model which has
generated, I said earlier, over $5 billion in quarterly earnings every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2012.
We shared updated throughout the call today on progress we've made to our goal of being the financial services leader
in six areas: customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate
citizenship and long-term shareholder value. I'm optimistic that the progress we're making will continue to drive our
long-term success.
I think we'll now take your questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I wanted to just kick off on loan growth because while it was decent number relative
to what we're seeing in the industry, the HA was a little slower than what we were looking for so could you just give us
a sense as to how you think that's going to be trajecting on a core level and then was there anything on a noncore
roll-off that was impacting the number?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, I think, Betsy, that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide some additional
granularity in the slides in terms of where we're seeing loan growth. I think the loan growth trends continue to be good
with the headwind that we're having just in terms of the absolute number being the runoff of the junior lien for the
mortgage portfolio and then the impact from auto. But you saw in the first quarter or in the second quarter that we had
some good growth in the C&I book, in government and institutional banking and commercial capital and global
banking.
Within the C&I book, while real estate, commercial real estate construction activity was up, the more typical real estate
loans were down a little bit primarily due to some of the competitive pressures that we're seeing out there. But I think
our trends should continue and that is our goal is to growth above the industry average. I think the important thing here
and one of the reasons why we wanted to be really transparent is that we've got to do this and one of the reasons why
we've become the largest lender in the country is because of our consistent approach to how we manage risk. And
we've seen cycles before, we'll see them again, but we'll continue to be optimistic because loans are such an important
product for customers.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then just separately follow-up, Tim, on the decision to sell the Insurance
Brokerage and there was a small separate sale of a business. I think it was the Shareholder Services business that hit the
tape the other day. I just wonder if you could give us a sense as to how you are thinking about the businesses that you
want to retain, attract, invest in, versus the ones that you are deciding to move away from because frankly in
conversations with investors the insurance was one that was a bit of a surprise to people. Thought was that it was good
for CCAR and ROE, albeit it had a high expense ratio. So with that as a backdrop, maybe you could give us your sense
as to what we should be expecting from the team going forward.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think what you should expect from our team is continued strong performance which is what
we've delivered this quarter. I think in terms of businesses that we've decided to sell, we're continuing to look at all of
our businesses. We have high expectations in terms of financial performance and for those business that, one, we don't
believe are as core for the platform, but two, maybe can grow better in the hands of others, we have decided to exit
those.
I think the Crop Insurance business is a great example of that. It was actually bought by one of our customers and my
understanding is they're doing well, which is great. We're happy about that. Likewise, the Health Benefits Services
business, which was a good business for us, the challenge there, candidly, was that the regulatory environment for that
business got much more in terms of – became much more focused on medical regulations and we just thought that that
was going to be – had a better chance to grow in the hands of somebody that's in that business full time, and again we
sold that to one of our customers. That's gone pretty well.
And then likewise, on the insurance business, recall a couple or three years ago, we sold the non-footprint offices in our
Commercial Insurance Brokerage business because there just wasn't as much correction there with our existing
business. And as we looked at the insurance business, again, it was performing fine, but candidly, I think that it might –
we thought it might work better with others and we're very pleased with the buyer, USI. They were the same firm that
purchased the offices that we sold in 2014 and then again with shareowner services.
So we're going to continue to look at all of our businesses. Those were all good businesses. I think the other thing that's
important is that all those buyers took care of our teams. So we're trying to improve our results to all of you and we're
going to continue to look hard at our businesses and if something doesn't fit, then we'll move on.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Good morning. So a lot of good details on the expenses, the drivers of where the $2 billion
net will come from. I think it's all very helpful and the back half of the year commentary I think is positive. But are you
able to give some visibility on where you think the absolute level of cost could be, looking out at a couple of years?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, for the reasons we've talked about before, it's tough to give an absolute number
because so much of our expense is driven by the business results that are happening in any given quarter because they
are related to production level et cetera. So instead, what we focused on is what we're taking out and focused
importantly on our 55% to 59% efficiency ratio because we're driving our businesses to outperform and incidentally
that's part of the story. Betsy mentioned it in her question, but the things we're focusing on are lower efficiency ratio
businesses and the things that probably don't fit as well are some of our higher efficiency ratio businesses, not all. So I
would think of it that way.
What costs are we taking out because they're non-value-added and we're improving the company, and where are we
signaling that we're going to run the company over time 55 to 59, as opposed to a specific dollar which reflects more
assumptions than is reasonable to make about what our business mix at that time, what our production levels are that
time.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Yeah. I can appreciate some of the moving pieces on the revenue side. I do think even a
range might be helpful. Some of your competitors, Bank America, JPMorgan, one would argue they've got more
volatile revenue stream than you because of a bigger investment bank, and JPMorgan gives us an annual expense target
Bank America has a number out there a couple of years out. So I think something it's something we're considering. I
think it would be helpful for your stock. Obviously, the expense message overall is positive and I do think it's
something that might be helpful.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Following up on Matt's question on the expenses, John, could we go over that
concept of the timing differences between the first $2 billion of expense saves that you're targeting for the end of 2018
and kind of the offsetting spending, some of which is already occurring? Could you just explain that timing difference
again so we understand it?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So the first $2 billion should be fully in the run rate at the end of 2018 and the
second $2 billion should be fully in the run rate at the end of 2019. The concept of a timing difference is we have
elevated expense today, and we described some of the areas where that's occurring. Some of that will abate naturally
because programs run off between now and the end of 2018 or the end of 2019, so there isn't a nice stair step that
describes what rolls on and what rolls off. But we have higher expenses than they should be today in certain areas, and
we've got these programs kicking in when we're describing them kicking in.
Now it's certainly possible – it's very likely, actually, that we'll begin to drip into the run rate, the first $2 billion, before
the end of 2018 and the second $2 billion before the end of 2019, but the last dollar of it should be in the run rate by the
end of 2018 and the end of 2019.
And then to complicate it, I know you know this, but we've got a few other items that will be rolling off after 2018,
FDIC insurance, the super-premium there, and some amortization of deposit intangibles is out there. We're also selling
these businesses which will have an impact on expenses. All of those things will be happening at about the same time,
but we'll keep driving people back towards evidence of the $2 billion for 2018 and the $2 billion of 2019 so you can see
where we're taking that cost out.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And because of that difference between the spending that you're doing to offset the
first $2 billion and when you get the saves by next year, won't effectively some of that first $2 billion really be falling
to the bottom line in 2018 because the spending already happened? And now you're getting the savings?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Some of it will. That is because it's coming in before the last day of '18, and there will be
some ramp down in certain of the programs that we've got that have elevated expense today. But just for clarity's sake,
to help people understand how long it might take, we're describing it as the end of 2018 and the end of 2019.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And then to the question of longer term targets, understanding the challenge of an
absolute dollar target, but maybe a target that's a gap between your revenue growth and expense growth over time, is
that something that you might aspire to? Having a gap between those two? An operating leverage kind of target?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We certainly aspire to have consistent positive operating leverage. It depends on what's
going on with the rates while all that's happening because the business mix will make a big difference in what kind of
leverage we get. There's so much leverage in a higher rate environment than there is in a lower rate environment
because you get extra revenue without actually having to put more labor into it.
So there are assumptions that are embedded in what that would look like. But just to be perfectly clear, in every
business in every way, we're targeting to end up in a consistent positive operating leverage environment as a result of
the moves that we're making.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. That's fair. One quick follow-up. Is there any change in your loan growth
outlook for the full year? I think at Investor Day you were targeting low-single digit loan growth for the year. In terms
of low-single digits, any change there after the results this quarter?

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Ken.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Hey. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. One more specific on just the expense trajectory. Can you
help us understand on the insurance brokerage side and the sales of those businesses, is there any way to help us
understand the magnitude of the revenue and expense related to those that go away? And are those expenses
specifically in the $2 billion?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So two things. One, because we're still in the process of closing on those transactions, it's
not appropriate to talk too much about the results of the businesses. We'll wait until that's done, but two things.
One is both the businesses that have been announced and are being closed this year have very high efficiency ratios, so
you would expect to see the efficiency ratio benefit at the margin. These aren't huge businesses, but at the margin from
the outcome. And we'll talk more about what they meant to Wells Fargo after they've closed. But no, they're not in the
$2 billion. So specifically, the list of things that we're doing to improve Wells Fargo isn't getting benefited by expenses
going away from having sold the business.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: That's great. Thanks for that. Second thing, just as the earning asset mix has changed with slower
loan growth and mixing a little bit more into securities and cash, can you just help us through the dynamic of just net
interest income and NIM trajectory from here? Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes. So there's a lot that's going to happen with NIM trajectory, and I'd say the biggest
drivers to look for, part of it is earning asset mix and the rate of growth in loans, and of course what kind of loans we
put on the books. But at least in the short to medium term, probably more impactful than that is what's going on with
deposit pricing because we've been outperforming the beta that we showed to you at our Investor Day by a reasonable
amount, especially on the consumer and small business side of things.
And so as we sit around and think about the next six to twelve months and what happens with rates and what happens
with net interest income, whether or not we continue to outperform our modeled expectations on deposit repricing is
really one of the big drivers. Obviously, deposit growth, loan growth, deployment into securities all matter, but I think
I'd focus on deposit pricing in the near term.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: But do you feel confident that NII can continue to grow from here?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We do. In fact, we're, as I think I mentioned, confirming that low to mid-single-digit
annual NII growth 2017 rate.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Right. Okay, understood. Thanks, John.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: I wanted to focus my line of questioning in terms of the revenue progress that's
underlying your goal to get back to your efficiency range, and maybe it's good to just jump off from Ken's line of
questioning. You mentioned that the betas are going to be a big swing factor. And I'm wondering how you're thinking
about the sensitivity of outflow in beta as the Fed begins to reduce their balance sheet and how it would impact you
specifically.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure, I think our general assessment is if they start selling long-duration assets, I know
that there are people who believe that depositors will rush out of bank deposits and rush into mortgages in 10 years. I'm
less confident that that is an expected behavior, but let's assume that deposits decrease by some percentage of the
amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet. I don't think we have any reason to believe that our impact on that would be
any greater than our percentage of deposits overall because we think that we're very competitive in our deposit
franchises. We certainly are on product, service, et cetera, and we could be as competitive on price as we choose to be
depending on what the impact is on our business at that time.
So the way we're thinking about it is, I'll wait and see what the impact – what happens to deposits in the aggregate. And
then we'll react from a defensive position to the extent necessary to protect our deposit franchise as when and if the
market begins to make moves in order to stem whatever tide of outflows there are of deposits out of the system.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And, Erika, just to reinforce John's point, I think that's why it's really important from our
perspective to make sure that we're investing in our products and services, convenience, as John mentioned, for our
consumer customers. And that is that when you're in an environment where it is uncertain, the Fed has never had a
balance sheet of this size. We've never been through a situation where they're talking about reducing a balance sheet.
We can talk about history all day long, but since we've never been through that, nobody knows exactly what's going to
happen. But what we do know is one thing, and that is our customers value convenience, service, reliability. And to the
extent that we can continue to invest in all of our products and services, we can compete on much more than just price.
And as John said, we're comfortable about our ability in any environment of maintaining and hopefully growing our
deposit share.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Thank you. Moving on to just the other side of the balance sheet, one of your
competitors gave a dollar number in terms of how much liquidity had been tied up with their living will process. And
I'm wondering, especially given the Treasury proposal, if you could share, at least ballpark, how much liquidity is tied
up there. And I'm just I guess wondering what the opportunity set for Wells Fargo could be if reg reform does come to
pass, given it seems like liquidity versus capital seems much more of the constraint.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: The amount of – there are liquidity, big liquidity requirements as a result of resolution
planning. But frankly, I don't think they get us to much different of a number than our LCR process. In fact, LCR might
actually take us to the requirements, plus our buffer would take us to a higher level than our resolution liquidity needs
and our plans. So there's a lot of liquidity on the books of the biggest banks, but it's for both of those reasons. And so if
in some way resolution planning was softened somehow, frankly, I don't think for us, it would make that big of a
difference, and I'll leave it at that.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: And the final question, just on the fee side, if you take out the gain on the PCI loans,
the run rate is something like $9.4 billion. And as we're looking forward to efficiency improvement for the second half
of the year from the 61%, I'm wondering how we should think about the progression of fees in the second half.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We go line by line. Probably the biggest swing item, of course, will be mortgage and
what happens because now there's more price competition, I think, reflecting excess capacity and reflecting the
different market that we're in. It's a little bit more of a free-for-all in the purchase market than it is in a refi market
because of the way people source their mortgage loans in one versus the other. They don't just go back to their service

survey. They go out to the market in the purchase environment. So I think mortgage banking could be a little bit more
volatile. I think volumes are good, and our leading share is certainly a help, and our introduction of technology there
will be an incremental help, but that's a reasonable swing item.
I think service – I think everything else right now is in line with our five-quarter averages. We had a record in card fees
for the quarter. Trust and investment fees are very high. You heard the WIM results, and that reflects inflows as well as
the levels of asset prices that drive a lot of the outcomes there. Service charges are good. They did tick down a little bit.
We have introduced these new capabilities for our customers to avoid overdraft expenses. It would be a shame to lose
that revenue, but it's good for our customers, and we're happy to have done that. That feels like the right thing to do.
And then insurance is likely to be in the run rate for the rest of the year. We probably won't close that until the end of
the year. And then some of the market-sensitive other times will reflect the markets that we're in.
So there's a story behind each of them. Most of them are in line with the five-quarter averages, and I'd say mortgage is
probably the item to look at in terms of what's the size of the market, what's the composition of the market, and what's
going on with margins that reflects competition.

Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hello, Saul.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Saul.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi. Hi. Good morning, a couple questions First on the auto portfolio, down $2.5 billion
linked-quarter, obviously, you talked about underwriting standards. But how should we think about that going forward
in terms of the magnitude of declines in the second half, and where ultimately can the size of the portfolio get to? Do
you have a sense for that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Saul, it's a good question. I think that you're likely to see a continued decline in the auto
portfolio through the second half of this year, and my bet is it will probably stabilize sometime in the first half of next
year. I think during that entire time, it's reasonable to assume that the quality of the underlying customer, which is
really key here, but the quality underlying customers measured by FICO score will continue to improve. I don't know if
it will continue to improve at the levels we've seen, but it will continue to be very strong. And then my guess is that the
business stabilizes sometime in the first half of next year.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. And the decline is really related more to pricing and not getting targeted returns than
anything you're seeing from a credit standpoint; is that fair to say?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, no. I think a year ago, we looked at the market, and what we saw in the market was the
following, and that was that – remember the majority of our originations are used car loans. And so, we became
concerned about underlying values of the collateral, because of production levels by the industry, the number of cars
that were coming off leases. We got concerned by the risk of return in terms of pricing, as well as term, and we took
that all into consideration in terms of ramping down our originations and improving the underlying quality.
In the short term, we gave up loan growth, and so the metrics are not as good. We gave up maybe some short-term
revenue, but over the long term, this is how we think about credit. We're not targeting certain balance levels, or
anything like that, but we want to continue to underwrite in an appropriate way on a product-by-product basis.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: In that business, we're also reorganizing the business itself. We're collapsing lots of
regional offices, more than 50 regional offices down into a number of much bigger centers, and while that's going on,

we've reduced the risk profile of the portfolio and what's rolling into it so that we can work through that reorganization
on with less inherent risk in the loan book. And that's helpful too. That's idiosyncratic to Wells Fargo when you're
thinking about what this means for auto loans in general.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Got it. Just adding to that, on the retail sales metrics, it seems like you embedded them into the
segment results, or some of them into the segment results, but it seems like some of the forward-looking indicators,
whether it's I guess branch banker interactions, credit card applications, don't seem to be there. And I'm just curious
what the logic was there. And is the trend that you had been showing which was the big step function down after the
sales fraud issue and then kind of a stabilization, is that sort of what we're continuing to see in some of those
forward-looking indicators?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, let me start and, John, jump in. I mean, I think that what we're trying to do, Saul, is
provide you with a reflection of how we're measuring and running the business. So we changed, for example, the
incentive compensation plan in the first quarter. We talked about the results of that briefly. I think that we're seeing
actually some very good results in terms of customer experience and a continued improvement in customer loyalty.
I think the branch interactions are reflective of what's going on terms of customer choice moving more to mobile than
anything else. And so when you think about our customer interactions, what I would do is step back and not only look
at branch interactions but also look at the number of online and mobile interactions. We had a total of 1.9 billion
customer interactions in the second quarter, and that's why it's important for example to make sure that we're investing
in technology so a customer can open an account on their mobile device if they want to, or they can come into one of
our branches, that's fine.
But overall, I would say that we're seeing a slow but steady return and an improvement in the underlying retail
business. We still have more work to do. That's absolutely the case. Mary Mack and her team are absolutely focused on
that, but we're making some progress.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes, and so this is – as we announced at Investor Day, we're changing our descriptions,
our disclosures, as Tim said, to emphasize what Mary thinks is important in running the business. And you can see the
branch and ATM transactions and the digital transactions in the supplement. They're on slide 20.
And just specifically to your question in terms of us hitting a stabilization point based on some of the previous monthly
disclosures, nothing has changed about that. Things are still stable. Things are going well. We're opening more than
we're closing, et cetera. So this just represents the pivot toward how Mary is managing the business.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: On the deposit side, the weakness in the deposit fees, I know you've flagged a few items. You
flagged the new products you introduced. And you also mentioned the higher earnings credit rate. Can you give us any
idea of how much those factors for each was a drag? So in other words, can you just slice up how much was
attributable to the new products versus the ECR and then possibly the sales practice issue?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I would say it's 50-50 between earnings credit rate and the changes that we made on
overdraft. I'm not specifically attributing anything to what was going on in sales practices in particular.

<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then also on the deposit side, the decline in the deposit balances itself, can
you give us similar color around the drivers there? How much of that is at all tied to sales practice, if at all, or is it just
other factors that are impacting that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I wouldn't attribute any of the decline to sales practices. I think just – again, the second
quarter tends to have a lot of seasonality in it, particularly on the consumer and the Wells side because folks get their
tax refunds and then they use them. And the tax refunds were delayed a bit this year. And so, I think that they were
probably three weeks to a month delayed and we talked about that in the first quarter. So, actually, I think the deposit
franchise on the consumer side and the Wells side has performed better than what we had expected and better than last
year.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes. So a couple other items and we mentioned them earlier but, in WIM, we had more
customers shifting from cash into investments, so people actually moving out of cash and getting invested. So, those
show up in assets under management on the WIM side.
We also, on any given quarter-end, will have big dates. We'll have big dates for payroll. We'll have big dates for escrow
payments. We'll have big dates for M&A, et cetera. And so, just depending on what day of the week or what deal is
outstanding or what part of the cycle it occurs in, those can be multi-billion dollar swing items at any point in time.
So, as a result, we tend to look at averages more often and, in Q2, we had a record average in deposits. So, that reflects
the whole businesses.
<Q - John Pancari>: All right, that's the color I was looking for. And then separately on the commercial real estate
side, on the lending side, I know you indicated that you're adopting a bit more of a conservative credit discipline there.
Can you talk about what you're seeing? What's making you back off incrementally here? And what areas are you really
stepping back from? Thanks.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I apologize if you took away from my earlier comment that we're adopting a more
conservative tone. We've always been a conservative commercial real estate lender. That's why we have become the
largest commercial real estate lender because you've got to be able to adapt through cycles.
Having said that, from time to time – and again, this can be quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year – there's a fair amount of
competition on stabilized commercial real estate projects. I mean, there's lots of liquidity out there. And so, this quarter
there just happened to be more transactions that we looked at where we said, gosh, the risk return just isn't there. But I
wouldn't describe it – and that's more based on underlying risk return in an individual transaction as opposed to
stepping away from any region or any product type within CRE.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Tim, can you share with us – obviously, you're centralizing a number of the processes as you
guys have described – how you ensure that you maintain the incentives or the entrepreneurial spirit, if you will, of your
people in growing the business? Centralizing could kind of slow down the process for loan approvals and such. Can
you share with us what you're doing to try to prevent that from happening?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think it's a really good question. I mean, if you think about the amount of change that's
happening at the company, there's no question there can be impacts in terms of how we're interacting with our
customers. And the way that you guard against that is that you talk about it a lot. You make sure that when you're, for
example, centralizing all of our HR functions that we've got the right service level understandings between our line
folks and our HR folks whereas we centralize some of our risk functions that we've got an understanding, and then you
encourage folks to provide feedback. You ask our enterprise functions to think about themselves as service providers,
and their customers are the lines of business.
And as you can imagine, you get feedback in terms of decisions you've made and things you've done that in some
places you might go a little bit far, you get that feedback and then you make adjustments. But I think it's making sure
you've got a plan in place, making sure that you've got the right team in place, asking folks to provide a lot of feedback
and then responding to that feedback. And so far, I think we're doing a good job, but it's something we talk about a lot,
Gerard.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes. And one thing I would add is that today the people who have been centralized are
the same people who were serving or working in the business or for the business to be entrepreneurial and get things
done, as you described. The test will be what happens as a generation changes and we have new people who never were
in those business, that are in those centralized roles, and how do we make sure that they provide the same level of
support and service back to the business?
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And, John, with that, is there a timeline? Is it we should know in two years or 18 months that
you've been successful in keeping that entrepreneurial spirit? Or is it further out and it just takes a while before we
really know?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think the timeline is forever.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes, the timeline is forever.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: But just to be clear, you're describing one of the potential vulnerabilities. There is a list
as long as your arm of great things that come out of having pulled together people to provide a common service in a
more effective way which creates better experiences. So, the upside is huge. Not only does it save money, that's a great
plus.
But for all of these things that our businesses were doing for themselves, they weren't doing it at scale, and now we can
provide it at scale with the best tools, the most highly trained people, the deepest bench. It's a benefit. So, I'd encourage
you to think about it that way too.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Sure. And you mentioned, if I heard correctly, that people now digitally can open up accounts
online. What type of loan products can people apply for and get approved for – I'm sorry, not online, through the
mobile app. What type of loan products can people actually apply for through the mobile app? For example, Quicken
Mortgage, your product is in there, if they have the Rocket mortgage that you do through the phone. Are you guys there
yet with that type of product or other loan products where consumers can actually apply and get approved for them
through the mobile device?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So, the short answer is not enough and that was one of the areas that we highlighted at
Investor Day. Within our mortgage business, we're working on our own online capabilities and right now we're piloting
it for our team members and, so far, the response for our team members who are taking our mortgage has been very
good. In fact, it's been much better than what our expectations were.
And so, our plan is then to pilot that for non-team-member customers later in the year and roll it out next year and we
think it'll be a step above anybody else in the market.
On the small business side, I mean you can – if you're a Wells Fargo customer, you can go online and you can open up
or apply for a loan and we'll give you an answer in 45 seconds or 60 seconds or something like that. We have more

work to do from a credit card standpoint. But our goal for over the next couple years is to make sure that, on the
consumer side, all of our products and services are available online and as many as possible on mobile. Probably less
likely mortgage is going to be on mobile, but we're going to improve the capabilities across the board.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. And then just finally, shifting gears on you, on the total loan portfolio, obviously,
year-over-year essentially flat. But one of the growth areas has been your commercial foreign loans. They're up over
10% year over year. Can you share with us where that growth is coming from? Granted, I know it's less than – well
below 10% of total loans, but where is the growth coming from? And second, where do you see that growing to? How
big could that business be since you're seeing some good growth there?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So, Gerard, recall that within our Wholesale Banking business, we have a Global Financial
Institutions business with offices located around the world and we have a real benefit given the quality of our balance
sheet as also the quality of our products and services and team in terms of the relationships that we have with other
financial institutions around the world. They like doing business with us.
And so, in the second quarter, we saw some growth. In the first quarter, we didn't see growth.
In addition, when you think about what our international strategy is, separate from the Global Financial Institutions
business, it's to help our customers when they want to do more business outside the U.S. or help non-U.S. customers do
business here, and we continue to see good benefit from that very focused strategy. We're not trying to be all things to
all people. Bu, gosh, if you look over the last five years or so, I think we've been growing those activities at a kind of
mid double-digit rate.
So, I wouldn't say it's any region around the world in particular or any product set, but think about it as over time in
Global Financial Institution and then in that very targeted global banking strategy.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy A. Bush>: Good morning, guys. How are you?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good.
<Q - Nancy A. Bush>: Yes. A couple of questions back to the sales practices issue. I think you mentioned that you had
preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement. Could you just summarize for us what other suits, issues, et
cetera, that have been publicly disclosed that are out there? Is there anything major that's still outstanding at this point?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, the $142 million settlement that was preliminarily approved by the court, we believe,
addresses the other class action suits that our sales practice is related. I think there are about ten that are out there. So,
we have high expectations that, ultimately, that preliminary approval will become final approval after we execute on
what we agreed to do which, of course, we're going to do that.
In terms of other activities out there, we have consent orders and plans that were for both the OCC and the CFPB that
we need to comply with and we're working very hard to be able to do that. And as has been discussed, there's been –
there's an investigation that's still going on by the justice department and we'll continue to provide more disclosures and
the disclosure of that in the 10-Q and the 10-K but there's nothing really new that's different in the 10-Q as it relates to
other legal matters for sales practices with the exception of the announcement of this preliminary approval from the
court on this settlement.

<Q - Nancy A. Bush>: The CFPB's recent move on arbitration versus class action or versus lawsuits, I'm assuming that
will not be retroactive. Have you had a chance to look at that and see if it's going to have any impact on what happens
going forward?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think that lots of folks have had an opinion on this, and not only in Washington but also
various business groups and so on. I'm not going to opine on the legality or illegality of what they're doing and whether
it's retroactive. I don't think it's retroactive. But I think there's a lot of concern about this decision and I think that – my
guess is that based on the feedback that we'll see legislative or administrative and legal action against it.
<Q - Nancy A. Bush>: Okay. And just finally on the subject, there have been several large municipalities that have
severed relationships with Wells Fargo. I think New York City may have been the last one. You'll have to refresh me
on that. My understanding of this municipalities business is that it's primarily liquidity management. It tends not to be
terribly profitable business, et cetera. Obviously, you don't want to lose it. But I'm just trying to see if there are any
trends that we can track to that right now and where to look on the income statement to see if there is an impact.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. But overall, I think the punch line is that there hasn't been a material impact to the
company for all the decisions made or some of the decisions made by some of our municipal customers. But you're
right, there have been some cities, some states who have put us on a freeze or put us on probation or something for
some period of time because they want to see that we're going to fulfill obligations that we have related to sales
practices, and of course we're going to do that. And our expectation, Nancy, is that we're going to win all that business
back. A great example is the State of California recently who put us on probation, and then we competed very hard and
won some municipal business because we provided the best option for the citizens of California and for the state.
The fact of the matter is that there's a lot of reporting when politicians stand before a podium and talk about how they
want to put a freeze on Wells Fargo for a while. What doesn't get reported is the fact that most of our municipal and
GIB customers are continuing to do business with, they love working at Wells Fargo. And in fact, one example of that
is you saw the growth in balances in the second quarter of $1.1 billion in our Government and Institutional Banking
business. So that business continues to perform well. We're going to win all that business back and we're going to fulfill
the obligations that we have and promises we've made to all those customers.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One nuance to your question, Nancy, you mentioned it tends to be the portion of the
business that's least profitable. Most of these relationships are complex relationships where we're a credit provider.
We're managing their cash because very few institutions can manage liquidity or manage cash like we do. And then we
might also be doing some investing for them or some bond placement for them or some risk management stuff for
them.
And the ones that I've tracked since this has begun, usually we've been, as Tim describes it, put in a box for a year or
for two years on bond underwritings. But they go through a painstaking process to pick their partners on who provides
credit and who manages their cash, and it takes years to switch those things if they decided to, and they have a tendency
not to want to do that. So the core underlying piece of the business tends to be actually quite good.
<Q - Nancy A. Bush>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great, thanks. So I had a quick question. First, I think maybe an easier one on the oil and gas
loan portfolio. I know the reserve is still at almost 8% for the overall portfolio. But given the slight pullback in the oil
prices, could you give us a little bit of color on the portfolio today versus where it was back when it was in the $20s? Is
there an actual number for oil prices per barrel that you get more concerned about your oil book?

Page 19 of 21
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I'll start on your last question first. I wouldn't say there's an exact price. The production
has migrated to the most efficient producer, so whatever that price is that would make people disturbed, it's a lower
price than what you might have thought a couple of years ago. The portfolio overall is now about 1.3% of our total loan
portfolio, $12.7 billion. It's down 10% year over year. We had $20 million of charge-offs in the portfolio this quarter,
which is down $80 million from the prior quarter. Oil and gas non-accruals are at $1.8 billion, down call it $230 million
linked-quarter. Criticized assets are $4.5 billion, down $0.5 billion linked quarter. And the remaining allowance, as you
said, is almost 8% outstanding, so I think we feel good about where we are. We got after this early. We built reserves
against it to what we thought was the right level, and now we're coming out the other side of it.
It's of course more than keeping an eye on the price of crude. This is both an oil and gas business, so we've got
hundreds of professionals in market. We're working with all of our customers all the time to help them manage down
their risk. And it doesn't feel like an area of concern in the resource prices. This is the neighborhood that we're
operating in.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then on the primary consumer checking customers, I know they're still more
opening than closing at this point in time, but the growth rate is still decelerating. So do you have a better handle on
when that will actually start to inflect and see a better growth rate? I know you've done investments and the marketing
spend picked up this year. Is it next quarter we should see that inflect? Is it the fourth quarter? Can you give us some
insight on the timing there?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think it's going to continue to occur over time. I wouldn't say the inflection is tomorrow or a
week from tomorrow or next quarter. I think our expectation is that we're going to continue to grow from the current
levels, and every quarter is a little bit different. But my encouragement of you is to look a year from now and see where
we are.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: A little more context on that metric because we've been pointing towards and relying on
that metric increasingly over the last couple of years. And in the early days of really emphasizing that metric, one of the
things that we were working through was the conversion of customers who were Wells Fargo customers but weren't
primary customers to a primary status by encouraging them to do that, giving them reasons to do it, giving them
capabilities, et cetera, a compelling value proposition. So setting sales practices aside, we had been working through
that stock of people who were already customers but weren't primary.
So in any event, even if we hadn't had sales practices issues, that was going to slow down. Now, we've got the sales
practice issues to recover from, and we also have the fact that we've converted as many or probably as many as are
going to be converted from non-primary status. So it's really going to reflect taking business from other people and
getting more than our fair share of new household formation or new bank customer formation as it happens over time.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Perfect, thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Marty.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hi, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I want to talk about mortgage banking. It used to be a real
powerhouse for Wells Fargo. And a couple years ago at Investor Day, we actually had the head of Mortgage Banking
talking about how it was about to finally turn the corner after we come out of this financial crisis. And here we have a
seasonal quarter where you should have seen an uptick, and we actually had Treasury rates falling, which should've
been a better delivery quarter, but yet margins fell off. So just the innate trends and metrics of the business just don't
seem to be working the way that I have grown used to it in my history. So I was just interested to see how you think

about the business. And how do we get this thing turned around?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Marty, I might push back just a bit, and that is that one of the decisions that we've made over
the last few years is to make sure that we're building this business for the long term and to eliminate any portions of the
business that we would describe as providing additional amounts of risk. So we got out of wholesale funding or
wholesale mortgage. We've got out of reverse mortgages. We exited the direct FHA business because of the potential
liabilities. And so during the period that you were describing, what we've been trying to do is really build the business
for the long term.
We've made most of all those changes. And now as we look toward the future, we think it's really critical to make sure
that we've got, for example, that online product that Gerard had asked about in which we're in the process of and it will
be rolling out next year. And our expectation is that we will continue to grow this business.
In the short term, as John mentioned, what happened this quarter was just that the mix between correspondent and
direct shifted a little bit. But also remember in the background that because of the size of our servicing book, in periods
where there's a lot of refinance activity, we get a disproportionate amount of share relative to the rest of the industry,
proportionate for us. So, I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business. There's huge opportunities here.
There's huge opportunities to grow the first mortgage business. There's huge opportunities to grow the second mortgage
business and Franklin and the team are very focused on that.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One more thing I'd add, Marty, that doesn't show up in the mortgage banking line item
but we're making non-conforming prime jumbo mortgage loans hand over fist for our best customers and they show up
on our balance sheet. So, they contribute to net interest income but they don't flow through the mortgage banking line
item the same way.
And so, we think of the business as the combination of those things. Some of it has shifted because of our emphasis on
higher credit quality and that loan balance cut off – puts those on our books. So, there's a variety of things all derisking.
And the last thing I'd say is that, as I mentioned, for those loans that are on our books and we're the biggest mortgage
lender, we had a net recovery in credit in the quarter. So, we like the credit profile, what we're putting on our books as
well.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Yes. And so, really it's holding more on the balance sheet as well as like you were saying kind of
retooling the business. So, this should be the kind of basing of that and we should hopefully begin to see some
improvement in the market and the business now being able to improve from here. So, that hopefully will be what we'll
see over the next couple years.
The other thing I want to ask you about was when I looked at your deposit rates, what would be your MMDA or kind
of the savings a money market savings align where the majority of your deposits are, the rate has done really well. It
had an increase of several base of points.
The line right above it, which is really the checking account, has been going up almost with the Fed fund rate. So, it's
somewhat surprising that your checking account is going up faster than your savings account. So, there has to be kind
of an anomaly in that account. Is that just more corporate related? Is that how you classify it? I'm just curious why that
rate is moving up so fast.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: That's more commercial and corporate related. On the consumer side, because of the service
convenience that we can provide, as we've talked about in the past, we're trying not to compete on price and that's what
you're seeing across the rest of the industry. I think the growth that you're seeing is primarily on the commercial and
corporate side, particularly medium and larger corporates, some financial institution were candidly – it's much more
price sensitive. It has still been increasing at less than the rise in short-term rates but that's what explains it.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And the checking account is just more – is that more treasury type of products in that where you
actually show interest-bearing checking as that first line on that supplement?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: They're indexed to a variety of things but...
