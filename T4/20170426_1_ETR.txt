And now, I will turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a good start to another important year
for Entergy as we build on the momentum of last year's achievements that have made us a stronger company. We
continue to make significant progress to transform our generation portfolio, reduce the risk in our merchant power
business, and invest in our core utility business.
In fact, this quarter, we accomplished everything in our plan to achieve our objectives. The Indian Point settlement that
we announced in January is being implemented on the agreed upon schedule. We completed the sale of FitzPatrick to
Exelon Generation. We filed for regulatory approval to transfer Vermont Yankee. We received a final order in our
transmission cost recovery factor filing in Texas. We filed our annual FRP with forward-looking features in
Mississippi. We finalized renewable RFP selections in Arkansas and Louisiana. And today, we are reporting first
quarter operational earnings per share of $0.99.
These results are in line with our expectations for the quarter and we are on track to achieve our full year guidance.
That's a validation of the disciplined execution of our strategy to reposition our company for steady predictable growth
in earnings and dividends. Moody's, following on the actions taken by S&P last year has recently upgraded our issuer
rating to Baa2 from Baa3.
Turning to slide 3, this quarter we reached milestones to further reduce the risk in our merchant power business. The
sale of FitzPatrick to Exelon Generation marks the culmination of months of preparation by employees from both
companies to ensure a seamless transfer of the plant and its approximately 600 employees. And more importantly,
FitzPatrick will continue to generate carbon free electricity for more than 800,000 homes and businesses in its region.
The FitzPatrick transaction is another important achievement in our planned orderly wind down of EWC. We will
manage our organization each step of the way so that the level of overhead that remains after we end merchant nuclear
operations in 2021 encompasses only what is reasonable and necessary to operate our business going forward.
At Indian Point, we are working towards license renewal with the NRC and we are meeting all critical milestones
outlined in the terms of our settlement with New York. Specifically, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation has issued a final Water Quality Certificate and final water discharge permit. New York State and
Riverkeeper have withdrawn their remaining contentions before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the Board
has terminated the proceeding.
Pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, the New York Department of State has issued its concurrence with our
consistency certification filing and all pending court litigation related to Indian Point license renewal has been
dismissed. Let me repeat that: all pending court litigation related to Indian Point license renewal has been dismissed.
And we expect the license renewal to be issued in 2018.
At Vermont Yankee, we filed with the NRC this quarter and with the Vermont Public Service Board last December for
approval to transfer the plant, its decommissioning trust and its decommissioning obligation to NorthStar. We've
requested the NRC's approval by the end of this year and the Public Service Board's in the first quarter of next year.
Finally, at Palisades, the Michigan Public Service Commission has scheduled hearings for June 13 through June 16 on
Consumer Energy's petition for approval of the early termination of the PPA. The Commission is targeting its decision
by August 31. As a reminder, Palisades and Pilgrim have begun their final refueling and maintenance outages.
For Utility, Parent & Other, we continue to make strides towards delivering on our earnings outlook for 2017 and
beyond. After receiving approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in November, we broke ground on
construction of the St. Charles CCGT project, which we expect to come online in 2019 as scheduled.

We also have applications pending for construction of the Lake Charles CCGT in Louisiana and the Montgomery
County Power Station in Texas. Procedural schedules have been set and we expect decisions from regulators in the
third and fourth quarters of this year respectively.
In New Orleans, we requested a temporary suspension of the procedural schedule for approval of the New Orleans
Power Station. We requested the suspension to accommodate consideration by all the parties of our latest load forecast
and the implications if any it would have on the project.
Last week, we filed a status report with the New Orleans City Council informing the parties that by late June or early
July we expect to make a supplemental and alternative filing that will include a peaking resource with a lower capacity.
The filing will also include testimonies setting forth a firm commitment for Entergy New Orleans to pursue
construction of up to 100 megawatts of renewable resources to serve New Orleans. We plan to continue pursuing
certification for the original project given its many benefits, but will present a smaller resource for alternative
consideration by the City Council.
Today, I am pleased to announce that Entergy Louisiana recently signed a purchase and sale agreement with Calpine
Corporation for the acquisition of a peaking plant. Calpine will construct a plant which will consist of two natural
gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total normal capacity of approximately 360 megawatts. The plant, named the
Washington Parish Energy Center, will be located in Bogalusa, Louisiana and is expected to be completed in 2021.
This agreement is another step in our broader portfolio transformation efforts to replace aging units with cleaner, more
efficient generation for the benefit of our customers.
We also are making progress towards the deployment of our advanced meters in our service territory. Our advanced
metering infrastructure project and associated regulatory approvals remain on schedule. Working with vendors, we are
in the early stages of implementing the IT infrastructure needed to support meter deployment and developing the
logistical plan for that deployment.
Regulatory filings were made in 2016 in four jurisdictions. Procedural schedules are now set and hearings are
scheduled for the third quarter of this year. In Texas, legislation was introduced in the current session to clarify the
applicability of existing advanced meter regulation to Entergy Texas. We expect to file our deployment plan with the
PUCT by the fourth quarter. Following regulatory decisions and initial implementation of the communications network
starting in 2018, we anticipate initiating meter deployment in 2019.
Finally, Mississippi welcomed the news of Grand Gulf's 20-year license renewal with numerous local and state officials
recognizing Grand Gulf's strong community support and the plant's positive impact to the state and local economy. In
March, celebratory events were held, which Governor Bryant presented a supportive proclamation declaring March 6,
2017 as Grand Gulf's Day.
On the regulatory front, with progressive constructs in most of our jurisdictions, we are carrying out our rhythm of
annual formula rate plan filings and other riders. EMI continues to utilize its formula rate plan with forward-looking
features and made its annual filing on March 15. The filing reflects no changes in rates with an earned ROE of 9.72%,
within the allowed range. A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter.
In March, the Texas commission approved a $19 million annual increase to ETI's transmission cost recovery factor.
The settlement reflects $286 million in incremental transmission investment since ETI's last rate case proceeding. Use
of this rider, along with the distribution cost recovery factor, provides greater financial flexibility to support the needs
of customers in Texas.
Our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. The success of our business is dependent on making
sure that the communities we serve are thriving. We remain committed to the economic development of our region
through our $5 million five-year workforce development initiative. In partnership with the Texas Workforce
Commission in March, we announced $600,000 in grants to support workforce readiness in Southeast Texas. The
grants will support programs at community college and high schools to equip individuals to step into high demand,
good paying jobs.

We also renewed our partnership with Jobs for America's Graduates with a grant that will help at-risk students in
Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi stay in school and graduate on time. All of these initiatives are focused on creating
a competitive advantage for our communities in helping them attract new industry to the area.
We are pleased to have been recognized through several awards for our corporate stewardship and community
development. For example, in recognition of our employees' emergency preparedness and response after major events,
we received the Edison Electric Institute's Emergency Recovery Award for outstanding power restoration efforts on
behalf of our customers; and the Emergency Assistance Award for helping other utility companies recover from
Hurricane Matthew. This marks the 19th consecutive year EEI has awarded Entergy a national storm restoration award.
Recently, we were also included in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
This is the 8th time we've been named to this list, which recognizes companies taking responsible actions in employee
relations, philanthropy and community support, environment, and climate change, which is a good segue into the
administration's recent executive order around promoting energy independence, which includes a review of carbon
regulation.
In light of the order, I will highlight Entergy's position as one of the cleanest generating fleets in the United States. A
principal objective of our strategy is to remain an environmentally sustainable fleet for the communities we serve and
to continue to prepare the company for operations under any type of carbon emission cost that may accrue in the future.
According to the 2016 Benchmarking Air Emissions report authored by M.J. Bradley & Associates, Entergy produces
fewer CO2 emissions per megawatt hour than 78 of the top 100 power producers. Our emissions rates for 2015 and
2016 across our entire fleet were 540 pounds and 590 pounds per megawatt hour, respectively. This is well below the
1,000 pounds per megawatt hour standard issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in previous administration
for a new, highly efficient combined cycle natural gas unit. Thus, we consider our environmental strategy to be aligned,
both with global ambitions for a transition to a low carbon economy and with our commitment to provide reliable, low
cost electricity to our customers.
Preparation for this transition began when we were the first U.S. utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing CO2
emissions in 2001. 10 years later, our commitment went beyond merely stabilizing CO2 emissions. In 2011, our
Environment 2020 commitment included a voluntary pledge that through the year 2020 we would maintain our carbon
dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels.
I'm pleased to report that we are meeting our commitments. And in 2016, our CO2 emissions were approximately 20%
below our year 2000 emissions. Due to the challenging economics of relying on renewable resources in our geographic
footprint, we are meeting our goals through a combination of methods. For example, we are replacing older, less
efficient legacy units with cleaner, more efficient resources. Highly efficient combined cycle power stations, such as St.
Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, will produce up to 40% fewer carbon emissions and improve our average
fleet efficiency by roughly 800 BTUs per kilowatt hour.
Nuclear generation is also an important source of clean, reliable, baseload power. And prudently investing to preserve
these valuable resources for our stakeholders is an important part of our strategy. Our planned investments in new
technologies to modernize our grid such as advanced meters will further improve efficiency and reliability.
On top of that, we are actively working to deploy and incorporate cost effective opportunities to expand our use of
renewables, including distributed energy resources. These will allow us to improve supply reliability and control costs
for our customers and further reduce greenhouse gas emissions as the economics, performance and reliability of
resources continue to improve.
We are committed to working with our regulators, customers, and other stakeholders to consider all proven
technologies. We provide additional information about these efforts in our standard reporting, including in this year's
integrated report, which is available on our website. While it is too early to comment on the specific impacts of the
recent executive order, we remain committed to developing an electric generating and delivery system that is well
positioned for operations in a carbon-constrained economy, whatever that may look like.

I'm pleased with all that we've achieved to-date in 2017 and I see great things for Entergy this year and beyond. With
critical decisions behind us, we now have good clarity on the plan we need to execute to achieve our results in the next
five years.
We now know the timing and the sequencing of the wind down of our merchant operations. We have time to manage
the overhead costs associated with the exit from that business and we have a firm goal to minimize overall cash flow
impacts.
At Utility, we've identified the projects that we need to support our goals in that business and we have the regulatory
constructs and relationships in place to facilitate the growth of our core business through these infrastructure
investments for the benefit of our customers. And while we recognize there is still much to do, our accomplishments so
far are a confirmation that we have the right strategy, leadership and workforce to deliver on our operational plan and
financial outlooks.
Now before I close, I'd like to recognize the very valued and significant contributions of Theo Bunting who is on his
last earnings call with us before he officially retires. He has been an incredible leader, mentor and colleague at Entergy
for nearly 34 years. His deep knowledge and experience in both the industry and the business have been key to our
success today.
Personally, I have worked with Theo almost every day since I came to Entergy 18 years ago. While it goes without
saying that his knowledge and counsel have been invaluable. I cannot imagine where I or any of the rest of us would be
without his support and friendship. My appreciation for all he has done for me and for Entergy is only matched by my
best wishes for his health and happiness as he and [ph] Toby (17:11) enter the next chapter of their lives.
And now I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo and good morning, everyone. As Leo said, we continue to execute on our strategy and we are on track
to achieve our 2017 guidance.
Let's get straight to the first quarter numbers starting with slide 4. On the left, Entergy's as-reported earnings of $0.46
included special items related to decisions to sell or close EWC's nuclear plants, including the sale of FitzPatrick. These
special items reduced earnings by $0.53. On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $0.99 per share as
compares to $1.35 a year ago.
Utility, Parent & Other results are summarized on slide 5. Operational earnings were $0.62 and adjusted earnings were
$0.83. Weather is estimated to have reduced operational earnings by $0.16. Adjusted earnings were $0.12 lower than
the first quarter 2016. This result is in line with our expectations. Although Residential and Commercial sales were
below our plan, our new – or excuse me, our non-fuel O&M was also lower.
Net revenue was higher from new rates to recover productive investments which benefit customers. Over the past 12
months, we've had a number of rate actions across utility operating companies from rate cases, FRPs and riders,
including for last year's Union acquisition. One that became effective this year was Entergy Arkansas 2017 test year
FRP rate change. Despite a steady growth in customer count, we experienced a decline in combined Residential and
Commercial sale to 3.1% on a weather adjusted basis. One factor was that last year was a leap year, which means we
had an extra billing day in 2016 and that accounts for about one-third of the change.
In addition, our service territory experienced the mildest first quarter in over a 120 years of recorded temperature
history. During periods of abnormal weather conditions such as this, it can be difficult to capture the effects of weather
on Residential and Commercial sales.
Looking on a longer term basis, the 12 months ending Residential and Commercial sales declined about 1%. While we
are closely monitoring customer usage going forward, it is worth noting that the projects that we have identified in our
capital plan are driven by customer reliability and aging infrastructure replacement needs and not by occasionally

volatile quarterly sales.
In the Industrial segment, sales growth was positive, as continued growth from new and expansion customers was
somewhat offset by lower sales to existing customers. For new and expansion customers growth came from the primary
metals, industrial gases and chlor-alkali segments. The decline in sales to existing customers was driven by refinery
outages. This is consistent with our expectations as I noted on our last quarterly call. Refiners are starting to come out
of their outages now, crack spreads are currently high, and we expect these customers to run strong in the second half
of this year.
Non-fuel O&M increased $0.20 quarter-over-quarter. There were several drivers including a beneficial cost deferral
recorded last year in connection with the EAI rate case order, which reduced 2016 O&M by about $0.06.
Non-nuclear generation expenses were higher primarily due to a full quarter of Union costs. Nuclear operation
spending also increased as expected, while spending and support of ANO inspection activities was lower.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on slide 6, operational earnings were $0.37 in the current quarter,
$0.14 lower than the prior year. FitzPatrick accounted for $0.06 of the $0.14 decline. Excluding FitzPatrick, the other
key driver was net revenue, due primarily to lower prices. The price variance was partially offset by lower fuel expense
attributable to impairments.
As you know, Indian Point Unit 3 is in the midst of its refueling and maintenance outage, which includes the baffle bolt
inspection. We will replace 270 bolts. That work is underway and we expect the plant to be back online by the end of
May.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow this quarter of $529 million, essentially flat to first quarter of 2016. Reduced cash
flow from the timing of recovery for fuel and purchased power at the Utility and lower operational net revenue at EWC
were largely offset by positive cash flow from income taxes and reduced spending of Vermont Yankee
decommissioning.
Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance ranges, which are summarized on slide 8. We continue to expect
Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS to come in around the midpoint of our range. Even though first quarter weather
adjusted Residential and Commercial sales were lower than planned, non-fuel O&M is tracking favorable to our
guidance assumption due to effective cost management.
For our consolidated guidance, the negative weather to-date has caused us to move below midpoint expectations. But
it's still early in the year, and weather could turn around over the remainder of the year. There are other risks and
opportunities that could apply to both Utility, Parent & Other, as well as Entergy overall such as keeping more of the
O&M benefits in the first quarter and capturing additional nuclear decommissioning trust benefits as we rebalance the
portfolio due to the equity market rally.
Separately, which we mentioned on our last quarterly call, is a potential for an income tax item at EWC, possibly as
early as the second quarter this year. If that does materialize at a magnitude similar to or slightly larger than last year,
we will shift our consolidated operational guidance accordingly. Would not change our adjusted UP&O guidance.
Moving to the longer term view, slide 9 shows our adjusted UP&O outlook, which is unchanged. We are also updating
our EWC EBITDA outlook on slide 10. We still see the free cash flow out of that business is relatively neutral through
2021 excluding any potential contributions to decommissioning trusts. And our goal to get to completely cash natural
remains achievable.
Although it is a separate analysis, we submitted the most recent NRC financial assurance filings on March 31 which
indicated that no NDT's had a deficit. Summaries of these filings are included in the appendix of our webcast
presentation.
Our cash and credit metrics are shown on slide 11. As you can see, parent debt to total debt is higher than our targeted
range. We expect this to turn around and end the year near the top of our targeted range, or about 20%. Looking further
out, we still expect the parent debt ratio decline to the 22% to 23% range in 2019. This is consistent with our estimates

last fall. We continue to look for opportunities to become more efficient with our capital and O&M spending.
In January, Moody's upgraded Entergy Mississippi to A2 to recognize improvements in the company's formula rate
plan and expectations for improved cash flow metrics. And as Leo mentioned, earlier this month, Moody's upgraded
Entergy Corporation's issuer rating to Baa2, matching our upgrade to BBB+ with Standard & Poor's last summer. Both
actions are the result of our efforts to improve our business risk profile by focusing on our core Utility business and
winding down our merchant business. As a reminder, we remain on positive outlook from Standard & Poor's from
earlier this year.
Our strategy to achieve the goals laid out for each of our four stakeholders remains the same as we focus on steady
predictable earnings and dividend growth from our core Utility business. Meanwhile, we're continuing to manage risks
throughout the company including the orderly wind down of our merchant business.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Turner with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Turner>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Turner>: Drew, in your comments you mentioned that there is the leap day in the first quarter as
well as the extreme weather which impact normalization calculations on year end. But at this time can you say that
your full year 2017 normalized guidance is still appropriate? And secondarily, when you look across the different new
projects that you are working on in terms of utility generation, is there any other pushback in terms of the need for
those plants, like you've seen so far in New Orleans?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: All right, this is Drew. I'll take the first one and I'll hand over the second part of that
question to Rod. So at this point, obviously if nothing changes – we haven't updated our expectations for second quarter
and third quarter and fourth quarter to be higher than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, so all else being
equal, we would be probably slightly below where we initially anticipated the year. But it's still early in the year. So I
think it's still premature for us to make any changes as to what our expectations would be for the full year. And I'll turn
the rest over to Rod.
<A - Roderick K. West>: And as it relates to the rest of the supply plan, keep in mind that the rationale behind the
supply plan was not primarily driven by point-of-view on load. In New Orleans for instance, out of a sense of
transparency, we actually brought the change in our 30-year load forecast to the attention of the stakeholders, or again,
just to be transparent. But the rationale behind the investment is still very much intact. We've not seen across the
jurisdictions any response or opposition to our plans based solely on the load or sales forecast.
Keep in mind that the load is different from the sales forecast, and I think that's a distinction we need to keep in mind as
well as we look at the rest of our generation portfolio. But the answer to your question is, we are still – we have not
seen any additional pushback throughout the rest of the jurisdictions.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: And Chris, this is Leo. I'll just jump in as well. From a strategy standpoint, as Rod mentioned,
we've got an aging infrastructure in terms of our fleet and locational issues as it relates to what we need to build from a
generation standpoint. New Orleans, for example, there is no generation inside the City of New Orleans, and part of the
need for that in addition to meeting peak demand is to be able to supply the system should we have some sort of storm
that comes through and knocks out transmission infrastructure, which has happened in the past.

So, that's a locational issue. Same with some of the other plants we've got the need because of the fact that we went into
all of this transformation short to begin with. But add to that the first quarter weather-adjusted sales is just an anomaly.
As you know, weather normalization in these things are really mathematical algorithms that work well in most cases.
But I think Drew mentioned that this was the most mild winter in terms of degree days in the history of recording
degree days, 120 years or something like that. So, that's really not cause for any kind of an alarm in terms of what's
going on long term.
<Q - Christopher Turner>: Okay. Great. Thanks for all that color. And then switching gears to EWC, I think on the
last call you commented on cash flow being pretty negative this year because of some outages and then slowly getting
better into the early part of next decade when Indian Point shuts down. Can you just give us your latest thoughts there?
And then, in particular, I'm interested if there has been any advancements with your potential offsetting cost cuts to
some of that cash outflow?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. This is Drew. And in terms of the overall forecast at this point, Chris, I think it's
essentially the same as it was before. We still have all of the outages this year and so that's pretty expensive, but we're
anticipating pretty strong cash flow generation through the next periods, primarily because we won't be paying for
another refueling outage at each of the plants – well, I should say, Pilgrim and Palisades. We will be doing one more at
Indian Point for each of those units and then those two units would have better cash flow generation as they ramp down
into 2020 and 2021.
So, from an overall cash flow perspective, at this point, it's still about the same. But in regards to, I guess, your second
question, are we making any progress, I would say, absolutely. Internally, we've been scrubbing the numbers down
hard and so we would hope to show you some specific progress over the balance of the year to demonstrate that we are
closing that gap and meeting that objective that Leo talked about in his script of getting to cash flow neutral.
<Q - Christopher Turner>: Okay. Great.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Cash flow – let me just clarify, cash flow neutral. Overall, I think from an operational cash
flow perspective, we're already at neutral, it's just the NDTs that we're working on. And in addition to the operational
piece, we're also working on transactions there as well.
<Q - Christopher Turner>: Okay. So that cash flow neutral number is all-in including the decommissioning trusts
over the five- or six-year period?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. Our goal is zero, including the decommissioning trusts, through 2021. Right now, our
forecast has essentially zero, operationally, not including the trust over that same timeframe.
<Q - Christopher Turner>: Okay. Got you. Thanks, Drew.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.

reminder of where you are on moving towards getting some of this rolled into rate?

<A - A. Christopher Bakken>: In terms of the nuclear sustainability plan, we remain on track. We're going to
continue to make improvements in the performance of our fleet and improve our regulatory margins. So, I would
characterize this straightforward as on track.
<A - Roderick K. West>: All right, Jonathan, it's Rod. In terms of the timing, we expect to make a filing on this
coming Friday, day after tomorrow, with the APSC, formally seeking to reconcile the nuclear cost adjudication with
our formula rate plan filing in July. So we can handle the nuclear cost conversation in conjunction with the FRP. And
nothing has changed in terms of our point of view on the recoverability of those costs. We think the facts support the
finding that the costs we're seeking recovery are consistent with what you heard over the last several quarters with
Chris. And that is – and Leo made reference to it – the costs associated with people, with improving the equipment in
the plant to preserve those assets and the benefits for customers. And so, we feel comfortable that the evidence will
support a finding of continued recovery, not just of the costs that are in question for purposes of the 2016 or 2017
forward test year, but the actual 2018 forward-looking test year we'll file in July.
So, no change there, and again a consistent message around what we are seeking recovery of. I will note that the cost
associated with the FRP filing and what we expect to file on overall nuclear costs in July do not include costs
associated with regulatory oversight or state or things of that nature. So, it's pretty much a clean nuclear cost, cost to
run and operate the plant through and beyond the expected life of those assets.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And the outstanding issue from the 2017 Arkansas FRP is still sort of pending a
schedule, is that correct?
<A - Roderick K. West>: That's what – that's what I was referring to when I said we'll make a filing on Friday to join
or conjoin those issues from a timing standpoint at Arkansas. So the outstanding issue that you made reference to, that's
what – that's the subject of the filing we'll make on Friday, where we'll formally ask the APSC, let's handle it all in
conjunction with the planned FRP filing in July.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. So, take it out of the old one and put it into the new one effectively?
<A - Roderick K. West>: That – I think that's fair.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, a quick first question on the Utility side. Obviously, AMI is the big program you
guys ramping up here for. Can you discuss a little bit of the precedence in Louisiana and Arkansas with respect to
perhaps peers and just some of the nuance you might expect as you move through the process there?
And then I suppose specifically on Texas, obviously it seems like you guys are looking to file later this year. Any
reason for kind of the shifted schedule and what potential size of the program that might be? And the further detail
would be just, is that already encompassed within your CapEx program?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: The – I want to make sure, that I'm – I deal with the question in order. And you may have to
re-ask the last part.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: No, no. Please.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: On AMI, we have filed for – we've made the AMI filings in every jurisdiction except for Texas.
And we're trying to address some legislative prerequisites, so we can do that – do Texas as well. And we expect
resolution of the formal AMI filings by year end. In terms of precedent with other jurisdictions, I think the timing of
both the conditions precedent to deployment, that is the deployment of workforce management system, the asset
management systems and the actual timeline of our 2019 deployment comes from the experiences we've gathered,
lessons learned from other jurisdictions who have gone down this path before.
And the message that's consistent across each of our filings in jurisdictions is that our objective is to have the benefits
to our customers of AMI deployment be available to them in addition to our benefits at the time we put those assets into
service. And so that affects our plan regarding the timing of deployment. And again, that message is consistent across
the rest of the jurisdictions. The third question I need you to repeat, so I make sure I am answering it.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: That – the last one is the easy one. With respect to taxes, obviously you haven't
formally filed, but have you baked into your expectations in CapEx something in there for when you do likely
eventually file?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes. Yes. Our plan includes – the capital plan includes the Texas AMI filing as well. The
threshold issue for us was making sure we had legislative and regulatory mechanisms and approvals setup. And so we
had to take care of that with the legislative session. We've had some support on the Senate side of the Texas legislature.
We are awaiting word on the House legislation that would authorize us and PUCT to go down that path. But the answer
to your question is yes.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And let me just give one point of clarity on that. So, our capital plan, Julien, is through 2019,
mostly includes corporate wide efforts; communications, IT platforms, that kind of thing that would support the scaling
of Texas when it comes in. And then, beyond our capital plan would be maybe more Texas-specific meter deployment
and stuff like that, that would be – so maybe starting in 2019, but certainly going into 2020 and 2021.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. Excellent. Just a quick clarification on the prior. You obviously – were talking
about a cash flow sort of breakeven target for the business overall – or the EWC side. Can you just elaborate a little bit
on what you expect the ongoing impact to operational earnings or can you remind us how we are thinking about that
through the period and specifically in the later years how we should think about operational versus non-operational
items on earnings?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: You're talking about 2017 through 2021?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yeah. Or specifically, so kind of like an ongoing, right? I understand that obviously...
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah, on an ongoing – yes, on an ongoing basis, once we get the plants to shutdown status
and we are – and removed in the decommissioning activities or the plants have been taken off our balance sheet like the
VY type transaction, we would expect to be essentially flat at EWC. Part of that is, next year, there is an accounting
rule change that we anticipate around how you account for nuclear decommissioning trust earnings and that would give
us an opportunity to not just realize gains that – we have realized gains show up on our income statement, but actually
mark-to-market the growth in the trust over time on the equity side.
And the effect is going to – we typically see about 6.25% of returns in the decommissioning trust, but you only
recognize in the income statement about 3%. And when you kind of close that gap, it starts to close the gap to the ARO
liability, the Asset Retirement Obligation liability that's out there and the amortization of that. So, once you get out to
2022, it's about flat.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. So to be clear, it's effectively zero for the cumulative cash flow and flat on
an earnings base?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Beyond 2022 – starting 2022 and beyond, yes.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yes, indeed. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys. I hate to do this. I kind of want to come back to the demand question. Can you
remind me for Residential and Small Commercial demand, what is in your 2017 guidance and your multi-year guidance
in terms of the assumption for just kind of – weather-normal growth there?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I'm sorry, Michael, could you repeat that question?
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Sure. What's in your 2017 guidance and your multi-year guidance for weather normalized
growth for Residential and Small Commercial?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: For Residential and Small Commercial it's about – it's almost zero. In fact I think if you – we
only put out till 2017, but if you went out to 2020, 2021, it's actually slightly negative. As you see automated meters
coming online and customers realizing the benefits associated with that, one of the benefits is lower expected demand.
And so we actually see negative growth over sort of a five-year period.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. And then, how – when we think about industrial demand growth – because your
forecast, pretty robust, 3%, and there's a lot going on obviously in East Texas and in Louisiana with the petchem
industries. But just curious how sensitive your supply needs are to kind of like every percent change in that. Meaning,
if it turns out to be, I don't know, closer to what you've seen more recently, closer to 2% or even a little less than that,
does that significantly influence how much new capacity you need to build or buy?
<A - Roderick K. West>: Michael, this is Rod. I think I want to reiterate here that the driver behind our capacity needs
is not so much driven by my assumptions around low growth although it's precedented. And that low growth certainly
helps offset the impact of those capital additions on customer rates. The driver – the primary driver locationally might
be around the specific needs of Industrial siding in the region. But it's really around modernizing the grid and fleet and
responding to retirements of aging assets. And that represents the lion's share of the generation and transmission
investment in the region, driven less so by assumptions on overall industrial load.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And let me add. This is Drew. Let me just add that we do still see positive industrial growth
out through our forecast period and beyond. And a lot of that industrial growth is based upon projects that we see
coming up and under construction right now over the next few years. And we've actually seen a bit of a pick-up
recently here on some of the petrochem, chemical industries and other things getting to their financial decision points
on whether they are going to go forward with their projects.
So we are still seeing good, positive demand growth in the Industrial space. And that is offsetting the Residential and
Commercial piece that we were talking about earlier. So even though that part looks like it's kind of flat over the next
few years, we do still see overall expected growth in our business.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. And finally, on Indian Point, when does the State need to tell you guys whether they
could potentially need Indian Point past the 2020, 2021 retirement date? Meaning, I know the original agreement left
room for the plant to operate through about 2024, 2025, but a lot of that is kind based on the ISOs and the State's
potential views on whether it needs it or not. When do they need to tell you guys? When do you need to know?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Michael we – this is Drew. We have to make a filing with New York, a formal filing with
the ISO and that will allow them to make the assessment about Indian Point and when it's going away and how they
would deal with that.
We were working with the ISO. We expect to make that filing later this year, and once we do make that filing, I think
there is a statutory 90-day timeline associated with the analysis that they would do and come up with a formal
recommendation. But certainly, they are aware of it and – but that process will get kicked off later this year.

<Q - Michael Lapides>: Okay. And if the ISO comes back and says, hey, actually for local reliability purposes we
need one or both of the units beyond 2020, 2021, what happens?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. Well, if they – first of all, if they said that there was a challenge that they needed to
solve, that there was some operational system issue that they would need to solve, they would need to go through a
process that would identify the best way for them to solve it. And it wouldn't necessarily mean keeping Indian Point
online. It could mean we need to upgrade a transmission line or we need to get a peaker in, in some place or something
like that.
So, depending on the nature of the issue they identify, there could be a lot of potential solutions. And their objective
would be to go find the most economic one that solves their problem. If, for some reason, nothing else matters until you
get down to Indian Point, well, then we would need to work with the state to figure out how we would move towards
something different beside 2020 and 2021.
So, it's not unilateral if they can't tell us to do it. They have to work with us on it, but certainly we don't want to create a
reliability problem in the State of New York either. So, we would work with them on that. But it seems unlikely to us
that it would get to the point where they would need Indian Point to stay online at this point. It seems likely to us that
they're going to find a different solution that will be more economic than keeping the plant online.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.

Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: You're there, Shar?
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Yeah. Sorry about that. I apologize. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: When we've discussed in the past, I think we've talked about sort of the Arkansas prudency
review, a separate procedural schedule, but now it sort of looks like it's going to be rolled into a larger one. Is that – any
signal on why that wasn't separated? Is it a function of the fact that the original prudency review was small and it made
sense to roll it into a joint proceeding? Just a little bit of clarity there would help.
<A - Roderick K. West>: Shar, it's Rod. I think about it as the nature of the cost. We have maintained all along that; 1)
we weren't seeking separate recovery mechanism for recovery of the nuclear costs, because those costs were consistent
with our objective to maintain those assets and the benefits that accrue to customers. And so, as we think about what's
going – what was going to happen in July anyway with the formula rate plan filing and our forward-looking test year, it
made sense for us to – from our vantage point, given that the APSC had not set a separate docket, procedural schedule
to go ahead and address it all in conjunction with the FRP. So neither we, nor the APSC had to deal with essentially
ongoing normalized nuclear spend in two separate dockets with nuclear and the rest of ANO. And so, it simply made
sense to us. And because of the ex parte rules, we weren't allowed to really have conversations with the commission.
And so, on Friday, we'll look to affirm and clarify that point of view that it makes sense to handle them both at the
same time.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on sort of the pending – sorry, if I missed this, but on
the decommissioning expense, the activities, the sale potential for Pilgrim and Palisades. Is there sort of any update
there and, eventually, could we see the same process with Indian Point?

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's Drew, Shar. Yes. So, we are continuing to make progress on this. These are pretty
complicated transactions. We're working through the Vermont Yankee one right now at the Public Service Board in
Vermont. And it is a first of the kind process and it's very complicated and they're taking their time. They're very active
in engaging process and so we are answering all their questions and expect to get through that sometime in early 2018.
That's sort of setting the table for Pilgrim and Palisades and we are certainly learning from Vermont Yankee, as we go
along. But we are making progress and it is two plants instead of one. Hopefully, by the end of the year or around there,
we get to a point where we're ready to bring a transaction forward and that satisfies all the stakeholders.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And then Indian Point, yes. I was going to add that we are definitely planning on looking at
something similar for Indian Point once we get down the road a little further.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it. And then just your cash flow picture, assuming you exit all of the decommissioning
activities, are you still neutral or is there an opportunity to be slightly positive?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: There could be an opportunity to be slightly positive. The objective of getting to cash flow
neutral includes operational elements. While we're still operating, it includes some of these transactions. So if we were
– if we hit a homerun, we could certainly get to positive over the – through 2021, over the four-plus year period.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it. Thanks. And Theo, congrats on the retirement. Even though I think you're too

And next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Hi, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Praful.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: First question, just going back to the decommissioning part, it sounds like in the base case plan,
there is some funding required for decommissioning which you're trying to overcome with O&M and cost savings. Just
firstly, wanted to figure out what's driving that? And secondly, what's the variability around it? Is site-specific review is
going to potentially increase that or decrease that? And Drew, you mentioned just hitting a homerun. Like, what are the
variables that can allow you to hit that homerun, I guess?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, if you look at – I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have our quarterly or, I
guess, annual testing on the – first, the NRC minimums for the decommissioning trust. And we passed all of those that
we submitted in March without having to post any additional information. It is when we get to the actual shutdown
analysis, which is the very detailed decommissioning estimates, and they call that the post shutdown decommissioning
activity support, we have to file that with the NRC within a certain amount of time after we actually shutdown the
plant. When we do that – that's actually a little different than the NRC minimums: the NRC minimums are somewhat
formulaic.

So, with all of the extra detail and the studies that we've done, we expect that there could be the potential to put in a
little bit more money at a couple of the plants. And we're working through that right now. We have our own estimates
for working through the estimates that our potential counterparties may have in the potential sale of those trusts to
them.
And so, that's a commercial negotiation and it's ongoing, but that's where the potential benefit could be. But there is
also still significant potential benefits in the operating piece before we get to actual shutdown of the plants.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Gotcha. Thanks. That's helpful. And then secondly, on the potential tax rate decrease – and if
there is let's say a tax rate decrease, 15% or 20%, whatever it gets to, assuming no other tax reform, just a tax rate
decrease, what does that mean in terms of – is there any change in like a capital allocation plan or a financing plan for
Entergy or is the current business plan really business as usual? And any benefits or impacts you've already talked
about kind of stay in place?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: You are talking about tax reform administration from – at the federal level?
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Yeah, that's right.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. Yes. In the near-term, we wouldn't anticipate any significant changes. We are in an
NOL position, and so whether or not we are paying taxes – or, we're not going to be paying taxes a whole lot in the
near-term under the current tax regime, and we wouldn't anticipate paying taxes a whole lot in the – under any tax
reform scenario, so our capital plan should be about the same either way.
We will obviously work closely with our retail regulators to get whatever affects our end rates, and then at the parent
level, since we also have the NOL there, is the fact – or, not the fact, the possibility I should say that we lose an interest
deduction or there is a lower tax rate, both of which would affect the parent negatively because of the losses there.
But from an earnings perspective, they wouldn't necessarily affect it from a cash flow perspective. And so, we would
not anticipate changing our capital structure as a result of tax reform anytime near-term or for the – I should say, for the
foreseeable future.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. So the parent debt to consolidated debt targets would remain about the same
irrespective of the tax reform?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That's what we are anticipating.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

Our last question comes from Charles Fishman from Morningstar.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Good morning. Drew, let me ask that last question a little different way. You put up a slide
last quarter on your preliminary thoughts on tax reform. Is there anything you've heard since then that would make you
change anything on that slide?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: No, Charles, nothing...
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. As you know, there hasn't been anything really definitive that has come out of DC as of
yet. Perhaps today, we'll get some information from the administration about where they intend to go. But we've
certainly been participating in EEI activities up on the hill: Leo has been up there; I've up there; our tax team has been
up there; our regulatory folks have been up there to try and discuss the impact on Utility customers primarily and what
they mean and the impact on our ability to raise capital and the cost of capital primarily. So we've spent a lot of time up

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Charles. And the only thing that I'd like to add, and I know we're running up against
the time here, but from the standpoint of where we sit, all the questions that you all had are really, really good and
helpful for us to make sure we know what you are focused on, but I just want to kind of end where I started, and that is,
from a strategic perspective, everything that we are doing is right on track with what we've laid out over the last couple
years. From an operational perspective, across the entire business, everything is running on track in terms of what
we've laid out over the last couple years. And then from a financial perspective, everything that we have achieved and
the things that we see in our outlooks are right on track with what we've laid out over the course of the last years –
couple years. So, from the standpoint of where we sit right here today, we're still very excited about the opportunities in
front of us. The capital plan, we have a solid – the regulatory structures we have around it give us the flexibility to
benefit our customers through those investments in most of what we're doing on the – certainly everything we are doing
on the capital side. Investment has been done elsewhere within and outside of our jurisdictions, both from a regulatory
and operational and a technological standpoint. So, we feel really good about where we sit and everything's right on

release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-Q is due
to the SEC on May 10th and provides more details and disclosures about our financial statements.
And please note that events that occur prior to the date of our 10-Q filing that provide additional evidence of conditions
that existed at the date of the balance sheet would be reflected in our financial statements in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles.
And that concludes our call. Thank you.
