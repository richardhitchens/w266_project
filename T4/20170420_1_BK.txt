Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Valerie, and thank you for joining us this morning. As you may have seen from our release, we again delivered
double-digit earnings per share growth for the quarter. We earned $0.83 per share, up 14% year-over-year, which
includes a $0.03 per share tax benefit related to a new accounting guidance for stock awards.
Now, looking at our results on an adjusted basis, total revenue grew by 2%, driven by 4% growth in Investment
Services fees and 4% growth in Investment Management and performance fees and 3% growth in net interest revenue.
Total noninterest expense was up 1%, resulting in nearly 130 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our pre-tax
operating margin increased to 33%, and we are continuing to deliver high returns on tangible common equity, this
quarter achieving a very healthy return of 22%.
Now, since we shared our three-year strategic plan with you in October of 2014, we have delivered nine straight
quarters of solid performance against the EPS goal that we laid out for ourselves. The relative consistency of our results
reflects how well our dynamic, well-diversified, lower-risk business model is positioned to create increased value for
clients and shareholders through all environments.
So, now let me update you on our progress against our strategic priorities during the quarter. Our top priority is
enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. In Investment Services, we have been investing
in cutting-edge collateral optimization and management solutions that we delivered to both the buy side and the sell
side. During the quarter, collateral balances continued to show robust growth, which speaks to the strong level of client
uptake that we have experienced. Another area of investment has involved building best-in-class technology and
middle office services that enable asset managers to leverage our scale and expertise.
Now, you may recall that back at our Investor Day, we discussed the market opportunity to service alternatives,
including real estate assets. Yesterday, we announced that PGIM Real Estate, the real estate business of Prudential
Financial, one of the top ten real estate investment managers in the U.S., selected us to provide fund administration
services for $33 billion in U.S. real estate assets. And these assets are not included in our assets under custody and
assets under administration win for the first quarter, but they will be included in the second quarter. This mandate is a
clear endorsement that our investments in the alternative space are paying off.
We were also recently selected by AIA Group, the largest independent publicly listed Pan-Asian life insurance group,
to provide investment books of record software and to consolidate all of their investment management data on to a
single platform. And we're seeing a demand for investment books of record solutions as global investment firms seek to
replace legacy platforms to manage investment risk, improve decision making, and ensure consistency in reporting. Our
best-in-class Eagle data management platform is well positioned to meet that demand, and given its flexibility and our
ability to scale, it will support growth.
And for the quarter, we had $109 billion in estimated new AUC/ assets under administration business wins, which I
remind you, excludes the impact of the Prudential transaction. So, we're off to a good start in 2017, and we remain
encouraged by the strength of our new business pipeline.
In Investment Management, we had a good quarter with revenue up 8% and pre-tax income, excluding intangibles, up
24%. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margins rose to 34%, helped by increased revenue and various expense actions.
Overall, asset management flows improved to their highest levels in several years. Of note, our cash business bucked
the industry trend of outflows, and in the quarter, we added $13 billion in asset inflows. Now, looking at our investment
performance over the longer term, we continue to see strong performance, with two-thirds of our actively managed
mutual fund assets ranked ahead of their peer median on a three and five-year basis.

Within the business, we are continuing to revitalize our investment product portfolio to meet evolving client demand.
So, for example, some of the greatest growth opportunities in active management lie in multi-asset class, alternative,
and specialist active equity strategies. As a result, we are working to increase our product offering in these areas. And
we've also been investing to develop additional capabilities in credit, real return, equity income, and liability-driven
investments.
Across all of our businesses, we continue to focus on enhancing the client experience, which we have no doubt will
drive future revenue growth. We have a high-tech and a high-touch approach to servicing our clients, investing in the
digital experience, and adopting a common discipline and approach that further improves how we interact with our
clients.
Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process to create efficiency and quality benefits for our
clients and reduce technology, operations, and structural costs for ourselves. Now, during the quarter, we continue to
increase our use of robotic and cognitive technologies to drive efficiencies and productivity. We have increased the
number of bots in production from about 150 bots at year-end to over 220 at the end of the first quarter. Now, this
speaks to the success of our early efforts on this front. Those bots are automating certain tasks, which is improving
accuracy and decreasing processing time by as much as 50% to 80%, depending upon the function. And we further
downsized our real estate portfolio during the quarter, exiting three locations for a reduction of 83,000 rentable square
feet. Now, on a year-over-year basis, we have exited 10 locations and 776,000 rentable square feet. And you can see
the impact of these actions in our lower net occupancy costs.
Now, we also continue to align client pricing when increasing regulatory and service costs. For example, we imposed
new fees to compensate for costs related to the investor tax reporting that we provide to European offshore fund
accounting clients. When we formalized our business improvement process a few years ago, many wanted to know
how long it could continue to generate savings. We still have a solid pipeline of opportunities to expand automation,
further rationalize our real estate footprint, and reduce vendor costs, which will help us to further reduce costs and
improve our operating margin.
And our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During the quarter, we upgraded and
streamlined risk reporting and making the enterprise much more resilient. And we continue to expand the global
footprint of our risk and compliance organization to gain access to top qualitative and quantitative talent capabilities
outside the U.S.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a
strong balance sheet, including strong capital and liquidity positions while returning significant value to our
shareholders. From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our fully phased-in SLR is now at 5.9%, which is a healthy buffer to
the regulatory minimum, especially considering our low credit risk business model. During the quarter, we returned
nearly $1.1 billion in value to our shareholders, repurchasing $879 million in shares and distributing $201 million in
dividends.
Our fifth priority is attracting, developing, and retaining top talent. To win the competition for talent, we're investing in
our people and our culture, creating workplaces that support a diverse, flexible, and adaptive workforce and holding
everyone accountable for results. Our workforce excellence program, which we are expanding in 2017, is transforming
our workplaces into efficient, collaborative spaces that leverage the full capabilities of our technology. The program is
strengthening the company's resiliency, making us more agile and reducing our operating costs.
Now, we recently released our second annual People Report, which illustrates how our people lead, innovate, and
collaborate to positively impact our company and our clients. It's posted on our website, and I encourage you to go
check it out.
So, in summary, we are continuing to execute on our strategic priorities, transform our company, and increase the value
we deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Our performance is only beginning to reflect the progress that we have
made in digitizing our business and harnessing emerging technologies, which should result in an increasingly
distinctive client experience and new sources of value for our clients. We see ourselves as being a great platform

company that integrates the best of what we do and what others have to offer for the benefit of our clients and the
marketplace. While it is still early, we are confident in our future as we continue to invest, innovate, and transform into
a more digital, data-driven global financial services powerhouse. It's exciting to envision the potential opportunities for
our clients and our shareholders.
So, with that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we performed well as our strategy is strengthening
our franchise, benefiting our clients, and improving our financial performance. When you look at the results for the
year-over-year quarter, I think a few things stand out. First, we experienced solid revenue growth in Investment
Services fees and Investment Management and performance fees. Both were up 4%.
Second, while our net interest revenue and our net interest margin benefited from the rate increases, both results were a
little lighter than we anticipated due to the slightly smaller balance sheet. Now, the dynamics of that, I'll discuss later in
a little more detail. I will also provide with you some additional color on how additional rate increases are expected to
benefit both NIR and the NIM. And finally, we generated positive operating leverage and increased our operating
margins from both higher revenue and continued expense control despite the significant pressures that we felt on
regulatory costs.
Turning to our financial highlights document, I'll continue my commentary starting on slide four, and that gives you an
overview of our operating results for the quarter. Our first quarter EPS was $0.83. That's 12% higher than the year-ago
quarter on an adjusted basis. Year-over-year, looking at our performance on an adjusted basis, first quarter revenue was
up 2%, expenses were up 1%, and we generated approximately 130 basis points of operating leverage.
As we have noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact our results. It's negative for revenues
and positive for expenses. However, the net impact from currency translation was once again minimal to our
consolidated pre-tax income.
Income before income taxes was up 6%. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margin was up two percentage points to 33%.
And return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was 22% for the quarter compared to about 21% in the
year-ago quarter.
Now, moving ahead to slide eight, I will discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Total Investment Services fees
were up 4%. Asset servicing fees were up 2% year-over-year, and they were flat sequentially. The year-over-year
increase primarily reflects net new business, and that includes the growth of our collateral optimization solutions as
well as higher equity values, and that's partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar as well as the negative impact of
downsizing of the UK retail transfer agency business. Year-over-year, the impact of these latter two items was
approximately minus 2% to our revenue growth rate.
Clearing service fees increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily driven by higher money market and
mutual fund fees. Issuer service fees were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher depositary receipt fees, and that was
partially offset by lower fees in corporate trust. Treasury services fees increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher
payment volumes, partially offset by higher compensating balance credits provided to clients, and that reduced fee
revenue, although it did increase net interest revenue a bit.
First quarter Investment Management and performance fees increased 4% year-over-year. That's primarily reflecting
higher market values and is partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally against the British pound
as well as the impact of last year's asset outflows. On a constant currency basis, Investment Management and
performance fees actually increased 8%.
We've been focused on delivering [ph] profitable (16:48) revenue growth within Investment Management through our
business improvement process, which reduces expenses and drives future growth. In line with our objectives, adjusted

net operating margins improved to 34% for the quarter, driven by higher revenues and expense improvement actions
taken over the course of the last year.
Turning to foreign exchange and other revenue, FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was 6% lower
year-over-year, and it was up 2% sequentially. FX revenue of $154 million was 10% lower year-over-year and 12%
lower sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower market volatility. The
migration to lower margin products also impacted the year-over-year comparison but not so much the sequential
comparison.
Investment and other income of $77 million compared with $105 million in the year-ago quarter and $70 million in the
fourth quarter. Both comparisons primarily reflect the net gain related to an equity investment and decreases in other
income from our increased investments in renewable energy. The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower
lease-related gains. The sequential increase was partially offset by lower income from corporate bank-owned life
insurance.
Now, slide 9 shows the drivers of our Investor Management business that help explain our underlying performance.
Assets under management of $1.73 trillion was up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, offset by the
impact of the dollar primarily versus the British pound. With regards to flows, with net inflows of $27 billion, we had
the best quarter in years. While active equity strategies continue to experience outflows, the revenue impact was more
than offset by inflows of $18 billion into other active strategies. This includes $14 billion into liability-driven
investments and $2 billion into multi-asset and alternative investments as we maintain our focus on improving the
revenue mix toward long-term, high-value active solutions.
With regard to short-term flows, as Gerald noted, we added $13 billion in cash, and we did that by focusing both on the
performance as well as increasing distribution through our liquidity portals. This was in contrast to the cash industry
which experienced overall outflows.
Now, turning to our Investment Services metrics on slide 10, assets under custody and administration at quarter-end
were a record $30.6 trillion. That's up 5% year-over-year and reflects higher market values, offset by the unfavorable
impact of a stronger dollar. Linked quarter, the AUC/A was up 2%, mainly driven by improved market values and a
slightly weaker dollar. We estimate total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $109
billion in the first quarter.
Looking at the other key Investment Services metrics, you will see average deposits declined 8% year-over-year and
7% sequentially, reflecting both the impact of the rate increase as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance
sheet to meet the liquidity and capital requirements. Lastly, tri-party repo balances grew a healthily 13%.
Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you'll see that on a fully tax equivalent basis, NIR was up 3% to $804
million versus the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in NIR primarily reflects higher rates and the impact
of interest rate hedging activities, and those actually negatively impacted the first quarter of 2017 less than the first
quarter of 2016. And that was partially offset by lower average earning assets as well as higher average long-term debt.
The sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of interest rate hedging activities in the fourth quarter of 2016
premium amortization adjustment, which, combined, reduced net interest revenue by approximately $43 million
sequentially. And that's about 6 basis point impact to the net interest margin. Substantially, all of the interest rate
hedging activities in the fourth quarter were offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue.
Now, NIR benefited from higher rates, which was partially offset by a reduced balance sheet, and we discussed that
previously how we intended to do that as well as some adjustments to the asset and liability mix to build a cushion for
the fully phased-in liquidity coverage ratio that went into effect in the first quarter. As we look forward to the second
quarter and the full year, using the forward yield curve to estimate, we would expect to see NIR rise 2% to 4% in the
second quarter, and 4% to 6% for the full year as the balance sheet stays flat or contracts slightly.
Turning to slide 12, you'll see that our adjusted noninterest expense on a year-over-year and sequential basis increased
1%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher consulting and staff expenses, partially offset by lower other

expense. The increase in consulting expense primarily reflects higher regulatory and compliance costs related to
resolution planning and CCAR. After we submit the resolution plan on July 1, the quarterly run rate for these expenses
should come down by approximately $10 million. The increase in staff expense primarily reflects higher incentive
expense that was partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar. As you will see, we added a separate line
item for our bank assessment charges to provide additional transparency since they have been and are expected to
remain a significant cost item.
The sequential increase in noninterest expense primarily reflects higher staff expense, and that was offset by lower
business development, net occupancy, software and equipment as well as professional, legal, and other purchased
services. The increase in staff expense reflects the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees,
partially offset by lower severance expense in the first quarter.
Consistent with prior quarters, the first quarter reflects the benefit of improved efficiencies as well as savings from our
location strategy, which is designed to optimize our footprint, as well as from our vendor renegotiations that continue to
reduce our costs. Savings from efforts like these are enabling us to fund important growth initiatives including NEXEN
as well as to absorb increased costs relates to the regulatory requirements.
Turning to capital on slide 13, all of our fully phased-in ratios increased during the quarter. Our fully phased-in
supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.9% as we both generated capital and reduced average assets. One of the
benefits of our decreased balance sheet is we now have a reasonable buffer above the SLR minimum that will provide
additional flexibility in managing our capital going forward. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity
coverage ratio.
A few additional notes about the quarter. Our effective tax rate of 22.3% was reduced by approximately 3% or $0.03
per common share from the application of the new accounting guidance related to the annual vesting of stock awards.
This results in a benefit this quarter due to our stock appreciation above the awards' original grant price.
On page 9 of our press release, we show Investment Securities portfolio highlights. At quarter-end, our net unrealized
pre-tax loss on the portfolio is $23 million, and that compares with $221 million at the end of the fourth quarter of
2016. And that improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in market interest rates.
Now, let me share a few thoughts on our outlook on topics that have been top of mind with investors since the change
in the new administration. We believe that many of the post-crisis regulations have made us and the banking industry
stronger. Although some modest adjustments could be helpful to our business model, it is really too early to predict
outcomes. So, at this point, we're maintaining our current regulatory compliance initiatives and the significant
corresponding spends associated with them. However, during Federal Reserve Governor Tarullo's departing speech, he
suggested adjusting the enhanced SLR requirement for risk, and that should provide some relief for the custody banks.
Now, let me provide you with some color on how we are thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you
with our modeling. As we look forward in the event of future rate increases, we expect flat to modest contraction of our
balance sheet, which we also expect to be more than offset by higher net interest margin. We expect net interest
revenue to increase approximately 2% to 4% sequentially and approximately 4% to 6% for the full year. We also
expect our net interest margin to expand to 100 to 130 -- somewhere between 120 basis points and 130 basis points by
the end of the year, which should continue to expand in coming years as we reinvest maturing securities in our
portfolio.
Regarding fee waivers, we have recovered nearly all of the pre-tax income related to the interest rate-sensitive fee
waivers. We also expect our regulatory and compliance costs to continue to be elevated in the second quarter, reflecting
the increased expenses associated primarily with the resolution and recovery plan but with CCAR as well. As
mentioned earlier, we expect these expenses to decrease over the second half of the year by approximately $10 million
per quarter.
Despite the increased regulatory costs, we expect our total expenses to remain close to flat to last year's level in the
second quarter. For the full year, we expect our total adjusted expenses to be up no more than 1%. Regarding taxes, we
expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% as we have previously guided. And finally, we

expect to generate positive operating leverage once again in 2017.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Before we open the line for questions, let me offer a couple more thoughts. As a reminder, this is our ninth consecutive
quarter of solid performance against our EPS goals. I also want to remind you that we have a well-diversified,
lower-risk business model that is largely fee-based with recurring fees representing nearly 80% of our revenues. Now,
that positions us to consistently deliver solid quarterly results and higher risk-adjusted returns versus other financial
institutions. And we're executing on our strategic priorities to deliver even greater value for our clients and our
shareholders.
With that, operator, we can now open it up for some questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jeffries.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Hey. Thanks a lot, guys. Good morning. Todd, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more
about the balance sheet and specifically, your points about reinvesting cash flows off the securities book, in terms of
where the curve has moved to. And then just separately, how do we just think about, given that you're not on a
traditional bank, how do we think about the deposit betas and how you expect your balance sheet to act differently, if at
all, from more of a traditional regional?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Ken. Good morning. I think as we've guided in the past, we do see some sensitivities
to interest rates to the balance sheet. In fact, the deposit base has moved pretty much along the lines that we had
anticipated. So, we saw in the quarter, on average, deposits down about $15 billion. That has since actually gone up a
little bit, but it feels like it should be fairly steady there.
The betas themselves are pretty low. So, as you see from our disclosures, in the quarter, our interest rates paid on
deposits moved from a negative 1 to 3 basis points positive, so about 4 basis points with the 25 basis point move.
Remember, not all of this is dollar denominated. About 75% of it is. So, for that move, you could kind of look at the
beta somewhere between the 20% and 25% range. We would expect those betas to creep up as interest rates continue to
go up.
So, what we would expect to see is a little bit of contraction in the balance sheet and a little bit of expansion in the net
interest margin. And that's why we think we can continue to see the growth that we're talking about in NIR. So, not a
whole lot further contraction in the balance sheet is what we'd currently expect.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: All right. And as my follow-up, I'll just ask the first part, just keep it at that.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Just again your reinvestments in terms of the long end has come in quite sharply. Are you able to
find new securities to replace that roll-off still at higher levels? Just can you talk through on front book, back book, and
just kind of reinvestment yields?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. That is obviously a little bit disappointing that the yield curve has remained so flat.
When you do modeling, you typically do it assuming a parallel curve, although when we're doing our forecasting, we
are forecasting it off of a forward rate curve. So, the assumptions that we're making here is that the market will follow
the forward rate curve, and obviously, the forward rate curve for longer-term rates has come down with a rally in the

markets over the past month or so.
So, the answer to the question is we would expect off of that forward rate curve to see – first of all, there's a substantial
amount of those securities portfolio are floating. So, clearly, they're going to reset with the LIBOR resets. And the
remainder is repricing – a substantial amount is repricing each year. Given those two factors, we would expect to grind
the yield up in that securities portfolio over time.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Thanks, guys. So, the first question around the servicing business, it definitely feels like
the competitive dynamics have gotten a little tougher. JPMorgan announced they've gotten a little bit more aggressive
in that business in the last couple of quarters. So, maybe you could talk about your relative position in the space there
today. I guess, how do you defend your position and perhaps the areas where you feel the biggest opportunity for
yourself to grow, both from a revenue perspective but also from a profitability perspective?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: So, this is Brian Shea. I'm happy to take that. We feel pretty good about the outlook for
the Investment Services businesses. You're seeing the Investment Services fee. Revenue growth, up 4%, which is
actually improved over what it's been year-over-year and more recently. And we think the asset servicing business,
which is going to benefit from secular trends, which are putting pressure on asset managers to transform their operating
models and to outsource more of their solutions. So, that's why we see growth opportunities in the middle office space.
We see growth opportunities from technology solutions. Eagle, that Gerald mentioned, is a great example of that. And
we see growth in the alternative space. The announcement of PGIM Real Estate outsourcing opportunity is a great
example because most of the market still insources their real estate fund administration, and this is a big growth
opportunity for us. And we see growth opportunities in the EPS administration space, and we're investing in all those
areas, so we feel good about the long-term prospects in the Asset Servicing business.
The clearing business is also performing pretty well, and we're benefiting from the fact that self-clearing firms are
reconsidering whether they want to clear for themselves, and Pershing has a solid pipeline. As a result of that, we're
getting good growth in the RIA custody business, which is benefiting from the Department of Labor fiduciary standard.
We're getting some mutual fund consolidation driven to the platform, again driven by the DOL change where people
are moving mutual funds to platforms so they can put them under an advisory framework. And we're getting real
leverage between Pershing and the private bank. We have record levels now of both credit facilities established
between the wealth management bank and Pershing's clients and record levels of outstanding credit, now over $3
billion in loans provided to those introducing broker- dealers and RIAs.
The issuer service business is solid. We have solid share in the markets we're in. Obviously, we benefit from a higher, a
better issuance environment. Corporate trust is, in the first quarter, the year-over-year comparison is that issuance of
global debt is down something like 15%, but our share of the market's pretty steady, and we're positioned to grow as the
issuance market picks up. And we're getting good traction in the corporate and the insurance space, in particular.
And then, of course, we're a leader in the broker-dealer clearing space. U.S. government securities and triparty repo
market, and we have invested heavily in resiliency, resolvability, scalability of that business so that we can serve the
market well and responsibly. And we expect that that business – that will start to grow in the second half of this year
and throughout the course of 2018. So, overall, there are competitive pressures, but honestly, we're really focused on
what the clients need in this market and the client solutions we can use to differentiate ourselves. So, we feel pretty
good about the prospects

<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Thanks. Thanks for all the detail. And I guess, a follow-up along similar lines, which is on
collateral management specifically. Gerald, you highlighted that in the release and your prepared remarks as well that
that's been a pretty exciting area of growth for you, guys. Is it possible though to kind of break out what the revenue
contribution is overall for the firm now from collateral management? And maybe just give us a sense what the growth
in that area has been.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, we break out a lot of detail already, Alex. Breaking out a particular individual line
item is just too complicated. Considering it's both for the buy side as well as the sell side, it goes across asset servicing
and our markets business. And so, to segregate it and to call it out individually would be pretty tough.
That being said, it is an increasingly and in demand set of solutions. And so, it was initially around collateral
management, and then it became segregation issues around the new regulatory climates around the world. Now, we're
shifting into collateral optimization and building the engines for that on a global basis. So, we still feel very positive
about its growth trajectory on a global basis for both the buy side and the sell side.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. All right. Figured I'd try. All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello there.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello. A question on the whole SLR and central bank deposits, including the leverage ratio. Not
asking you to speculate of what will happen. I think it should happen. It happened in the UK. My question is, if it were
to happen, what would you do with the money? It's a decent size, chunk of your balance sheet. How does that get
reallocated? What kind of benefit could that be if it did happen?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Glenn, it's Todd. I'll take this. I think there are actually two – if any relief comes on the
SLR, I think there's two approaches to it. One is that they would change the denominator a bit just as you described.
Maybe they would exclude from that riskless securities such as treasuries or central bank deposits. The alternative is to
adjust the enhanced SLR, so the additional 200 basis points, similarly, the way they do to the GSIB buffers that are
required on the risk-weighted ratios. And that is what Governor Tarullo recommended specifically in his departing
speech. And we would assume that perhaps, given where we are on a GSIB buffer, relative to others that might be
about half. So, that just kind of paints the picture for possible future rule changes.
All that being said, I don't think you would see a dramatic change necessarily in how we'd have to manage capital
because the CCAR would still be constrained by the leverage ratio, the traditional leverage ratio itself. So, we would
need to take that into consideration. It would make it easier for us to meet our spot ratios. We're one of the few
institutions that tends to be more constrained by spot. But that's really no longer the case with where our capital is
today. So, now, we're in a pretty good position.
It would probably put us in a position to take on certain types of low-risk activities that we wouldn't have otherwise
taken. I mean, we could increase the deposit activities. There're certain lending types of activities that might be a little
more attractive to us than they would have been. I think number one, it is a possibility that we could expand into certain
activities and manage our capital a little bit tighter.
The other potential outcome is if there is a reduction, for example, around treasuries and central bank deposits, we
would expect that to promote more activity in the repo markets and other markets that we serve. So, that could
potentially be a positive to the fee generation of the company.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Glenn, if I could just add, on the supplemental leverage or enhanced supplemental
leverage, it was actually very nice to see Governor Tarullo in his final speech specifically call it out related to the

custody banks. If we see some movement – I'm a little bit optimistic we will – it will allow us to have more flexibility
with our balance sheet. As you know, over the course of the last year, we've pushed deposits out, which is
counterintuitive to what a bank is supposed to do. And so, I think by some relaxation of that, that will give us more
flexibility on the balance sheet. And whether it's repos or repo financing or accepting customer deposits and putting
those deposits to work, which can create more income, I think it just gives us more flexibility in the future.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: [ph] I think (40:28) I appreciate all of those comments. The quickie follow-up on that regulatory
theme is you were kind of clear in terms of what we should expect cost-wise. I just want to revisit how come regulatory
costs are higher right now. There's this overall feeling like they have plateaued and trending better in general. What
specifically is taking up some of the dollars being used right now?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, so for us, Glenn, it's really the resolution plan. As you know, we got feedback on
the resolution plan last year. We responded to the deficiencies in October. We got positive feedback on the
deficiencies, but there were other actions that we need to deliver by July 1. We have a significant number of people – I
mean, a very significant number of people focused on delivering this resolution plan. That comes with quite a few
investments. We had said, in the past, that the investments associated with that probably had between the capital and
other spend of over $140 million. We are in the highest burn rate point right now up to the delivery of it on July 1, and
then we would expect to see a little bit of relief thereafter. Of course, we'll then be waiting for feedback, and I'm sure
we'll continue to evolve and improve the plan over the next few years. But I think we've made great progress, and it's
come at a significant cost.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Got it. Thank you for your answers. Appreciate it.

Our next line comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just, Todd, if we could just go back to the net interest revenue
and if you could talk a little bit about the hedging activities in the first quarter and sort of the thought for coming into
the next quarter. I think there was less of an offset in fees this quarter. If you can just talk about that dynamic moving
into the second quarter and whether you think that will persist through the year.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. Sure, Brian. So, there are basically two types of hedging that goes on. So, if you
look at our long-term debt, most of that debt we have swapped to floating. As the hedge on that from time to time based
on interest rate movement, there will be a component of that that is deemed to be ineffective. That ineffectiveness is run
through net interest income. Over time, it will work itself out to zero, but they are long-term hedges. So, one quarter, it
might be up a little bit. One quarter, it might be down. It was unusually positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. So, when
you look on our schedule on the earnings release on page 7 and you look at the yield on long-term debt, that's where the
noise is coming from. That long-term debt is basically just floating. But you might have noticed in the fourth quarter,
we saw a 1.36% yield, down substantially from the third quarter. That was because of gains from the ineffectiveness.
Otherwise, it would have been about 1.63%.
Moving to the first quarter, you saw it pop up to 1.85%. Well, if you take into consideration the impact, it would have
been down about 6 basis points from that. So, it's moving up as you would expect it to move up on average with the
movement in LIBOR since that has been primarily swapped.
So, I think it's not a whole lot more complicated than that. There's one other element, and so that doesn't impact other
trading at all. We also hedge the spread between the overnight rate and LIBOR, and that does not get hedge accounting
treatment on those swaps. So, a gain or loss on those runs directly through trading, and that creates some noise as well.
And again, that just averages itself out. Sometimes, it's a positive. Sometimes, it's a negative. So, the impact to this
quarter is effectively overstated the fourth quarter NIM and overstated the fourth quarter earnings by about $40 million
and understated a little bit by this quarter, and that ultimately had about a six basis point sequential negative impact to

the NIM. So, when we look out forward, we just assume that's going to average itself out. It's very difficult for us to
predict, and that's why we do call it out.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: And so, that averaging out is included in your 4% to 6% guidance for the...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes. Yes, it is. So, I'm not suggesting we've got a recovery from anything that we've done.
Just going forward, we assume it's zero.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay. So, locked in for 1Q and then zero for the next three quarters.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Right.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: And then how many additional Fed hikes after the March 1 are you including in the 4% to 6%?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, it depends on the day that you do the calculation, but as we prepared for this, we
had two additional Fed hikes in that forward curve.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay. And then my follow-up will just be on prime. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about
the clearing business. It's been actually very strong considering the client runoff. Maybe if you can just talk about the
tempo this year in that, if there's any more attrition from the clients that have departed. And then you mentioned a lot of
elements of cross-selling within your own franchise and the benefits from the fiduciary rule coming through. Is that
going to create stronger tailwinds coming into the second half of this year as that rule theoretically gets implemented?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, good question, Brian. It's Brian Shea. I would say the clearing business has been
remarkably resilient and despite the fact that we've had some large client losses over the last year or two, mostly driven
by global wealth firms exiting the U.S. marketplace which were big Pershing clients. Despite that, the core underlying
business has been performing pretty well, and the metrics are starting to improve. We're seeing a pretty solid pipeline
of large firms, including self-clearing firms reconsidering whether or not they're going to outsource their clearing.
Those tend to be choppy, but we're encouraged by the trend, and we think we have the right platform to help be the
solution to that.
We also have invested in an integrated bank and brokerage custody platform that's very appealing to wealth
management firms and to registered investment advisory custody firms. And our RIA custody business is experiencing
double-digit growth. And one of the things that's differentiating us is this private banking partnership with the wealth
management group. So, just to give you an idea, we're up to about $4.8 billion in credit facilities established and over
$3 billion in loans outstanding, and that's the private bank of BNY Mellon making loans available to the high-net-worth
investors of RIA custody clients and introducing broker-dealer clearing clients. So, that's good.
From a DOL perspective, it's driving more traditional brokers to the advisory model, which is part of the reason you see
that advisory growth. But we're also seeing now a trend toward mutual fund consolidation, meaning that assets are
moving to brokerage platforms or to the Pershing platform as advisors want to actually include mutual funds into an
asset allocation or were advisory [indiscernible] (48:11) relationship. So, that's a positive trend for Pershing. So,
overall, we have a pretty good outlook, and the revenue diversification of Pershing is pretty strong. So, it's been
resilient.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great. Great. Thanks for that color. Thanks very much.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. A couple of follow-up questions. One on the SLR discussion that you had
earlier, Todd, just wondering would you consider any changes to your press strategies in the event that there was an
SLR change?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Potentially, I mean, as you know, we've issued quite a bit of preferred over the past couple
of years, and we have kind of changed our capital stack. So, I think we're pretty comfortable with that capital stack. We
probably have a little more space that we could go if we wanted to, and it's largely to drive the Tier 1 capital, which is
the numerator for the SLR. So, if SLR changes took place, we would have to rethink that. So, I think the answer to that
is yes, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And is there any flexibility there? I'm just wondering if there's kind of a non-call
provision that you're kind of dealing with for a number of years or not.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. No, there are some non-calls in those, but we're quite comfortable with the capital
and the cost of the capital. I mean, some of those issues were below 5%, so it's certainly less costly than Tier 1. So, my
expectation is that we would keep it in place. It's just a question of how much future issuance that we would do.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it. Okay. And then on the regulatory expenses, I think you indicated that
currently, you're running at the high watermark, $140 million. I assume that's an annual number or is that a quarterly
number?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, the $140 guidance is something that we provided a while ago, which is what we
thought the number of projects that we're going to require to invest in would ultimately cost us between capital and
expense. The capital would obviously ultimately become an expense. We've not given additional information against
that, but as we responded to last year's letter, we have increased the run rate spend, just the monthly run rate spend on a
number of different components of the resolution plan requirements. That is what we expect to see, to wind down a
little bit in the second half of this year.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And the second half, it's $10 million in 3Q and $10 million in 4Q for a total of $20
million decline. Is that [ph] realistic (51:13)...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, that's the guidance. That's the guidance, yes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. Right. I just want to make sure it was $20 million in total not just $10 million.
Okay. And then just last question, NEXEN take-up, maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there
and also what incremental your clients are asking for that you're focusing on delivering, incremental functionality
perhaps that you might be working on.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, why don't I give you a couple of headline numbers? And then, Brian, you may want to
give some color commentary on some actual initiatives with individual clients. But today, we have about 60,000 users
on our NEXEN Gateway. 11 different businesses within the company are consuming it or putting applications up on it.
We have about 17 different clients who are accessing our API store. We have about 140 or so APIs in our store. There's
about another 100 APIs that are queued up to go into the store. And so, we're seeing a pretty significant take-up. And
then the data that's coming out of our Digital Pulse is being captured and consumed mostly internally to improve our
operations and find pockets of ways to automate and reduce our own structural cost. So, generally, the take-up has been
quite positive, and the businesses are using it, and we're seeing real applications up and running on it.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, I agree with that. And I would just say, in addition, Betsy, we're starting to build out
the app store, and actually, the first third-party vendor will be live in the app store in the second quarter. We have a
pipeline of five or six that have committed that we'll be putting on over the next couple of quarters. And then there's an
even more robust pipeline of firms in discussion with us as we sort of execute this vision of delivering the digital
investment platform that our clients need to reduce their vendor management, integration, business continuity, cost, and
help -- and we're going to enable that through NEXEN. So, again, every two weeks, we add more functionality and
more capabilities, and we're getting more traction with the clients, and, of course, as a result, the clients are starting to
see more value incrementally every two weeks.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And anything in particular people are asking you to do that you're putting on
the to-do list or...
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: I wouldn't say anything specific that would be earth-shattering. Just continuing to deliver
all the capabilities of the company through a single gateway and also enabling them through APIs to integrate with us
the way they want to work. Those are the two big drivers. And frankly, longer term, as we execute this more fully,
we're going to be easier to do business with. And to Gerald's earlier point about improving the client experience, it's
going to improve the client's technology experience significantly, and it's going to make it easier for them to do more
business across the company. So, we see this really creating long-term value for the company.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Betsy, the...
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yes.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: ...the live situations with a number of clients tend to be around data aggregation and them
being able to pull data out of the systems in a much more easily consumed way versus us pushing mountains of reports
that take days to produce. And we've been able to shorten that reporting cycle down to minutes and in some cases, for
different fund companies and hedge funds. So, that's the initial set of applications.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Back to the SLR and the potential
changes there. How much flexibility do you think you've got on the level of capital you run with so that the numerator
part of the question, just given that the CET1 is at 10%? I think you talk about running with a minimum of 100 basis
point buffer over the regulatory minimums of kind of 9.5%. I mean, does that kind of limit the amount of flexibility
you've got if you're just focusing on the numerator side, so the option is more around the denominator and how you can
run the balance sheet differently?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Sure, Geoffrey. It's Todd. I'll take this. So, first of all, our minimum for the
common equity Tier 1 is 8.5%. So, we're at 150 basis points over that for the fully phased-in. So, that feels like a pretty
decent buffer. Certainly, it's adequate we would think for most stress tests at least as we've seen them in the past.
I think in terms of the SLR, I think that had been the binding constraint in the past, but now that it's up at 5.90% or
close to 6%. And at 6.60% in the institutional bank where it needs to be at 6%, it, too, feels like it has a pretty good
buffer to withstand two things that could potentially move that. You're not going to see a lot of noise we wouldn't
expect in the risk-weighted asset, so for the common equity Tier 1 ratio, but what you could see under the SLR is an
expansion of the balance sheet if there were big deposit flows. So, we think that gives us an adequate buffer for that and
certainly in this new interest rate environment.
And secondly, there are fluctuations and other comprehensive income that really comes out of the securities portfolio.
So, we've structured the securities portfolio in such a way that it's less rate sensitivity than it had been in the past, and
we think it could accommodate some fairly substantial increases in long-term rates, which we'd actually kind of like to
see at this level of a buffer. So, we feel like it's pretty well balanced right now.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Thanks. And then on the CET1 again, the advanced ratio is a lot lower than the standardized
ratio. Is there anything that you've heard recently that gives you confidence that the advanced ratio could be relaxed a
bit, maybe operational risk RWA calculations changing or something like that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, there's what's become known as Basel IV has been batted about quite a bit. At this
point, I would say it's too hard to determine or it's impossible to determine whether there's ultimately going to be
adopted. Within that, one of the considerations would be to change the treatment for operational risk, which we would

encourage, I think would make some sense. That would probably provide some relief to BNY Mellon, and I think there
are some other considerations that may very well offset that around market and other types. So, A, we don't know
whether it's going to be adopted; B, it's not the test that's used in the CCAR. It's the standardized test which it almost
has to be. It would be very difficult to run it off of the advanced approach and get consistency. So, we don't know
whether it would be adopted. We're not really sure ultimately what the impact would be to us. It's probably net positive
on operational risk and slightly net negative on the other items.

Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups at this
point. So, helpful on the $10 million a quarter in consulting headwind here in the near term, but taking a step back and I
think you guys made some comments about it previously, if we end up in a lesser burdensome compliance and
regulatory environment, how should we think about how that might provide an additional lever for you to pull on the
expense side? And then if we think about how maybe Brexit might offset some of that, the need to invest might offset
some of that, given how controlled you guys have been on the expense front for several years, like when we put all of
that in the mix over the next few years, assuming we have regulatory relief, how should we think about what could
happen to operating expenses?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, let me take a high-level stab at it, and then, Todd, you can weigh in some. I think the
way we contemplate it, to the extent that we have some sort of change in tone on the regulatory side that we can
actually direct some more of our resources and frankly, some of the higher intellectual capital the company us being
consumed by regulatory requirements, if we can redirect it to new products and solutions, and that is our goal as
opposed to taking a dollar-for-dollar reduction in whatever expenses we may have from regulatory relief. We'd like to
invest more in some of the businesses and some of the solutions. We'd like to invest more in further automating the
company, which will drive better operating efficiencies for the long term. And so, we would like to see some of it
continue to go to shareholders but a lot of it reinvested in the company for future growth and for future improvements
in our strategy and technology and automation.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And I would add just a couple of things here. If you think about the U.S. regime, there's
been an awful lot of new rulemaking that's gone on and actually the implementation cost to comply with that. And I
probably said to you once or twice before that we think that the run rate has probably peaked and I was wrong. But if
you think about things like CLAR, even the advanced approaches to calculating the risk-weighted assets, CCAR, as it's
continuously developed, the resolution plan, which comes with some new requirements, for example, around liquidity
and capital management, the liquidity coverage ratio, which is a demanding regulatory reporting exercise, since we're
providing significant amounts of daily information. So we're getting all of that implementation in place. And there will
certainly be, I'm sure, no matter what the change in the regime is, ongoing requirements to improve that. But we'd like
to think that we don't see a lot of new rulemaking out there because I think we're getting all the way through the
Dodd-Frank requirements. So, in the U.S., there probably would be some relief regardless of what the regime actually
does.
I think globally, one of the things that we broke out on our expense report is bank assessment charges. And so, the
FDIC charges have gone up substantially as have what we see both on the European resolution fund as well as just
bank levies in certain parts of Europe. There's the potential for some relief on that, but probably, even that is a year
away. And the other thing I might add why we want to still be cautious here is that in Europe, as we implement MiFID
and other additional regulations, the compliance costs there are quite high as well. So, we're going to get, I think, some
short-term relief. Whether that actually rolls into long-term relief or not is too early to call.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: That's all really, really fair and very helpful. Thanks. And certainly, Todd, I think you got
some company in trying to call a top on the regulatory burden; it's getting worse for sure.

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: One follow-up on the SLR buffer, I think you guys said that you would expect it to have
from 200 bps to 100 bps. When I had looked at – I guess, maybe I compared it to the enhanced buffer that the Fed had
come up with and I thought maybe it might even be a bit lower for you, what makes you think that it would only [ph]
be halves (1:03:35) for you rather than maybe even a potentially better outcome?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, that's highly speculative on my part. I have just seen, if you were correlate – so, you
might be right, Brennan. If you were to correlate the 200 to the buffer, the GSIB buffer, and you use the same regime to
calculate it, something like half I think would be a reasonable estimate. But you're right, it could be a little bit more
than that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. Great. Okay. Thanks.

And our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, Gerald. Good morning, Todd.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Question, Todd, and I know there's been a lot of talk about the balance sheet, and I think you
gave us guidance in your prepared remarks about basically a flattish balance sheet from here until the end of the year. If
you guys look longer out from your customer standpoint and we get into a 3% fed funds rate environment, let's say,
going into 2019, are there still lazy deposits, if you will, sitting on your balance sheet that would move into
higher-yielding alternatives? Or do you see with your current customer base that deposits they have are truly what
they're probably going to keep with you even in a higher rising interest rate environment?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. So, I'd like not to call them lazy because a lot of this is related to activity that goes
on, corporate trust activity, asset servicing activities, settlements, and so forth. And we do think the betas will increase,
and in many instances, we actually have contractual rates that we apply to client deposits.
So, I think the way to look out at the future is there will be a -- just as we saw the spike up in deposits with the Fed
easing, I think we'll see that kind of market share gain, if you will, the total deposits come out, which it practically has.
And then the business will grow. The deposit side of the business will grow with activity as it has historically. That's
our expectation.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Yeah. No, no, no, that's good. And then I know this is a hypothetical and maybe never will
come true, the industry including you guys has suffered from the LCR ratio being as high as it is. If there wasn't that
requirement to have the LCR ratio as high as it is, what do you think a more reasonable LCR ratio should be for you,
guys? Or are you comfortable with what it is now?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And I'll be happy to comment on that one. And the LCR may very well get some
conversation, but I think there's another thing that you should be aware of. In the resolution plan, there is something
called the RLAP, which is the liquidity that you need in place in order to go in and manage your resolution plan. It's
pretty highly correlated to the LCRs. So, it could be another – it's another constraint that I think that you should be
aware of, and we're working through that as we deliver it to the regulators this summer.
That being said, the LCR is a constraint. It does limit the types of things that you can do. There's no question that it has
an impact on lending. And if you took into consideration that there are probably substantial amount of liquid assets on
the balance sheet that don't fall into the denominator, it's probably more constraining than it really needs to be. I think
conceptually, it is a very good tool. It's an approach to managing liquidity that makes a heck of a lot of sense. I think
perhaps it could be tweaked a little bit. If it were, it's another one of these things that would provide more flexibility,
