Treasurer.
With that, let me turn the call over to Dan Akerson.
Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Randy, and good morning.
This morning I'll provide you a summary of our fourth quarter and calendar year 2010 results, and then, as Randy said,
Chris will take it from there and provide a more detailed review, then I'll close.
I'm pleased to report that for the calendar year, General Motors recorded net income attributable to common
stockholders of $4.7 billion, and automotive free cash flow of $6.4 billion, which excludes the impact of $4 billion of
voluntary U.S. pension contribution.
While these are clearly very good, I wanted to highlight for you some of our major accomplishments that not only
contributed to them, but also builds our foundation for the future.
We have significantly lowered our cost base and restructured GM North America to break even near the bottom of the
cycle, as evident with our four consecutive quarters of posit EBIT in 2010.
We've maintained our number one market share position in the combined BRIC markets. In fact, we have maintained
our sales leadership in China for the last six years.
On October 1st, GM completed the acquisition of GM Financial to help expand the availability of consumer financing
in the U.S., particularly in subprime and leasing. Based on some early programs, we are already starting to see some of
the benefits of the strategy.
After an incredible development process, GM commenced the launch of the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric
vehicle when we said we would, mid-November. We started with seven initial launch dates, and we'll complete our
rollout of the other 43 during 2011, ahead of our original plan. The Volt performs on the road and for the environment,
negates the range anxiety experienced with other electric vehicles, and is positively shifting perceptions of General
Motors.
We have also worked to improve our balance sheet. We have reduced our debt by over $11 billion, including the
repayment of the U.S. and Canadian government loans, as well as the VEBA Note. We've enhanced our liquidity by
signing the $5 billion revolving credit facility, and we've also contributed $6 billion of cash and stock to the U.S.
pension plan.
In Europe, we're working to aggressively implement our restructuring plan to lower our breakeven point. And finally,
we executed a successful $23 billion public offering last November. allowing the U.S. and Canadian governments to
reduce their ownerships to approximately 27% and 7% respectively on a fully diluted basis. We know we still have a
lot to do, and we plan to continue to build on our progress in 2011.
Turning to slide 2, we have a summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2010. Our
revenue was $36.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $135.6 billion for the year. Operating income was $300 million for
the fourth quarter and $5.1 billion for the year. And net income attributable to common stockholders is $500 million
and $4.7 billion for the fourth quarter and calendar year.
On a fully diluted basis, our earnings per share were $0.31 for the fourth quarter and $2.89 for the entire year.
Included in the fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders and fully diluted earnings per share is
approximately $700 million in losses associated with the purchase of the U.S. Treasury preferred shares, $200 million
gain associated with the repayment of the VEBA Note, and $100 million combined gain associated with the sale of
Nexteer and the purchase of Strasbourg.

After emerging from bankruptcy, there may be a period here – period of time where we are not – we are void of the –
we're not going to be void of these one-off type transactions. Kind of a settling, if you will, post IPO. Post bankruptcy.
Moving to the non-GAAP metrics highlighted in the bottom of the page, GM recorded earnings before interest and
taxes less adjusted of $1 billion and $7 billion for the fourth quarter and calendar year, respectively. The decline in the
fourth quarter EBIT adjusted is consistent with the guidance we provided during our third quarter earnings call.
Our automotive cash flow was a negative $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter and a positive $2.4 billion for the year. Both
included the $4 billion discretionary U.S. pension plan contribution. Excluding this, free cash flow would have been a
strong positive $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter and a positive $6.4 billion for the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to fill in most of the details.
Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone.
So turning to slide 3, I just wanted to spend a bit of time on the presentation of our results. As we've discussed on
previous calls, we have a very standardized approach to ensure consistency and transparency for you. We have some
improvements to our approach and they include the following.
The fourth quarter of 2010 marks the first quarter in which our results are directly comparable to those of a year ago.
And so therefore, we will transition our quarterly EBIT bridges to year-over-year comparisons.
To give you greater visibility into one of our key regional markets, we're also starting to report separate sales and
financial results for GM South America. This segment includes sales and manufacturing operations in countries such as
Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, that were previously reported as part of GMIO. That's
International Operations. Prior quarter sales and financial results for GMIO have been adjusted to reflect the breakout
of GM South America, so they're directly comparable.
Finally, we completed the purchase of GM Financial on October the 1st. Starting with the fourth quarter, our results
reflect the consolidation of GM Financial. In order to provide you with an operating metric for the entire company, GM
Financial's results are included in our non-GAAP earnings before interest and tax, and EBIT adjusted, on a pre-tax
basis.
With that, let's move to a review of the results. And given this marks the end of the fiscal year as well as the quarter, I'll
give you detail for both the year and the fourth quarter results. That means that you'll hear a bit of my voice. We'll
cover a bit more ground today in my prepared remarks than normal.
So on slide 4, we highlight net income attributable to common stockholders and fully diluted earnings per share, as well
as some of the items that are included in these metrics. Starting with the fourth quarter of 2010, net income attributable
to common stockholders is $500 million and earnings per share was $0.31 on a fully diluted basis. As Dan just
mentioned, our fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders and fully diluted EPS includes the
impact of the gain on the extinguishment of the VEBA Note, combined gain on the sale of Nexteer and purchase of
Strasbourg, as well as the loss associated with the purchase of the U.S. Treasury-owned preferred shares. The impact of
these items is a $400 million reduction to net income attributable to the stockholders, or a $0.21 reduction to fully
diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. So if you adjust for those, excluding the impact of those items, our net
income attributable to shareholders would have been $900 million, or $0.52 a share on a fully diluted basis for the
fourth quarter.
For the calendar year, we had $4.7 billion in net income attributable to common stockholders, or $2.89 in fully diluted
earnings per share. These were all also impacted by the items we just covered, as well as the $100 million gain realized
in this first quarter from the sale of Saab. For the calendar year, and adjusting for rounding, these totals were $200
million reduction to net income, or a $0.14 reduction to fully diluted earnings per share. So excluding the impact of
these items, our net income attributable to common shareholders would have been $4.9 billion, or $3.03 in earnings per

share on a fully diluted basis for the total calendar year.
Slide 5 provides a walk from operating income to EBIT adjusted for the calendar year. As Dan previously covered, our
operating income was $5.1 billion for the year. We reported $1.4 billion of equity income, which is our proportionate
share of the income earned by our equity method on vestiges, primarily our joint ventures in China.
Non-controlling interest was a $300 million deduction for the calendar year. This is related to the non-GM owned
proportionate share of consolidated entities, primarily GM Daewoo. And non-operating income was $1.3 billion for the
year. This is mostly attributable to $800 million in non-operating income experienced in the fourth quarter which I'll
cover on the fourth quarter walk a little later.
This adds to a calendar year earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, of $7.5 billion. The adjustments for the year
were $400 million including the gains associated with the VEBA Note, the sale of Nexteer, the purchase of Strasbourg,
and the sale of Saab. So excluding those adjustments, EBIT adjusted was $7 billion for the year.
Slide 6 shows the comparison of calendar year EBIT by segment. As you can see, GM North America, GM
International Operations, and GM South America all posted solid EBIT for the calendar year of $5.7 billion, $2.3
billion, and $0.8 billion, respectively. GM Europe had a loss of $1.8 billion, and Corporate sector and eliminations
totaled positive $0.3 billion. GM Financial reported $100 million for the fourth quarter on an earnings before tax basis.
So after adjusting for rounding, this totals to the calendar year EBIT of $7.5 billion, and after deducting adjustments,
places us at the EBIT adjusted figure that I mentioned of $7 billion for the year.
Turning to slide 7, we'll walk from operating income to EBIT adjusted for just the fourth quarter. Operating income
was $300 million for the fourth quarter, equity income was $300 million, non-controlling interest was $100 million
deduction, and non-operating income was $800 million for the fourth quarter. This adds down to earnings before
interest and tax of $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, and after excluding the $300 million of adjustments, EBIT
adjusted was the $1 billion figure that we've had in our release.
Slide 8 shows composition of EBIT by segment for the fourth quarter. GM North America, International Operations,
and South America posted EBIT of $800 million, $300 million, and $200 million, respectively. Europe had a loss of
$600 million, and Corporate sector and eliminations total $400 million. GM Financial reported $100 million for the
fourth quarter, as mentioned, on an earnings before tax basis. So that totals EBIT of $1.3 billion for the quarter, and
adjusted down to $1.0 billion.
Slide 9 provides our global deliveries and market share on a standard five-quarter basis. This includes vehicles sold
around the world under our GM and our joint venture brands and through our GM-branded distribution network. For
the fourth quarter of 2010, our global deliveries were approximately 2.2 million units, an increase of approximately
220,000 units versus the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase is primarily attributable to an improvement in the global
industry, but also a slight improvement in our global market share, which was up 0.1 of a percentage point versus the
fourth quarter of last year.
Turning to slide 10, GM North America deliveries were 685,000 units for the fourth quarter of 2010, up 48,000 units
versus the fourth quarter of 2009. U.S. share of our four brands, Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac, was 19.1%, a
0.5% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
Slide 11 provides what we view as key performance indicators in GM North America, and is a slide we've shared with
you while reviewing our quarter results throughout the year. The lines on the top of slide represents total U.S. market
share as well as U.S. market share for our four core brands. As you will note, total U.S. market share and four-brand
market share have progressively converged as our sales of discontinued brands have been eliminated. More
importantly, our four-brand U.S. share has stabilized and actually improved to about 19% in the fourth quarter of 2010,
versus 18.6% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving to the bars on the slide which represent our average U.S. retail incentive for our four brands, and these are
based on J.D. Power PIN data. Our average U.S. retail incentives for our four brands was approximately $3,100 for the
fourth quarter of 2010, down some $800 from the year ago. On the bottom of the slide, we provide our average

Page 5 of 17
four-brand retail incentive as a percentage of ATP and compare it to industry average, and this, again, is consistent with
what we've done in previous quarters.
Our incentive percentage of ATP has decreased substantially over the past year, from 12.4% in the fourth quarter of
2009, to 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Additionally, our fourth quarter 2010 four-brand U.S. retail as a percentage
of ATP was in line with industrial average. We were slightly below the industry average for the calendar year in total.
You'll also note that we've provided data for January 2011. For the month, our incentive increased approximately $400
from December 2010, and our percentage of ATP increased to 12.6%, which was 126% of industry average. Our total
U.S. market share was 21.4%, and our U.S. retail market share was 20.6% in that month, both the highest since 2008.
These were all the result of a very targeted sales initiative. For the month of January and February, we identified an
opportunity to maintain our sales momentum during traditionally slow months. We ran targeted loyalty and other
programs that were very successful.
However, I want to highlight that this is not a change to our disciplined approach on incentives. On a go-forward basis,
we plan to continue to align production with demand and maintained our disciplined use of incentives to generally
remain, on average, at industry levels on a percentage of ATP basis.
Turning to slide 12. GM North America net revenue was $22 billion for the fourth quarter, up $3.7 billion from the
prior year. This continues the improving trend we've seen all the year long. We ended the year with 511,000 units of
U.S. dealer inventory, or about 71 days of supply. This was an increase of 33,000 units during the quarter, but a
reduction of 12 days of supply due to an increased selling rate in December.
Slide 13 provides North America's EBIT by quarter going back to the fourth quarter of 2009. As you can see, the EBIT
was $800 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, up $4.2 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2009, but down from the
third quarter. A reduction of business in third quarter is consistent with what we reviewed during our third quarter
earnings call, and I will review the key drivers of this reduction after the year-over-year comparison.
Particularly pleasing is that despite somewhat depressed U.S. industry volumes of 11.8 million units, GM North
America delivered solidly profitable results and an EBIT of $5.7 billion for the year.
Slide 14 walks the major components of North America's $4.2 billion improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009 to
the fourth quarter of 2010. Approximately $900 million of the improvement was related to volume and mix, the net
volume impact being $1.1 billion, with mix unfavorable approximately $200 million, primarily driven by increased
compact car volume. Price was favorable at $100 million, mostly related to reduced U.S. incentive spending. Costs
were approximately $2.9 billion favorable, but that was primarily driven by the absence of the $2.6 billion UAW
VEBA settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. In other words, approximately – a favorable
approximately $300 million. This includes $200 million in lower translational exchange related to the Canadian dollar
net monetary liability position, as well as the $100 million gain on the sale of Nexteer.
Slide 15 provides the major components of North America's $1.3 billion reduction in the fourth quarter versus the third
quarter. Now, our fourth quarter results are consistent with our expectations as well as the general outlook we gave
during the third quarter conference call, but clearly we want to give you more visibility here, given its importance.
Compared to the third quarter, volume and mix was unfavorable $400 million in the fourth quarter. This includes
approximately $200 million of favorable volume impact, primarily driven by improvements in North America's market
share, but more than offset by $600 million in unfavorable mix. The unfavorable mix is primarily due to increased
compact car volume related to the very successful Cruze launch, as well as lower full-size truck and crossover volume,
with the third quarter relatively strong, as I mentioned a quarter ago, and the fourth quarter relatively weak, as I also
foreshadowed.
Price was unfavorable at $300 million, primarily related to normal seasonal model decay, costs were unfavorable
approximately $600 million, in line with our expectations. This includes $400 million in increased marketing expense
related to key product launches such as the Cruze and Volt, the Buick Regal Turbo and CTS Coupe, as well as other
media initiatives such as Chevy Runs Deep and the carbon offset advertising. Additionally, engineering expense
increased approximately $200 million largely related to expenditures for prototype tooling for upcoming vehicle and

powertrain launches.
Importantly, this is a more normalized run-rate going forward. GM North America's fourth quarter results had
approximately $200 million in additional marketing expenses and $100 million in additional engineering expense. Also
impacting fourth quarter results was a $100 million sales allowance accrual for first quarter 2011 programs and a $200
million unfavorable translation exchange of the Canadian dollar net monetary liability position.
So in terms of how you – we think about 2011 versus 2010 for GM North America, we anticipate that volume will
favorably impact EBIT as the industry continues to recover, partially offset by unfavorable mix and price. With regard
to U.S. dealer inventories, we expect to close out 2011 levels roughly equal to year-end 2010, but at a lower
corresponding days supply due to an increased selling rate by the end of this year. This includes a build in the first half
associated with recent launch products such as the Chevrolet Cruze, products in short supply including the Chevrolet
Equinox, as well as inventory builds of full-size trucks primarily related to a lower selling rate in the first half of the
year. We then expect to deplete U.S. dealer inventory during the second half of the year.
Regarding costs, we anticipate relatively consistent overall levels from 2010 to 2011, with investment in increased
advertising and engineering, but also increased pension income and lower amortization expense. We expect first
quarter costs to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2010.
Turning to slide 16. GM Europe deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2010 total 426,000 units, up 48,000 units from the
fourth quarter of 2009. The increase is primarily driven by GME market share, which increased 0.8 percentage points,
to 9%. Our share in key markets such as Germany and the UK were up 0.2% and 1.2 percentage points versus the
fourth quarter of last year. Opel and Vauxhall market share was 6.2% for the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 0.4
percentage points from a year ago. And Chevrolet market share was 2.7%, again, up 0.4 percentage points from a year
ago.
On slide 17, we have GME, Europe that is, net of – revenue by quarter for the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of
2010. Europe revenue was $6.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up $0.7 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The
increase is primarily attributable to the impact of increased volume, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates.
As you can see on slide 18, Europe's earnings before interest and tax was a loss of $600 million for the fourth quarter of
2010, totaling for a loss of $1.8 billion for the year. Included in Europe's result are restructuring charges of
approximately $100 million for the fourth quarter and $700 million for the year.
To recap briefly, our restructuring plan is focused on lowering our breakeven point through cost savings and continued
production and – and productions. In May, we reached an agreement with the Works Council on approximately $300
million of annual employee cost concessions. In December, we completed the closure of the vehicle plant in Antwerp,
Belgium. Through this measure as well as other separation programs in Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom,
European head count was reduced by approximately 5,000.
On the product front, we introduced the Meriva, Antara, and Movano in 2010, and we plan to launch an additional four
Opel/Vauxhall products in 2011, including the Ampera. By the start of 2012, we plan to have 80% of our Opel and
Vauxhall car lines' volume refreshed such that the model stylings are less than three years old. Based on our plan, we
expect to achieve breakeven EBIT before restructuring charges by year-end.
Slide 19 details a $200 million improvement in GME fourth quarter 2010 results versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The
net impact of volume and mix was $200 million favorable. Pricing was flat, with improvement related to the recently
launched Astra and Meriva offsetting the impact of the lifetime warranty program that we launched.
Costs were $300 million unfavorable on a year-over-year basis, and this includes approximately $200 million increase
in engineering, as well as $100 million of restructuring expense related to the closure of the Antwerp plant at year-end
and separation programs being conducted in Germany and the United Kingdom. Other was favorable at approximate
$300 million including a $100 million gain on the purchase of Strasbourg powertrain facility and a $200 million
favorable related to the absence of Saab losses experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Turning to slide 20. We saw our International Operations – this now excludes South America, as I mentioned –
deliveries totaling 776,000 units in the fourth quarter, up 63,000 units versus the prior year. Focusing on China, our
deliveries were 576,000 units for the fourth quarter, up 42,000 versus the prior year. The reduction in our China market
share in the fourth quarter is attributable to a stronger-than-expected industry growth in December, driven by the final
month of certain tax initiatives and the retiming of deliveries of vehicles produced at our joint ventures to January. We
estimate that our January share will actually rebound to approximately 14% for the month on an industry of 1.9 million
units, or 25% above the month's run-rate of 2010. So a good start to the year there. For the year, International
Operations' deliveries were 2.4 million units in China and 3.1 million units in total.
Slide 21 provides International Operations' net revenue, which was $6.1 billion for the fourth quarter, up $1 billion
versus the prior year. This improvement is primarily attributable to volume and mix improvement, as well as favorable
foreign currency. As you can see in slide 22, International Operations posted a $300 million – $300 million in EBIT for
the fourth quarter of 2010. On a year-over-year basis, that's a decline of approximately $100 million.
Turning to slide 23. Therefore we have a walk of the fourth quarter EBIT from 2009 to '10, consistent with the other
regions. Volume and mix was favorable, approximately $100 million. Price was also favorable, approximately $100
million, on a combination of factors including increases in – on launched products. Cost was approximately $400
million unfavorable, and this includes $200 million associated with GM debt due to increased material, labor, and other
production costs. And we also experienced approximately $100 million increased engineering expenses related to
future product programs. Other was favorable approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis. This includes
favorable non-controlling interest adjustments due to the decline in GM debt profitability, partially offset by
unfavorable FX and derivative mark-to-market adjustments.
Turning to slide 24, the last of our regions, South America. Deliveries totaled 286,000 units in the fourth quarter, up
62,000 units versus the prior year. The improvement was primarily attributable to increases in the South America
industry, which was up 300,000 units. South America total market share was 19.6% for the fourth quarter, broadly flat
with the previous year.
On slide 25, we show that the fourth quarter of 2010, South America net revenue was $4.5 billion. The $200 million
increase over the fourth quarter is primarily related to the impact of increased volume, partially offset by unfavorable
foreign currency related to the devaluation of Venezuelan bolivar.
Turning to slide 26, South America recorded a $200 million of earnings before interest and tax for the fourth quarter,
broadly consistent with the run-rate for the year. Slide 27 shows that the impact of volume, mix, and price was
approximately $200 million favorable year-over-year, offset by costs, which were unfavorable by about the same
amount, $200 million, largely due to increased manufacturing-related labor and material costs.
On slide 28, we provide a walk from net income attributable to common stockholders, to automotive free cash flow for
the fourth quarter and for the calendar year 2010. Our automotive net cash flow from operating activities includes the
impact of the voluntary U.S. pension plan cash contribution of $4 billion that we've previously announced. Our capital
expenditures were $1.1 billion and $4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and calendar year, respectively. After deducting
capital expenditures from automotive cash flow from operating activities, we arrive at automotive free cash flow of
negative $2.8 billion for the fourth quarter and positive $2.4 billion for the year. So if you exclude the impact of the
voluntary pension contribution, automotive free cash flow would have been $1.2 billion, which is very pleasing, for the
fourth quarter, and $6.4 billion for the calendar year.
Going forward, we anticipate our capital expenditures to increase to approximately $7 billion for the 2011 calendar
year, consistent with what we've foreshadowed before. And we will also implement our previously-announced unwind
of in-transit funding in the first quarter which will show as a deduction to cash flow in the quarter.
Moving to slide 29, we provide key automotive balance sheet metrics. We ended the year with $33.5 billion in
available liquidity. With our cash flow generation and the addition of the $5 billion revolver, we essentially maintained
our very strong liquidity position while significantly reducing our key obligations and also funding the GM Financial
acquisition. Total book value of debt at year-end was just $4.6 billion, which was down $11.2 billion from the start of

the year. This primarily represents the paydown of the U.S. and Canadian government debt, VEBA Note, and the GM
debt facility. Series A preferred stock also decreased to $5.5 billion of book value, reflecting the purchase of the U.S.
Treasury shares. Finally, our U.S. pension underfunded status decreased from $16.2 billion underfunded to $11.5
billion underfunded.
So our very strong operating results have allowed us to make substantial progress in strengthening our balance sheet. In
total, we indeed leveraged these long-term liabilities by over $17 billion during the course of last year.
Slide 30 gives you some more visibility into our U.S. pension fund status, which was 84% funded at the end of the year
– sorry, 84% funded at the start of the year, to 90% funded at the end of the year. Our service and interest costs were
$5.7 billion, more than offset by actual return on plan assets estimated at approximately 14%, or $11.6 billion. So this
was a very strong return on assets, well above our assumed 8.5% for the year. Updated discount rates at the end of the
year resulted in a $5.2 billion reduction in funded status. The weighted average discount rates at the U.S. pension plans
reduced from approximately 5.5% to approximately 5% at the year-end.
As previously announced, we've made the $4 billion voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. hourly and salary plans in
December. And I'd also like to mention that the underfunded status at year-end 2010 excludes the impact of the $2
billion stock contribution we made effective January. So including this, it increases the funded status to approximately
91%.
Turning to slide 31, and this is addition, as I mentioned, we have some GM Financial key metrics. As you know, we
acquired GM Financial on October the 1st, and started with the – starting with the fourth quarter, our results reflect the
consolidation of their activities.
To recap briefly, through this acquisition, we plan to offer customers more financing options. We plan to increase the
availability of leasing for GM vehicles which have been underrepresented versus the industry average, and remain
competitive in the availability of subprime financing.
In December, we paused our prime lease programs with GMF in the state of Ohio. This program is very successful, and
GM Financial originated some 30% of GM leases in Ohio for the month. In total, we saw our Ohio lease penetration
increase from 18.8% in November, to 25% in December. So due to the success of this program, we've already
expanded it to 15 additional states that, when combined with Ohio, represent some 45% of U.S. lease volumes.
So moving to the information on the slide here, GM Financial recorded $129 million in earnings before tax for the
fourth quarter of 2010. Total originations were $935 million, with financed at GM vehicles accounting for 18.1%, up
7.3 percentage points versus the prior year. At year-end, total finance receivables were approximately $8.6 billion, and
we expect the portfolio to grow in the first quarter with increased origination levels. Finance receivables greater than 30
days' delinquent were 8.6% of receivables at year-end, and annualized net credit losses for the quarter were 5.5%, both
excellent improvements from the prior year.
Turning to funding, GM Financial continues to successfully access the capital market. We completed a $700 million
securitization in December and an $800 million securitization in February, both at an outstandingly low all-in 2.5%
cost of funding.
On page 32, I wanted to do something slightly different by providing you a status update on our material weakness.
This morning, I am very pleased to tell you that after assessing the effectiveness of the remediation actions put in place
to address the company's material weakness regarding the financial reporting process, the management team, the audit
committee of the board of directors have both concluded that the material weakness no longer exists as of December
31, 2010. Disclosure controls and procedures are therefore – as well as internal control over financial reporting are
effective at December 31, 2010. This important – marks an important milestone for the company, as it has been an
issue for several year and reflects a lot of hard work by everyone involved.
So I've covered a lot of ground, a bit more than additional. Hopefully you found that detail useful and important, but in
particular, given the trends, we wanted to give you as much visibility as possible. So with that, I'll turn the call over to
Dan for his summary and closing remarks.

Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris.
I'd like to close in what I believe are a few takeaways from today's calls. In summary, good start, lot more work to do.
2010 was clearly a good year for General Motors. I'm not sure anyone would have predicted a year ago that GM would
deliver net income of $4.7 billion automotive cash, free cash of $6.4 billion, before contributing $4 billion to the U.S.
pension plan. In addition, four consecutive quarters of positive EBIT and automotive cash flow excluding the pension
contribution. As I said, good start. Now for the more-to-do.
We will be focusing on four key areas in 2011. First, we need to continue to develop and launch great products for our
customers around the world on a consistent basis. Important launches in '11 include the Chevy Sonic, the Buick
Verano, the Opel Zafira, the Ampera, and as well as the new Baojun brand in China, which incidentally I was in China
last week and drove it. This is going to be a good brand and a great car in Asia.
Second, we must drive for improved business results around the world. This includes strengthening our position in
emerging markets like China and Brazil, implementing and following through on our restructuring plan in Europe, and
continuing to leverage the industry growth in North America. An important initiative across the global will be our
ongoing efforts in cost management. As we reinvest in the business, in both engineering and CapEx, we must remain
vigilant in mitigating these cost increases. And as we expand production in the growing industry demand, it'll be
critical for us to stay very focused on managing fixed cost.
Third, we will continue to push hard on technology, on the heels of the award-winning Chevy Volt. I believe we are in
for a sea change in this area. And I also believe GM can and will lead. Fourth, we made great progress in 2010 on our
already strong balance sheet, and I would expect to further improve it in 2011. We are on a journey to minimal debt and
fully funding and de-risking our U.S. pension plan, and I expect we will make meaningful steps in that regard in 2011.
In summary, our focus is to build on the progress we made in 2010, take advantage of what should be a strong –
stronger global industry in 2011, and we expect our first quarter should be a solid start in the new year.
Thanks for taking your time this morning. That wraps up our remarks. Now let's open it up for questions.
Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Investor Relations and Financial
Communications
Okay, operator, we're ready for questions when you are.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Himanshu Patel from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Himanshu Patel>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Himanshu Patel>: Couple of questions. I think at the auto show, you had somewhat signaled that you were
considering tweaking, or maybe just more fundamentally altering your strategy in financial services. Can you elaborate
a little bit more on kind of your latest thinking there? Particularly the two verticals of wholesale and retail prime, where
you're currently not present. Do you think there's a need to move into that?
My second question is, just since the IPO, oil prices have shot up considerably. Steel has gone up a lot. I'm wondering
if your view on 2011 mix and commodities have changed?

And last and final question. If you could give us an update on 2011 pension contribution thoughts?
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Let me handle the first one, and then I'll ask
Chris to handle the second two.
On financial services, as Chris outlined, we've made significant progress in the leasing and subprime markets since we
acquired GM Financial on October 1st. Obviously we have a lot of latitude in this area, but I don't want to go into it any
further, other than to say that we're studying it and we're working with our partner Ally in this area.
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, so just coming to your other two
questions, Himanshu. The last one first.
In terms of pension plan, our basic strategy is the same one as we've outlined all the way along, which is to the extent
that we generate free cash flow over and above the commitments of investing in the business – engineering, capital, et
cetera – then we'll look to make contributions to the pension plan to achieve, in due course, a fully funded, de-risked
plan.
So exactly how much that will be this year will depend on how the results for the year shake out. But it's still our
intention to use that free cash flow generation to progressively fully fund the plan and get to a fully-funded status in
due course. No change there.
On material costs, clearly there's some headwinds there. We were anticipating those, so certainly in our strategy and
budgeting over the last few months, we have been planning for material cost increases, offset by supplier performance.
So there isn't any significant change there. Obviously we're watching what's happening in the world very closely, as
everyone is, and we'll have to deal with the outcomes of those as they come along. But the headwinds were not a
surprise to us.
<Q - Himanshu Patel>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Good morning, everybody. Had a couple questions.
First, could you just clarify the non-operating income, that $800 million that you had in slide – I think it's seven – in the
quarter. What are you including in that, and what regions does that show up in?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, sure. There is a number of factors
in there, Rod.
The ones that I mentioned, the VEBA Note – so when we repurchased that, that actually created a positive outcome of
about $200 million. Nexteer and Strasbourg that I mentioned, which were about $100 million each.
Then there was some – a couple of other items. For example, the MLC contingencies. So MLCs are our old co, if you
like, and we have a contingency for that in our accounts associated with the amount that we need to settle with them.
We made a re-estimate of that. That was a positive couple hundred million dollars associated with an anticipated lower
claim.
We have royalties in there. This is sort of $30 million, $40 million. Rental streams, $30 million, $40 million. And then
sort of gains on derivatives and some much smaller items.
So all of that totals the $800 million. That appears in either North America or the region concerned, depending on the –
for example, Nexteer, as I mentioned – it was in North America, and we back that out when we do our adjustments.
The MLC contingency was in the corporate line, and again, we look to back those out if we think they're extraordinary.

<Q - Rod Lache>: Okay, so in the regional breakdown, that was backed out, is that correct? All these items? Or some
of them?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: In the total EBIT adjusted, we backed
them out. In the regions concerned, they're still in there.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Okay. And then -
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Best way of looking at that probably is
to – on the chart that was about the fourth or fifth one I covered, I show regional EBIT by quarter, and then the
adjustments out to the right-hand side. So that sort of shows you all of the regions and the adjustments, and then you
have to take them out of the region concerned.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Okay. And then I just had a couple questions about the outlook.
I appreciate your color on the North American pricing. You mentioned that you saw the opportunity to have some
targeted incentives. Can you just maybe address what the priority is here going forward? Will there be periods of
elevated incentives in the future? How are you avoiding the risk of getting dealers and customers used to the
discounting?
On Europe, you had been targeting approaching breakeven, and just give us an update on what your thoughts are there.
And then lastly, just within the International segment, there had been some tax changes in China and a few other things.
Just any view on your broad outlook for the China equity earnings in 2011 would be appreciated.
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. Let me – we'll handle those three
between Dan, myself, and Mark. That was one question, right?
Okay, in terms of Europe, the intention, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're still on the same track that we
were before taking cost out, launching the vehicles, and achieving breakeven before restructuring costs by the end of
this year. So that's still the plan, still the expectation, no change there.
In terms of North America, if I just talk about the overall strategy and then Mark can give you a bit of color, as well.
Again, what I emphasized in my prepared remarks, the strategy hasn't changed. We want to be at or around industry
average levels as a percentage of ATP over the medium term.
In particular months, we're going to vary for that, by definition. We might have targeted programs in one month, back
away other months, in order to get to that average position. So no change.
The – but I'll hand over to Mark to talk a little bit more about color and the marketplace generally.
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: Sure. Yeah, Chris stated it correctly. If you look at the 12-month performance of what we did
on a disciplined basis of production and incentives and then model changeover, and if you look at the correlation of
those, you'll see where we turned models quicker from '10s to '11s, and then we had a richer mix because of it.
So we look at all those things. But in January and February, you'll see we did some things that post-bankruptcy needed
to be done from a loyalty – from a conquest basis. And frankly, the industry acted like it always did, which was a nice
surprise in terms of the slowness, on a seasonal basis, of January and February.
So if you look at that, and you look at what we did and some of the results that came out of that, we have built some
things on a brand and loyalty and conquest basis, on a momentum in these two months, that we need to do as a
company as we move forward out and shed the ownership and bankruptcy piece of this.
So those are very targeted things. They worked. They worked better than what we thought they would, quite frankly.
And so that momentum and the communication with our dealer body, they know exactly what we did. They know
exactly how we did it. They don't expect any type of consistent ride on any of that. And I don't want to really talk about
future pricing, because I can't.

<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And let me just finish the last question on China.
Before I do, just to reflect on Mark's comments, we've tried to bring and make the company a little more agile, a little
quicker in the marketplace, and quite frankly, a little less predictable. As Mark said, a little less consistent.
There is both tactical and strategic issues going here. We did have to transition from eight to four models, so loyalty of
some of those customers and conquest have been increasing over the last quarter or two, and we wanted to get off to a
fast start. And as you said, it did result in a richer mix. So a little bit of a inconsistency from our competitors' point of
view might not be all bad.
As I said, your comments on China are timely and relevant. As I said, I was in China over the last week. They are –
they've increased fuel prices, both diesel and gas, petrol, and they've increased the reserve requirement, and they've had
some rate hikes. There's no question they're trying to tampen down – tampen the demand a bit.
But at the same time, our view on this year is the market will grow on the order of 10% to 15%. And we think that's
good for the long term, rather than have -although in the short term, unbridled growth isn't all that bad. But for those of
you, and I know many of you travel to China, there are concerns by the government. They have a very pointed view,
and I would almost argue, a really good view on a national energy policy. And they also are concerned about the
infrastructure and being able to facilitate, especially in their large cities. So – and they're also trying to manage their
inflation within the country.
But that being said, what's – we're going to have to comply with what is viewed by the leadership of an individual
country. And of course, we feel pretty optimistic, guardedly optimistic, about what's going on in Asia generally and
China specifically.
So, as Chris said, there are a lot of moving parts, some headwinds, some tailwinds. But it's interesting and complicated.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Okay. Thank you.

The following question will conclude the analyst portion. [Operator Instructions] The final analyst question comes from
Brian Johnson of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Hey. Thanks, and good morning. I hate to have to do housekeeping, but just following up on the
last question. Could you perhaps take the adjustments included on page 4 and give us a sense of, when we look at the
EBIT for fourth quarter, for each of the geographies and for corporate/other, how we should allocate that?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. We can do it more exactly offline,
but if you go to – let's do it again. If you go to slide 8, there's about $300 million of adjustments. It would be – let's just
think – probably $100 million in North America, small amount in Europe, $50 million to $100 million, and the rest
would be in corporate and eliminations.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Okay. And then the next -
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: [inaudible] I can give you the exact
answers after the call.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Okay. Yeah, we'll follow up on that. And then corporate/other and income tax both were
seemingly – higher than at least what we had modeled on the positive side. Can you give us some color on what was –
even backing out that $200 million – why that swung to a gain in corporate? And why income tax was a benefit as
opposed to an expense this quarter? And how we ought to think about it going forward?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I'm not sure what you've got in
your model for corporate. There's nothing unusual in there, other than the ones that I've talked about. So that's just – we

could work through and look at your model, but that's probably specific to that.
On tax, what happened during the course of the year, and this is all good news, is as we made progressively more
money in North America than we were anticipating – which, as you know, is essentially zero tax rate, due to our
significant losses – then our effective tax rate as a percentage went down. The higher the proportion of we make in
North America, the lower the effective percentage of tax rate.
So we have to estimate on a quarter-by-quarter basis. When we wash it up at the end of the year with actual numbers,
we have some make a reconciliation back. We simply – basically paid about the same amount of cash tax, but on a
much bigger earnings base than we were expecting. So, good news.
So again, the low tax rate in the fourth quarter is simply a wash-up of the year to get to the actual number.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Okay. So we should think about that more as an annualized number?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Absolutely.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Because it's always going to move around each quarter?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Correct -
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Okay. And then as you kind of walk from in – back in North America – from Q4 EBIT to Q1
2011 EBIT, you mentioned some puts and takes. Perhaps just to summarize, are you expecting cost to be improved,
despite – and that's anticipating the steel and commodity headwinds. Volume will be what volume is. And on pricing,
will that be a net cost, given the type of programs you're talking about?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. Or directionally -
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Or negative?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: – volume should be a slight positive.
Mix a slight offset to that. Probably about the same. Price, broadly flat globally, maybe a little down in North America,
but broadly flat. And cost will be a big improvement versus the fourth quarter.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: And that's driven by launches? Or lack there – or getting beyond the launches?
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. It's driven by a few things. Firstly,
the ongoing improvements that we're making in the business. Secondly, the absence of some of the things that we
foreshadowed in the fourth quarter. So by taking those away, you'll see cost improvement getting back to prior levels.
Closer to prior levels.
So volume, mix, and price -
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: – obviously a wash. Cost a big positive
from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.
<Q - Brian Johnson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Christopher P. Liddell, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks.

to overcome. Are you worried that that's going to cut into the bottom line, not having a whole lot of new launches?
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'll answer that, since you quoted me. One
of the things that we really need to do, and we needed to do it on a longer-term view anyway, but with what's in the
news today, I'm very happy to say that by the end of this year, we'll have four really good entries into the compact
segment with high mileage models. The Volt, which won't be a significant influencer, just given the amount of
production we're going to be able to hit this year; Cruze, we've been very pleased with the acceptance of Cruze in the
marketplace; and the Eco Cruze will – on the road, will make about 40, 42 miles per gallon which is very, very
competitive. The Sonic comes out this summer, which is – we hope, but we – and expect it'll have sort of the – same
sort of acceptance that the Cruze will have. That will be a very fuel-efficient car as well. And then the Verano, which is
a Buick, much more up-contented, very fuel efficient.
Those, I think, are the right products fortunately, by good planning, happenstance, I don't know. But good products at
the right time. And the other thing is, we're looking at continuous improvement across the product line, especially in
Buick. You'll see it with eAssist, which is a – obviously these are combustion engines, but with electrical assist, it will
jump the mileage 20%, 25%, which may be very timely as well.
So all in, I think '11 is – it may not be loaded with new entries, but pretty solid portfolio. And as you know, we came
out of '10 with a good momentum, both in the luxury end, with Cadillac being the fastest-growing luxury brand. The
overall best brand growth was out of Buick, which we're very pleased with, and we've seen real good strong growth
across the Chevrolet line.
So net-net, we're strong – we're stronger in terms of new product introductions around the globe than we are in the
North America this year, but I do think we're hitting North America with the right – in the right segment with the good
– with the right products.
<Q - Tom Krisher>: You seem to be banking – or, at least the events of the world in the last few weeks have seemed
to have played into your hands for the models that you have, but that – those generate fewer profits obviously. If the
mix changes and you get more of your sales from the smaller products, do you see an impact on the bottom line?
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: Tom, this is Mark. How are you?
<Q - Tom Krisher>: I'm good, how are you?
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: Dan highlighted – good. Dan highlighted those models but – that are very fuel efficient, and
traditionally, we haven't done very well on a financial basis on those cars at all. But when you say the mix changes,
your statement there assumes that we don't get any more on a total market basis. So there's some volume there, and
you're seeing us come out of the chute pretty strong in the first quarter, and you're going to see some things that I think
may be some surprises too that Dan didn't outline in North America. So we're not going to I guess sit here today and
outline every single launch and portfolio plan that we have over the next 12 months. But we continue to see strength in
some of our more – higher-contribution margin vehicles as well.
And things like the LaCrosse, that Dan mentioned, with eAssist, is a good contribution margin car for us. So is Regal
with eAssist. So I mean, there's a mix in there within the mix that you – I think people tend to look at this very digitally
instead of looking at the crossover piece of this as well. Our crossovers remain extremely strong. In fact, we're – we've
got some real holes in terms of supply for them. So those things – don't underestimate what we can do on a mix basis
with – as people move out of the pure big sport utilities on a full-frame basis, we've got a great lineup, and the launches
that we have just supplement it, if that makes sense.
<Q - Tom Krisher>: Yeah, it does. Thank you.
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: Yep.

Our next question comes from Chrissie Thompson from Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: Hi there. I – a little bit of a follow-up to what Tom just asked. We've been kind of talking
around the issue of what's going on these days in Libya, and with people kind of talking about what's going to happen
with gas prices. I'm curious to know how serious you guys think this is in terms of where gas prices are going
throughout the year and what consumers will do?
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I will tell you that we were concerned
about this well before it was on the front page of any paper in the United States or around the world. In fact, we've been
contingency planning, going back prior to the IPO, on what we would do, how we would react. So – but fundamentally,
we're a automotive manufacturer, so the market's going to be what the market's going to be. But I think, if you look at it
systematically over the next couple of years, out five years, 10 years, energy is going to be more expensive, so we've
got to prepare for that. And it's come a little bit earlier maybe than the industry or the economy, or the world economy
expected it or wanted it. So we're going to have to react.
And so, I don't know where the trigger points are. I was watched on television this morning and one of the
commentators says, well, is it a $3.50 a gallon? $4 a gallon, $5 dollars a gallon? Well, I don't know. I think there are
psychological barriers that are crossed. I think people are kind of acclimated to $3 – I'm just me talking. But I think if
we get to $4, people will look at it differently than they did at $3.
But to be honest with you, Chrissie, we don't have a crystal ball any more than you do. But we have to prepare for it
and we think we've got some plans, but at the end of the day, conditions will prevail, and there's not a whole lot we can
do about that.
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: Sure. Has that discussion changed from $120 a barrel to $140 a barrel?
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I mean -
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: Okay.
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I guess if it does, we'll have to adjust.
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: Okay. And then, Mark mentioned the holes in the supply of crossovers as we continue to
see the demand for that really outpacing what you guys can produce, and the potential for consumers to maybe turn to
those vehicles this year over SUVs. What is the solution to that?
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: You're talking about our production schedules which we really can't get into and how we solve
our production, supply and demand equation. We do it every three weeks. We sit in a meeting and we go through all of
it and we look at how we're going to do it, and we do it. So are we adding plants? Is that what you're going back to,
because you always seem to come back to that? Not at this point. We're not going to change our fundamental breakeven
point.
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: That's fine. Are you going to be able to produce enough crossovers?
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: That's my job, isn't it?
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Want me to answer that question for you, Mark?
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: Yes, yeah, my boss is sitting across from me, but yeah.
<Q - Chrissie Thompson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: We're doing everything we can, Chrissie, yeah. Yeah.

Our next question comes from Christina Rogers from Detroit News. Please proceed. Miss Rogers, your line is open.
Please proceed.
<Q - Christina Rogers>: Hello. Can you hear me. Hello?
<A - Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Investor Relations and Financial Communications>: We can now.
Yeah, we can hear you now.
<Q - Christina Rogers>: Okay, great. I just want to follow up on Tom's question. I was hoping you could talk a little
bit about what steps GM might be taking to counter this lull in its product cadence, and will that involve increased
marketing or more use of incentives?
<A - Mark L. Reuss>: There's a huge amount of tools in the toolbox for this. Marketing is much deeper than television
ads. So how we go to market and the effectiveness of our dollar spend in marketing to yield sales is something that we
work very hard on. We've also introduced things like the Cadillac Shield in the last week or two, which gets at a full
service package of customer retention and care for Cadillac. You're going to see us take the Ritz-Carlton experience for
Cadillac to the next level, into our field. We're starting that right now.
So I'm not sure that a pure incentive spend is something that would be working on as the only solution to anything. But
the whole holistic marketing, customer retention, and conquest piece of the business with things like OnStar, with
things like the Ritz-Carlton experience with Cadillac, with things like courtesy transportation for Buick, those are the
things that aren't maybe making as many headlines as anybody would like, but those are real customer retention and
conquest experiences that are inside of the numbers that you see for January and February. We're going to keep hitting
that as hard as we can.
One of my performance metrics with Dan is going after customer service retention and conquest. And so, you're going
to see us really ramp that up this year.
<Q - Christina Rogers>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's also good to remember that if you
launch in April, May, June, look back into the last half of '10 and what we launched with the Cruze, and – not that we
launched a whole – but the Chevy Equinox right now is hot. And so we've got products that are selling well that will
carry us into '12.
The product launches in '12, which are quite strong, they're really not only going to manifest themselves till late '12,
into '13. So we've got a lot of momentum coming out of '10, and, as Tom said, just – I don't think this is good for the
country necessarily or for the world economy, but the products we are launching in '11 are the right products, given the
ambient economic conditions around the globe. And that doesn't make me feel real good on one level, but it does – it's
a little bit – it eases some of the questions you might have.
<Q - Christina Rogers>: Okay, thank you.
Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Investor Relations and Financial
Communications
Okay. With that, we appreciate everyone's time this morning, and we'll talk to you with Q1 results. Thank you.
Daniel F. Akerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you all.
