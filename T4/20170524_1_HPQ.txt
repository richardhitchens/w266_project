Dion J. Weisler
Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.
I'm very pleased with our quarterly performance. It was a breakthrough quarter where we delivered year-over-year
growth in both Personal Systems and Print. As a company, we're performing across our portfolio, our regions, and our
key financial metrics. Over the last six quarters, we've been building momentum, improving our business fundamentals,
and delivering on what we said we would do. We're taking profitable share, out-executing our competitors and
delivering some of the best innovation, design and execution in HP's history.
Our goal is to consistently deliver on our financial commitments every quarter while setting the company up for
long-term success. We are strengthening our core business and delivering our milestones in our growth and future
initiatives. I'm proud of the results this quarter. Let me talk for a few of the highlights.
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, at the high-end of our outlook range. We grew net
revenue by 7% year over year to $12.4 billion driven by growth in Personal Systems and Print, the first time we've
delivered growth in both segments during the same quarter since Q4 of 2010. We delivered free cash flow of
approximately $400 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the first half of the fiscal year. Through the same
year-to-date time period, we returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and
dividends.
Looking at the business segment performance, Personal Systems continue to deliver and demonstrate how playing our
game drives strong results. The team once again drove revenue growth year over year and market share expansion. We
saw a small increase in operating profit dollars year over year at a time when significant component cost headwinds
have been pervasive across the industry.
This is a great example of how segmenting market opportunities, innovating and executing can yield amazing results.
For the second consecutive quarter, Personal Systems revenue grew by 10% year over year, and importantly, once
again, this is broad-based growth across all three regions, both Consumer and Commercial audiences, and in Notebooks
and Workstation categories.
In calendar quarter one, we beat the year-over-year PC market unit growth by 12 points, once again, outperforming all
key competitors and the market as a whole. We achieved 21.7% global market share and regained the number one PC
market position globally.
Remember that market share leadership is an outcome, not an objective. Our ability to gain profitable share is one of
the true measures of success. Today, security is top of mind for consumers and the board room alike. Just look at the
cyber security events over the past couple of weeks. With this backdrop, we continue to deliver the most secure and
manageable PCs in the world with powerful new commercial notebooks and desktops, including the including the
EliteBook x360 with HP Sure View and HP Sure Click.
As part of our world-class security stack, Sure View defends customers from visual hacking with a built-in electronic
privacy screen. HP Sure Click protects customers and organizations from web-based security threats, including
malware and other viruses that we are all seeing daily in the news. We also announced HP SureStart, the world's only
integrated browsing solution which protects our devices from malware.

In addition to security, mobility is a top priority for our customers and a differentiator for HP. At Mobile World
Congress, we introduced the latest HP Pro x2 with the design, security, and productivity features tailored for today's
mobile workforce. This discerning audience took notice, honoring the Pro x2 with several important awards, including
a category Best of Show, Top Pick, and Top Innovation.
While the PC market has been healthier than expected during the past few quarters, the market remains highly
competitive and volatile. Regardless of market conditions, I remain confident in our team's ability to deliver consistent
results through a relentless focus on innovation, market segmentation, and cost management. And whether it's a virtual
reality backpack, an OMEN Gaming system, a DreamColor display, or a premium PC, we are winning hearts and
minds with the sleekest and most desirable products we have ever created. I am truly proud of what we've achieved in
Personal Systems and energized by the focus, energy, and talent of our people who know how to combine innovation
with incredible execution.
Shifting to Printing, Enrique [Lores] and his team had a breakthrough quarter, with strong performance across multiple
dimensions, total revenue, supplies revenue, units, market share, and operating profit. Printing revenue grew 2% year
over year, with both hardware and supplies revenue growing in the same quarter for the first time since Q2 of 2011.
Units also grew year over year as did our market share while delivering operating profit expansion. It's been a long time
since we've been able to say that, especially in a single quarter, and we're excited to be igniting a real renaissance in
Printing.
With solid progress on our productivity initiatives, which lowers our overall cost structure, we remain better positioned
to competitively price and place more units with a positive NPV. Due in part, to our continued operational progress,
hardware units were up 4% in Q2, our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth.
The overall print hardware market was up slightly in calendar quarter one, a bit better than expected. We continued to
grow faster than the market with year-over-year profitable share gains in both our Home and Office businesses.
I'm pleased that our Supplies performance strengthened this quarter with revenue up 2% year over year. We continue to
pull the levers within the Four Box Model. And when combined with our operational progress, both are having a
favorable impact on the business.
In addition to improvements in our core Printing business, we have also booked momentum in strategic growth areas.
Our Graphics business delivered another strong performance with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency
for the 15th consecutive quarter. We saw balanced hardware revenue growth across the portfolio, as well as in Graphics
supplies and services. Similarly, we saw growth in contractual printing, with continued increases in new total contract
value for Managed Print Services. We also grew consumer enrollment in Instant Ink and continue to expand into new
geographies.
At the end of Q2, we began shipping our disruptive portfolio of A3 multifunction printers. In contrast to the established
copier players, our new A3 portfolio is expected to transform the copier experience for customers and service
professionals. Our differentiation includes a lower total cost of ownership, improved serviceability, and the most
advanced security and device uptime. Our journey is just beginning, and we are aggressively onboarding new partners
and attacking new opportunities in the $55 billion A3 copier market.
The acquisition of Samsung's printing business will further accelerate our A3 portfolio. We expect the transaction to
close in the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
Turning to 3D printing, this was our second quarter of product shipments, and the feedback from our customers and
partners is very encouraging. Across the board, we're building momentum and advancing the entire ecosystem. This
month, at RAPID, the largest 3D printing conference in the world, we announced a series of important milestones,
including: a reseller program with more than 30 partners; more than a dozen 3D reference and experience centers
across North America and Europe; a growing roster of manufacturing service bureaus and product development
customers implementing HP Jet Fusion 3D printing systems for production and new applications. And we expanded
our Open Materials Platform to include new partners like Henkel, a global leader in high-performance adhesive
technologies.

Also, just this past weekend, at the inaugural 3D Printing Industry Awards, HP's Multi Jet Fusion technology was
recognized as the Innovation of the Year. Disrupting the $12 trillion manufacturing sector and transforming industries
is a long-term vision and one that we are making concrete strategic progress on today. This is a multiyear journey, and
I'm confident in this team's ability to bring disruptive innovation to market, create and empower an ecosystem, and
redefine the economics of production manufacturing.
To summarize, Q2 was a breakthrough quarter for us with strong year-over-year performance across our segments and
regions. We're executing, meeting our commitments, and capitalizing on our momentum. We are also making the right
investment decisions for the long term. However, our work never ends. Every single day we must continue to amaze
our customers and partners with the most competitive and disruptive portfolio in our industry and provide them with
meaningful value and opportunity.
Change is a constant in our business, and to us, change equals opportunity. We know how to operate in up and down
markets that we will continue to face. And are prepared to tackle the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. By
embracing change, we have an opportunity to accelerate, to innovate, to improve and ultimately, to reinvent for our
customers, partners, employees and shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details and our financial outlook.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Dion.
Overall, I am also very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. We delivered net revenue of $12.4 billion,
up 7% year over year. Similar to the broad based performance we delivered last quarter, we saw strong momentum
globally with each region delivering top line growth year over year and both EMEA and APJ growing about 10% in
constant currency.
Gross margin of 19.2% was down 0.2 points year over year, driven primarily by strong Personal Systems growth and
higher commodity cost in Personal Systems, partially offset by Print margins. Sequentially, gross margin was up 1.5
points higher than normal seasonality driven by favorable print margins combined with strong sequential growth in
Printing and resulting segment mix.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were up 7% year over year. The expense increase was driven by SG&A
where the year-over-year reported growth was impacted by the gains or offsets to SG&A expense that were recognized
in FY 2016 for the divestiture of certain marketing optimization assets. In addition, SG&A increased year over year as
we drove more demand generation and marketing initiatives, primarily in Print. We also continued to invest more in
research and development year over year. These R&D investments are important drivers to fuel future innovation.
Net OI&E expense was $69 million for the quarter. As a reminder, in the year-over-year compare, last year we
recorded a onetime gain of about $0.03 in OI&E from a favorable litigation settlement. With a non-GAAP tax rate of
22% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per
share of $0.40. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $140
million and acquisition-related charges of $20 million, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits of
$35 million, tax indemnification credits of $5 million and the related tax impact on these charges. In Q2, GAAP diluted
net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.33.
Turning to the segments, Personal Systems net revenue was $7.7 billion, up 10% year over year. We saw strong
performance across both customer segments with Consumer revenue up 16% and Commercial up 7% year over year.
While share performance is not our first priority, our disciplined focus on market segmentation and innovation enabled
meaningful year-over-year unit and revenue share gains in calendar Q1 across Consumer and Commercial.
PC average selling prices were up year over year and sequentially driven by favorable pricing, and to a lesser extent, a
mix shift to premium, partially offset by currency. As we highlighted last quarter, we took pricing actions globally in

response to unfavorable currency and the increased cost of components. However, the potential impact on demand and
full benefit of these price increases takes time to play through, especially in Commercial.
As such, gross margins were down both year over year and sequentially in Q2 driven by the continued component cost
headwinds and currency which weren't fully mitigated by the higher average selling prices. The team delivered a 3.2%
operating profit margin, down 0.3 points year over year. We continue to make progress beyond the core with a focus on
strategic growth categories. In Q2, we saw strong growth in premium, commercial mobility and commercial services.
Turning to Printing. We remain on track to deliver operational improvements in the core business while making
progress on our growth initiatives. Revenue was $4.7 billion in the quarter, up 2% year over year. Hardware units were
up 4% year over year, with growth in our Consumer and Commercial categories, up 3% and 6%, respectively.
Our total unit growth includes HP Sprocket, our handheld photo printer, which continued to have strong demand and
contributed to our year-over-year metric. In calendar Q1, we gained share year over year in both our home and office
businesses with overall print share up 0.5 points.
Overall, Print hardware revenue was up 7% year over year, supported by increased volume and higher average selling
prices, driven by rate and mix improvements. We continue to be focused on improving our cost structure, which will
enable us to place more NPV positive units. Driving these positive NPV unit placements is one of the many levers to
help ensure ongoing Supplies revenue stabilization.
In our growth initiatives, Graphics had another strong quarter, growing revenue across all regions in nearly all product
categories with strong performance in Indigo. Managed Print Services' new TCV was again up year over year. And as
Dion highlighted, we shipped our first new A3 printers at the end of Q2 and look forward to scaling the business in the
quarters ahead.
In Q2, total Supplies revenue was up 2% nominally and in constant currency, the first quarter of year-over-year
constant currency growth since Q2 2013. The year-over-year increase associated with the Four Box Model drivers was
better than we expected. We have clear line of sight to supply stabilization and expect second half Supplies revenue
growth to be flat to slightly up year over year in constant currency and adjusted for last year's changes to the supply
sales model.
Supplies revenue mix was 67%, flat year over year and channel inventory remains below our reduced ceiling. We saw
good improvement in Printing operating profit at 17.4%, up 0.1 point year over year and 1.4 points sequentially.
Margin increases were driven by favorable rate due a mix shift to the high-end of Consumer and ongoing cost structure
improvements, partially offset by increased marketing spend and investments in key growth initiatives.
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation, cash flow from operations was $455 million in Q2 and approximately
$1.2 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was $380 million in the quarter and approximately $1.1 billion year-to-date.
As highlighted last quarter, we had expected Q2 free cash flow to be below Q1 primarily due to the sequential changes
in revenue volume and mix from our respective segments.
The cash conversion cycle was negative 30 days, flat sequentially. Quarter-to-quarter, we saw a 2-day increase in day
sales outstanding driven by less favorable revenue linearity, which is more typical of normal seasonality. Days
inventory increased 4 days primarily driven by strategic buys to help assure component supply. And finally, we saw a
6-day increase in days of payable driven by purchasing linearity and more normal sequential changes.
On a full year basis, we remain confident that the revenue linearity improvements we saw in the first half resulting
from changes to our supply sales model are structural improvements. Therefore, we continue to expect that our free
cash flow could be at the higher end of our $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion outlook for the year.
During the quarter, we had a total capital return of $447 million through share repurchases and cash dividend.
Year-to-date, we have returned 95% of free cash flow as compared to our full year target of 50% to 75%. So we remain
well on track to deliver on this commitment.

Looking ahead, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. For the full year, we are on track to deliver
our productivity initiatives, as announced at SAM. We have accelerated the timing of certain restructuring charges from
fiscal 2018 where the incremental 2017 GAAP expenses will be offset by lower 2018 GAAP expenses. Many of these
restructuring charges are lumpy in nature and the timing is more difficult to predict which leads to keeping a wider full
year GAAP outlook range relative to our narrowed non-GAAP range.
In Personal Systems, we have increased pricing globally in response to the increase cost of components and
unfavorable currency impact which could have a more significant impact on demand and operating margins than we've
assumed.
For Printing, we expect Supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in the second half in constant currency and adjusted
for last year's Supplies sale model change. We also expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV.
With all that in mind, Q3 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.40. to $0.43. Q3 2017
GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. We are raising our
full year fiscal 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.66. And our full year
fiscal 2017 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. It's nice to see both PCs and Printing growing again. So, my first
question is on the PC market. I'd like to follow-up on the comments regarding price increases. What are you seeing
initially from the market and perhaps on a geographic basis? And then also, what are you seeing from your
competitors? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Shannon, let me start with what we did. So, we increased prices in both Q1 and Q2. In
Q2, what we saw was that Consumer price increase basically take and flow-through in the quarter, so it has a much
quicker impact than on the Commercial side. Commercial, that takes some time to actually work through the system so
we didn't see that as much in Q2. We do expect that we will see the price increase flow-through in Q3. But, the flipside
of that is of course we didn't see the demand impact either of that price increase. So, at this point in time, there's a little
bit of uncertainty as to what we will see kind of into Q3 and Q4 from those price increases in Commercial.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And Shannon, the only other thing I would add is that I think we saw this relatively early. I
believe I mentioned it a couple of quarters ago. And as a result of that, the first thing we did was went and sured up
supply for the full year because we wanted to make sure that we're able to fulfill the demand that we're seeing flow
through the pipeline. With that said, it becomes a constant daily set of work that the team does to continue to work
costs down in other areas of the business in the complete bill of materials, in the workflow that we drive every single
day. So, we saw this coming. I think we reacted to it and we're leveraging our balance sheet to ensure that we have
surety of supply.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thanks. And then, second question is just on the Printing operating margin. Supplies seem
to be improving a little bit ahead of schedule, which obviously is going to benefit margins. But I'm curious how you
think about sort of the balance of flow through of investment of those dollars into 3D printing, A3, other growth
initiative versus letting it fall to the bottom line. So how are you balancing that and how should we think about
operating margin as you go through the year? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I think the way to think about it, and we talked about this before, is that we expected
the Print operating margin which have historically been in the mid-teens will continue to be in the mid-teens. That's

kind of 15% to 18% and that the variability within that range is largely going to be driven by the opportunity to place
more units.
For 2017 specifically, we're very focused on our productivity initiatives and bringing those – realizing those as we
progress through the year. We are also taking some of the savings, a lot of the savings frankly, that we're getting from
lower discount dollars around Supplies, directly related to the supply sales model change that we made last year, and
we're basically reinvesting those back into marketing. We told you, we were going to do that and that that is in fact
what is happening. We're doing that in order to drive Print relevancy, drive more Print and also to drive preference for
HP-branded Supplies.
And then finally, we are investing. We're investing in A3, we're investing in Graphics and we're investing in 3D.
Operator
And our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Milunovich>: Thank you. Cathie, on the supply side. Just to clarify, again, you talked about flat to up in
the second half including the adjustment from last year. So, I take that to mean that the reported number will be
something up like 5%. I just want to clarify that. And do you have any view on what the longer term Supplies growth
rate is likely to be or will there be any growth from Supplies?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: No, to the first part of your question, the second half, yes, the reported numbers will be
higher from a growth perspective in the second half because we had such a significant adjustment to channel
inventories in last year's second half.
And in terms of kind of the longer term view of Supplies, I think one of the things that we've been saying pretty
consistently is that getting to supply stabilization in constant currency, and again, adjusted for these sales model
changes is the first milestone. It's not that in Q1 we then breathe a sigh of relief and we don't have to do it again. So, we
recognize that we are at a minimum, maintaining the stabilization in constant currency in Supplies over our longer time
period, exactly what that's going to like and we'll talk more at our Security Analyst Meeting later on in the fall.
<Q - Steven Milunovich>: Okay. And Dion, I wanted to ask you about the A3 market. I think you've said that you're
not really a player unless you had about a 10% market share. Do you have a sense of when you're going to get there?
And are you finding that you're able to develop the channels that you need?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: So, I will reaffirm that I think to be relevant in any marketplace that you want to have at least a
10% market share. Then you become relevant to channel – particularly in a channel driven business, you become
relevant to those channel partners and relevant to customers. And so, we want to get there as quickly as possible.
Having said that, we've only just started to ship our range of A3 products, and we are excited by the reaction to the
products that we've already delivered. The pipeline is very healthy. We are on boarding both existing partners and a
very new universe of partners that we've never transacted with, in the past.
The additional benefit of that is as we take on these new channel partners, we're finding additional A4 opportunities
within the new partner base and within customers that we've never dealt with in the past because they have a blended
mix of A3 and A4. So, this is ongoing work. Its early days. I'm excited by what I'm seeing across the globe in terms of
the commitment to driving our A3 business and we'll continue to remain focused on it.
Operator
Our next question is Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Cathie, you beat our free cash flow estimates

the component environment will stay tight, so I imagine inventory remains high. I know there's an SAP upgrade that
you're either in the midst of or is upcoming. Are there any dynamics in the back half that keep you conservative on the
free cash flow? Then, I have a follow-up.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I don't think there's anything that is out of the ordinary that's coming up in the back half
that is keeping us conservative, to use your words. I think it's more that we typically don't update our free cash flow
guidance in the year. We put out a range out there and we stick to it, and then we give a little bit of color. And so the
color that I've given is that, frankly, I do think we could be at the higher end, and we'll see.
Now there's also a lot of volatility in free cash flow as a result of what the business does. So if you've got Print – in this
quarter, we had Print increasing sequentially much more than is their normal pattern. Similarly, we had Personal
Systems out of their norm as well. They decreased more than is the norm. And so that can have a pretty big swing or a
pretty big impact on free cash flow. So there is a little bit of that that we're playing through as well. That could mean
that we could be higher. It could mean that we are a bit lower in the range.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Okay, understood. And as a follow-up, what percentage of the PC and Printer business
is now as a service? And are there any implications as it relates to CapEx or timing of payments from customers that
could change the free cash flow model longer term? Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So the contractual piece of our business is not that significant today to be putting any real
pressure on free cash flow or on CapEx in general, so I don't think that that's a concern of ours. It is moving in the
direction. It is growing and we like the fact that it's growing, but we don't see a significant impact from it in fiscal 2017.

Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I have one for you, Cathie, and one for Dion. So just you had talked
about how we should think about adjusting Supplies growth rate for drawdowns in channel inventory. And last year in
fiscal Q2, you said that Supplies were negatively impacted by 7% from a drawdown in channel inventory, which would
point to about a $250 million drawdown in inventory last year in Q2. So if we add that back to last year, it actually
looks like on an inventory-adjusted basis, Supplies were down 5% or 6% this quarter in Q2. Is that the right way to
think about it, or were there some Supplies inventory drawdowns this quarter?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So there were also year-on-year inventory drawdowns this quarter. If you think about the
fact that we did that pretty significant step down in channel inventory Q3 and Q4 of last year and then we have
continued to keep channel inventory at those levels or even a little bit lower. I think in Q1 I mentioned that
sequentially, we were down in terms of WOS [Weeks of Supply], we're down again both year over year and
sequentially. And so there is a little bit of an add-back as a result of those drawdowns in channel inventory.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. We can take it offline, but I think unless it came down this quarter, it doesn't
really matter because I'm comparing 13 weeks of sell-out this quarter versus effectively 12 weeks of sell-out last
quarter, and that's where I get the differential. If it came down in the interim, I don't think it really matters. But I'm
happy to debate that offline.
Dion, on my second question, you've done a great job in PCs and being a sustainable share gain or I think it's been like
almost 20 quarters. Your strong growth right now is benefiting from really good share gains, but the market is still
pretty weak. And quite frankly, your year-over-year comparison was pretty easy. It was minus 10%. So as we look to
the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter when the Personal Systems comparison goes to plus 4% and
you've expressed some hesitation about price increases and how that might impact demand, is it realistic to think that
HP can continue to grow PC revenues in the third and fourth quarters? And how do we think about the trade-off
between like a 4% operating margin or revenue growth in your eyes and how do you think about that? Thank you.

<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Thanks for the question, Toni. Let me just say that, as you know, we don't guide revenue, but
what I will tell you is that we don't broadly disagree with how the industry analysts view the PC market. We look back
18 months ago and we're in double-digit declines, and since that time the market's been steadily improving to the point
where it grew this quarter. And depending on which analyst you speak to, they're in the range of between minus 2%
and plus 2%, and we don't broadly disagree with that range through the remainder of the year.
What I will say is that I'm very confident in our team's ability to out-execute the market and out-execute our
competitors. And we do that with a fairly complex formula of segmenting the market, segmenting it again, finding the
pockets of growth within the market using fairly sophisticated heat maps and understanding where we believe the heat
is going to be in the market.
And we know that we can't cut our way to glory, that we need to innovate our way to success, so we spend a lot of time
and energy on innovation that matters to our customers. We spend a lot of – as a good example, a lot of energy on
security, multiple levels of security, below the operating system, at the operating system, above the operating system,
and we're seeing that really resonate with our customers right there. If you look at the last couple of weeks where
there's been a lot of global security concerns, and we've got a tremendous answer for that and we're being rewarded for
that innovation that we build into the product.
So you can expect to see us continue to innovate. You can expect to see us continue to take costs out of the business.
You can expect to see us continue to segment, drive to where the heat is in the market. It's a formula that's been
working well for us, as you pointed out at the start of your remarks. And I think when we do that, in a market that is
minus 2% to plus 2% depending on where you go, I think we can outperform the market.

Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thanks very much and great results. Cathie, you mentioned that you're raising your full-year
non-GAAP EPS, which is good to see, but the GAAP has gone lower. And you mentioned something about
restructuring. Is that accelerating, pulling them into this year, and then you're going to see the benefits sooner than
expected, or how should we think about why there's a disconnect there and about the timing of the benefits as such?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. So yes, we are pulling in restructuring from fiscal 2018 or at least some charges. I
think the way to think about it is that we're pulling in charges from 2018 into 2017 and that is impacting on the GAAP
number. But it's also – we've also got a wider GAAP range. And the reason we've got that is that some of these charges
can be determined – you determine what quarter you take them in by some very specific accounting rules. And
sometimes that tips the scale as to what quarter it fits in.
And I'll give you a really good example. This quarter, we closed – we announced that we are closing Irish
manufacturing. And there was this very detailed list of things that you had to check the box on in order to recognize the
charge this quarter. It just as easily could have been basically recognized next quarter. If that happens in Q4, then we
have something that falls out or we have something that falls in. So we've got a much wider range from a GAAP
perspective but in the big scheme of things, we are pulling in some of the restructuring charges into 2017.
In terms of the benefits, really what we've talked about is that this restructuring program, is a three-year program
roughly $300 million to $500 million worth of charges over that time period. We still believe that we will be in that
range. And that the savings on a full year basis would be $200 million to $300 million a year beginning in FY 2020 and
that we continue to believe that's the case.

<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you. I have just a couple of clarifications on margins going forward. On the
Printing margins, it sounds like the Supplies should be higher in the revenue mix. So, should we expect Printing
margins over the back half of the year to expand from this level or are there other puts and takes we should be aware
of?
And on the PC margins, is the current run-rate reflective of the tightness in the cost and the component cost
environment? And would you say this is a new base or are there cost initiatives that could tick that up and ASPs
increase and should help going forward? Or how should we think about the direction of those margins in the back half
of the year? Many thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Okay, so from a Print perspective, we still expect that the Print margins will stay in kind
of the mid teens, 15% to 18%. The offset to what you're talking about in terms of maybe a bit of a tailwind from a
Supplies perspective is the fact that we want to place as many NPV positive units, so that we keep the flywheel effect
of placing units, getting supplies, placing units and getting supplies going. So, that's kind of the optimization of the area
under the curve that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting.
On the Personal Systems margins, some of the things you should think about, one is the Commercial price increases
haven't really shown up yet in Q2, expect them to show up more in Q3, but we also are expecting there could be some
demand response to that. And then, on top of that, the commodity cost increased pretty significantly year over year and
quarter-on-quarter in Q2. We expect that they are going to continue to increase albeit, at a slower rate in Q3. So there
will be an incremental headwind as a result of those commodity costs going up in Q3.
And then, we are just – at a total company level, we've talked a lot about $1 billion in productivity initiatives that we've
got going and they ramp – they are ramping and are more back end loaded which we've been talking about most of the
year.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And just additional clarification to Toni's question, the annual question. We haven't really
changed our view on the PC business. We think it's in the range between 3% and 4%.

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot guys. I guess couple of questions for me as well. Cathie, could you just talk
about the cash conversion cycle and how do you expect that to track in the back half? And I guess looking at accounts
payable getting to 100 days, is that something that's sustainable in your opinion? And on the other side of thing,
inventory days went up as well, so do you think these just normalize each other and offset in the back half or is there
room for conversion to actually improve, especially the DPO stay north of 100?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. So I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making from a cash flow
perspective. We, over the last probably a year-ish, have been really driving cash flow in the company, at just about
every level in the company. So employees really understand the importance of free cash flow, they understand what
role they play in helping us to drive free cash flow. And I think of those as being really sustainable.
Secondly, we did make a change to our supply sales model last year, and that is driving better linearity – real structural
better linearity, linearity in the quarter that mirrors the demand that we're seeing. And that has also then provided
benefit because we're basically shipping revenues early in the quarter beyond the fact that we also do it at a lower
discount level. And so, that's real structural improvement.
In the outlook that we've provided for free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, and like I said, I think frankly we
could be at the higher end as a result of the Supplies change that we made. What's assumed in that is that our cash
conversion cycle is flattish, maybe down a day or two within that range. And so I think that's the way to think about. Is
it sustainable? It's probably going to be in the minus 28 to minus 30 days range.

<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess when you talk about the Printing segment margin
and you've set 15% to 18% as a target. Is that a reasonable target once the Samsung assets are rolled in and integrated
as well or does that kind of dilute that a little bit at least in the initial part of it once you get the deal?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Samsung is in investment mode right now. As we talked about when we announced
the Samsung deal, and then we also said on the call is that we would expect that the deal would be accretive in the first
full year. So, it starts out in investment mode and then kind of ramps from there. And that is not included in obviously
any of our fiscal 2017 outlook at this point in time.

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Yes, thank you. Dion, maybe you could talk about what you're seeing in HP Original Supplies
attach, how that has evolved over the past year or so. How much more room do you see over the next few years in
driving increased attach given the sort of relatively high significance to your strategy over the past several years?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: It's a great question. Thank you, Wamsi. And I think about the entire Four Box Model when I
think about our Supplies business and its stabilization. And so, I'll comment a little bit on each of the levers. I mean, the
Four Box Model continues to predict Supplies revenue will stabilize in constant currency and adjusted for the change in
the Supplies' sales model by the end of 2017.
It's also performed in line with or better than our expectations we had at the beginning of each of the four prior
quarters. And recall that we changed the Supplies sales model due to the increased impact of the omnichannel
environment and believe that this would be a more efficient model. And it's certainly proven to be a more efficient
model. Our execution of the demand-driven change is seeing improved sell-out linearity, we're holding less weeks of
stock in the channel inventory both year over year and quarter over quarter, as Cathie mentioned.
And we're achieving the cost savings that we previously had put towards discount dollars and that's supporting an
increase in the marketing to drive the Print relevance. And that's really at the center of your question that the increase in
the marketing dollars and the stable environment out there is enabling us to sell the value of Original Supplies and as a
result of that that has an impact on that particular box.
But we're making improvements in all four areas. The install base continues to improve in terms of size and shape,
usage. We have a lot of focus on usage obviously in terms of our marketing spend, and also in the change of the
different models that we have, Managed Print Services and Instant Ink, of course, impact the box that you're talking
about, the Original Supplies when we sell a Managed Print Service contract and Instant Ink, it comes with increased HP
Original Supplies. And so, we're happy about that and obviously maintaining a uniform price environment is helpful.
So, I think on many dimensions, the results we're starting to see flow through the Printing business are as a result of the
work that the team's been doing across all four boxes and the one that you mentioned is obviously a big part of that.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And maybe I'll throw another data point. So, Graphics continues to grow both nominally
and in constant currency. So, the Graphics growth in Supplies, specifically, was kind of low to mid single-digits on the
back of about a double-digit improvement in pages printed and impressions. And so, that continues to be part of the
strategy as well as we talked about core growth in future in the growth category is Graphics, and we're continuing to
make good progress there.

Printing. Is there something else that you're being maybe careful with in terms of peaking market share momentum,
maybe some channel dynamics that have you a little concerned when you look at the mix of the channel sell-through is
better or other I guess would be the question?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Mark, I think we're being prudent in our outlook. I don't think that we see anything
specifically looming that is making us be more conservative than we have typically been. There are a lot of different
things going on in the market, all of which are not easy to call. The uncertainty in the PC market around commodity
pricing, commodity availability, the demand impact of raising prices, those are tied to some of the things that weigh on
the market. And therefore, we're trying to take that into consideration.
We're also trying to take into consideration just the uncertainty that exists in the currency market. On a year-over-year
basis, currency has not been too big of an impact on the top line, a little bit more on the bottom line, but understanding
what the impact's going to be of U.S. policies and even the full impact of Brexit, there's enough uncertainties out there
that we think that it's prudent that our outlook is prudent.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Okay, fair enough. The follow-up question is around Katy's question earlier in terms of
as-a-service. Can you give us a sense in terms of how investors should think about that business vector being
potentially material for both Printing and/or PCs? Is that 2018 or is it more of a 2020 phenomenon?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I think it's a longer-term phenomenon. We are making progress for sure. We are seeing
the move from transactional to contractual, but it is not at a rate that says it's going to be typically really material. And
we'll talk more about this at the security analyst meeting when we talk a little bit longer term. It's definitely a trend in
the market. We think it's good for us over the long term, but it is not going to have a material impact in the short term.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: The last data points I've seen on this, and it's going back a little way, not too far back, was that
there was a 6-point swing from transactional motions to contractual motions, faster in mature markets than emerging
markets. I would say that again, like most of the areas where we focus on, we're out-executing the industry average on
that. And as a result of that, our pipeline is growing steadily for Device-as-a-Service, Mobility-as-a-Service, obviously
Managed Print Services, where 10 years into that journey already it's quite mature for us.
So I expect it is an ongoing customer trend. More and more customers want to have a contractual relationship. And
when we provide them the capability to do that across their Personal Systems and Print platforms, it's always a different
kind of conversation. So I expect it is a trend that will continue. But as Cathie mentions, it doesn't become absolutely
material for some time in the future.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Managed Print Services revenue is growing low to mid-single digit. So the trend is there,
but it's just not an exponential increase.

And our final question for today will come from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. So part of the bear thesis is that the print market is in secular decline, yet you've
still been able to place high NPV printers now pretty consistently. Is there a point where you think you won't be able to
place any more of these printers and we start to see those profits slow down, or has there been a change in the secular
story in the broader print market? And then I have a follow up.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I would say that, generally speaking, the answer always lies much more deeply down in the
segmentation, that you can't tackle the Print market with a single brush. Obviously, there were areas of clear secular
decline in the consumer market, and we said we don't think it's likely. We said it back at SAM. We don't think it's likely
that we can turn that market back into growth, but our job is to reduce the glide slope of descent. And I think with the
new range of consumer printing devices we brought to market, introducing brand-new categories like Sprocket, which
is doing incredibly well, and attracting customers that have never printed before. Many millennials that have had their
photos trapped in their phone are now able to free them by having a Sprocket in their pocket, and that's goodness for

the category.
And obviously, we remain focused on the high-quality NPV units. We're getting a lot more big data. We're leveraging
that big data to understand exactly where we're going to make those investments. And I think that segmentation and
pockets of growth and opportunity of growth will continue in the market. And let's not forget, we are very new entrants
into the A3 copier market. That's a $55 billion market, and we have less than 4% market share. So that is why we have
a strategy that has a core element to it, the vast majority of our revenue and operating profit today, but a very clear
growth element to it in terms of Graphics and A3 and commercial mobility, and we see that playing out over the next
two to three years.
And then adding to the future with Blended Reality, Immersive Computing on the one hand and 3D printing on the
other provides us opportunity for long-term growth really 10 years plus out.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Thanks. And if we look across your businesses, you should have an improving mix shift to
higher-margin businesses. Some of the ones you mentioned in the past like the accessories, the displays, gaming,
commercials, graphics, obviously we know the size of some of these. But are all of these, the other businesses at a level
of scale that can now help you to move the needle for you on margins? And how much runway do you think you have
for growth in these businesses? Thanks.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I think if we take by way of example the Personal Systems market, it's a $333 billion market,
but about half of that market is the non-core stuff that most of us think and talk about, notebooks and desktops and
detachables and convertibles. The other half of the market is thin clients and services and accessories and displays. And
in many of those markets, we're underpenetrated and in many of those markets, they come at higher margin. So as we
index our way up into that part of the market, it's a very clear strategy of Ron and his team as we execute against our
Personal Systems. And that helps offset the higher pressured areas of some parts of the core business and the same is
true for Printing, as we just highlighted.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And then the other thing that's going on in Personal Systems in kind of what we think of
as the core business is there's a positive mix shift going on and that leads to kind of units increasing or decreasing at a
different rate than what revenue is, and we have been ahead of that positive mix shift. And so, if you looked at IDC's
kind of revenue growth for PCs in calendar Q1, it was up more than unit, so units were up 0.8 points. They expect for
the rest of the year that units will be down a bit but that revenue will be flat. And as I said, we're ahead of that trend,
and so, we're benefiting and basically gaining rev share.
Dion J. Weisler
So thank you for the questions and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Continue to gain in confidence
quarter after quarter as the team embraces change and turns that change into opportunity. I characterize the quarter as a
breakthrough quarter for us, delivering growth in both segments, Printing and Personal Systems. Again, that's the first
time since FY 2010.
We're taking profitable share, we're out-executing our competitors and we're delivering some of the best innovation I
think this company has ever seen. But we remain humbled by that. Every day we must continue to amaze customers
with the most competitive, disruptive portfolio on the planet. And we're playing offense, and I think that's the right
place for us to be. And I think our most innovative days and best days lay ahead of us. Thanks very much for joining
