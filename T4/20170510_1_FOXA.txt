providing information that has been publicly announced.
And with that, I am pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.
Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. I apologize for a cold that I have.
We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest
core earnings per share in the company's history. This record result reflects continued positive progress across our
businesses, with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our Cable Networks and Television segments. And
whilst earnings at the film studio decreased when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior
year, when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust nonetheless.
Importantly, we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities: through growing the distribution
of our video brands on both traditional and demand-emergent platforms; through innovating digital advertising
products and partnerships, such as OpenAP; and most critically, through delivering outstanding storytelling, sports, and
news broadcasting. In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continue to be
differentiators for us, with over half the company's advertising revenues earned in these genres.
Of course, we had an incredible Super Bowl, but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on FBC and for
MLS Soccer on FOX Sports 1, which for the first time beat ESPN2 for an entire month in February.
Additionally, viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong, with Major League
Baseball leading the way. Yankee ratings are up 39% over last season, and the Atlanta Braves ratings are up over 54%
this season so far. The business is in great shape, with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed.
Not to be outdone, Fox News is the number one basic cable channel in both total day and primetime viewing for 61
consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest-rated quarter ever, rating strength we expect to
continue.
In scripted programming, our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continue to produce groundbreaking new
series that drive the long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion, and
Feud, adding to the network's reputation as a creative powerhouse.
National Geographic has made great progress in its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The
recent Genius premiere from producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, NatGeo's first scripted anthology series, drew
over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone, and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic
international channels.
The FOX Broadcasting Network's mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all, but we are
encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this
Monday. Of course, the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for its shows, and it is
important to consider these two businesses together.
20th Century Fox Television is coming off a stellar 2016 – 2017 broadcast season. This past year, our TV studio
produced the number one show on five different networks, including Empire on FOX, American Crime Story on FX,
Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC, and American Dad on TBS.
The solid performance of our film studio, with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures, underscores the
range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate with
Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, coming later this month, followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July,
Kingsman: The Golden Circle in September, and The Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced
the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2, something my young boys are wildly looking forward to, but which they won't be
allowed to watch.

Turning to our international businesses, the financial impact of the Indian demonetization, we believe, is behind us, but
the financial impact has obscured impressive operational progress. Most notably, STAR India is increasing its
viewership lead over our competitors, and the continued rise and rise of Hotstar as the emerging platform of choice in
India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes.
The company continues to attract great new leaders, such as Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO; and
Marianne Gambelli, who has joined us as President of Fox News's Advertising Sales, and we welcome them to the
company.
We feel good about where we are and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating
us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses.
With that, I'll hand it over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone.
Today we reported another strong quarter of financial results, posting double-digit gains in adjusted earnings per share
and growth in EBITDA, despite the very difficult year-on-year comparisons at our Film segment, which Lachlan
referred to.
Third quarter revenues increased $336 million, or 5%, to $7.56 billion, led by higher advertising revenues at the
Television segment from the broadcast of this year's Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Network
segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year, reflecting
double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single-digit growth at the Cable Networks, offset in part by
lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811
million, or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other, net, which primarily
represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending Sky transaction. Excluding the net
income effect in both years of other, net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter
adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The Cable Network segment
reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion, up 5% on revenue growth of 2%, with total segment expenses pretty much
unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6%, led by affiliate fee growth of 8%, which reflects
higher average rates across all of our brands.
Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year, as increases from the rating strength at Fox News and at FS1 were
offset by reductions from the non-channel businesses at NatGeo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal
to the prior year, as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming, most notably the planned
investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at NatGeo, as well as
contractual sports rights step-ups.
Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as lower advertising and syndication revenues were
partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were, as expected, down 18%
versus the prior year, principally due to the absence of STAR's prior-year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and
Asia Cup Cricket tournaments, and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative. Now, while
the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by
approximately $20 million. Reported international EBITDA contribution increased 44%, primarily due to the lower
sports programming costs at STAR and affiliate fee growth.

At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases
of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year's Super Bowl, where we generated
approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday, and from continued retransmission consent
revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the
absence of American Idol.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below a year ago. This quarter's very solid
earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures, and higher television production
contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland. The comparisons to last year's third quarter,
as Lachlan mentioned, are challenging, since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of
Deadpool and the home entertainment release of The Martian.
These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year as well
as from the quarterly timing of SVOD sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter. And finally,
from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to accumulate cash, reflecting our priority to point our capital toward the
planned acquisition of Sky.
And with that, let me turn it over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks very much, John, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
So as you've heard, the first nine months of the fiscal year have been strong and we've made good progress on a number
of fronts. But I'd just like to spend a minute or two addressing some of the key things we've been seeing in the
marketplace and share some thoughts on our priorities going forward. So a few points to make on the following
subjects: the advertising trends and performance; the distribution universe for our video brands; and the velocity of the
business in terms of revenue that might not be so obvious at first glance.
So first of all, we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter, which grew 16% companywide year
over year. Now obviously, as mentioned, the Super Bowl was a major contributor, which was offset in part by the lack
of both the Asia Cup and ICC T20 championships at STAR, which we had in the comparable quarter last year, and
softer demand due to the effect of demonetization, as John mentioned, and the absence of American Idol at FBC, which
had its final run on FOX last year.
But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brands saw good advertising growth, with only the National
Geographic Channel down, which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about
earlier. National scatter remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we'd like, particularly autos. But a
month into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high single-digit growth for both our domestic and international
cable portfolios.
As for the distribution landscape, a few highlights. Domestically, as John mentioned, we saw affiliate income growth
year on year of about 8%, an acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter, as planned. We
expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year. The U.S. paid subscriber base for us was up
slightly, about 0.5%. But obviously, we saw some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year over
year, which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter.
In fact, everywhere we look, we see a landscape of opportunity, as downstream distribution becomes more innovative
and competitive. Despite renewed market commentary over the last weeks, we remain of the view that innovation and
competition from new entrants and incumbent operators will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital
rebundling drives overall universe growth.
At STAR, we continued to grow at a good pace, but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affects this quarter's
comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable

affiliate revenue, so we're comping very nicely against a very high bar. This year we grew affiliate revenue in every key
region, with some of the pace at FOX Network Group's international channels slowing due to some local events, such
as the closure of two distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia. And the Hotstar platform in
India continues to make strides, expanding its watch time over the prior-year quarter by 220%, making it, by some
estimates, about 14 times the watch time for Netflix.
In Europe, Asia, and Latin America, we've introduced innovative non-linear packages to each of their regions under the
labels FOX Plus and FOX Premium, all tailored for its specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better
experience, and ultimately for us making a better business. And in the U.S., the digital MVPD revolution has only now
reached the starting line.
So taken all together, if we exclude the Film segment, which obviously didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue
globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip, and it's a testament to the diversity and breadth of the
business geographically and by mix. And year to date, our EBITDA is up 11%, which underscores how all this comes
together with a durable velocity underlying the business.
I want to reiterate that our strategy, a focus on big brands that matter for customers, an investment on screen that
clearly differentiates and earns attention, and a program of work to make our programming and products more
available, not less, is paying dividends. Our business has been an expression of the technological advances shaping our
industry from way back, from silent movies to talkies, from feature film exhibition to broadcast television, and from
broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV.
And the underlying technological advances today, ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end
user connected displays, and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally,
presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms.
We think this is only just the beginning, and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content
business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing. In
short, if content is indeed king, then using it to build platforms that are an expression of these current underlying trends
presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades.
Now, before closing, I'd like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy,
recently reporting good financial performance, with subscriber growth across the group. Last month, we welcomed the
decision by the European Commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction, and we continue to work with
UK regulators and we're confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year, as
we've said before.
Thanks very much, and we're happy to take any questions you may have. Reed?

[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for James. Given that you're the last major media company to
report, and we appreciate the update on your subscriber trends, no one yet has framed how big the virtual MVPD
universe is currently. So could you tell us in aggregate how big virtual subs have been for you in the past quarter and

what was the number a quarter ago? So just give us a sense of within your trends, how much is the virtual MVPD
business helping stabilize your core subscriber trends.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Michael. So, first of all, I don't want to get into disclosing individual partners
of ours, paid customer numbers, but I would say that it is very, very early days. And really I think mostly for us the
thing that I'd point out is, number one, the inclusion of our core brands and the investment in those core brands that
we've been making over the last couple of years has really worked in terms of inclusion in new virtual MVPDs, and
every major one, all – pretty much all of our brands are there. And we see that growing pretty fast over the next number
of quarters and years.
But to date, it's a pretty small number, because you really have really just DIRECTV NOW and Sling in the quarter,
and a little bit of Sony. But it's really now I think the increased competition, YouTube launching after this quarter, I
think it was just in April, and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So
what's really driving this more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands, and some of our brands are less
mature and we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD
subscriber base as well. And I think actually only one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Michael, I'd add to what James said, and James also touched upon in his prepared
remarks. The really pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all of the emerging key MVPDs are, and
they're targeting different segments of the consumer audience. So between DIRECTV NOW and Sling TV, YouTube,
obviously Hulu and PlayStation Vue, they're all very different services, and we think this is incredibly important,
because not only are they designed – or many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPD subscriber numbers
and losses, but they're targeting entirely new segments of the U.S. households. Segments that don't – that have
broadband now, but potentially don't have a traditional MVPD. So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence, as James
mentioned in his remarks, that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditional MVPDs, but will
actually grow the universe quite significantly over time.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay, thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Go next to John Janedis with Jeffries. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you, one for John I think. On the Cable Networks, there was obviously a lot of movement
on the cost front. So as you look out to – I don't know – even the June quarter or beyond, are there more sports rights
costs or incremental investments we should be thinking about or are you entering more of a normalized kind of the
mid-singles type of growth going forward?
<A - John P. Nallen>: We'll see, I'm only looking forward to the fourth quarter, John, but as I do, we'll see mid-single
on the domestic side, which is the continued investment in NatGeo and FX for the programming, but we don't have a
big sports step-up having domestically. But uniquely international, we have a big Cricket event in STAR, the
Champions Trophy. So we'll see a touch – we'll see a higher growth in that quarter uniquely for that event. Otherwise
our expenses should be in that mid-single zone.

<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. I was hoping for some more detail on India, James. A competitor
highlighted yesterday that the Indian marketplace is challenging and they were pleased they had low exposure. And
obviously, it conflicts with your commentary, the prepared remarks. Can you talk about the trajectory towards the
long-term target of $1 billion of profitability and at what point Hotstar is cannibalistic? And any other thoughts on the
marketplace relative to that other point of view would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: So, thanks, Doug. Look, we're very enthusiastic about our business in India. I think
what we're seeing there today, as Lachlan mentioned, an increased level of leadership in terms of our entertainment
share. Our sports business is really going from strength to strength, since we acquired the half of the ESPN STAR
Sports joint venture a number of years ago and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace. It's been very, very
successful, not just in Cricket, but also with Kabaddi and with the Indian Super League, the soccer league there, really
rounding out the schedule. So we feel very good about it.
When I look at the marketplace, we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization, as John mentioned. We're
largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter, and we're at the run rate that we need to be at
to get to our targets at this point. So we feel on target. We feel like the business is in pretty robust health. Creatively,
it's performing very, very well. And we feel confident about the Indian environment generally.
I did note some of those comments. I heard about that, and I was surprised because at least from our business
perspective, we take the view that you go into a market like India in the expectation that in success, it's really going to
change your life. So you really don't go anything other than the whole hog, and that has really paid off well. We have a
very profitable and exciting business there, and I think it speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the
media sector today.
When I look at the all the varied performance, I think I'd urge you to think about all of these firms with different
strengths and weaknesses, and our business has been on a very clear path about investing in these big brands around the
world, being global first, getting exposure to markets that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us,
and investing on screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible content experience they can have.
And maybe that's different from other players.

<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Doug. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
We have a question from Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please go ahead. It appears we've lost Ms. Reif's line. One
moment, we'll go with Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks and good afternoon. I have two, one for James and one for John. James, I just
wanted to ask about the appointment of Joe Marchese as the head of ad sales. You've talked about a new model. And
given his background in advanced advertising, what does that appointment say? And what was your thought process in
appointing Joe, say, about your expectations or where the TV broadcast advertising model is going in terms of ad
product?
And then for John, you guys have really outperformed the market in terms of domestic affiliate revenue growth. Of
course, that's due to some recent large distributor renewals, or at least one. So can you just talk a little bit more about
the outlook for that? I think James said in his prepared remarks, strong growth heading into 2018. I think some folks
are wondering about the second half of 2018 after you lap that big renewal and the step up from that. So will other
renewals help? And could you just remind us what portion of your footprint is up by that time that can perhaps pick you
guys up despite the anniversary? I hope that makes sense. Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Anthony. Look, I think on the advertising side, obviously, when you have
leadership changes and transitions, you really look to what you think the needs of the business are going to be over time

and in the future. And I think in Joe and also in Danielle Maged, who's also reporting to Randy Freer in that area, we've
got leaders that are really very, very capable. We think that – and I think that the advanced advertising piece,
combining that with the core advertising, broader TV advertising piece, I think just makes a lot of logical sense. We
look at this business as an audience business and an attention business. And having an organizational structure and the
leaders of it aligned with that is the right strategy going forward, and we're really excited about the next chapter for our
domestic ad business.
Lachlan, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: No. I'd just say that look, Joe Marchese is an extraordinary executive. We're very
lucky to have had him driving our new advertising, advanced advertising initiatives over the past couple of years, and I
think he's going to do a tremendous job across all of our advertising sales portfolio.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Anthony, it's John to deal with the second part. I got out of the guidance business a couple of
years ago, but clearly our domestic affiliate fee growth is strong. And we look at the peers and we are putting some real
points on the board here. So we've accelerated this quarter. We're going to accelerate again second quarter and into
2018. And if we get volume from the new virtual MVPDs, then that's icing on the cake. So we're feeling very confident
about our growth.

confirm. You're saying that 2018 would accelerate from the fourth quarter level in 2017?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I'm not necessarily saying that, Ben.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Okay.
<A - John P. Nallen>: But I'm saying that from where we are in the third quarter, there is acceleration still ahead of us.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Got you.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: By the way, I think it's something that John has pointed to in the last at least two or
three earnings calls, so I think the credibility of how closely we watch the affiliate revenue and growth, I think we've
got a track record of delivering what we say.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Yes, absolutely. And my bigger question, Fox News has been a tremendous
business for you guys. Obviously, there's been a lot of change there and a lot of commentary in the press about
advertisers showing some frustration and then coming back to the business. But I'm wondering, affiliate fees are a huge
part of the business model. I think it's most of the revenue. Have you had any impact or conversations with distributors
about some of the volatility there and the changes in talent? And how are you feeling? Obviously, you've said the
numbers speak for themselves, but how are you feeling about that network's programming and position with the
distributors who are out there every day with consumers for that network?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: I think it's interesting. If you go on YouTube TV, for example, and you see the
number one trending live channel and shows on emerging DMVPD, it's almost always the case Fox News. And that
continues, obviously, post a lot of the programming changes and lineup that we've had. As we've said, the channel
continues its ratings dominance, moving forward very strongly, very strong with both affiliates and with advertising

<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you, guys.

It will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. I'm just curious about how you think of the TV station business with the
Blackstone JV. You were bidding for Tribune and you may not have bid for Tribune, and you're going back to bid for
Tribune. I was just curious how your distribution strategy may have changed.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: So first of all, look, what I don't think is that this – or rather, I think this is not the
forum to get into kind of hypothetical conversations around M&A that may or may not have happened. I would say
that, in the end, we didn't bid for Tribune and we've talked about this with the investment community and our
shareholders in the past. The station business is a strong business for us. It's an important part of our network
distribution. It's a strong business in terms of local programming, local news, and so on. But it isn't a place that we're
targeting to deploy capital into.
And so anything that we look at there is more about can we change our strategic position, could we think about scale in
a different way, but not in a way that would be use of capital for us at all, just to be clear. But it remains – look, it's a
strong business, and I think the local – relevance of those local brands and the local stations in their communities
continues to be very high.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Do you feel that the leverage is may be shifting to stations as they get bigger? Do you
worry about that?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Look, I think our affiliate agreements are constantly something that we think about
and adjust. They come up in different cycles. And we feel that we have quite a lot of options with respect to working
with our partners. Tribune is, obviously, a big partner of ours, and we look forward to continuing to work with them.
We provide an enormous value for our affiliate partners as they do for us. So we think it's a pretty balanced relationship
and one that we strive to make fair.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: I think that's exactly right. And when you're speaking of retransmission consent in
particular, obviously, the value of the network programming, in particular sport, is incredibly important as part of that
relationship with the affiliates and with what they can achieve through their retransmission consent.
James Rupert Murdoch
I think that's all we're going to have time for, folks. So much appreciate everyone joining the call, and thanks very
much for your time.
John P. Nallen
Yes, thank you.
James Rupert Murdoch
Great.
