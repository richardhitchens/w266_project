Now before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those
factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measures – measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements
is provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release.
Let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone.
Sales for the fourth quarter were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% from last year; diluted earnings per share were $0.36. As Carol
will detail, fourth quarter comp sales were positive 3.9% for the company and 4.8% for the U.S.
We saw strength across the U.S. as 49 of 50 states positively comped. The states that have been the most impacted by
the housing crisis, specifically Florida and California, performed in line with the company's overall performance in the
U.S., so while they're not leading us out of the downturn, they're at least no longer an anchor.
The markets with underperformance to the company average in the fourth quarter tended to be those with significant
weather impacts during the quarter, and particularly January, such as in the Northeast.
Last quarter we mentioned that we were seeing a tighter range of performance across our top markets. That continued
to be the case in the fourth quarter. So the overall picture is one of a stabilizing business.
This is a source of some confidence for 2011 because it's occurring despite the continued weakness of the housing
markets. Private, fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP remained near its 60-year low at 2.25%. We still
look at this measure to help understand the pressures in the housing market and the fact that our performance has
disconnected from it suggests that our business is stabilizing and can improve, even as the housing market remains
under stress.
Operationally, we continue to make progress with our customer service initiatives. We've completed the rollout of our
First Phone, and Marvin Ellison and his team ended the year with 51% of store payroll allocated to customer-facing
activities.
Since we started measuring our labor allocation, this is the first time we've crossed the threshold of having more hours
dedicated to customer-facing activity than tasking activity. We have a target of a 60-40 ratio and we believe we'll
achieve that by 2013. As we drive this reallocation, we are seeing ongoing improvement in our net promoter score,
which is up 450 basis points year-over-year and is now over 73%.
We achieved another significant milestone in the fourth quarter. We opened our 19th rapid deployment center. This
completes our RDC build out, at least for the next several years. Restructuring the supply chain of a business as large as
Home Depot in just three years is an enormous undertaking that touched almost every part of the company and required
the work and dedication of the entire team, but Mark Holifield and his supply chain team merit particular recognition.
We now have ahead of us continued opportunities to improve the RDCs themselves as well as the rest of the supply
chain, particularly our stocking facilities.
For the quarter, as Craig will detail, we had a very successful holiday selling season. We saw continued growth in
transactions, and we also saw an uptick in our average ticket with strong performance in kitchens and appliances.
Over the course of 2010, we made significant improvements in our merchandising systems, predominantly focused on
our in-stock product and processes. For 2011, that will continue, but we will also intensify our focus on our special

order product and processes.
This has been an area of historic underperformance for the company. We know we have to make it easier for our
customers to buy non-stocked items, and Matt Carey and his IT team along with our dot-com merchandising and
operational teams will be making this a priority. We will be digitizing our catalogs, upgrading our special order systems
within our stores, restructuring our SKUs to accommodate shopping for coordinated items, and continuing to improve
the connectivity between our digital presence and our bricks-and-mortar presence.
On the international side of our business, Mexico continues to perform well, with positive comps for the 29th quarter in
a row. Canada had negative comps for the quarter as they lapped last year's dramatic increase in sales, driven by the
expiration of the home renovation tax credit.
In 2011, our U.S. businesses will be lapping the expiration of a series of the 2010 tax incentives. The New Homeowner
Tax Credit, the Cash for Clunkers Appliance Credit and the $1,500 Energy Tax Credit. But we believe the growth in
GDP and improving consumer sentiment will continue to lift our business in 2011.
For the year, we are anticipating approximately 2.5% sales growth and 9.5% growth in earnings per share. We have
some difficult comparisons in the first quarter, but we expect each quarter to show positive growth with sales
momentum gaining in the back half.
We continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation and increasing shareholder return as we have laid out for you in
the past and our intent is to increase our dividend every year. So today, the Board of Directors and I are pleased to
announce that we are increasing the quarterly dividend 6% to $0.25. We will continue to use excess cash to repurchase
our shares. The hard work and dedication of our associates will make the difference in 2011 as they did in 2010. We are
very proud that 93% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing for the back half of 2010.
And now let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.
Looking at our fourth quarter results, we're pleased that the focus areas we shared with you on our last earnings call
met or exceeded our expectations during the quarter. We saw excellent results from our gift centers, seasonal and Black
Friday offerings and new product launches. The fourth quarter represented our fifth quarter in a row of positive comp
growth. We saw positive comps in nine departments during the quarter, and we were pleased with the comp
improvement we saw in the U.S. from the third to the fourth quarter.
The departments that outperform the company's average comp were Kitchens, Outdoor Garden, Indoor Garden,
Electrical and Tools. As I mentioned going into the fourth quarter, we leaned into the holiday season and increased our
buys. The outstanding values in our Gift Centers as well as our incredible Black Friday lineup led to a very strong
November. In fact, the tremendous response by our customers to our appliance values led to double-digit, positive
comps for appliances in the month of November.
The expiration of a tax credit in the U.S. for the purchase of energy-efficient windows, doors, skylights, drove
increased sales in Millwork and Home Services during the two months – the first two months of the quarter as
customers made purchases ahead of December's 31st deadline.
We also saw continued strength in our Gift Centers and our Decorative Holiday categories throughout the month of
December. While January was impacted by heavy snow and ice, we were well positioned to respond in weather-related
categories. Our teams executed extremely well, leveraging our supply chain capabilities to position product for our
customers. As a result, we saw double-digit, positive comps in power snow removal equipment, chemicals and snow
tool categories.

As we shared with you previously, our focus over the past few years has been to restore the competitive position of
Home Depot and to drive every day great values for our customers. As a result of this effort, we have seen improved
customer transactions for the past five quarters and our overall company comp transactions were up 1.3% in the fourth
quarter.
Total company average ticket was up 2.6% or $1.30 to $51.31 for the quarter. Transactions for tickets under $50,
roughly 20% of our business in the U.S., were up 1.8% year-over-year. Transactions for tickets of $900 and above, also
approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up 9.6% in the fourth quarter, certainly contributing to our overall company
ticket performance.
Drivers of this big ticket increase include the sales of appliances, millwork, windows, and HVAC. While customers
responded to the great values we offered in the quarter and took advantage of tax credits, we believe they still remain
cautious on making big ticket investments in their homes.
During the fourth quarter, we saw some commodity price inflation. In the last 45 days, we have seen a number of
requests from vendors for price increases as a result of elevated raw material costs. We review each of these requests
on an individual basis and our portfolio strategy drives our go-to-market actions as it has done for the past several
years.
The ongoing development of our assortment and value offerings for our customers through the implementation of our
merchandising transformation, continues to pay off through market share growth. As of December, according to the
NIACS 4441 U.S. census data, we gained 19 basis points of market share on a rolling 12-month basis. Additionally,
based on an independent, third-party tracking of consumer activity, we gained unit share in seven out of thirteen
departments during the fourth quarter, including Building Materials, Tools and Hardware, Plumbing, Electrical, Indoor
Garden, Outdoor Garden, and Appliances.
As we look to 2011, we are well positioned to drive both sales and transactions. We kicked off the new year with great
values on several interior projects, including bath remodels and paint. We are currently offering round two of our
outstanding event called Vanity Insanity and we are seeing terrific project selling from our associates as well as great
overall results from the event.
In our paint category, we're excited about the fact that a third-party leading consumer publication recently ranked our
BEHR Premium Plus Ultra paint as its best buy across all dominant sheens for the second year in a row. Our BEHR
Premium Plus and Glidden brands were also ranked highly across all sheens reinforcing the fact that we have an
incredibly strong offering for our customers in the DIY paint space.
We also continue to focus on innovation and services for our professional customers. At the most recent builders' show
in January, BEHR announced the introduction of KILZ Pro-X, a product line designed with a professional paint
contractor in mind, to be available exclusively at all Home Depot stores by the end of the first quarter of 2011.
The entire KILZ Pro-X line has been formulated to optimize spray, roll and brush application, along with performance
features including superior hide and coverage and touchup capabilities allowing our professional painters to save time
and money. As we roll out KILZ Pro-X we are also implementing new POS enhancements that allow us to better serve
this customer segment.
In addition, we are rolling out a new line of Milwaukee Red Lithium Tools powered by the leading lithium technology
available. These tools deliver 40% longer run time and 20% more torque than products powered by current lithium
technology in addition to providing superior performance in cold weather conditions.
And finally, we have a lineup of some incredible special buys and innovative new products for our outdoor categories
during the 2011 spring selling season. We will kick off the spring season with an outstanding spring Black Friday
event. Spring Black Friday will include some of our most popular outdoor categories such as live goods, lawn care,
outdoor power, eco-friendly gardening products, patio and grills. And in addition to our spring Black Friday event,
we'll also be introducing several great products for our customers' outdoor projects such as Armor Guard Decking, an
expansion of our Green Garden chemical products by both BEHR and Ortho, a new lineup of tractors from John Deere

We're excited about these new product rollouts for 2011 and we feel confident that our customers will recognize and
respond to the great values being offered at The Home Depot this spring.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone.
We exceeded the guidance we gave you at the beginning of December due to stronger-than-anticipated sales growth
and a couple of expense good guys. In the fourth quarter, sales were $15.1 billion, a 3.8% increase from last year.
Comps or same-store sales were positive 3.9% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.5% in November, positive
5.1% in December and negative 0.7% in January. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.8% for the quarter, with
positive comps of 8% in November, positive 5.8% in December and positive 0.7% in January.
For the year, our sales increased 2.8% to $68 billion. Total company comp sales were positive 2.9% for fiscal 2010 and
comps for U.S. stores were positive 2.5%. Our gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 25 basis points
from last year. Our U.S. business contributed 24 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter principally because we
had lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores. Clearance inventory is down 32% from one year ago and our
inventory has never been in better shape. For the year, we experienced 40 basis points of gross margin expansion.
Turning to operating expenses, in the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percent of sales, decreased by 161 basis
points to 27.8%. In total, operating expense dollars were $80 million less than last year. Our expense leverage was
primarily the result of positive same store sales but also reflects the following significant items. First, depreciation
expense was $18 million under last year due to a lower asset base arising from fully depreciated assets.
Second, we saw a $24 million year-over-year expense benefit due to a lower-than-anticipated cost of private-label
credit. And third, management bonuses were $34 million less than last year. Relative to our financial plan, we had a
good year. But not as good as what we experienced in 2009.
Finally, we did incur some expense associated with the announcement of six store closings in the quarter, but that
expense was about the same as the expense we incurred last year for similar actions. For fiscal 2010, operating
expenses as a percent of sales was 25.7%, a decrease of 93 basis points from last year.
As detailed in our press release, we had some charges associated with HD Supply and our business rationalization in
2009 and 2010. Adjusting for those charges, we leveraged operating expenses by 75 basis points for the year. As we've
discussed, we've experienced great expense control due to the introduction of new tools. During the year, we also
recognized some one-time expense benefits totaling about $70 million that we do not believe will repeat in 2011.
In the fourth quarter, interest and other expense was $87 million. On an adjusted basis, interest was down $71 million
from last year due primarily to the following factors. First, we had an unexpected $44 million benefit related to
favorable IRS guidance and the corresponding reversal of an interest accrual. Second, the cost of outstanding
indebtedness was lower than last year. And third, we had some interest benefit arising from certain state tax
settlements. For the year, interest and other expense totaled $566 million. Our income tax provision rate was 38.2% in
the fourth quarter, and 36.7% for the year.
Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.36, an increase of 100% from last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 50%. For the year, earnings per share
from continuing operations were $2.01, up 29.7% from fiscal 2009. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share from
continuing operations increased 22.3% to $2.03, compared to last year's adjusted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $1.66.

Now moving to our operational metrics, during the fourth quarter, we opened five new stores and closed one store in
China for an ending store count of 2,248. At the end of the year, selling square footage was 235 million, flat to last
year. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the fourth quarter were $255, up 4.3% from last
year. For fiscal 2010, sales per square foot were $289, up 3.5% from fiscal 2009.
Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year, inventory was $10.6 billion, up $437 million from a year ago.
This reflects higher sales levels as well as a pull-forward of certain spring inventory buys. Inventory turns were 4.13
times, up from 4.06 times last year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $600 million or 17.6 million shares of
outstanding stock. We ended the year with $40.1 billion in assets, including $545 million in cash. For the year, this
reflects cash generated by the business of approximately $4.4 billion, offset by $2.6 billion used for share repurchases,
$1.6 billion used for dividends, and $1.1 billion of capital expenditures. Computed on the average of beginning and
ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 12.8%, 213 basis points
higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Now as we look to 2011, we expect another year of sales growth in line with U.S. GDP growth expectations. We've
detailed our guidance in our press release, so let me just hit the high points. First, let me remind you that we guide off
of GAAP. For the year, we project that our sales will increase by approximately 2.5% with low single-digit same-store
sales growth. We plan to open ten stores in 2011, two in the U.S., one in Canada and seven in Mexico.
We expect sales growth to be stronger in the second half than in the first half of the year with growth rates fairly similar
to what we reported in the U.S. for fiscal 2010. We're planning positive same-store sales growth in every quarter, but
we expect the first quarter to be our lowest comping quarter given the timing of spring's arrival last year and tough
year-over-year commodity price comparisons.
For fiscal 2011 we expect earnings per share from continuing operations to increase by approximately 9.5% to $2.20.
Included in our earnings per share guidance is operating margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points arising
from gross margin expansion and modest expense leverage.
As I mentioned at our December investor conference, we expect some discrete cost pressures in 2011, and we have
some operating expense benefit in 2010 that won't repeat. So we anticipate operating expenses will grow at
approximately 70% of our sales growth rate for the year. Given year-over-year expense comparisons, we project that
our earnings growth will be stronger in the first half of the year than in the back half of the year.
For fiscal 2011 we project cash flow from the business of roughly $5.7 billion. This forecast assumes we refinance $1
billion of senior notes that come due in March. We will use our cash to invest in our business and return capital to
shareholders. Our 2011 capital spending plan is $1.35 billion, reflecting $585 million for our existing U.S. stores and
supply chain, $370 million for IT, $300 million for new stores, and $95 million for our non-U.S. businesses.
We've just announced a 6% increase in our annual cash dividend to $1 per share, and we'll use cash to fund our
dividend, which for the year approximates $1.6 billion. This leaves approximately $2.5 billion of excess cash, which
we intend to use for share repurchases. Depending on the timing of our repurchases, we should see some earnings per
share benefit arising from this activity in 2011. Assuming we repurchase the shares ratably over the course of 2011, we
expect our earnings per share growth from continuing operations to be approximately 12% for the year.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Cindy, we are now ready for questions.

<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Congratulations on a nice quarter.
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: I just – I wanted to ask the first question about weather. In your prepared comments you addressed
the weather in January, and we've heard from a lot of other retailers talking about weather, but – and you gave us the
progression of comps through the quarter. So I guess the question I have is, as you look at the weather in the markets,
was it overall positive or negative, and then to what extent either way?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, so if you went through the monthly comps that
Carol set out, for the months with strong positive comps, November and December, I wouldn't say that that was
because of weather – or, unless you want to put it, well, there wasn't weather that stopped people from being able to get
to the stores. I mean that was really the weather issue in January, was, I mean, for example, here in Atlanta, I mean the
city was shut down for almost a week. So I'd say if you looked at it from that perspective, weather was more of a
negative for us.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay. And the second question I had, with respect to the ticket information you gave in the press
release. We saw a nice uptick there, and again, if my math is correct, it looks like one of the strongest growth in ticket
in a few years. As you look at that, was that – do you think that was more reflective of something, your typical fourth
quarter, or was that something that's more reflective of an underlying trend in the business and something we could
carry forward as we look into 2011?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: The key drivers of ticket in the quarter were
obviously growth in categories like millwork, HVAC, some of the categories that actually benefited from the tax
credits as well as a terrific response from our customers on our appliance offerings that we had as part of our Black
Friday event and a solid performance in our kitchen business overall.
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: As we built our plan for
2011, we assumed more growth would come from transactions in the first half of the year and more from ticket in the
back half of the ear.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Perfect. Thank you. Congratulations again.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Brian.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter Benedict>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Just following up on some of that. Craig, you mentioned kind of some of
your plans for the spring, specifically interested in the outdoor power equipment category. How do you plan that
category going forward, the riding mowers? And what – what are your forecasts telling you in terms of the timing of
spring, because I think spring was real early last year. When do you guys expect that to kind of set in?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yep, Peter, we did have an early spring last year,
which was a very nice benefit in Q1. I think this year, if you buy into the forecast, it's more of a normalized spring this
year. And, so, we actually anticipate that it provides a little bit of headwind in the first quarter. And then we're excited
about our overall outdoor power equipment lineup for this year. You know, excited about the value propositions that
we have in riding mowers and walk-behind mowers. We have an outstanding program in walks and then as I
mentioned, we're expanding with some new product in outdoor power as it relates to continued expansion of Lithium,
which did very well for us last year, so looking forward to the spring selling season.

<Q - Peter Benedict>: Terrific. Thanks. And one quick follow-up. On the international comp trend, when should we
expect kind of a turnaround in particularly Canada? Are you guys expecting that to be positive next year? And if so,
when do you expect that swing?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Canada – so – you continue to have a little bit of
headwind in the first quarter just as you get through all of the tax credit comparisons. Then it should start to turn – turn
positive.

We'll take our next question from David Schick at Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - David Schick>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - David Schick>: Frank, you said at the beginning of the call, excess cash to buy back shares, Carol you said
priorities are return cash and invest in the business, but just, I guess, more details on your thoughts if you beat
guidance, how do you think about movements on the balance sheet, buyback, the dividend? What are the priorities that
you would use excess operating income for?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, hopefully we've set out our guiding principles
pretty clearly over time, which is first, we invest in the business to support and sustain our company, and then second,
we do look to excess cash for buying back shares and we have an objective of increasing our dividends annually as we
approach a payout ratio of 40%-ish. And we're kind of slowly, as you saw from the announcement this morning, we're
kind of trending down in that – in that direction.
<Q - David Schick>: So it's not one big next thing, you would continue the balance of things.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right. Yeah.
<Q - David Schick>: Great. And then just any comments on what you're seeing in the rollout of the First Phone?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Marvin's here and I'd ask Marvin to comment on
it. I'd just say it's the start – that it's really been a program just extraordinarily well received by our associates and a
great job both by our operations team and our IT team. But, Marvin?
<A - Marvin Ellison>: Yeah, David, very successful. We've had really a couple of key things we're focused on.
Number one, simplifying how we look at data. This device gives the associate real-time data on sales, gross margin and
inventory also, in-stock. Simplifies the in-stock process, which is big for us, but one thing that's been a pleasant
surprise is checkout. We had almost a million transactions in the fourth quarter on the First Phone in checking
customers out at point-of-sale. So a mobile point-of-sale checkout is big for us because we have a huge focus this year
on speed of checkout and the results and the feedback have been terrific. Great partnership between Matt Carey and his
team, Marc Powers, my lead of operations and we feel like we have a lot to build on for the rest of the year.
<Q - David Schick>: Great. Thanks.

<Q - Chris Horvers>: Can you talk about your thought process on bringing the inventory in a bit earlier this year for
spring? I think you made that same decision a year ago and it was very successful. Just curious what the drivers were
this year?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yeah, we did have success with that last year. You
are correct. And so we're following on that success. Given all of the data that we looked at, we said we wanted to be
prepared to capture anything early that we could, given the fact that the projections right now for the later part of the
quarter are not all that strong from a weather standpoint. Who knows how that will exactly play out, but that's the
decision that we made.
<Q - Chris Horvers>: I got you. And as, on – Carol on the gross margin, did you see any pressure in 4Q related to
commodity cost pressures and are you baking in any for 2011?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Well, as you can appreciate
in the gross margin, there are a lot of goes-ins and goes-outs related to product mix. And there was some inflation in
there as well. But nothing material or else we would have called it out. As we build our plan for 2011, it is a
commodity-neutral plan. Craig mentioned in his comments that over the past 45 days we've been getting some requests
for price increases and we deal with those one request at a time.

We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser at Barclays Capital.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So there's been a lot of noise in the
housing market over the last year, and as you look into the category detail of your recent performance, is there anything
to suggest that the strong fourth quarter results weren't just due to the upturn in housing turnover that occurred early in
2010? Especially in light of the historic 6 to 9-month lag between that metric and home improvement demand?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Michael, I – we can't see it. I mean, it's an interesting
question because you might think, gee, you saw just as you said – you saw this spike kind of in the spring and was that
coming through more in the fourth quarter. But if you look at where the strength was, I think you'd say it was a
combination of areas where we had great offerings and took some share and other areas where you had improvement
through the tax credit items that we called out. And then a very, very strong seasonal, holiday season selling that we
really don't think was related to an uptick in the housing market as a whole.
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Yeah, to put it in
perspective, the benefit that we enjoyed from the sale of energy-related products was about 50 basis points impact to
our comp in the quarter.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: That's helpful. Follow-up question. Consumers have shown a clear desire to want to re-engage
in home improvement over the last few quarters. So the next big headwind the business might face is pressure on
discretionary budgets from rising food and gas prices. Does that influence how you think about the portfolio pricing
strategy as we move through this spring and through the rest of this year?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Yeah, I mean certainly we know that if you look
over the past couple of years, there's been cycles where the customer's been under serious pressure with discretionary
spend. That's why we are incredibly focused on trying to drive great values for our customers every day. And focusing
on making sure that we're putting the offerings out there that continues to drive our positive comp transactions. And
really helps drive customers to our stores. So it's a key focus for us as we move forward.

We'll take our next question from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Colin.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: First question, just back on gross margin. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that
you'll probably get a few more requests from vendors for price increases over the next 45 and probably 400 days.
[Laughter].
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: How do you think about passing that through? In what categories do you think you have
some pricing power and which categories might you need to be a little bit more careful? And historically, what have
you seen? And how do you think this might be similar or different?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Colin, look I would agree. There has certainly been
pressure in the last 45 days. I don't think that's going to subside. And – but we deal with those on an individual one-off
basis. Our first and foremost approach is to try to figure out how to work with our suppliers to either leverage our
supply chain, leverage how we do business together to try to mitigate the pressure that they're seeing so that we can
continue to hold the line the best we can. And really, in terms of our go-to-market approach, that's driven by our
portfolio strategy. And we are guided by our portfolio strategy in terms of how we think about applying pressure in the
marketplace and what we really want to stand for.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: Okay. And then just separate follow-up question, I know it's hard to do, but is there any
way you can quantify what you think the impact of the energy tax credit in the appliance – your strong performance in
appliances in November did to the comp in November?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Well, we can tell you for the
quarter what we think it is.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: That'd be fine.
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Okay. So we think the
impact of energy was about 50 basis points to the U.S. and appliances was about 120-ish basis points.
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: Okay, great. And, Carol, just a final follow-up on that. Given your expectation that comps
improve through the year should we – your toughest compare now is the fourth quarter, would we assume that you'll do
something similar to – in the appliance category next year? Will this become an annual event?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: We're not going to share our
secrets with you today.
[Laughter].
<Q - Colin McGranahan>: All right. Good luck then. I guess I'll have to watch and see.

We'll take our next question from Laura Champine at Cowen & Company.
<Q - Laura Champine>: Good morning, guys. So we're very pleased to see the increase in big-ticket purchases and it
looks like you gained some share there. But, Craig, you made a statement that you thought the consumer was still
cautious on big ticket? What's your evidence there? And what's the outlook for the bigger ticket spending in 2011?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Well, I think two things. Number one, when you
look at the categories that had positive growth that were tied to the tax credits, so we look at that and go, okay, that's
not necessarily repeating. So that makes us a little bit cautious as a result.
I think – and then the second piece of it is, is we still need to see improvement in the big projects with the customers.
It's not seeing a lot of evidence of major remodels going on in homes at this point. So that's really the two things that
we're looking at from a caution standpoint.
<Q - Laura Champine>: Thanks. And then just a clarification on the last answer. The 120 basis point impact on Q4
from appliances, was that from your own promotions or from stimulus programs for ENERGY STAR appliances?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: That was the impact of
appliance sales.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Sales. Right.

<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hello?
<A - Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations>: Wayne?
<Q - Wayne Hood>: – and you need to give some about -
<A - Diane Dayhoff, Vice President of Investor Relations>: Wayne, we missed your first part of your question.
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, for some reason it blanked out.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: Okay. Can you hear me now?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: Okay, terrific. So my question was to Craig. And I guess you are sitting at record gross margin
levels from where we are today and over the next 12 months. Are we at an inflection point where you begin to give
some consideration to reinvesting more into price in areas like appliances, to drive growth and market share and let
your gross margins flatten out in '12 and '13? And instead of having modest increases, maybe it's slight?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: So, as it relates to our strategy, first and foremost,
what we're trying to do is continue to lower prices for our customers on a day-in, day-out basis and drive greater value
for them. And we're trying to manage obviously the bottom line by driving improved efficiencies in how we run the
business.
So things like the 32% reduction in clearance inventory, which saves the margin line, obviously, are how we've been
able to deliver the improvement to date and still be able to lower prices for our customers. And that's our continued

focus. We shared at our analyst meeting that as we moved into 2011, we'll begin to see benefit from our supply chain
and much less of it comes from our merchandising.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: Okay. Just a follow-up for you too, Craig, is where do you think your inventory will be by the
end of the second quarter and the end of the year? And then, Carol, where are you thinking the payables inventory
would be at the end of the year? Just so we can take a look at your cash flow?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Why don't we put it in terms
– if I could jump in, Craig – put it in terms of net working capital? So that would be receivables, inventory and
payables.
As of the end of 2010, net working capital as a percent of sales was 10.3%. And we project, based on the guidance that
we shared with you this morning, that it will drop to 9.8% by the end of 2011.

We'll take our next question from Greg Melich at International Strategy Investment.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get into the SG&A a little bit more and the
earnings progression. I think you mentioned that first half earnings growth should be better than second half, given
some of the comparisons on SG&A. Yet the comps would be weaker in the first half than in the second half. Could you
take us through the logic behind that? What's driving it? And also do you have the Durbin Amendment and the benefits
in your guidance for this year?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Yeah, absolutely. Well, as I
mentioned, we have about $70 million of expense benefit that we don't believe will repeat in 2011. That expense
benefit took place in the back half of 2010.
If you'll recall, in the third quarter, we told you that we had $20 million of gains from real estate sales. We don't believe
we'll have those gains next year.
In the fourth quarter, we just called out a $24 million year-over-year benefit related to our private label credit. The
gross benefit was $44 million. That won't repeat next year.
So that takes us to $64 million of expense benefit that won't repeat. And then there was about $6 million of other items
that won't repeat. And all that took place in the back half of the year. So that's why the year-over-year earnings is
different than the year-over-year sales growth estimates.
On the Durbin side, as you know, the Durbin Amendment asks the Federal Reserve to determine what reasonable and
proportionate fees should be for debit – and debit makes up about 17% of our tender penetration. Based on the Fed's
draft regulations, we think the benefit to The Home Depot could be $35 million a year.
Now, because it hasn't been implemented, clearly the benefit to us would be less than $35 million in 2011. And because
we don't know when it's going to be implemented, we haven't put any of that in our plan.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. That's very clear. And if I could follow up on commodity inflation, you said that's a neutral
environment in your gross margins. But what did commodity inflation actually impact comp in the fourth quarter? And
what do you expect in the top line for commodities this year? Thanks.
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: So between lumber and copper in the quarter, it
was approximately 50 basis points of impact.

We'll take our next question from Steve Chick at FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Stephen Chick>: Hi. Thanks. I guess question on – I guess weather. And kind of with the storms we've seen and
the commentary you made about January, is there a way to I guess plan or assess what the restoration might be? If you
might get a benefit of that in terms of recovery and restoration? And have you seen any kind of pick-up as you moved
beyond January and I guess you could say thawed out or gotten further into February here?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Steve, this is Craig. I really don't have a way to
quantify it. There's no way for us to do that.
But what I can tell you is that we certainly believe that folks will have to repair things. When you look at the amount of
ice and snow that existed, you'll have roof damage. You'll have live good damage in terms of shrubs, bushes. Their
gutters will need to be replaced. So we're certainly prepared for that and anticipate that.
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: And as we look at our
business in February, the first couple of weeks of February, the weather was horrible. But it's gotten better. And
February comps are running better than our January comps.

We'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin at Bank of America.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Thank you very much. Frank, with big ticket up so strong and obviously a significant contributor
to comps, could you maybe shed some color on how good of a leading indicator you believe big-ticket strength is in
other parts of your business, even including Repair and Maintenance?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, so let me start with the Repair and Maintenance.
Again – and we've shared on past calls that that has been a strength in our business. And certainly Repair and
Maintenance categories continue to perform positively. So the customer is still focused there.
As we look at the big ticket, particularly around the fourth quarter, certainly the drivers behind that, again, were the
great values that we had in our appliance offerings. It's a good appliance time in the industry in total, and we kind of
went after that with some great values and did very well.
But then you look at the categories that were impacted by tax credits, and those performed extremely well. And
certainly, that environment obviously has now changed, so we think that that adds some pressure going forward, and
don't really anticipate the same level of big ticket performance as we move through the first half of the year.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you. And one follow up, if I may. With the RDC program completed last month, can
you maybe just give us an update on what you think the gross margin benefits will be as well as the benefits to turns?

maximum benefit, but it is the year it starts to turn to a benefit. As we've been describing this all along, there's an
investment and then the benefit starts to come forward.
And as we talked about in December, we saw overall 40 basis points, with, you know, 30 coming from the supply chain
and the RDCs as it picks up. And you start to see that benefit as we go forward in 2011.

And we'll take our next question from Deborah Weinswig at Citigroup.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: Thanks so much, and congratulations on a great quarter.
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Thank you.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: Carol, you mentioned great expense control due to some new tools. I'm pretty well versed
in your merchandising tools, but can you please expand on the tools that helped deliver the company's great expense
results in the quarter? And what inning are we on, on these tools?
<A - Carol Tomé, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate>: Well, I think we've talked in
the past about a new checkbook that we introduced in the stores that really helps the stores manage their operating
expenses, like their personal bank account. And they have great visibility now. They can actually pull up images of
invoices. It's just really helping them get their arms around our expenses.
We also have cost-out teams here at the store support center, and these teams go aggressively against costs. We do a lot
of cohort analysis. Just superior analytics. Something that's really getting underneath the costs.
There's a sense of enthusiasm. We're really enthusiastic about sales, but there's a real sense of enthusiasm about cost
control, too, and we recognize the people who drive out costs.
You might say, are you done? We're not done. If you think about the expense plan we put together for 2011, expenses
would be growing faster if we didn't have expense control in place.
So we've still got opportunities to drive productivity in our business for sure. And a lot of that is coming from the
technology initiatives that Matt and his team are driving in our business. With technology, boy, lots of costs can go out.
<A - Marvin Ellison>: So, Deborah, we'll give you a perspective on the P&L checkbook. Before we rolled this out, a
store would have to wait until the 15th of the month to see the expenses from the previous month. So it's impossible to
really manage it effectively. Now you have basically a real-time view of what you're spending based on your budget by
line item.
So to Carol's point, it gives the store team just a much better handle and tremendous visibility and transparency around
what they're spending, how they're spending to the rate of plan. And it just allows us to be much more efficient in
managing that overall expense line.
<Q - Deborah Weinswig>: Great. Thanks so much. And staying on the technology theme, can you talk about how
much of your sales were online in 2010? And how do you see that growing in 2011? And maybe some of the initiatives
behind that as well?
<A - Frank Blake, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But, Deb, we've kind of said on online that we're not
going to talk about it as a separate business for a while yet. It's still – we need it to get to be a more significant and

Our last question today will come from Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: Just under the wire. Thank you so much. My question relates to market dynamics. I believe
you alluded to gaining share in roughly half of your categories as measured by units. If you could give us a sense as to
where the share gains were, how that trend compared to prior quarters? And then as part of that discussion, what you've
seen in terms of promotional dynamics in the space, particularly in some of the hotter categories, if you will, like
appliances?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: Sure. We – this is Craig. We gained share in
building materials, tools, hardware, plumbing, electrical, lawn and garden, both sides of that, as well as appliances.
Quarter-to-quarter – again, that's unit share based on consumer activities – so quarter-to-quarter, those can fluctuate a
little bit. But when we look at it on a rolling 12-month basis, those are areas where we're continuing to show progress
over time.
I think as it relates to the marketplace, again, we feel that we're applying a significant amount of pressure in the market
in terms of really offering our customers outstanding values. You know, the history of our company has all been about
finding special buys, working with our suppliers to come up with something that helps them drive volume through their
factories. We can pass along savings to our customers. It creates urgency to bring the customers into the store. And I
think we did a really good job of that in the fourth quarter, which helped our numbers.
And so we'll continue to follow that strategy.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: And any comments on just the competitive dynamic, did you see competitive responses or
competitive aggressiveness, particularly in November, December?
<A - Craig Menear, Executive Vice President, Merchandising>: It seemed somewhat similar to previous quarters.
