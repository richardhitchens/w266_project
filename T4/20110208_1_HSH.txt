events. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that actual results may
differ from those expressed or implied in these statements. Consequently, I need to caution you not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. We have provided additional information in our release, in our fiscal 2010
Form 10-K that I encourage you to review, concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
these forward-looking statements.
The slides that we will be reviewing today can be found in the Presentation section of our Web site in the Investor
Relations section. And as a reminder, all adjusted numbers we discuss on today's call exclude the impact of significant
items, contingent sales proceeds, acquisitions, divestitures, and the effects of currency changes. Our updated guidance
table contains a reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS numbers and explanations of non-GAAP financial measures
are included in our release.
Now let me turn the call over to Marcel.
Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We spoke to you on January the 28th about
our intention to spin-off our North American Meats business and, in doing so, create two successful pure-play
companies. We, at that moment, gave you an update of the guidance for the full year, which we reaffirmed today.
In the past week, we have spoken with many of you and you have a good idea -- we have a good idea of the type of
information you need to refine your assessment of our value-creation efforts. Many of you, of course, have asked about
taxation. And I think people generally appreciated that we were careful not to get carried away about tax considerations
on the 28th. A decision to spin-off the North American Retail and Foodservice business is driven by strategic, rather
than tax considerations, and we will address this in more detail later in this call.
But first, let us turn to the key perspectives on the first half year. We are pleased that the second quarter showed a
strong jump in profitability relative to our first quarter. Our segments delivered $100 million more operating income
than in the first quarter. At an EPS level, we made $0.24 in the second quarter versus $0.14 in the first quarter.
As expected, the first half was quite challenging, with very significant commodity cost increases. We anticipate further
headwinds in the second half, particularly in coffee, where we've had a bit of cover in the first half from our forward
positions. We have more work to do to push price increases through in the second half.
We need another two quarters in line with the second quarter then, to achieve guidance for operating income. And there
are a number of reasons why we feel good about our ability to do so. First, price increases implemented in the first half
will help our margins in the second half. Second, over the last few quarters, we have been investing in MAP and
launching innovations, which will gather steam in the second half. L'OR EspressO is a prime example of innovation
that continues to gain great momentum. We're adding capacity to increase volume, create more varieties and serve
more markets. In all, these innovations will contribute to our top and bottom-line in the second half, and you may have
noted that in our sales guidance.
Third then, we have been investing in the first half, both in MAP and in a number of projects, such as the
implementation of SAP in our North American factories and the new Kansas City plant. We anticipate completion on a
number of these projects and we will start harvesting benefits. Last, we continued to drive cost down through
Accelerate and other initiatives. So all this considered, is why we are confident that we will achieve our guidance for
fiscal 2011.
Commodities continue to be a major issue. So we've put a couple of key prices on this slide. These are spot prices and
they mostly come to us with a time lag. And as you can see, we're going through a time of major cost increases. At Sara
Lee, we felt that 2008 was a tough year, and you may remember that, but 2011 is turning out to be a much rougher
patch.

And I have to say that it does feel a bit like mountain climbing. While you're climbing, you tend to focus on a peak in
the distance, and only to find out that when you get there, there's another peak behind it.
Another item I'd like to call out is the quarterly split of operating income. We're working against a year where profits
were very front-end loaded and, as we price through commodity cost increases, this year's profits will be back-end
loaded. We put last year's adjusted quarterly operating income figures, by quarter, on this slide as a reminder. As you
can see, last year's quarterly segment income peaked in the second quarter.
At the time, and you may recall that, we said that in North American Retail, our quarterly profit for the second quarter
was above the trend line of gradual improvements. You may recall that we made more than 16% operating margin and
we were quick to point out that that was not the path that we were on in that year.
Now, these figures have been taken from our 8-K, which restated our North American Fresh Bakery business to
discontinued operations and show that we had a huge second quarter last year. And with the reclassification of Fresh
Bakery, the figures are no longer exactly comparable with what we reported last year. But let me just remind you that
in the second quarter, we reported a more than $100 million improvement in segment operating income on the prior
year, last year, second quarter of '10.
Now as this year progresses, comparables will become easier, even though the third quarter last year was also very
strong. Now let me pull these two points of commodity costs and quarterly profit flow together. It's clear that
commodity price fluctuations do impact our business. We have a tough time when prices go up, and when prices go
down, we have a bit of tailwind.
So let us go back to the current year. Here, we are comparing the first and the second quarter with the prior year. Just
on a technical note, let me note that the fiscal '10 figures that you see here are slightly different from the prior slide.
And that is because here on this slide, we're using fiscal '11 exchange rates for both years, and on the prior year slide,
we were using fiscal '10 exchange rates. It changes the figures a bit, but it doesn't change the conclusions.
As you can see, the adjusted operating income in the second quarter of this year was strong. It wasn't quite the peak we
made in the second quarter of last year, but we would classify it as pretty good going.
Those of you who have done the sums quickly, will have noticed that if we have two more quarters like the second
quarter, that is, if we add two times $249 million, we will achieve the guidance for adjusted operating income. This
slide summarizes in the bullets below what I've just said. There's less investment in the second half, more growth,
further progression in terms of pricing through some of the commodity cost increases.
Now let us look at sales. Adjusted net sales from continuing operations, which exclude our currency exchange
fluctuations and acquisitions, were up 1.8% in the second quarter, 2.4% in the first half. And you can see that we have a
fair amount of price increases coming through and it is accelerating as the year progresses.
On the mix side, we have positive news. This is partly the result of the growth of premium propositions and partly the
result of the Company quite consistently exiting or reducing lower margin products.
At a volume level, we're showing negative figures. The Foodservice pizza dough, and liquid coffee contracts that we
lost last year both play an important role, but it's probably better to talk to sales growth by segment in order to give you
the appropriate color.
North American Retail, we pushed through price increases to help mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs in the
second quarter. These price increases slowed our volume in the second quarter, leading to the total of volume and mix
being negative in that quarter. We gained share in six of 12 categories and expect to do okay from a volume and mix
point of view for the balance of the year.
Meanwhile, we feel quite positive about our volume and mix developments in Foodservice. The reported figures are
very much influenced by the two contracts that I mentioned earlier. Underneath that, our Meats, Bakery, and Liquid
Coffee businesses are doing well. And as the loss of the pizza dough and liquid coffee contracts annualize, we expect to
see top-line growth in the second half.

On the coffee and tea front, our large volume Roast & Ground business is holding up reasonably well, despite our price
increases. Mix is starting to become a meaningful positive, as a result of both Senseo continuing to do well in countries
like France and Germany, and further rollouts like Spain and Brazil; and, of course, as a result of innovation such as
L'OR coming through.
I'm also pleased to say that the outlook for the second half looks strong. We will see significant price increases and we
are targeting a meaningful uplift in mix. In International Bakery, due to disappointing volume developments in our
Spanish business, we're implementing an aggressive pricing strategy to reduce the gap with private label and grow our
top-line.
And now with that, I'll turn over the call to Mark Garvey, who will give us further detail about the quarter, and I will be
back to you in a minute to talk about tax and re-domiciliation, and other subjects that you have raised in relation to the
intended split of the company. Mark?
Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and
Controller
Thank you, Marcel, and welcome, everyone. I would now like to walk you through our second quarter results in a bit
more detail.
On this slide, you can see adjusted operating segment income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal '11 with the
comparisons of the same periods in fiscal '10. Total adjusted operating income was $249 million for the second quarter
compared to $296 million last year. For the first half, adjusted operating income was $428 million compared to $483
million in fiscal '10.
At an adjusted operating segment income level, the results were primarily impacted by commodity costs net of pricing,
particularly in the North American Retail and International Beverage business segments, as price increases lagged
commodity cost increases. In addition, MAP investment was 10% higher in the first half of fiscal '11, as we continue to
invest behind our brands. Corporate costs, on the other hand, were down significantly, primarily resulting from
Accelerate savings and reduced pension costs.
This slide quantifies in more detail the primary drivers of the changes in adjusted operating income from fiscal '10.
Pricing net of commodities, were a negative $54 million in the second quarter and Project Accelerate contributed $23
million in savings. The impacts of MAP, volume mix, etcetera, some of which Marcel has mentioned, explain the
remaining changes. A similar theme is evident for the first half results, with pricing net of commodities at a negative
$96 million and Project Accelerate savings of $50 million.
Now let me turn to earnings per share. For the second quarter, we reported $1.37 EPS. This was a busy quarter with a
closing of a significant transaction related to Household and Body Care, and the movement of our Fresh Bakery
business into discontinued operations, both of which impacted our reported EPS.
Firstly, the completion of the sale of our body care and European detergents business to Unilever in the quarter resulted
in a gain of $0.84, which is included in our reported earnings under Discontinued Operations. Secondly, with the
movement of the Fresh Bakery business into discontinued operations, we are required to recognize a tax benefit on the
difference between the book basis and the tax basis associated with the bakery business. This amounted to $0.35 in the
quarter.
Note that when the Fresh Bakery sale is completed, we will book a tax amount on the gain associated with the sale,
which will offset the tax benefit recorded this quarter. From a cash perspective, there will be minimal cash tax outlay
related to the sale of the bakery business. Then there are other significant items of $0.13, primarily related to Project
Accelerate, other severance actions being taken to eliminate stranded overheads associated with the Household and
Body Care sale, and debt extinguishment costs. This brings us to adjusted earnings per share of $0.31 for the second
quarter, $0.24 of which relates to continuing operations, and compares to adjusted EPS from continuing operations of

$0.27 in the second quarter of fiscal '10.
Now turning to cash from operations, we reported cash from operations of $233 million for the first half of fiscal '11
compared to $472 million for the same period last year. The primary changes from last year are due to higher working
capital amounts, mostly due to increases in inventory, driven by commodity cost increases, reduced operating income
from discontinued operations, as Household and Body Care businesses are being sold through the year and reduced
operating income from continuing operations. We reaffirm our guidance for cash from operations for fiscal '11 at $400
million to $500 million.
On January 28th, we discussed our updated guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal '11 guidance for adjusted operating
income for continuing operations at $904 million to $940 million, and adjusted earnings per share for continuing
operations at $0.85 to $0.89. The changes discussed on January the 28th, related to a reduction in the top-end of the
guidance for operating income, due to the increases in coffee costs and our inability to fully price these increases
through by the end of the fiscal year. We also discussed a further change to the lower end of the EPS guidance,
associated with a revision to some assumptions around tax, interest expense, and share count.
Now let me turn to Project Accelerate, which remains on track and has contributed significant cost savings to the
corporation. We have adjusted our guidance on Project Accelerate savings and costs to account for the disposition of
the Fresh Bakery business. We now expect cumulative savings of between $300 million and $350 million through
fiscal '12.
We have reached cumulative savings of approximately $194 million through the second quarter of fiscal '11, and this
will grow to $220 million to $240 million by the end of this fiscal year.
Overall, costs are expected to be approximately $280 million, the majority of which will have been incurred through
the end of this fiscal year. On January 28th, we also announced some changes to our capital structure plans, which
included the plan to issue a special dividend of $3 per share during fiscal '12. We also committed to completing $1.3
billion of share repurchases in fiscal '11, of which we have completed approximately $800 million to date.
In all, since we announced our capital structure plans in February 2010, we have repurchased 87 million shares at an
average price of $15.05. Combined with the remaining repurchases to be completed this fiscal year and the fiscal 2012
special dividend, the corporation will have returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders.
Before I conclude, I would like to remind you of some impacts to fiscal '12, which we also discussed on January 28th.
There are some tailwinds that will benefit our earnings per share in fiscal '12, which we are currently estimating to be
approximately $0.15 per share. These tailwinds include a reduced share count on the completion of the $1.3 billion of
repurchases in fiscal '11. Pension expense should decline by approximately $40 million, based on current assumptions.
Amortization costs will decline by around $30 million and we expect to make good progress on eliminating the
stranded costs for Household and Body Care, and Fresh Bakery.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Marcel.
Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President
Thanks, Mark. Now let's turn to the announcement of January 28. As a quick reminder, we will create two pure-play
stand-alone public companies by spinning off our North American Meats and Foodservice business, and we expect the
spin-off to be completed in early calendar 2012.
Now before we go into the detail, let me just give you some perspectives on how we got to the announcement. Sara Lee
has been on a long journey of major changes in the composition of its portfolio. And I think it's fair to say that in its
most recent history, there has been a very focused approach to unlocking value for the shareholders.
In 2009, we started the sale process of our Household and Body Care division. Obviously, not an easy decision and, as
it turned out, very difficult to execute, with Sara Lee ending up just selling the business in pieces.

We look back on it with satisfaction, though. It marked an important turning point for the development of our share
price, and we believe that it was the right thing to do for our business, as well. All pieces found good homes where they
can prosper. In early 2010, at CAGNY, we announced that we would use the proceeds to finance a significant buyback
program. Again, not an easy decision, most companies like to go off and buy things, but it was a clear sign of
discipline, taking our commitment to shareholders seriously. And it worked well. We clearly had another lift in our
share price.
In late 2010, we announced the sale of our North American Fresh Bakery business. That, again, was the right thing to
do for our shareholders and, we are proud to say, for the business. The combination with Bimbo, there's more value to
be created than we could have done on our own, and hence, it was the logical thing to do. This transaction also had its
complexities with the Sara Lee brand having to be shared, further work having to be done on paring down our
corporate center, but nevertheless, the right thing to do. And while we work through these initiatives, we have been
busy in the background looking at what other logical steps we could take to unlock value.
Splitting the company into two pure-plays was an obvious option and we started investigating it a long time ago as one
of a number of options. We concluded in early calendar 2010 that the option of a split of the company, and the other
options that we were thinking of, needed to take a backseat to first selling the Fresh Bakery business. So for that
moment, we put it to rest. And then after the Fresh Bakery transaction, we started working on it again.
Meanwhile, we received unsolicited indications of interest. Our analysis indicated that it was unlikely that we would
get something that would either trump or shortcut our own plans to unlock value. And the reason for that is very
simple. There were just too many moving parts and some of the larger transactions haven't even closed yet. Now that
said, presented with credible parties who say they can shortcut and trump value creation, the only logical thing to do is
to see whether or not that is true.
It turned out that the best thing to do for our shareholders was to go back to our own sequence of steps designed to
unlock value and make that next step. And that was the announcement of the 28. And the reason why we think it
creates value is three-fold.
Firstly, we're creating pure-plays. They generally tend to do well, with some senior management sitting close to the
market opportunity. And look at Coach, Inc., which has done phenomenally well after it was spun off from Sara Lee.
We have every confidence that both the companies we are creating have an excellent shot at doing really well.
Secondly, investors can choose whether or not they want to buy shares in the Meat Co., in the Coffee Co., or both.
There are people out there who either like our North American Meats business but don't fancy our Coffee business, and
vice versa. By splitting, neither group will be burdened by having to discount Sara Lee for the part they don't like. And
it is fair to assume that the share price of both companies would reflect that. Lastly, the split opens more opportunities
for our two companies to either acquire or partner with other players in the industry.
The next slide will give you an idea of how we envision the two companies looking like, post the spin-off. Both
companies will be able to pay a competitive dividend and both will have a solid investment grade rating. All of that we
said on the 28th of January. And we also said that we anticipated both companies to have a tax rate of approximately
35%.
Now, that latter comment sparked a lot of debate immediately after our call on the 28. People generally understood that
we were reluctant to go deep into tax consideration. The split is driven by the strategic rationale I just gave you, rather
than tax. We said that we would do our best to further explore the most efficient structure for the two companies, but it
was important to get you grounded on some of the basic facts and not to over-promise.
Let's start with the structure. We are currently a U.S. public business with two operating businesses underneath. That is
to the left on this slide. The spin, in itself, will result in two U.S. public companies, as you can see here. With the spin,
we move to the right of the slide. First, you see our North American business post-spin-off, and next to it you have
what we have dubbed Coffee Co. Coffee Co. will have most of its operations outside the U.S., but the spin, in itself,
leaves it as a U.S. public company.

Now, the first question that people have asked is whether or not either of the two companies can be bought following
the spin-off. Before we get to that, let me just reiterate what we said on the 28th. There are no restrictions if someone
turns up wanting to buy the whole of the company prior to the spin-off. Then after the spin-off, and I'm going to be
using a bit of shorthand here, there are rules that put restrictions on buyers who have engaged in substantial
negotiations prior to the spin, and who subsequently want to buy either of the parts.
Substantial negotiations is a tax term and it sets a pretty high standard. Depending on the circumstances, these
restrictions range from six months to two years. Other than any people with whom we've had substantial negotiations
prior to the spin, there are no restrictions. And there is a debate for the tax experts as to whether or not the discussions
we've had with the people who gave us unsolicited indications of interest constitute substantial negotiations. And I have
to say, we don't worry about these discussions for two reasons.
First of all, from a shareholder perspective, if it gives you comfort, there are enough people out there that would be
totally unrestricted. And secondly, to be frank, from our perspective, we're just focused on running our business and, in
the process of doing so, creating value for our shareholders. We think the two pure-plays that we're going to create are
going to do really well, and we see lots of opportunities for both pure-plays to create value for shareholders.
The second question then, that has come up is the issue of re-domiciliation. And let me direct you to the right side of
this slide again. Coffee Co. is, absent the re-domiciliation, as we said, a U.S. public company for tax purposes. We will
evaluate the most appropriate location for Coffee Co. Considerations for this will include factors such as where our
shareholder base is located, the best stock exchange for the listing and which index the company will be included in. It
is something to consider.
And many of you know that Jan Bennink, our new Executive Chairman, has a very strong reputation with investors in
Europe. He has an outstanding track record of creating value in the food and beverage industry. So, yes, it is something
to think about, what is the most appropriate location for Coffee Co. But please be aware of how a re-domiciliation
actually works.
The top entity, SLC (US) here on the slide, cannot simply move to another jurisdiction. It's not like a holder of a green
card who can move to a European country, send back his green card and be done with U.S. taxation. That's not the way
it works in the corporate world. Such a move in our case would be a taxable event in the U.S. and the taxes would be
prohibitive.
Instead, if we were to re-domicile, this would be done by SLC (US), the company, or the parent company, here on the
right, putting a new foreign entity on top of itself. Shareholders would hand in their SLC (US) shares and would get
shares of the new parent company in return. Underneath that foreign company, you would still have SLC (US) and only
underneath SLC (US) you would have the Coffee Co. operating companies.
Profit, and for that matter, repatriations would flow through the SLC (US) company. And hence, we have cautioned
you that you should assume that Coffee Co. will pay a 35% tax rate and the repatriation tax.
Now, no doubt there's going to be a lot of speculation as to whether or not Coffee Co. could or could not do better than
that. And as we've said on the call, we will evaluate our most efficient capital structure, and we will do so in
conjunction with the decisions that have to be taken on where to base the Coffee Co. Company, and I hope that clarifies
a few of the questions that some of you've had.
To conclude, we've touched on the January 28th announcement and we've gone through our quarterly results. We're
aware of the fact that some of the information that we gave you during this call is a repetition of the 28, but we thought
it would be useful to go over some of that stuff again.
As discussed, 2011 will be a year where we will continue to experience real headwinds, but we have a plan in place that
will help us to achieve our guidance for profitability and EPS. Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to accelerate growth
and we are confident that, as the year progresses, this will show.
In calendar 2011, then, there will be a lot of work going into the creation of two pure-play companies, and we're
excited about the prospects of success for those two pure-play companies. We realize that there are many complexities

to our story, but please know that we are fully committed to keep you informed as we navigate through this process in
this year.
And with that said, it's very clear that we're looking forward to seeing you all at CAGNY. And now, Mark and I have
time to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alexia Howard [Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.]. Please state your
company name.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Yes. Good morning. It's Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Hi, Alexia.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Hi, Alexia. How are you?
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi. Just wanted to ask a question about the pricing on the International Beverage side, given
the commodity cost pressures this quarter, I'm surprised that there was only 1.9% of pricing in there. Was that because
of competitive dynamics over there, or was there a structural sort of inflexibility that prevented you from taking more
pricing? I'm assuming that we're going to get more through in the back half of the year.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. That's fair to assume,
Alexia. You'll have more in the back half of the year. When we look into the detail, what we're seeing is that this
pricing is coming up. Typically, in Europe, that then goes hand in hand with a grace period, where trade temporary
price reductions come through. So for the back half of the year we're looking at a significantly larger price increase
than you've see in the first half. Does that answer your question?
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Okay, great. Yes, it does. Could I just ask about the volumes in North American Retail, as
well? It looked as though, from the measured channel data, as though frankfurters and frozen desserts were pretty weak
this time. Is that something that we could continue – expect to continue to happen in the second half?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Well, we've been very focused
on recovering some of the cost pressures that came through from commodity cost increases. On the dessert side, the
bakery side, we took a deliberate decision that we wanted to get to a more appropriate level of profitability. We were
not making enough money, so we took a basically -- it's not that we have to make tons of money out of everything we
do, but we have to make a decent return. So we made a turn there. That led to an impact on the volume side in that
particular part of the business. That's why we're calling out that in six out of 12 categories, we do well. We've called
out from the share data. So if you add it all up, you actually see that volume and mix for the second quarter was
negative.
For the third and the fourth quarter, we are cautious. So we are – what we're saying is we're going to be okay. We're
going to be okay from a profitability point of view. We're going to be okay from a total sales point of view, so the
company will grow and will show increased profits for the whole of the year. But we are – with the words okay, saying
that's what it's going to be. On the coffee side, then, you'll see a meaningful acceleration of, in particular, the mix
element. And that's a function of all of the innovations that we have been launching over the last – what is it -- three or
four quarters. So we have L'OR capsules, which – where we're bringing more variety to the market. We're expanding
distribution. We're going into new countries. We've put capacity in place.
In Spain, we've launched – under Marcilla we've launched capsules, which people are very excited about. That will
make a contribution. We're rolling out Pépites D'Arôme. These are these tablets, as you may recall. And we continue to
roll out Senseo. France has double digit growth figures on Senseo. Spain, we've launched now, I think, that's something
like a year ago. We've taken it to Brazil. So on the North American Retail Meat side, we're saying second half is going

to be okay and we'll make another nice step in terms of overall sales and in terms of profitability. On the coffee side,
we're looking to see a lot of results coming through from the investments and the innovations that we've made. Mark,
do you want to add to that?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Yes, I would just add,
Alexia, I know when you look at the numbers, you can see that for the first half, our volume mix was down 1.1%.
We're forecasting it will be up between 3% to 4% for the second half. And Marcel took you through some of the
innovations that we see driving some of that. Of course, we will also be overlapping some of these lost customer
contracts in Foodservice and that will help us additionally. So overall, we're reasonably confident that we can get there
over the next six months.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: You just asked a question about
North America, Alexia, but we gave you the full story, so.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: I appreciate that.

The next question is from Andrew Lazar. Please state your company name.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Barclays Capital. Good morning.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Hey, Andrew. How are you?
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Very well. Thanks for some of the additional transparency. That's helpful. I guess one more on
pricing and inflation. The sort of inflation that you faced this quarter, or even in the fiscal first quarter, certainly is not
unprecedented relative to what you saw a couple years back. But I guess the past two quarters, the gap between what
you took as pricing and what the costs were just seems somewhat larger than we saw in any quarter two years back
when you faced a lot of the inflation in '08. So I'm just curious if maybe you could take us through a little bit of a --
maybe a couple of key similarities and key differences in your two core businesses; that what you're seeing in facing
this issue today versus two years ago?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, Andrew. I would caution
you on the side by saying, well, the price increases are not dissimilar to what you had two years ago. When we do our
sums, and Mark can give you some perspectives on that, we have this basket of increases. We are well in excess of
what we had two years ago, and Mark will give you some figures. So that's one.
Then the second question that you've -- or the second part of your question is to say, look, you've had a large gap
between what you're pricing through and what your qualities are. I think it's fair to point out that we had a $33 million
currency mark-to-market impact in there, so that you need to take out. Then you still have a very meaningful gap. So
let's just take one step back.
On the European business, it's clear that with private label being quite big in all European countries, that this is quite
[inaudible]. There's a couple of countries in the Netherlands. There's a couple of battles going on between some
retailers; France, the same thing. So we're having quite a bit of heavy lifting to do in order to get everybody there to
accept price increases.
On the North American side, we have been making sure that we recover the commodity cost increases. And also there
from a competitive point of view, we have to very carefully watch our back and see whether or not those pricing
actions are replicated by competitors, because if we get too far ahead of the music, then obviously we will have issues.
Mark, do you want to add?

<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Yeah. I think it's a fair
question, Andrew. Two years ago, we certainly faced significant commodity increases. Let me give you a perspective,
in gross numbers, our '09 increase of commodities was around $350 million, give or take. This year, we're talking about
over $500 million in terms of commodity cost increases. I would also say the flavor is a little bit different. It's
significantly, on the coffee side, we're seeing this year as we have our Arabica prices up 65%. You've seen those in the
markets. And in Europe, it's taking a little bit longer to get increases through than it is traditionally in North America,
and that's also had an impact in terms of the lag that you're referring to. So although we have seen increases two years
ago, they are quite a bit more significant this year for us.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Great. I appreciate that added color. Thank you.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew.
Operator
The next question is from Tim Ramey [D.A. Davidson]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Good morning. It's D.A. Davidson. Marcel, it's been previously stated that North American Retail
would be up both in margin and dollars for the year in terms of EBIT. And this was not an unexpected downtick, but a
meaningful downtick. Do you still have confidence that that can be true for the full year 2011?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Tim, you are of course closest to
the file of anybody, so you are an expert in keeping us to our promises. So thank you for that question. The answer is
yes. Yes. So we've said we see another uptick in margin and we still think that we can deliver that.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Can you elaborate on that? Because this has been one of the most interesting forecasts of the year
and I think it'd be stunning if you did it. Is this relating to the sliced meat facility or? I mean, clearly, you've got more
price increases that have to happen, even incremental to the ones you've already taken, just to catch up to where lean
hogs are likely to take you or trim is likely to take you and so on.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, right. So the answer in
respect to the figures is yes. And you're right to point out, to say, well, then, you have still a bit of work to do. Second
quarter, let me just start with that. The second quarter margin, I think, was 11.6%. That was the fourth highest figure
that we've reported over as long as anybody remembered. We took that out of the script yesterday because the fourth
ranking doesn't sound very exciting, but the second quarter was actually not bad. Let me start with that.
Then secondly, we recognize that we're executing against a very different environment than when we made our plan.
So we are making some real adjustments on how we are going to be managing through pricing and MAP investments in
the second half of the year. So we are going to be pragmatic there. We've invested very significantly over the last three
quarters, so we think we can afford to do that. That is the second one. And then the third one, Tim, is we've been
investing quite a bit in projects on ERP II, that is the implementation of SAP in our factories. That's a huge project, a
lot of that is CapEx but a lot of it is also operational expense.
The same thing for the Kansas City plant, the Kansas City plant is now coming on-stream so that will fall to the
wayside. So it's a combination of things. One, we're going to be pragmatic about how much MAP investment we can
afford in the second half. Two, some of the project expenses that we've had in the first half will fall to the wayside. And
not only that, but we'll have some benefits coming through. And then three, the second quarter was not a bad quarter. It
just wasn't as good as the second quarter of last year. We're happy that we pointed out last year in second quarter that
that was not a trend line that people could rely on. So I hope that – does that give you a bit of color?
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Yeah, it clearly does. An 11.7% margin would be something to dream about three or four years
ago, as I recall. So that isn't bad.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: It's heavy lifting and when I say
we're pragmatic, we're all traveling in cotton boxes. That's a bit of a joke, but it gives you an idea of – we are making

sure that we bring every penny to the table because we want to obviously, achieve that target of showing another year
of sales growth and margin improvement.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: And just a quick one on International Beverage, because the price increases are even – or the cost
increases are even more acute there than they are in the Meat segment, I think. How do you feel you'll be able to do in
terms of margin preservation in the second half of the year there? I'm modeling them down. I assume that's the right
thing to be doing, but...
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: The – I'll tell you what our
objective is, Tim. The objective is to exit the year largely with gross profit per kilo, that's the way we look at it, largely
with gross profit per kilo intact. In order for gross profit per kilo to be intact, a number of things still have to happen.
We still have to get a price increase in France. And in the Netherlands, I'm not sure that we will actually achieve that
objective of gross profit per kilo to be intact. But that's the thinking in the business. That's the way we look at it. So we
don't look at it with percentage-wise.
We internally talk about what is the gross profit that we make per kilo? Obviously, in the first half, we haven't – we're
behind that because we haven't priced everything through immediately. So the objective is to get back to that target as
the year progresses. We're hopeful that we will be able to do so in all major markets. I think in the Netherlands and the
Benelux, given the large share of private label and the in-fighting that is going on, on the retailer side, I'm not sure that
we are going to be able to do that within the next six months.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Got it. Thanks so much.

The next question is from Ken Zaslow [BMO Capital Markets]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: BMO Capital Markets. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Melissa Napier, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Ken.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Good morning Ken. How are
you?
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Good. Hey, I appreciate the clarity on the taxes and stuff. I just want to make sure I understand
something. On the International Beverage side, where you're guiding to 35%, just looking through your 10-K's and
thinking about this a little bit, if you -- to achieve that 35%, you'd be assuming no growth initiatives in the International
markets, where you'd be indefinitely be able to reinvest and not pay taxes on it? And then, the other part of that is, you
would assume that the income tax from operations outside the U.S., which reduce your taxes anywhere from 8% to
16%, won't reoccur? Is that the way to think about it, is that those two things go away?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: I am not sure that I understood
everything that you're asking me. Let me just give you a handle and see whether or not it answers your question. The
International business pays a tax rate which is lower than the 35% that we have here in the U.S.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Yep.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: And that's a function of
primarily the fact that tax rates in Europe are significantly lower. In the Netherlands, for example, it's, in fact, 25%.
And in many jurisdictions in Europe, tax rates are lower than here. So to the extent that we bring profit up, that profit is
being repatriated to the U.S., we have to top up to 35%.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Yep. But if you keep the profits in the International -- I think last year, you kept in $200 million to
$225 million.

Page 12 of 22
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Correct. If you keep the profits,
then you have an opportunity to over time, reduce the profitability. We've been running a lot of – there is complexities
around this with inter-company loans and there is a whole -- you can get a Ph.D. on it. So it's not quite as simple as
saying, okay, we reckon that we need about half of our profit at the top end. And therefore, it's half of our profit a tax
rate of 35% will apply and other half, it's a tax rate of, let's say, 25% will apply. There is more complexity inside the
Coffee Co., re-domiciled or not, and that's why when we run our models, we're saying it's appropriate to guide the
market for a 35% tax rate.
To the extent that the business becomes -- makes real progress in terms of becoming very profitable, then, obviously,
you have opportunities to leave some of the money behind in Europe. You'd want to invest that money wisely, because
otherwise, you end up with a pile of cash in Europe and debt at the top end of the company. And that's not necessarily a
very efficient balance sheet structure, but to the extent that profitability goes up, you have -- you start to have
opportunities to drive the tax rate down. Does that answer your question?
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Yep. That's – yeah, pretty much. I'm kind of in that camp that you're going to be able to put some
money to work in Europe; therefore, keep money there; therefore, your tax might be lower than 35%. That's what I was
trying to think about.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Okay. Yeah, and as we've
indicated, we will, of course, do everything we can to optimize the structure of Coffee Co.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: And then, my next question is on the re-domiciling issue, just to understand this, as well. If the fair
value of your stock is where it is today and you could do your loss carry forwards between what you have in the 10-K
and from the Bakery division, to what extent will the fair value of today's stock price impact if you would re-domicile
or not? Because it seems like if you -- if by current stock price, it would be a different risk reward or a different tax rate
than it would be if your stock was at $20 or $21. Is that a fair statement, as well?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: We are -- again, let me take a
stab, see whether or not I answer your question. If it were to come to a re-domicile, the re-domiciliation is not a taxable
event at the corporate level, but it would be a taxable event at the shareholder level, whereby people would be taxed for
the proportionate part of the capital gain that they're making in the swap of Sara Lee U.S. shares into Coffee Co. shares.
So let's just take an example, to make it real easy. Let's say you've bought your shares for $15. The two shares then do
$20 together, so they both do $10. Then your basis gets prorated through both shares, so you have two times 7.5 and
you get taxed at the shareholder level for the swap between SLC (US) shares and the shares of the International holding
company. So you get capital gains tax over $2.50. That's the tax consequence of the re-domiciliation and depends, of
course, on where you trade and where you bought. So that will be different from one shareholder to another.
And then you've referred to the loss that we have made into the sale of the Fresh Bakery business. And so we make a
capital loss. That capital loss is an item that we are studying in relation to the spin-off of the Meat Co. business.
Because in order for the spin-off in the Meat Co. business to be fully taxed -- completely a non-tax issue, a non-tax -- it
doesn't generate tax at the corporate level, that loss may come into play. And that's something that we are studying.
And then it becomes really complicated and I have to say I'm a bit out of my depth. I would have to talk to our tax
people, but I know that that loss comes into play. And it also comes into replay in terms of the debt being moved
around because we have to put some debt into the Meat Co. Company. And if I recall it correctly, in moving that debt
around, the fact that we have a capital loss actually comes in handy.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: I didn't realize that the taxable spin-off – the non-taxable spin-off requires the allocation, the loss
carry forward. I appreciate that. Thank you.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Hope that helps. Good. Next
one.

The next question is from Terry Bivens [JPMorgan]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Hi. I'm from JPMorgan. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Hi, Terry.
<A - Melissa Napier, Investor Relations>: Hi, Terry.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Hi Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Marcel, just a couple of quick questions on the North American Retail side. How much did your
Kansas City plant impact the operating earnings? And if you could give us an idea if there were duplicative costs in
there? I'm just trying to get a better indication of what KC meant for the earnings, what it likely will imply for the
second half?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Terry, it's Mark. I can
give you a rough number that was in the second quarter for Kansas City and our SAP implementation, which we would
regard as non-recurring as we go into particularly the fourth quarter and into next year -- it's around $9 million, $10
million of an impact.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Taken together, Mark?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Yes, taken together,
around $9 million or $10 million.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: This is the new CFO of the
company using the word, nonrecurring. You'll have to deal with the accountants afterwards. Go ahead, Terry, what's
your next question?
<Q - Terry Bivens>: I'm just reaching for my Bayer aspirin after all this. Hold on one -- okay. But that does go away --
you're suggesting all of it goes away in the fourth quarter and going forward, just to make sure?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Most of it would be
gone away by the fourth quarter. Kansas City is becoming operational in the third quarter. ERP II, our SAP supply
chain, is fully rolled out through the end of the fiscal year. So we still have some plants coming online over the next
four or five months.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: That goes way, Terry, and then,
of course, we should have benefits coming through.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Absolutely.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: The Kansas City plant is a much
more cost-efficient plant than what we currently have.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. And just sticking with the meat operation, at least in the syndicated data, you lost share to
Oscar Mayer in both sliced deli meats and hot dogs during the -- what would appear to be your second quarter, the
December quarter. And I'm curious, what are your assumptions as to what they're going to do competitively going
forward? It seems to me this could be the fly in the ointment in terms of those healthy increases that Tim Ramey was
asking about?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Hey, Terry -- Mark, I think,
after this call is in trouble with the accountants. He talked about non-recurring costs. I don't want to be in trouble with
the lawyers, so if you don't mind, I'm not going to be making assumptions about what Oscar is going to do or not going
to do.

The next question is from Akshay Jagdale [KeyBanc]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Thank you. KeyBanc Capital Markets. Good morning.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Morning.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Morning.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: I'm going to give it a stab on this spin-off math here. So if we take your word for tax issues not
being a major factor for creating value, I'm just trying to get any insights that you can give us in terms of your analysis
of how you create value. Now mathematically, obviously, it's pretty simple. When you spin them off, the valuations
could garner a premium to what you're currently trading at, which would be a function of growth. So I just really want
to focus on the growth aspect. The – how does the spin-off impact your ability to grow? So in other words, the two
separate companies will grow, I'm assuming, faster than they were – than they would, if they were combined. Is that
right? Because that's something you can control and I'm sure, given the structure that currently exists, you've done
some analysis there. Can you help me just understand a little bit better how you're thinking of creating value through
the spin-off?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Well, what I think we can talk
about is, the two pure-plays that we're creating. And let me just give you a perspective on. We internally asked the
senior management team and we will communicate that with our own people in the course of this week – is we said,
look, there's two ways of thinking about this. One is we are splitting the company in two, and the other way to look at it
is to say, no, we're going to be doing two IPOs. So we're going to bring two clean pure-play companies to the market.
And pure-plays tend to do well. And the reason why they tend to do well is because management gets to sit really close
to the market opportunity. And that's the only thing that management focuses on, by definition. So there is not a – it is –
I will immediately share with you that that is a judgment call. A judgment call is supported by statistical analysis.
If you look at how companies generally do when they become pure-plays, there is good statistical evidence that
suggests that companies tend to do better from a top-line view than other companies that sit in conglomerates. And we
are strong believers that if we actually create these two pure-plays, the same processes will be at work in our own
respective companies. And it's very hard to pin it down.
I don't think that when Coach was spun off and they went through a process, which I think was very comparable to an
IPO. I don't think that anybody had realized that, after a couple of years of lackluster growth within the Sara Lee
portfolio, they would do extremely well.
And it's a function of management gets to sit really close to the market opportunity, gets investors behind it that believe
in that particular market opportunity and therefore, are willing to fund it. And these types of things lead to faster
growth. And I hope you bear with me that I cannot identify -- we're going to spin the company and, as a result of that,
in the second quarter of 2011, we're going to be launching three additional products. That's just not the way it works.
But the statistical evidence suggests that value creation from pure-plays is very strong. Does that help you?

<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: That does help. And the Coach example is a positive, but I could also -- that is helpful. I'll
leave it there with that question. The other question I had was more specific to the reporting. What is the Other
category within organic sales growth that you report in your press release?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: The Other category, a
number of different things go through there. For example, in our Foodservice business, we have some sales regards to
machines, et cetera. And we also have some green coffee sales that we have specifically in there. And there are some
commodity sales, as well, on the North America side. That's roughly the makeup of Other.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Can I just go back to your
previous question?
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Sure.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: The statistical evidence would
indicate that, on average, pure-plays tend to do very well after splits or spin-offs. There is a consideration which, of
course, has occurred to us and that is size. Do the companies that you spin-off, do they have the appropriate size? And
in our case, we strongly believe they have. And I have been involved in multiple situations where spin-offs took place.
And sometimes the company that you create is just too small to stand on its own feet. We do not believe that that is the
case here. We believe that with both companies having something like $4 billion of sales -- very, very good EBITDA
and profitability profiles. That is an appropriate size. Those companies should be able to do really well. And we think
that by putting the focus on -- of putting the senior management really close to the market opportunity, we will see a
benefit coming through.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Okay. Great. I'll pass it along.

The next question is from Vincent Andrews [Morgan Stanley]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Hi, it's Morgan Stanley. Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Morning, Vincent.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Morning.
<A - Melissa Napier, Investor Relations>: Morning.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: I wanted to just follow-up. Mark, on the call I guess last week, you made some comments
around where inflation was and you'd said that the basket, on a cash basis, of course, had migrated into the high 20s.
And then you made another comment that basically was that you'd see about half of that this fiscal year. And I guess
we're very focused on this call about making the back half of the year and so forth, but I also wanted to get to what the
longer term implications are. And I guess my question is, it just seems like, maybe to Marcel's point earlier, that there
are a few more mountains ahead of us from a pricing perspective. Because if you're only handling half of the mid or
high 20s this year, a lot of that's got to be in front of you for fiscal '12. And I just -- can you put that in perspective or
correct any of that if it's wrong? And maybe -- go ahead?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: I can do that. Yeah,
just to clarify again, when I talk about the high 20s, that's if you take all of the commodities that we effectively utilize
in terms of input, on average, when you look at their increases year-over-year, it's in the high 20s; it's 28%, 29%. When
you take into account what we do from a full recover, hedging perspective, the actual impact on us is going to be
around half of that. So not that half has to come, we effectively should have around half of that in terms of our cost
push.

<Q - Vincent Andrews>: I guess, but won't those hedges roll off and then you'd have the other half next year, or am I
missing something?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Well, obviously, as we
go into fiscal '12, we continue to look at how the market is playing out and we'll take appropriate hedges if costs keep
pushing up. That's something for sure we will have to take into account for next year. But as you go to the end of this
fiscal year, we're pretty much where we think we're going to be at this point.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Vincent, you're absolutely right,
because we haven't done that and that's why earlier, I made the point about us being very focused on trying to exit this
year with the gross profit levels per kilo broadly where we should be or where we have been.
Let me just go back to the metaphor of mountain climbing. It's just a reflection of this frustrating experience. You
climb this mountain. You see this peak of the -- somewhere high up, and you climb and then you get there, and you
think, oh, and there's another one. At some point in time, actually it does stop. And with the coffee prices where they
are, this all adds time lags, supply will react. And it's -- we've had debate as to whether or not this is going to go forever
and ever and ever. At some point in time, you actually do reach a peak and you start -- you put your skis on and you ski
down, so not all Hell and gloom.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Yeah. I guess what I was getting at was that there's a need to try to make this guidance that's
out there for this year that -- and obviously, that the environment has gotten tougher on you through the year, but there's
also still more work to be done into next year. And I'm just trying to think about how you're balancing, doing the right
things to get all the way through, to put your skis on and go down the hill ultimately, and get through fiscal '12 relative
to just sort of putting up numbers that the Street is going to be happy with this year. I mean, how is that -- how much of
a challenge is that internally?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: That's fair enough. You've got
to be careful not to chuck your skis overboard whilst you're climbing just in order to get to the top, because then you
can't go down any more. So while we're on that metaphor, where we have – and we've had that debate as well. If you
look at the last three quarters, we've actually very significantly invested. So we've got some good innovation coming
through. We have some real investment coming through. And next year, know that will be further heavy lifting to do on
the pricing side; but on the other hand, a couple of things start to play out nicely for us next year that we haven't
included in the $0.15 that Mark has talked about, in terms of the opportunities. Let me just give you a few -- and I
haven't prepared for that extensively in this call, but let me just give you a few.
First of all, the Kansas City plant will come on-stream and that will provide us further lift. Secondly, some of the
Accelerate projects that we are currently pushing through will provide us lift. We are currently working on the
restructuring of our Dutch pension plan. We'll have the benefit this year, that's a half-year benefit, next year it will be a
full year benefit. Thirdly, this year we haven't got the full benefit of innovations like, for example, L'OR EspressO
coming through. We've noted that to date nine months into -- I think we're now nine months, something like that into
the launch, we've sold 150 million capsules. You can roughly work out -- working back from the retail price as to what
that means in terms of top-line.
We're launching into more countries, bringing more varieties in. We've put the capacity in, so we will have a
meaningful uplift there. Same thing for Spain, where these capsules that we're launching, they're launched in the back
half of the year. So yes, we'll have further work to do in 2012 in order to keep working against commodity cost
increases. And you are absolutely right to point that out. That said, in fiscal '12, we have a number of tailwinds that
Mark has pointed out, from a very technical perspective. And we haven't as yet spoken about the operational
perspectives but we think that from the operational perspective, we will also have good support in order to drive our
business forward in 2012. Does that answer your question?
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: That does. Thank you very much for all the detail. I really appreciate it.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Thank you.

The next question is from Robert Moskow [Credit Suisse].
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. I just have two points. You mentioned obstacles to pricing in France, or at
least that there hadn't been any pricing in France. Can you just tell me, what is the obstacle? Have your competitors
taken pricing yet and are you lagging or...?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: The obstacle is retailers.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Pardon me?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: It's retail. And if you'll allow
me, I am reluctant to go into the specifics of customers, but there is a bit of a battle going on in France. It's not our
competitors. Both we and our main competitors have been diligently working to convince everybody that price
increases need to be taken and are the only path forward to protect both our margins and the retailers' margins. So the
issue is retailers.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Marcel, it's a pretty big market, France. And if the retailers aren't allowing it through, despite
60% increases in coffee beans, is there a chance here that – when will we know whether the pricing went through?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: We will know in the second
half.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Last question, Kansas City, is there a capacity increase for you as a result of the new
plant in Kansas City, overall for the organization?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, the answer to that is yes.
But we're also bringing back in-house some production that we currently have outsourced.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And are you shutting down any capacity internally or no?

<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Good morning, Bryan.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: I -- just two questions, one related to International Beverage and the other related to the spin.
On International Beverage, with coffee costs going up and price sensitivity, consumer having price sensitivity to
increases and I guess retailers also, just how is the Pod business – yours and just maybe just for the industry – been
affected by this sensitivity to pricing? It just seems like from what you've reported this morning and what Nestlé has
done, it seems like the Pod business is actually still gaining overall dollar share, even though there's some sensitivity to
pricing. So I'm just trying to get an understanding of how Pods have performed through this phase.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah, this is real simple, of
course. If you look at the coffee raw materials as a percentage of the total consumer or wholesale/retail price, for Pods,
it's a fraction of what we have in the Roast & Ground.

In Roast & Ground, the coffee component is actually very high -- I don't want to quote figures off the top of my head,
I'm looking at Mark, but we can come to you -- back to you and you can work it out yourself, by the way, if you look at
retail prices. So the Pods are significantly less affected by raw material cost increases. And the Pods business is going
strong. There is absolutely no -- if you look at the figures, we try to estimate, for example, how big Nestlé is in Spain,
in France, in countries that we have data on.
And an espresso system is a very material component of the overall Coffee market. And it's a growing component of
the overall Coffee market. So that's why we're keen to participate. We are working on our own innovations. As events
unfold, we'll have more visibility on that. But there is absolutely no question in our mind that the market is going
towards single-serve premiumization, that there is a lot more room up there and we'll actively participate. At the same
time, I think it's important to note that we are proud of some of the innovations that we're bringing to the Roast &
Ground market.
The interesting thing about the Pépites D'Arôme in the Netherlands, so these are these tablets that we bring to the
market, that's a very nice example of how you can innovate in a category, which by many is considered to be a
commodity category. We don't think that's true. We think that in Roast & Ground you can innovate. And Pépites
D'Arôme is a prime example. The thing that we're doing in Spain with the capsules for the Napolitana machines is also
a very good example of how you can innovate in the Roast & Ground market.
So we're firing on all cylinders, both on the Pods side. We're participating in the systems that there are out there at this
point in time. We're working on new systems. And meanwhile, we are working actively to bring more innovation to the
Roast & Ground category.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just in looking forward in terms of the two separate -- the
two companies post the split-off, if we look at first Project Accelerate savings, have you -- in the preliminary estimates
that you've provided for operating income for New Sara Lee and Coffee Co., have you also allocated the Accelerate
savings between those two companies, as well?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: I'm looking at Mark.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Yes.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Who's nodding yes.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Yes, we have.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Yes, we have. So what
we have determined for Coffee and what we've determined for Meats are both in their individual segments.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: And then as we try to model off of that going forward, there's going to be -- well, I guess my
question is, should we assume that there will be some incremental costs that each company incur because they now will
be stand-alone businesses? And does Accelerate maybe give some of that back? Because my understanding at least part
of Project Accelerate was to try to centralize some of the -- getting some of the costs or try to create cost savings
through centralization and now we're going back to de-centralizing. So I'm just trying to get a sense for, as we're
modeling it forward, will it be – well, A, will there be a step-up in cost for each individual company because they now
will be stand-alone? And then second, just any gauge in terms of how that will be relative to maybe how other split-offs
have has fared in that?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Mark, chime in, but first of all,
the issue of splitting the companies in two, whether or not that leads to extra cost, we have done an analysis where we
have gone through all our – what I would call corporate expenses. And yes, you need two Investor Relations Managers
and you need two Treasurers. That said, there are also things that you can do without. We currently have in our
company a span of control of two, if you like, with the large Coffee business and our North American Meats business.
So there's opportunities there as well, and we have – when we did the analysis, we've come provisionally to the

conclusion that that probably evens out.
As soon as you create an awareness that, okay, let's try and make sure that we look at this not as a split of the two
companies, but we will look at this as an IPO and we're going to make these two companies really successful. That is a
fresh perspective, which I am confident will lead people to say, okay, if we're going to be a $4 billion company, then
let's make sure that we run our business as a $4 billion company, because we want that $4 billion company to be
successful. And I am confident that, whereas our initial indication said it's a wash, I'm pretty confident that if we do it
well, it will actually be a benefit. And Mark, you want to talk.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Well, I would just
concur, but in terms of what you mentioned, Bryan, on Accelerate, you are right, that part of that program has been to
reduce costs both at the segments and at corporate and some of it has been leveraging certain outsourcing activities, et
cetera. When we modeled this, in terms of the two separate companies, we believe we can pretty much get to a
non-increase when we both – look at both companies versus where we are right now. Clearly, in terms of moving
towards some of these new arrangements, we may have some costs to get. And we'll give you color to that in due
course, but our overall modeling is that there should not be a cost push when you actually look at the two companies
separately.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.

<A - Melissa Napier, Investor Relations>: This is Melissa Napier. I was just going to interject that, we originally had

The next question is from Judy Hong [Goldman Sachs]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Thanks, Goldman Sachs. Good morning.
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Hi, Judy.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Marcel, another benefit that you've talked about in terms of creating two pure-play companies is
that it allows each company to have more flexibility to make acquisitions going forward. I'm wondering if you can talk
about how important acquisition might be as a part of growth strategy for each, and for each of the businesses in broad
sense, what are some of the acquisitions that could make sense in Coffee? Is it more geographic expansion? In Retail
Meats, how should we think about acquisition in that part of the business?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Let me just start by saying that
the philosophy that the management team of Sara Lee has, is that you should only be doing acquisitions if you feel that
you are the better owner of an asset. So you have to have a track record in terms of delivering. And you have to have a
clear case to be made as to why you can do better than somebody else with that particular asset. I think that will be
unchanged for both companies because both companies' management teams are of the same mindset.
So I don't think you should assume that people are going to be going overboard in terms of doing all sorts of acquisition
sprees or spending or doing – I think I keep going back to what I've said earlier – you can go a long way in life by just

avoiding doing anything stupid. And both management teams, I am absolutely convinced, will be very disciplined in
the way they go about acquisitions.
Now, that said, both companies are attractive companies to partner with. It has happened to us before that people say,
hey, I wouldn't mind combining my Coffee business with yours, but then I'd like to participate in your Coffee business.
Now so far, we didn't have that type of flexibility. We couldn't provide that. And after the spin, we will be able to do
that. So we think that our Coffee business on a standalone basis and our Meat business, same thing, will be better
partners for people to join up with.
So just summarizing, both management teams, I am absolutely confident, will be disciplined about this, will be very
focused on creating value for shareholders. Both management teams will no doubt focus on building a track record of
creating real value organically for shareholders, and that will be their ticket to, step by step do sensible acquisitions. It
is absolutely evident to us that if you spin or if you split the two companies, that both companies will become more
attractive partners for other participant in the industry to team up with. Does that answer your question?
<Q - Judy Hong>: Yes, that's helpful. Thank you.

The next question is from Robert Dickerson [ConsumerEdge Research]. Please state your company name.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: ConsumerEdge Research. Thanks a lot. I just had one or two quick questions. I guess – I
mean, it's more strategic based, your overall thought process, one, with respect to the special dividend. And then two, I
just wanted to follow-up and talk little bit about the International Bakery segment.
On the special dividend, I just wanted clarification – have or have you not said the exact timing of that? I mean, I know
it will be fiscal year '12, but the assumption I'm making is that it'll take place before the actual spin, which should be
taking place early in calendar '11 -- I mean, in early calendar '12, is that right?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: That's right.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Okay. Great. And then, what was the thought process around paying out a $3 special
dividend? I mean, I realize there was the capital plan, the buyback, the $2.50 and the $3 in shares. As their stock price
goes up, you don't want to average up your buyback price, lowers your risk. So I mean, it's – overall, it's better for
investors to get the $3 cash dividend, but like I mean, why not if you're splitting the company, why not take some of
that at least and delever more pre-spin? I mean, is it just essentially to give back investors the capital and potentially
lower the volatility on the shares going into the spin or if you could just talk about that a little bit?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: No. The view that we take is
that -- there's a couple of things we believe that both companies should have an efficient balance sheet. And we've said
that we are targeting solid investment grade or words to that effect. And there is merit in making sure that the balance
sheet is efficient when you come out of the other end of the tunnel of the split. That's one.
Secondly, with the buybacks, what we have seen is that people tend to look at valuation from the perspective of
applying a multiple even to the current year EPS or the next year's EPS. And if you do that, while underneath you have
a multi-year buyback program, you effectively ignore some of the cash sitting on the balance sheet and the $3 dividend
forces that value into the valuation. So that was another consideration.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Okay. Perfect, I agree, so I like that answer. And then the other quick question is just on
International Bakery. I mean, obviously, you sold North America Fresh Bakery as you're referring to the spun coffee
business is Coffee Co., it's not -- I mean, we're not referring it to as Coffee Co. and 5% to 10% of operating profits
bakery business. What are you thinking strategically about the International Bakery business?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: If you don't mind, Robert, we
are strategically thinking that we're going to create a pure-play company. And just – and I'm going to leave it at that.

<Q - Eric Katzman>: Morning. I guess a couple of questions, Marcel.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yep.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: The depreciation and amortization, it looks like that's running $320 million on the new
companies combined. And that's materially lower than you were running. Is that all due to the bread disposition, the
North American Fresh bread disposition?
<A - Mark A. Garvey, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller>: Eric, it's Mark. It's
mostly due to the bread and also the Household and Body Care disposition. And of course, we have some depreciation
amortization coming off as well as you move into next year. But it's mostly to do with the discontinued operations.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then the CapEx on the new co. -- is it probably going to run about equal to D&A? I
mean, are those two going to offset each other in the --?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President>: I think that that is a bit too early
to tell, Eric. It depends on how successful both businesses innovate and grow their top-line. So I'd be loathe to provide
additional color. I think both companies have an ambition to grow their top-line and invest behind it. But they'll both
have to show that they can actually grow and bring the innovation to the market. And with that, justify the CapEx that
goes behind it. Eric? We seem to have lost you.
<A - Melissa Napier, Investor Relations>: Hello? Okay, I think we seemed to have lost Eric. Is there any final
questions?
Marcel H. M. Smits, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President
Good. Well, we are looking at a silent phone at this point in time. So what I suggest we do is we end the call here.
We've been on the phone for an hour and 40 minutes. The reason why we want to take a lot of time is because we
realize full well that we have an unfolding story, which has a certain amount of complexity that needs to be explained.
So that's why we've taken time. We will be out on the road, and we are keen to take your questions to keep you fully
abreast of everything that's happening in our company.
As for now, thank you all very much for your presence in the call. We're looking forward to speaking with you in very
short-term. Thank you. Good bye.
