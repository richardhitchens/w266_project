participating in listen-only mode.
As a reminder, our presentation today, slide 3, includes certain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's
current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of
assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and which inherently are subject to risks. Please refer to the slide
in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that
could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements.
I'd like to remind you as well that our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rule. In an
appendix to our slides, we've provided a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures. The slides as well as our earnings release and selected quarterly financial data can be found on our website.
Last, we'd like to remind you that we're hosting a presentation and luncheon featuring Campbell products at the
Consumer Analyst Group of New York event next week. Our presentation begins promptly at 10:30 Eastern Standard
Time on Wednesday, February 23. We hope you'll join us either via webcast or better yet live in Boca Raton.
And with that, I give you our President and CEO, Doug Conant.
Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. This morning we reported earnings per share of $0.71, a 4% decline. For the first half we delivered
earnings per share of $1.53, a 5% decline. Sales declined 1% for the quarter and the first half. Our results for the first
half combined with a more muted outlook for the balance of the year gave rise to the change in annual guidance that we
provided in this morning's news release.
Today I'll be focusing my remarks on our largest segment, U.S. Soups, Sauces and Beverages. That having been said,
as Craig will highlight later, I would point out that year-to-date our other three segments all reported operating income
growth.
In the second quarter, similar to the first, we continued to protect our U.S. soup consumer base by maintaining a strong
advertising and promotional profile in the face of a very challenging environment. As a result, in measured retail
channels, wet soup consumer takeaway volume growth rose meaningfully, outpacing the average gains in other simple
meals during the period.
However, also similar to the first quarter, our increased promotions in the second quarter were costly as we strived to
maintain our competitive profile and honored our customer commitments. This promotional spending pressured our
gross margin rate, again similar to the first quarter, and negatively impacted our EBIT performance.
Before I turn to the second half outlook, let me comment briefly on our sauces brands, Prego pasta sauce and Pace
Mexican sauce. Prego and Pace are large profitable brands for us. For many years they have been profitable growth
engines as well. More recently, private label and value brands have made inroads in sauces. As a result, our sauces'
performance in the second quarter was highly pressured.
We expect intense competitive pressures in U.S. Soups, Sauces and Beverages to remain in the back half of this fiscal
year. This challenging environment for the balance of the year gave rise to the change in our annual guidance that we
announced this morning. That having been said, we currently expect improved sales, EBIT and EPS performance in the
second half of our year.
Later in our presentation Craig will elaborate a bit more fully on our plans to improve profitability, including increasing
price realization and expanding our margins in preparation for higher inflation in fiscal 2012. So I won't go into that
now.
Let me just make a broad observation about what we're focusing on at Campbell. As other food companies have noted,
the overall environment remains challenging, particularly in the U.S. We continue to believe that the key to success is

innovation with the right price value proposition supported by effective consumer marketing. Delivering that
combination with all our brands in a consistent way is the focus of our action planning going forward. Denise and I are
committed to working together to advance these plans in order to deliver consistent top and bottom line growth as we
have done in the past. We look forward to advancing our thinking further and during the Q&A and at the upcoming
CAGNY conference.

Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. I'll spend a few minutes walking through the second quarter results and the
segment highlights followed by our year-to-date results. And I'll conclude by addressing our revised full year earnings
guidance, which is provided in our news release this morning.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.127 billion, down 1% versus the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the
favorable impact of currency translation, organic net sales decreased by 2%. As anticipated we maintained a high level
of promotional spending through the second quarter, which has negatively impacted the sales performance maintenance
of our U.S. Soups, Sauces and Beverages segment. As Doug noted we achieved good sales growth in our Baking and
Snacking segment. Primarily as a result of the margin impact of higher promotional spending, EBIT declined by 8% in
the quarter to $359 million. EPS was $0.71 in the quarter down 4% as compared with the second quarter of 2010. Our
reported net sales decline of 1% was composed of a 1-point decline in organic sales partly offset by a 1-point gain from
currently translation as both the Australian and Canadian dollars have strengthened. As you can see from chart nine,
our increased promotional spending drove a 2-point decline in sales accounting for the overall decline in organic sales
as volume mix and pricing were comparable to a year ago.
Due to the elevated promotional spending in the quarter, our gross margin percentage declined from 40.5% to 39.4%, a
decrease of 110 basis points. Marketing and selling expenses declined from $301 million to $291 million this quarter,
reflecting reduced levels of advertising and lower selling expenses. The latter is due to cost savings initiatives.
Advertising expense in U.S. Soup and Sauces declined partially offset by increases in Beverages at Pepperidge Farm.
Administrative expenses increased 3% to $154 million.
As I noted earlier, EBIT declined by 8% in the quarter. Below the line net interest expense rose 19%, an increase of $5
million driven by the higher mix of fixed rate debt in the portfolio following the $400 million long-term debt issuance
that we did in last July. The tax rate declined 1.9 points to 27.1% due to lower taxes on foreign earnings. With the
lower tax rate offsetting the impact of higher interest costs, net earnings, similar to EBIT, declined by 8% in the
quarter. Average shares outstanding decreased 3% in the quarter as we continued to execute our strategic share
repurchase program. As a result, the 8% decline in net earnings yielded only a 4% decline in earnings per share.
In our segment results for the quarter, U.S. Soups, Sauces and Beverages sales declined by 4%. This change reflected
lower U.S. soup sales attributable to the overall increase and promotional spending and a sales decline in sauces in the
face of stepped up competitive activity. Sales of both Prego and Pace were below year ago levels. Private label gains in
the Mexican Sauce category have had a negative impact on our Pace sales. Sales in U.S. Beverages were down slightly,
falling 1% for the quarter. Sales of V8 vegetable juices declined while sales of both V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash
increased. Operating earnings declined 15% to $220 million this quarter from $259 million a year ago.
U.S. Soup sales for the quarter declined 4%. We experienced declines in both condensed and ready-to-serve soup,
down 7% and 4%, respectively. Broth continued to perform well with sales increasing 7% reflecting another successful
holiday period. U.S. Soup sales were negatively impacted by our increased promotional spending and also by
movements in customer inventories.
While our sales were down, I should point out that we achieved strong externally measured consumer takeaway volume
in the second quarter, a significant improvement in marketplace performance from the first quarter. Additionally our

market research would indicate that our new portfolio advertising campaign is effective and that consumers report a
positive impact.
Looking ahead, we'll begin to shift our marketing mix from trade to brand building activities, including this advertising
and additional consumer spending. This shift is designed to improve our price realization while building our brand
equity. We recognize that the shift will negatively impact volumes in the short-term, but we feel it is the right move
toward improved category health.
In Baking and Snacking, organic sales increased 5% reflecting volume driven gains in both Pepperidge Farm and
Arnott's. At Pepperidge Farm, sales increased due to gains in Goldfish and Baked Naturals snack crackers, Milanos and
Home Style Cookies, stuffing and the successful expansion of the Deli Flats line. Arnott's in Australia posted stronger
sales due to gains in savory crackers led by Vita-Weat and Shapes as well as growth in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits
partly offset by a decline in other sweet varieties.
Earnings increased 11% in Baking and Snacking due to the volume driven growth in Pepperidge Farm. Organic sales in
our International Soups, Sauces and Beverages segment decreased by 3%, reflecting lower net pricing as we increased
spending levels to maintain volumes. The organic sales decline reflects lower sales in Latin America, Canada and
Europe. Operating earnings decreased 7% in the quarter primarily due to declines in Europe and Canada.
While we're seeing improvement in some parts of our Food Service business, most notably the refrigerated soups sold
in retail grocery perimeter, our overall sales declined by 2% in this segment in the quarter. Earnings in the quarter
increased $4 million or 24% driven by favorable foreign currency transaction rates and the benefit of our cost reduction
efforts.
Let me turn now to our first half results on Slide 17. Reported net sales decreased 1%. Organic net sales were down 2%
driven by promotional discounting in U.S. Soups, Sauces and Beverages. EBIT of $803 million was down 8% versus a
year ago, primarily due to increased promotional spending and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains and
favorable mix. EPS declined 5% to $1.53. For perspective, it's important to note that we're lapping a very strong first
half from a year ago in which EPS increased by 14%.
For the first half of the year, our reported net sales declined 1% and similar to the second quarter reflected a decline of
two points attributable to the impact of increased promotional spending, partly offset by a 1-point increase due to
currency translation. The organic net sales decline was due entirely to the increased promotional spending.
Gross margin percentage decreased from 41.2% to 40.3% for the half. This 90-basis-point decrease was primarily due
to increased promotional spending and cost inflation, partly offset by productivity improvements and favorable mix. To
date, inflation in ingredients, packaging and energy items has been very modest. And we've benefited from our
procurement contracts and commodity hedges. Looking ahead, we anticipate increased inflation primarily in the areas
of grains, oils, sweeteners and steel cans. As a result, our Baking and Snacking business has taken pricing action
already, and as I mentioned we anticipate improved price realization in U.S. Soup in the second half of this year.
Our marketing and selling expenses decreased from $585 million to $568 million reflecting lower selling expenses.
We've reorganized our U.S. sales team to improve efficiency. Administrative expenses increased from $282 million in
the first six months of 2010 to $294 million this year. This increase was primarily due to higher benefit costs including
pensions and health care, costs associated with our new headquarters facility, information systems related expenses and
currency, partly offset by lower compensation expense for the half.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased 15% or $8 million driven by the higher percentage of
long-term debt in the portfolio. The tax rate at 30.2% was down 80 basis points for the first half, the benefit of which
offsets the higher interest expense. For the first half, net earnings decreased 8% and diluted shares outstanding
decreased 3%, thus EPS declined by 5%.
In the segment results for the first half, U.S. Soups, Sauces and Beverages sales declined by 4% driven by a 5%
decrease in U.S. Soup sales attributable to the overall increase in promotional spending. Sales of Campbell's condensed
soups declined 4% reflecting weakness in our condensed eating varieties. Sales of ready-to-serve soups declined 9%

driven by increased promotional spend which did not yield the anticipated volume lifts. Broth sales increased by 2%
due to a solid holiday performance.
Beverages performed well for the half. Sales rose 5% on solid volume gains partly offset by the impact of higher
promotional spending. Strong sales gains in V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash were slightly offset by lower sales of V8
vegetable juice. Sauce sales declined for the first six months, reflecting lower sales in Pace Mexican sauce as we have
been negatively impacted by private label activity and in Prego pasta sauce as we have increased promotional spending.
Operating earnings declined 13% to $515 million.
Category performance in the United States during the latest 52 weeks is shown on slide 22 and is based on IRI panel
data and Campbell internal estimates. The overall category declined in dollars by 3.4% in the past 52 weeks. Our Soup
sales declined 4.1%, and all other branded players declined 1.6%. Private label dollar sales declines were in line with
the category, down 3.2%. While it's not shown on the chart, Campbell and other branded players have increased
volumes in the soup category. While the volume performance has been positive, the gains were not sufficient ultimately
to translate into dollar gains as the chart shows.
Trends in both dollars and volumes were stronger in the most recent 13 weeks according to the IRI data and Campbell
estimates. Category dollar sales rose 1.7% in the quarter, and volume growth was 5.9%. Campbell benefited, showing
growth in both dollars and volume for the quarter.
Campbell's dollar share in wet soup for the past 52 weeks was 62.9% down 50 basis points. The decline in our dollar
share came from ready-to-serve soup. Private label's dollar share of soup was flat at 12.3%.
For the half year, Baking and Snacking organic sales increased 2% as both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's achieved
volume gains. Earnings increased 5% due to gains in Pepperidge Farm and the impact of currency, partially offset by
lower earnings in Arnott's. The Arnott's results are compared to a very strong period a year ago in which earnings
increased by double digits. We're pleased with the results for our Baking and Snacking business which has benefited
from high levels of innovation and compelling advertising.
Organic sales in International Soups, Sauces and Beverages decreased by 1% primarily due to declines in Latin
America and in Canada, reflecting higher promotional spending, partly offset by gains in Asia Pacific. The sales
increase in Asia Pacific was primarily due to volume driven gains in Australia. Operating earnings increased 2% to
$120 million compared to $118 million a year ago, driven by volume gains and productivity savings partly offset by
higher promotional spend. Sales of North America Foodservice declined 3% while earnings increased 2% reflecting the
impact of favorable currency transaction rates and our efforts to aggressively manage cost in this business.
Cash flow from operations, shown on slide 25 was $483 million declining $13 million from a year ago. The impact of
lower pension contributions in the current year was more than offset by higher working capital requirements and lower
earnings. Capital expenditures of $74 million are down from $103 million a year ago. For the year, we now forecast
capital spending of approximately $275 million.
In the first half, we repurchased 16 million shares at a total cost of $573 million under our strategic share repurchase
program authorized in June 2008, and our ongoing practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under
incentive compensation plans. Net debt was $2.796 billion, an increase of $259 million.
Turning to our revised full year guidance on slide 26, we are anticipating improved second half financial performance
relative to our first half. We also now expect slower growth than previously anticipated, particularly in our U.S. Soup,
Sauces and Beverages segment as we managed the transition to reduced promotional levels in soup and operate in a
very competitive environment, which is impacting the entire segment.
Below the line, we continue to assume that the combined impact of changes in net interest expense and taxes will not
be material to the year. We now forecast sales to be between plus 1% and minus 1% for the year, adjusted EBIT to
decline 3% to 5%, and EPS to decline 1% to 3% from the adjusted base of $2.47. This guidance range implies
improvement in the back half, most of which will come in the fourth quarter as we cycle a very strong third quarter
from last year.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Jennifer.
Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Craig. At this time we will conduct a Q&A session. We'd like to request that our callers limit themselves to a
single question yet stay on the line in case clarifications are needed. This way we hope to respond to more callers.
Mary, can you give us our first question?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, our first question comes from Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I guess my question has to do with the difference between the
soup shipments versus the consumer off take. And I guess Doug, maybe you could just kind of walk us through as the
quarter kind of progressed because I thought that – I don't know, we never want to talk too much about weather, but I
would have thought with the weather being the way it is that retailers maybe would have, if anything, stocked more
soup, not kind of cut back on the number of – the amount that they had. So maybe you could just walk through that?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Eric,
maybe I'll jump in there, and then if Doug or Denise have anything to add. I think the first thing to recognize is that we
started into this period of pretty heavy promotional discounting in the third quarter of last year, and consequently we
had fairly strong shipment levels and a certain amount of inventory build coming into this quarter.
Secondly, I guess I would acknowledge that as you're well aware, it's hard to read, with great precision, movements in
inventory inside all the channels, some of which are unmeasured at the store level and at the pantry level. So we're very
encouraged that the takeaway was as good as it was in the quarter. I don't feel like we lost any sales because of what
was going on with respect to inventory levels. But clearly, as you look across the first half of the year, the promotional
activity has not – we haven't gotten the kind of lifts that would have paid for the kind of promotional activity that we've
done across the first half of the year.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Just building on it, we do have the volume
growing again, which was essential. We wanted to protect our consumer base. As you recall a year ago we were losing
some of our base to other simple meals, and we said we have to protect that with the consumer. And we have. But in
the deep promotional environment that we're in, not just in soup but in the broader simple meals arena, retailer
inventories are getting increasingly difficult to measure and manage. We have visibility to pieces of that – of those
inventories but not to the full range of outlets and channels. So I feel good about the direction, but clearly we had some
inventory that got worked off.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, just any thoughts on did the – do you think the pretty
bad winter so far helped some of that consumption? And is that maybe what's giving you a little bit more confidence in
the second half to pull back on the promotion and just kind of let advertising do the work?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, just a few thoughts on that. Historically, at
least the 10 years I've been here, we've sort of naturally pulled back from price promotion as we go into the spring and
summer, so this is a natural – a very natural cycle here. We also have visibility into the performance of our advertising
campaign, which is the best performing campaign that I've seen since I've been here in terms of consumer response. So
given that we naturally pull back anyway, and that we – we've seen response – positive, encouraging response to the
advertising, I think it's a natural thing for us to do. But Denise may want to expand on that a little.

balance our price promotion with our brand building now that we have a stronger campaign.

Our next question comes from Terry Bivens from JPMorgan.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hi, Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Terry.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Hi, Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Doug, here's a question for you. All of our data seems to indicate that you guys really throttled
back on promotion during the month of January, which I found a bit surprising. Is that consistent with the actual
strategy? And if it is, what would be the thinking there during that single month?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Terry, we didn't really – we're not – I won't get
into a discussion of month-to-month promotional planning, but I would say we – broadly speaking across the quarter
with all of our major customers, we maintained our promotional presence through the entire quarter. What I will
acknowledge is that other branded competitors, one in particular, was very aggressive again in January and may have
attracted more of the promotional attention in that month. But Denise, I may be wrong, but I think we maintained a
pretty solid profile, and we maintained our advertising presence throughout.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Exactly.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: And just a follow to that. I guess the big question is how much of a threat is this competitor you
just mentioned to the more rational strategy in the second half? I mean if they really hit the pedal on promotions,
doesn't that really compromise this strategy? Or how are you looking at that?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Historically, the category has not been
particularly promotionally sensitive when we get into the spring and summer. The retailers aren't particularly interested
in running hot deals on soup in April. So typically the – and the consumer's not particularly looking for hot deals on
soup in April. So I personally believe we're going to – the more balanced approach that Denise is taking and that she
just spoke about makes sense, and we can weather the storm here. We have good brands to compete in this space. We
have good advertising against it. We will offer very good price values still relative to other simple meals, and as we've
highlighted in the past, oftentimes depending – in most periods, we have more interaction with other simple meals than
we do with the branded competitors in soup. So – and I think in that broader arena we'll be sufficiently competitive.
Denise, would you...
<A - Denise Morrison>: Yeah. Terry, I think going forward we know that when we have competitive price value and
we have great advertising and brand building, that's when we grow profitably. And I think although I was very happy
with the consumer takeaway in volume for the quarter, it came at a high cost. And therefore, we need to make sure that
we are growing our earnings as well as our net sales.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. Thanks for the color. We'll see you next week.

stride with sufficient innovation, sufficient brand building activity balanced with responsible trade promotion, we know

TV, but I know you've been keeping pretty heavy on the advertising. Yet it was down in the quarter according to I think
the numbers Craig mentioned. Is that just a matter of timing? We're going to keep up kind of the foot on the pedal for
the second half of the year and move towards more advertising? Can you talk about that please?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The TRPs were down I think modestly. But we're
talking about still very high levels of advertising, and we believe at a threshold level. I'll let – and we are committed to
maintaining that as we've indicated. But, Denise, do you want to expand on that?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Yeah. Chris, a couple things. First of all, we maintained a very high level of advertising. We
actually had a different mix of 30s and 15s, which impacted our GRPs, but our Anthem campaign, which was a 30
second, was very, very productive. So that was one of the changes we made, and we will continue advertising heavily
into the third quarter.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then I just wanted to be clear on a kind of this -- a comment you made earlier
on simple meals. And I guess that's obviously been a challenge for the soup category. And you got more promotional
and more aggressive and clearly in this quarter, from a takeaway standpoint did well versus other simple meals, but
obviously the cost is very high to get there. So what I'm trying to understand, is that a sustainable strategy? Is this what
it takes to be competitive against simple meals, is simply to be more promotional, more price promotional?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Chris, I think the best way to describe this is that starting in the first quarter this year, we did
have an observation of a larger amount of switching between soup and other simple meals. And because the advertising
campaign was new and it took time to gain traction, the lever that we had to use was to get more competitive on our
price promotion. We were successful in getting that switching behavior back to what we call normal levels. Meanwhile,
the advertising is starting to get traction so we believe we have a much more balanced marketing mix to work with
going from the second half of this year forward.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Thanks for your time.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Chris. Next question please, Mary.

<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, David.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Can you comment on shelf space in the soup category? Are you holding shelf space? Is it
declining? How do we kind of -- the one thing that I still find that investors ask all the time is just kind of
fundamentally why this category doesn't seem to be doing better? And back to Eric's question, it was such a
tremendously cold winter, I know you're saying that the FDM data looked okay, but the shipment data down. It just
feels hard to explain. So talk about shelf space and then talk about just big picture about the category trends?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Okay. David, we have not seen changes in shelf space for the soup category. And we watch
this as you know, very, very closely. I mean, to date since we started our fiscal year, we've put in over 20,000 new
upgraded IQ Maximizers across the retail landscape so we've been working very closely with retailers in the category
on shelf space. So it is -- it's competitive out there, and it's one thing we continue to watch. But to date we haven't seen
any movement in that.
<Q - David Driscoll>: And in all the dollar stores, when they're expanding their footprint at the expense of the
traditional retailers, there's nothing negative with that fundamental change at retail? Is that a true statement?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have a presence in those dollar stores. And
we're committed to getting our fair share of that presence. We have products that can play in that space. And in the
fullness of time, we think that's a very manageable proposition.

<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi. Can I ask about the beverage category? It seems as though it slowed down quite a bit in
sales growth terms this time. In particular, I think you had the Tea version of V8s that was being launched. How are the
distribution trends on that? Is that going as expected? Or are there other dynamics in the Beverage segment that are
causing some challenges?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Well, the Beverage business has always been very competitive. And we're very proud of the
fact that V8 has been outperforming the shelf-stable juice category for quite some time now. I would say that we
continue to invest in V8. Splash and V-Fusion did very well this past quarter. We were a little bit lower on V8 Red, and
I would just say that we continue to be very, very optimistic about our ability to compete with beverages.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And for the half, it's been solid.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Yes, but --

food budgets, people, we have observed, are willing to trade out of the category and go to water and other more value

Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Denise, a couple of weeks ago I guess there were some pretty high-level management shifts that
were made at Campbell. And again, new head of sales, new head of U.S. Soup and some others. And even I know it's
very early to sort of get your strategic outlook and plan. I was wondering if perhaps you could share a bit about maybe
what skill set you were looking for in some of those key people? Maybe what objectives you had in mind when you
were making those sort of what seemed like pretty key personnel decisions going forward?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Yes. That organization shift had been planned for quite some time, Andrew. And what we're
doing is we are setting up the North America Soup, Sauce and Beverage unit to create better focus and to jumpstart
innovation. And I'll talk more about this at CAGNY, but those leadership changes and the structures were designed on
purpose to do that.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And just to build on it, as part of the, what we
call our ORP process, we've been developing those two leaders for roles like this for the better part of six or seven
years. So this is a natural evolution of the thinking, but tailored to address the issues of the day and the issues that
Denise has highlighted as being most critical to moving forward.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I appreciate it. They come – I mean I know they come highly regarded, I think, both internally
and externally, and I guess from Pepperidge. So I was trying to get a sense of just what -- is that -- I'm trying obviously
to get a little bit more insight into where you're headed going forward obviously and how those folks add to that. But
we'll get more into that at CAGNY as well. Thank you.
<A - Denise Morrison>: The good part about Campbell's, Andrew, is that we do have some great bench strengths, and
these are great leaders that are coming into these positions.

manage condensed and ready-to-serve, or do you view those categories or those segments as somewhat different from
each other as you think about the next few quarters?
<A - Denise Morrison>: I think there is an interaction with condensed eating and some of the RTS brands. And
particularly with the price discounting that we had in the marketplace, the value proposition of condensed became less
apparent to the consumer. Going forward as we realize our pricing, I believe that that will be restored, and condensed
will have a much better second half.

Our next question comes from David Palmer from UBS.
<Q - David Palmer>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Hi. Doug and Denise, someone mentioned the positive response to the new ad campaign in the
Q&A. Is there any details you could share about, from a almost a consumer level research perspective, how are
perceptions and/or behavior perhaps changing this year with regard to soup? Are there certain demographic groups that
are cutting back or coming back to soup versus other categories? Any insights would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Okay. We still consider it early days, but the consumer response to the campaign has been
really positive. And we've had certain executions, because this is a portfolio campaign, and there's sub-branded
advertising within it. We've had certain executions that have performed better than others and we continue to learn and
improve it. But this is some of the best advertising we've had on air in our recent past. So we're very, very encouraged
by that.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It is the first time that we've had an umbrella
campaign across the entire line. So we're pioneering new ground here for the company, the first time in almost 20 years
that we've done it this way.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Right.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So we have expected that it would take a little
time. The response in particular to the Anthem spots that Denise mentioned has been exceptionally good in research
and then in qualitative tracking following the launch. We've also had good response to some of our condensed cooking
executions and our Chunky execution that we were concerned about because we were migrating from a brand-building
Chunky NFL perspective into this broader spot. But our Chunky business has held up very well through all of this
activity.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Right. And our Healthy Request business has also been off the charts.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As it relates to the advertising, so we have seen
impact. Where we've had -- where we've been pressured has been when we have tremendous price gap pressure that is
changing the promotional -- the price points to a point where our condensed eating soups have been so pressured by
ready-to-serve pricing. But on balance, we see it across the portfolio in a very positive way.
<A - Denise Morrison>: And we think that we can strengthen the execution on condensed eating, and we're working
on that right now.

Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Hi, Judy.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Craig, you called out input cost inflation in fiscal '12, and I'm wondering if you could quantify or
give some quantification to what you're expecting for cost inflation? Our math shows that you could be facing
something like 6%. Are we in the ballpark? And then in relation to that, sort of your ability to use price as a lever to
offset that as opposed to maybe other levers that you can see in your P&L to manage through that inflation?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yeah,
we don't have an F '12 forecast. We're a little early for that yet. As we look at this year, clearly the trend is up. We're
going to finish the first half sort of flattish on ingredient, package and energy input inflation. And then in the second
half we would expect something more like about 3%. And as we look forward to '12, probably somewhat higher than
3%, but I don't have a number for you.
So it clearly is in our thinking. Pepperidge Farm has already taken some pricing action because some of the earlier
pressure has been, as you are well aware, on grains and so impacting that business. And we're very mindful of it as we
look at our commercial policy around soup in the back half of this year and coming into next year. But it's a little early
for us given our cycle and given our pricing cycle to be forecasting that.
<Q - Judy Hong>: And just in terms of broadly speaking, any other levers that you feel that you may have kind of over
the next six to 12 months and your ability to manage it through that inflation?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well, on
the cost side, I mean one of the things that's helping us mitigate the impact as we move into it is a combination of our
hedging program and our contractual arrangements with certain suppliers. I mean that's not going to -- those things
don't offset long-term inflationary pressure, but they do give you some time to react and to manage your pricing in the
marketplace against what you see coming as inflation. We also within cost of sales, not directly impacting input from
ingredients, packaging and energy, but within cost of sales, we continue to have a really strong and successful enabler
program. We'll be at record levels, I think, again this year after having a strong year last year.
So we're attacking other pieces of the cost base. We've talked publicly about soup common platform and some
longer-range programs that we've got. But every year we're trying to fight back something like 3% or so of our total
cost base with structural cost decreases. So those are the things on the input side. On the output side, of course, we've
got within pricing, we've got the opportunity to manage at the list price level as well as manage promotional depth and
frequency.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Judy, also, I think it's still true at a very high
level to think in terms of we believe we have the ability through pricing and productivity to manage our cost base. And
that -- and it's beyond just soup. It also applies to our other branded areas in healthy beverages and in baked snacks
where we have good brands, we can price to manage -- between pricing and productivity, over time we've
demonstrated the ability to manage costs.
<A - Denise Morrison>: We also have a very good discipline about our SG&A management.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Great. Okay. Thank you. And see you next week.

<Q - Adam Josephson>: Good morning, everyone. This is Adam Josephson in for Akshay. Thanks for taking my
question.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
<Q - Adam Josephson>: I realize consumer takeaway was good in the quarter, but obviously the category continues to
have its challenges. I just have two questions. Is it possible that some of problems that the category's having are
attributable to a generational shift, in that younger people tend to eat less canned soup than their predecessors? Or is it
possible that the trend toward healthier soups has detrimental to the category because the soup doesn't taste as good as
it did before?
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll turn it over to Denise in just a second, and
she's going to cover more on this when we get to CAGNY. But what I would say is, those areas create great
opportunity for us. And we believe we can do a better job, particularly with millennials, and we believe we can
continue to drive on the health and wellness front to grow the category faster. And that's – and we're going to cover that
at CAGNY, but, Denise, do you want to give them a topline?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Yeah. I would say the best way to answer it is Campbell Soup is in 85% of all households.
And we do have a very high index with millennials, although it's not as high as baby boomers, i.e., that's the
opportunity for us. It's still pretty significant. The other question that you asked was about health and wellness, and our
Healthy Request soup was actually our best performing line this year. So we are hitting the mark on that acute need of
heart health. So that's probably the best way I can answer it, and I will provide more insight on that at CAGNY.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. I was just listening to the tone on the call today more than anything. And I got to say, it's
awfully positive. You've just lowered guidance for the back half of the year. And I would argue that the Soup plan for
this year did not – that Soup did not go according to plan. And I guess I'm just kind of wondering, Denise, as you think
about strategic planning for fiscal '12, most people that I talk to think that there needs to be some kind of re-basing of
margins or expectations. And the tone is so positive, it just doesn't seem like that's where you're headed right now. And
maybe the rebasing today is all that's necessary. And that's fine, but I'm just kind of -- the performance to-date just
hasn't really been very good, and I'm not quite sure how I can -- how I can kind of get on board that things are going to
get quickly better?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Okay. First of all, I'm going to acknowledge what you said, and that is that we believe we can
do better in the soup business. And that our performance as a result of the heavy price discounting that we engaged in
did not give us the lifts that we had expected and the volume gains that we had realized were not sufficient to drive
profitable net sales. So I agree with you there, and I'm not happy about that.

However, you know that I have a new team, and we are really focused on creating value over the long term. And we
have an opportunity here to explore all of our options for doing so. So it's unclear at this point whether a rebase would
be the right step for Campbell but that said, we believe at this point that we have enough resources right now that we
could just reallocate to fund our growth, including trade spending and some of the dollars that we had appropriated for
sodium reduction in R&D. So this new team is looking with fresh eyes at everything.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Just to build on it. For context, we've grown EPS
every year for nine years. We've grown EPS 10% over the last five years. We have a flattish performance in a very
tough year, and we know what we need to do better. We're focused on it. We have spending as a percent of sales at a
record high level. So we have some resources there. And we've just got to find a way to manage things smartly.
And then I would emphasize that every year we go through a strategic planning process with our board where we look
at all of our options. Denise and her new team are doing that right now. And I think she'll be in a position to -- with a
much more informed and complete look to cover that when she gets to our July Analyst Meeting. So I think in the
meantime we have plenty to do, and we're on it. So I think this is just a natural evolution of the business, and we've got
to work through it. But three of our four segments are growing earnings. We have an issue here in the U.S., and we're
on it.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: All right. I appreciate the clarity from both of you. And I really do wish the best of luck. I
don't think soup is the next buggy whip, and you've done a lot for the category over the years, Doug. I think the
category can grow, so see you at CAGNY.

<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Well,
we've seen lower compensation expenses in the first half, and I think you would see that continue as a trend into the
end of the second half. There are also some – if you'll recall in the second half of last year, we also had a recall on
SpaghettiO's, which is another item that will help us in terms of comparison second half versus first half.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Can you quantify, how much are you expecting compensation -- lower compensation expense
to benefit the full year?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Most of
the benefit frankly is coming from lower incentive compensation which we've -- we're -- if you look at the first half,
we're on the track that we think is appropriate for the full year.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: So how much has it been for the first half then?
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: We're not going to provide that level of detail.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Yeah,
right.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Well, then as we're modeling the second half, should we factor in a higher compensation
expense for next year? I'm just trying to get a sense for is G&A going to be artificially or abnormally low this year
because you've missed your plan, and do we have to put that back in for next year? Some help on just how to think
about that would be helpful.
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: So
clearly as we look at next year we would anticipate higher incentive compensation, but as Denise said we've got a very
disciplined process against total G&A, and we would look to be realizing efficiency opportunities in other areas. But
just with respect to incentive compensation, yes, we'd look for a bigger year next year.

<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Eric.
<A - Denise Morrison>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Good morning, everyone. It seems that over the past couple quarters your condensed cooking
soups have been one of the bright spots in a clearly tough environment particularly for U.S. Soup. This quarter in the
press release you commented that there were declines in both condensed cooking and eating varieties. Wondering
whether you think something's fundamentally changed there? What the drivers have been behind that decline and what
your outlook is for the cooking portfolio?
<A - Denise Morrison>: Eric, we're pretty happy with condensed cooking overall for the half. And one of the biggest
events we have is our holiday season, and when we look at the total performance of this business throughout the
holiday -- and some of those cases start shipping in October all the way through the end of the year – we're pretty
pleased with the momentum in cooking soups. And our broth of course has been stellar for both quarters. So we know
the trends here are good. I mean consumers are cooking at home more. We've invested very heavily in
Campbellkitchen.com, which is providing recipes. So we still are very excited about the Campbell cooking soup line.
<A - Douglas R. Conant, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Recognize, too, Eric, that in the quarter the
biggest divergence between positive consumer takeaway and shipment data was in the cooking soup category.

<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Eric. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: Hi, it's Priya actually. Just a quick question. Can you talk about your plans to address the
recent $700 million in debt that matured?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Sorry, I
didn't get the question.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that, Priya?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Address
the $700 million recent maturities?
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: Yeah. The $700 million in debt that came due I guess a few days ago, can you just address
your plans as to whether you look to refinance that and to -- new long-term paper or just pay it down over time?
<A - B. Craig Owens, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer>: Sure.
Got it. Sorry, I just didn't get the question the first time. We did a $400 million issue last July, which in effect
prefunded some of that. We took advantage of the low rate environment. We have plenty of room within our
commercial paper program that as the $700 million matured and rolls off, we just -- we roll that balance into the
commercial paper program. But I think it would be fair to say we are looking for opportunities to -- if you want to think
about it this way, to term out the rest of it.
<Q - Priya Ohri-Gupta>: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay.
