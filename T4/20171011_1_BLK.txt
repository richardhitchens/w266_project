MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated third quarter 2017 earnings teleconference.
Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed
on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.
[Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Christopher J. Meade
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking
statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these
statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the
results of Blackrock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to
update any forward-looking statements.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2017. Before I
turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our
earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted
results.
The breadth and scale of BlackRock's globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong
business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are
driving better alpha generation, fostering stronger client partnerships, and allowing us to more efficiently operate our
business. Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long term net inflows of $76 billion representing 6%
annualized organic asset growth and we're positive across client type investment style and region.
BlackRock has now generated over 5% long term organic asset growth for five consecutive quarters. More importantly,
we've achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months. Bear in mind these long-term
growth rates don't include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year.
Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings
per share of $5.92 both increased 15% versus a year ago. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of
net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from
potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the
fourth quarter of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise
in the future.
Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee
growth partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's third quarter.
Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting
strong overall performance from our broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund
that delivered exceptional full-year performance [ph] and lots (4:14) annually in the third quarter. Technology and risk
management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the
institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms.
Demand remains strong across our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail
intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction
capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently. We continue to invest in technology and data
initiatives across the firm to generate better alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global
distribution capabilities.
Whether investing through the income statement, the inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix, or
using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital, our
goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue.
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A
expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13%year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily
reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund
expense was up $34 million or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM and significant growth in
our iShares franchise.
G&A expense was up $51 million, or 16% year-over-year, in line with previous guidance reflecting higher technology
and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement
expense, and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago.
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points
sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin aware and remain
committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to execute our consistent
capital management strategy during the quarter repurchasing an additional $275 million in common shares and stand by
our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.

Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion representing 6% annualized organic asset growth were positive
across client type, investment style, and region. Globalized shares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion,
representing 14% annualized organic growth with strength across both core and noncore exposures. In the one year
since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact
of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows
by over 600 basis points.
iShares' equity net inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market
exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart data funds. Fixed income iShares net
inflows of $18 billion reflected continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients with flows led by
treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds.
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion
once again showcased the strength of our top performing active platform and include $1 billion into unconstrained
strategies as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt, and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows
were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund.
Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and
active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client
demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion, as several large clients made strategic
asset allocation changes during the quarter.
Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our
LifePath target date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows.
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business saw $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several
large client wins and reached its highest ever level of AUM.
BlackRock's third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and
continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage,
and consistent capital return.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter, as our differentiated global investment and technology platform
increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before.
Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We've seen greater political stability in Europe.
China is continuing to show economic strength. And after a long period of stagnation, we're seeing consistent growth in
Japan.
Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines. And many
global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities over time,
which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes.
In these times of greater economic certainty, there's also a greater need for people to be invested. And more than any
time in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. We build customized solutions from
our investment platform that spans index to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities
enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate alpha more consistently, manage risk smarter, and scale
operations more efficiently. Combined with insights of the BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form

stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients, and all of this is showing up in our flows.
As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional
and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles. We now have seen a total of $264 billion of flows so
far this year compared to $202 billion for all of 2016.
As we deepen our relationships with clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we
have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility and we take this seriously, and we also attempt every day to
achieve the responsibilities with our goals.
Gary talked about our shareholder value creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework.
Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means investing to be a leader in the areas
of high client demand in growth like ETFs, like illiquid alternatives. It also means investing to generate differentiated
alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin and, most importantly, technology and to grow
our scale.
With regulation, technology, and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth management globally,
BlackRock is at the forefront of change in the industry, and our focus remains on the long term for our clients
worldwide.
In the U.S., there are two major shifts converging in wealth management. First and one of the largest asset movements,
fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The
second, digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client
assets and provides leverage for fast-growing advisory practices.
These trends have several major implications for our entire industry. Value for cost is critical to advisors in asset
allocation decisions. Advisors are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief investment
officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions, so there's a heightened focus on repeatable,
systematized processes that can be scaled.
Against this backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is
increasingly for strategic partnerships beyond any one specific investment product. They're looking for partnerships
with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients. BlackRock has
the building blocks, BlackRock has the technology, and BlackRock has the expertise to glide clients on how to
effectively use our scale.
Our U.S. Wealth Advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial advisor
engagements. We increased engagements by 23% relative to the same time last year in part by leveraging technology.
We've held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none two years ago, which has especially been productive
for us to reach more advisors in our fast-growing independent channel.
Our focus in investment and wealth management technologies is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem,
which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients that use ETF for asset
allocation and alpha generation. We are developing new products. We're spending time on ETF education across the
industry and BlackRock is at the forefront of innovation in the ETF distribution side.
The investments we have made in iShares are showing real-time results. For both the third quarter and the year-to-date,
iShares captured the number one share of flows in the United States and Europe and globally.
Usage has been increasingly across tough client types, from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures in fee-based
advisory models to insurers, asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds using ETF alongside individual
stocks, alongside bonds, future swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios.
We are similarly seeing growth across all our key product segments. We've seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income
ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors, in our smart
beta and ESG.

In alpha-seeking strategies, we are focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe the
revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes in future growth for BlackRock.
We are seeing early signs of progress with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our
benchmarks or peer medians now for three years.
The growth we are seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we made over time to position
ourselves ahead of our client needs. We invested to build our infrastructure business, beginning with a lift out of a
small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure
team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested and committed assets across a diverse set of equity
and debt infrastructure strategies.
Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares Core Series to drive growth at a time when we anticipated these
significant changes in our ecosystem. With industry flows at record highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the
revenue impact of our investment and grew our share of flow from 25% in 2016 prior to our repositioning last October
to 41% market share over the past year.
Technology is increasingly a significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances
distribution and alpha generation is driving increased flows to our base fees and performance fees, and we're also
growing our direct technology and risk management revenues which increased by 15% year-over-year.
One example of that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. After the idea was borne out of an
internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built it into a business to drive value for our clients. Less than
two years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and five clients have gone live on our
platform.
Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, bicipital,
Scalable Capital are reaching tens of thousands of financial advisors who manage assets on behalf of millions of
end-investors. As our digital offerings enable financial advisors to have a more productive conversation with their
clients, they are driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies.
We invested our cash management business both organically and through acquisitions to strengthen our platform, to
leverage our scale and drive incremental growth.
We've grown assets by 70% over the last five years without significantly increasing our expense base. In the third
quarter, we saw $20 billion in net inflows into cash management strategy, and now manage more than $400 billion in
cash.
Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focus on
today like factors, ESG, illiquid alternatives, and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely
be driving growth for our future.
It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This
will continue to position BlackRock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. No
firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the future of our clients. This is and
will be our biggest competitive advantage in building stronger relationships with our clients and driving growth in our
business.
If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated
growth and a differentiated financial result and that's why we continue to believe in our future.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: So, my first – well, actually, my question is on Aladdin. When you think about future
revenue growth in Aladdin on a dollar basis, how should we think about the mix of revenue growth between the legacy
operating system, Provider Aladdin for custody banks and in the retail advisor offering including future advisor and
Aladdin Risk for Wealth because I'm just really trying to evaluate the immediate term opportunity between these
various offerings now.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: We see – well, that's a great question. I don't know all the answers to that question
because some of this is just being introduced today. But we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel
very confident we're going to continue to have double-digit growth.
In our core business, we are seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in that
revenue column. What is very interesting also we're seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients specifically in
fixed income. We are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So, we are now becoming even a larger component with those
clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment. They have seen the success in terms of their own
operation and they're now expanding it into other asset categories.
We now are seeing more interest from, what I would say, our core pension and insurance clients, and from global asset
managers throughout the world. So, the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin
and we expect that to continue and grow, I think we said, double-digit.
Provider Aladdin, we're in the testing phases right now where we are – Aladdin provider has been put on to the
custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that and ultimately we believe that's not going to be –
obviously, it's a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on but let me also be clear on – it creates greater
efficiencies for us.
By having Provider Aladdin a seamless blockchain, which is a private blockchain between us and our custodial
relationships, it really creates more seamless processing, and it should reduce many, many errors. Let's assume we
won't have any more errors. We do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock and
then use the Aladdin environment to all our clients to have that same type of platform to utilize it, and then it would
grow significantly.
Aladdin for Wealth Management has a big future opportunity. As we said, we have now won five clients. We are now
implementing those five clients. The demand is significant. What we are so pleased we have demand from Asia, we
have demand from Europe and North America. So all that improvement for wealth management is very well positioned
for carrying that growth that we see.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I have a question on MiFID. We are here
not far away from the deadline in Europe. There is a clear direction of travel it seems for the market in funding research
directly on the P&L as opposed to RPAs. What do you think though, looking forward, might happen here in the U.S.?

Are we going to see institutional investors begin to request similar treatment from their asset managers here, and how
do you see that playing out? Thanks very much.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: First and foremost, as a fiduciary, we're going to do whatever is going to be the best
for our clients over the long run. And there's not obviously the immediate pressure related to MiFID II or of the likes of
it in the United States than we have immediacy in Europe. So we're talking to our clients. We're working with this.
I would say one thing very clearly though. I think the outcome of having us having more responsibility of our own
research is a fantastic thing. I do believe by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more, what I would
call, incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at look at this as an opportunity. We look at this as an
opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe our scale gives us unique opportunities in this too. So we are working on
this. We're studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude. We're looking at this as a,
opportunity and we're treating it as an opportunity. And we're having dialogues with our clients.
I would say in the ecosystem if I was nervous about MiFID II, and I've talked to regulators about this, we are worried
about what the impact will be with some of the small cap companies that are having trouble, which we're hearing from
many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with a regulator yesterday about
this. I'm also worried about are we going to see the proper research for new companies. I'm not talking about the big
giant IPOs that we are accustomed to, but the small IPOs that are that are quite small.
So I think we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have a real strong opinion
globally. But I think the trend will be, as you clearly framed your question, is probably movement more towards that
fiduciary standard worldwide, and we'll see how this plays out.
We would like to think that over time we have the whole ecosystem, regulators, the asset management side, the sell
side, we have a better understanding how this plays out. The key – the most important point when you have these big
giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets.
And so we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it's not properly monitored and
organized.
The last thing I would just say related to what MiFID II will be, with greater transparency, first, that's great for
investors. Investors, one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said on these calls, is my worry about retirement
worldwide.
I just finished a world tour. The amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts. In Japan, it's $5 trillion in
bank accounts with negative returns. In Europe, it's huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts. If we could have
moved some of this money into long-term investing because much of the savings is towards retirement, we probably
would have had even more dynamic economies worldwide.
So clearly more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry, but the industry has a transition to go through.
And the last thing I would say with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs. And this is one of the
big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech, that I do believe these big changes are going to move more
money to managed portfolios, to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows.

Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Alex.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I was hoping you could spend a minute on the competitive
dynamics in Europe. So over the last year or so, it seems like BlackRock's retail fund flows, and frankly the market
share as well, had improved in the region on the active side, and that's outside of the strong position you guys have in
iShares. So can you just give us a sense of what's behind the improvement and I guess your views on BlackRock's
competitive position in the region into 2018 given MiFID, Brexit, FCA regulatory scrutiny, et cetera?

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: So it's a very important region for us, obviously. And the improvement in flows in
direct relationship to the improvement in performance. In Europe, we have some of the strongest performance and I
think you've seen that especially in our long and short European fund. As performance gets better, we see a lot of
demand. Europe has been an important part of our rollout. We have significant resources there and investments there,
and they are also participating in the growth of the ETF business in a big way where not only do we have our ETFs but
we also have a lot of technology that we're bringing to the European markets.
So it's a very big growth area for us. We have, as you know, almost a third of our people out in Europe and we're going
to continue to grow. And the other part of it is that we believe that we need to be local in each of the countries in
Europe. So, we have our local sales force and we also have portfolio management so that we can be a global company
but be local in all parts of Europe. And we're, like everyone else, waiting to see how the Brexit unfolds and then we're
going to respond appropriately to that.

Your next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the abbreviated
comments this morning as well. A two-part question, if I could. First was one of your major competitors in Europe
recently embraced shifting to a sliding fee on the management fee in their global equity portfolio. I was wondering if
you could your reaction to them, the implications of that particularly given what your view is greater transparency.
And then somewhat unrelated, maybe for Gary, I heard the term margin aware and that seems like a new coined the
term, and I'd like to understand what that exactly means as you think about the growth versus margin dynamic? Thanks.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I'll let Gary answer both of those questions.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Thank you, Larry. So, Bill, as it relates to I think you were referring to the fulcrum fee pricing
model. I think that our view would be on this that as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of the issues not
the least of which are both regulatory and changing client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about
new ways to evolve fee structure.
So, we've seen a bunch of announcements of intentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think we saw
one change more recently in the United States including the fulcrum fee which is actually been in use in the U.S. for
some time but many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented.
I think we continuously monitor pricing structures. We currently utilized both flat fee structures as well as
performance-based fee structures across our product range. We're mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision
to restructure – reposition some of our active equity businesses and launch of the low-cost advantage suite earlier in the
year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we'll continue to explore a variety of structures including fulcrum fees
and frankly other innovative structures to determine whether they are appropriate for our products and most importantly
for clients.
Your second question, in terms of just the tonality of the market. I don't really think there's any change candidly, but I
think we've been very clear historically that we don't manage the business to a margin and we're trying to optimize
organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing to margin
doesn't actually make people understand that we're not focused on margin. And so, obviously, trying to make sure that
we can do – deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we're always focused on. And so, I
want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware even though we may not be managing the business to a
specific margin target at any point in time.

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I would just echo that. We are very margin-aware and we see a great opportunity for
growth. We will interpret that and manage that accordingly. But, of course, leaders of companies have to be
margin-aware. We have to trade off future growth opportunities with margin. We all know that. And so, I think that's
what Gary really tried to say.
And – we've always said that we believe that we execute our strategies properly that we could see expansion in
margins. And we see great growth opportunities so that we will look at that as a trade-off, and as Gary said, that has not
changed so, I'll leave it at that.

Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello there. How are you?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Doing well.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: So, I heard your comments loud and clear on the recoupment of more than the investment that
you've made in the Core Series price investment. So, I guess, I'm looking for an update on how you can protect that
kind of pricing competition outside the core and then maybe how you evaluate it on an ongoing basis?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: So, Glenn, I think we've, historically as we've thought about pricing strategies and
iShares, we've talked a lot about both client and product segmentation. And, I think in every instance, what we're trying
to do is to effectively evaluate the value proposition to an individual client from buying the product. In the Core, we
clearly have seen a group of clients who are significantly more focused on price than they are necessarily after market
liquidity, bid-ask spread or tracking error. And so for that segment of the world, we are obviously focusing our
products, significantly more focused on price.
There's another segment of the marketplace that, frankly, is not necessarily long-term buy and hold. They're much more
interested in tracking error. They're much more interested in making sure there's enough liquidity if they decide to get
out in significant volume. And for that segment of the population, they are less focused on price and more on the other
elements of the value proposition that the ETF brings to the table. And so, that segmentation, we talked about core, we
talked about precision instruments, we talked about financial instruments. We're trying to make sure that in every
instance we're understanding the value proposition that the client's looking for and making sure that we price the
product accordingly.

Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hello, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Cyprys>: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back on some of the comments you were making
around investing in the business. I think you mentioned that today's organic growth is the result of some of the
investments that you've made over the past couple of years. So, I guess the question is how much are you investing in
the business today and how does that compare with what you've invested over the past couple of years? And just given
the changes that are occurring within the industry, do you feel a need to accelerate or pick up the pace of investments
versus what you've done historically?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Well, I think the pace of the amount of investment that we're doing is clearly accelerating as
the business is getting bigger and our financial resources are becoming more significant and the complexity of the
business is changing. So I think every year we go through a process of identifying a number of strategic initiatives,

which we talk to you about all the time, whether it's ETFs more broadly, smart beta and factors...
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Infrastructure.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: ...illiquid alternatives including infrastructure, as Larry mentioned, retail technology,
institutional technology, more broadly, and regional expansion. I mean these are just a number of things that we're
doing, not the least of which is planning for a new headquarters six years out and other things that are just kind of more
business as usual.
So I think there's no question that we are continuing to invest. Obviously, to the extent you have markets that cooperate
with you, it makes some of those decisions a little bit easier. But I think as we've shown in prior years, we're trying to
be very consistent with our investment spend, notwithstanding what markets are doing at any point in time because we
do stay focused on the long term. And to the extent that basically we find ourselves trying to balance the trade-off
between growth and margin, we aggressively look to reallocate our resources in a way that allows us to do both at any
point in time.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I would just add, because I think this is a really important component of who we are
and where we're going. I think we have a unique competitive advantage because of those investments. It's clear to me
that we need to continue to invest to be competitively in front of the needs of our clients and our competitors. And I do
believe that as we position our technology, especially R&D investment technology to reach more clients, Aladdin for
Wealth Management to be on more desktop with more of the financial advisors, investing in alpha signals in our
scientific businesses. I believe it's critical for us to stay in front of these big, giant trends.
As I've said in my prepared remarks, if we did not make those investments a few years back, we would not be in the
position of really working with our clients and picking up considerable market share with our clients institutionally and
in retail. And we look at this in a very competitive way. We believe our scale is a real advantage and, as Gary said, as
their scale has increased, it gives us even a greater competitive advantage. And we do believe data, technology, risk
management is going to continue to drive hopefully better financial literacy.
That gets back to my, once again, my whole concept of financial literacy for better outcome investing. The organization
that can provide that seamless information to get some of that money that's essentially been trapped in short-term
strategies into proper long-term investing, it would have a remarkable impact on the results for our clients, remarkable
impact on society, and a remarkable impact on the company that provides that. So, I look at this as essential, and so we
will continue to be investing to be that one key leader for those events and those opportunities.

Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Good morning. Hey, good morning, guys. Sometimes it seems that there are so many opportunities
ahead of you that maybe one of your biggest challenges is maximizing them and how do you organize yourself to
maximize them just given there are so many things going on. And I know in the past, you've done things like combine
solutions with the institutional sales force or things of that nature. So, can you maybe just update us if there's any – do
you feel like you have, for the moment at least, the right structure? Are there any kind of organizational changes you
think you're thinking about or could be necessary to really maximize the opportunities you see?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: As you know, it's been – it's not planned but it appears almost every year we're
making some leadership changes. We did that already earlier this year in terms of really enhancing some of our
regional coverage, enhancing our alts business, and really enhancing our global equity platforms.
The demands on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve them. So you're correct in asserting
that we see more opportunities – or let me restate, potential opportunities. The key for us is to focus on the
opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly. over the last

number of years – I would say clearly. for more than 10 years we've been more right on those strategies than not.
This is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why I spend
so much time visiting clients. I would clearly say loud and clear, 80% of our strategies have been led by what we are
hearing from our clients, wishes that they could have some type of technology solution. They want to have better
understanding of ESG. They want to have better understanding of how they could integrate more infrastructure as a
platform, how they can navigate the defined contribution plan in some form of bypass. So it is a big task in trying to
make sure that we are focused on the right strategy.
And what I would say – what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein in really navigating the moment-by-moment types of
issues around there, they're constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don't want to say
we're perfect and I don't want to say we don't constantly have to refresh ourselves because we do. We have to refresh
ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we're operating, stay in front of our clients. And there are always
inefficiencies, so I'm not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems.
But we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational efficiencies. We're making decisions by listening to
the end clients. And we also believe what is necessary – and Rob Kapito mentioned this earlier, we have to be closer to
our clients and this is why the regionalization effort is so very important, so we can listen to our clients better.
And then I would say one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the BlackRock
Investment Institute by bringing all the thoughts together, hopefully to have better alpha outcomes. But also bringing
all that information flow into one platform to redistribute it really gives us great insight, and it's that insight that helps
us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it's through that insight that has allowed us
to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future.

Your final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Hi, maybe just a two-part question on the technology side. You guys are spending a lot of
time on the retail or the wealth management front and your relative size there versus institutional seems like there's a
great opportunity. I just wanted to see if you could either size that or where you are and maybe the penetration of that
opportunity, and then as that relates to efficiencies in the business, how you see that playing out as that continues to
scale up? Are you going to make progress on that opportunity, how that will play through efficiencies and through the
operating leverage given the model?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me just say very clearly, as I said in my prepared remarks and Gary did too,
MiFID II and fiduciary standard rule really changes the whole ball game, not just for where assets are going to move,
but risk supervision is critical. Under a fiduciary standard rule, as I said, the CIO office is going to have a lot more
responsibility in their various platforms. And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management. So we
continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities.
In terms of efficiencies, obviously, we've learned a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So,
unquestionably, as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform but Aladdin for Wealth Management is a
considerably different platform. I mean Aladdin for Wealth Management, we could have 10,000 users, and it's a very
different platform. This is why I don't want to say Aladdin – the institutional Aladdin business is going to create so
many efficiencies for us and margin expansion as we use Aladdin for Wealth Management. We believe if we can
penetrate more and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably over time, there's more efficiencies.
But let's also be clear, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more flows for
BlackRock. So, it's going to evolve. Let's be clear because I could tie that question, Mike, with the question that I was
asked before related to technology. Our ecosystem is evolving. I think it's evolving very rapidly now. I think this low

return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how
they want solutions to be provided. So, you have an incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide.
At the same time, we're seeing a huge expansion of global capital markets. And also, we're seeing the utilization of
more technology and how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the ecosystem even more rapidly.
So, the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients, and obviously, if we're helpful
with more of our clients, we're going to win more share. With more share, we're going to drive better efficiencies.
So efficiencies are important and so I'm not trying to dispute anything about it and we focus on efficiencies and I could
tell you Rob Goldstein and Gary Shedlin focus on that relentlessly but it's more important that we stay in front of
change as an organization. If we're the firm that stays in front of change on behalf of our clients, our clients will award
us more share of wallet.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence Douglas Fink
I think I said most everything. But first of all, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued
interest at BlackRock. I think our third quarter directly is linked to the comments that we've had related to the
investments made over time and how those investments have translated that into improved margins, improved
revenues, improved AUM, improved operating income, and most importantly, better and more improved relationships
with our clients.
Hopefully, this is well recognized by all of our investors and we will continue to leverage our differentiating scale.
We're going to continue to invest in investments in technology, as I said, to deliver that value to our clients, to stay in
front of our clients, and that's my commitment to all of you as our shareholders that we will – our objective is to stay in
front of our client needs so we could be more valuable to our clients.
With that, everyone, have a good quarter. Thank you.
