We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures during this call. These non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled in the
tables attached to the text of the earnings press release that we issued earlier today. We believe that these tables provide
investors useful information about our business trends. However, our non-GAAP measures do not replace and are not
superior to GAAP measures.
For the call today, Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter, walk you
through our 2010 accomplishments, provide you with thoughts on the external outlook for 2011, update you on key
initiatives including NYTC and conclude with our priorities for 2011. Michael Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer, will
then review the financial results for the quarter. We will then open the line for your questions. Also on the call today
for the Q&A session is Larry Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer.
When we go to the Q&A session, please limit your questions to one to allow for broader participation. We are
incorporating slides to the call today, which are available for viewing on our website, and Duncan and Mike will refer
to these slides during their remarks.
With that, let me turn the call over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you Steven, and good morning everybody. As we often do, we are going to walk you through the slide deck
that's available online, so Mike and I will make a point of referencing which slide we're on as we go through the deck.
So again good morning to everybody and thanks for joining the call today, I'm going to start on slide 3. Despite a
challenging second half of the year in terms of trading volumes, we are very pleased with the progress we have made in
2010 in transforming our business model and we entered 2011 with increasing momentum.
Our technologies business is already benefiting from the launch of our new data centers. We have significant
optionality with the launch of NYPC and U.S. Futures. Our clearing initiative in Europe is progressing, and the pipeline
is building in our listings business. And the fact that none of these drivers are volume dependent gives us even more
confidence. Why, because we see the health of corporate balance sheets, we see the return of corporate profitability, we
see the global economy growing, and therefore believe it's likely that volumes will increase when compared to the
second half of 2010.
As many of you know, we released our monthly volumes for January late last week and we were encouraged by the
sequential rebound in our derivative numbers and both the year-over-year and sequential growth in our European cash
and U.S. options volumes. So, while it's far too early to call the trend if volumes do come back to more normal growth
levels, we expect to reap the returns of our diversification efforts as well as benefit from improving volumes.
With that as an introduction, let me now turn to the quarter. In the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.46 per share on net
revenue of $613 million, down from $0.58 on $640 million in net revenue in the prior-year period. Strengthening of the
dollar year-over-year reduced our net revenue by $19 million and EPS by $0.03 and the prior-year period included a
$0.06 positive impact from a special LCH Clearnet dividend and the sale of stakes in NYSE Liffe U.S.
Our technology business continued to show growth and benefited from the addition of revenue from our data centers
coming online, strong enterprise software sales, and the impact of NYFIX. Based on our expectations for data
center-related revenue, revenue from several large exchange-focused managed services agreements already signed and
ancillary market data sales, we expect our Technology segment to generate an increase in revenue north of 15% in
2011.
Turning to Cash and Listings, we are continuing to see strong demand for our listing venues in terms of transfers and
new listings. During 2010, 14 companies transferred to NYSE from other exchanges with a total market capitalization
at $41 billion. A total of 99 issuers listed on NYSE Euronext markets in 2010 generated proceeds of $39 billion and 22
of those 99 issuers were from China. The 99 compared to just 44 IPOs for $21 billion in 2009. Additionally we
garnered 40% of technology IPOs. And to put that in perspective in 2005 that number was less than 10%.

On the cash equities trading side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability. In the U.S., off-exchange
trading continues to take away share from the lit markets with TRF share well above 30% of the market in the fourth
quarter and early signs in '11 is that we even go higher. In Europe, our share has remained relatively stable, just north
of 70%.
Lastly in our Derivatives segment, while we experienced record volumes for the year, the second half was challenging
for our European derivatives where market participants locked in profits from the first half's robust activity and trading
activity moved out along the yield curve.
Any discussion about the near term possibility of rising inflation or potential rate increases should be supportive of our
European derivatives business. In our U.S. options business, we were the number one equity options exchange for a
good part of 2010, and we have been successful at maintaining a leadership position in the space, so mission
accomplished. Options Insider newsletter also recently named NYSE Amex, our Options Exchange, the Exchange of
the Year for 2010.
Lastly on this slide, I want to provide you with a quick update on several key initiatives. On January 31st, the CFTC
granted NYPC registration as a DCO or Derivatives Clearing Organization, a significant step towards our ultimate goal
to compete in the fixed income derivatives arena. So having the designated clearing organization status just to review
with everybody gives us the first step towards being able to launch NYSE Liffe U.S. interest rate futures and NYPC.
The SEC and CFTC must now provide formal approvals allowing NYPC and DTC's Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation to cross-margin fixed income futures cleared at NYPC with fixed income cash securities cleared at FICC.
These regulatory approvals are expected at the end of February. I will speak more about NYPC in a later slide. Next we
are progressing with the build-out of our new clearing houses in Europe and our data centers are live in the U.S. and
Europe. So, all-in-all a good quarter and building momentum for 2011.
Shifting to slide 4, this is a slide that by now should be familiar to all of you as we put in every earnings deck and it
highlights the 2010 priorities for our three segments and begins to talk about what we accomplished. If you focus on
the middle, we are really showing you that what we've been doing in the last couple of years is to build the foundation.
When we started this transformation just a few years ago, there were disparate trading platforms, there were disparate
connectivity networks. We had no clearing assets and we have what I would describe as a very diffused data center
strategy at best. We had 13 data centers in locations that quite frankly happened to the company rather than comprising
a comprehensive strategy. They came through acquisitions. They came through other mergers that had been done
before all of us arrived.
So while it wasn't terribly glamorous, I think our view was that we needed to do the following: build-out the Universal
Trading Platform, get all of the technology platforms onto one platform, think about how to rationalize the safety
network making it the same in the U.S, Europe, and Asia, getting everyone connected through a common customer
gateway, begin the process of trying to build-out our clearing assets and build two new state-of-the-art data centers
which are now up and running. Now that we have completed the year, please turn to slide 5 for a review of our
accomplishments in 2010.
On slide 5, we note our accomplishments with pride. We did everything we set out to do and more. I'm not going to go
through each item on this comprehensive list, but we have gotten to this place because of the hard work of our
colleagues around the globe. One of the most important accomplishments last year was the articulation of our long-term
strategy which has guided everything that we do. And we have begun to see evidence that we are on the right track. We
also made it a focus to do a better job of articulating our strategy to all of you.
The build-out of NYSE Liffe U.S. was stalled by the lengthy regulatory process to which NYPC has been subjected.
Given these delays, the benefit of this effort has been delayed by approximately six months. Although the regulatory
changes are moving more slowly than we had anticipated, we have stabilized our cash businesses and we have also
achieved the leadership position in U.S. options. Our advocacy efforts on behalf of issuers have proven to be quite
effective and seem to be valuable by our clients. Whether measured by transfers or IPOs, it is clear that our efforts on
behalf of issuers worldwide are paying dividends.

We finished behind only Hong Kong and Shanghai in IPO issuance in 2010, quite a feat given the sizeable amount of
issuance that comes from Asia. Our two state-of-the-art data centers are live, others have been decommissioned and the
migration process is just about complete in both Basildon and Mahwah. With the data center builds largely behind us
and some investments in the portfolio rationalized, our leverage ratios have come down, our ratings are high investment
grade and stable and we find ourselves in a very healthy financial position.
On slide 6, we provide you with some color in terms of how we are thinking about the external environment. I
personally believe the global recovery is extremely resilient. While it may not feel like it in much of the West, many
parts of the world are booming. China, India, Brazil, parts of Eastern Europe, Germany and Silicon Valley is on the
move again as well.
The UN believes global GDP will grow by more than 3% in 2011 and the IMF estimate is even higher, 4.2%. While
downside risks remain, the overall environment is such that 2011 should be the year that puts the global economy
officially on the road to recovery. As I mentioned earlier, corporate profitability has returned, balance sheets are
healthy and many companies are sitting on cash and ready to invest, all of which means that investor confidence is also
starting to return.
Some key factors which will determine the strength of the global recovery in 2011 are the rate of CapEx, the level of
business inventories, unemployment and job creation statistics and consumer confidence. But in short, we believe that
2011 should provide a better environment for doing business.
Please turn to slide 7. On slide 7, we provide you with a more detailed update on NYPC. We've talked many times on
this call about how we believe that NYPC will serve as a major catalyst for new competition in the fixed income
futures market. Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury Futures listed on NYSE Liffe U.S. will be the first to take advantage of
the unique operational and capital efficient model brought to market by NYPC. We'd like to take a moment to thank the
CFTC for their diligent hard work in the approval of the NYPC DCO application which we received on January 31st.
As I mentioned earlier, this was the first of the regulatory approvals we need to go live.
We continue to work with the SEC and CFTC on the last set of approvals which will govern the cross-margining
agreement between NYPC and FICC. As I said earlier, we are very optimistic that we will get – we will receive these
approvals in line with our expectations in late February. Regarding operational readiness, significant work continues to
take place with the go-live member firms who represent some of the largest users of fixed income futures. We expect
NYPC to be operationally ready for launch shortly after regulatory approval of the course of the cross-margining
agreements later this month.
On this basis, we are planning for a go-live of interest rate futures listed on NYSE Liffe U.S. cleared by NYPC
sometime in March of this year. We continue to receive encouraging feedback from the global trading community
regarding the innovative nature of our platform and our teams are coordinating closely with our global customers to
achieve a successful launch.
Moving up to slide 8, on this slide we again highlight for you the primary execution themes for our NYSE
Technologies business. As we said before, NYSE Technologies is at the heart of our community strategy. We were
disciplined in approach, we have validated and articulated the community strategy and outlined the strategic objectives.
The exercise resulted in the design of a dedicated strategic model for NYSE Technologies with the selection and
de-selection of market segments which you can see at the bottom of the slide. The resulting areas of focus are one,
infrastructure and data and two, front-office analytics for order management\routing technology and execution
technology. We have decided to build our strategic roadmap around four main strategic anchors. First, building out our
network. We plan to continue the expansion of safety and new regional hubs in 2011, introducing standards for service
in data exchange on the backbone and looking for a few global partners to build up our capabilities.
Two, we'll be extending data services. We'll develop our hosted historical data platform that offers on-demand
real-time access. We'll offer market data management services to other venues and major banks and broker dealers,
hedge funds and asset managers, and we'll extend our current product range across asset classes and regions. For

example, building out SuperFeed. We benefit from a virtuous circle here by leveraging client deals for content
collection.
Thirdly, we will continue to build-out our service platform by developing managed trading platforms for Tier 2
customers to allow them to keep up competitively with more sophisticated funds. And finally, we will attract other
market venues by aggregating them for complementary asset classes, e.g., foreign exchange with pose limited threats to
NYX market share as well as competitors in more mature markets.
Please turn to slide 9. Continuing on the NYSE Technologies theme, slide 9 provides you with an update on recent
deals that have been signed or are in progress. Our strategic vision has been validated by both market trends and recent
RFPs received from clients and prospects seeking to outsource pieces of their trading infrastructure. We're working
with Goldman Sachs to provide them with the Universal Trading Platform to support their European MTF Sigma X that
will be hosted in our data center in Basildon.
We're cooperating with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to open up access to a full range of solutions starting with the
implementation of the Universal Trading Platform in the expansion of safety. We recently signed a new deal with the
Muscat Securities Market in preparation for their migration to NSC V900. We're providing a front-office platform to a
global hedge fund combining a suite of NYSE technologies, products, and services. And we signed a cooperation
agreement with a European banking group to build-out a global market access infrastructure to multiple venues
leveraging NYSE Technologies' range of products.
Lastly before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to slide 10. So, I'm going to quickly review the priorities for 2011.
Some of these priorities will have an immediate impact on our 2011 results. This will help drive our growth in 2012
and beyond. We feel good about the balance. I already touched on NYPC and the interest rate futures launched in Q1,
and I've already highlighted the continuing acceleration and the growth of our NYSE Technologies business.
We believe that as we build up our clearing assets, we will be able to in-source a meaningful revenue stream and over
time that should put us in position to capitalize on the migration of the OTC products over the next couple of years to a
more exchange cleared environment. We continue to be very engaged with regulators here in the U.S. and in Europe.
We do think that between what the SEC is looking at in terms of market structure in the equities business here in the
U.S. and what the European legislators are reviewing in terms of the MiFID II revisions, we are optimistic that the
outcome will be a net positive for market participants and NYSE Euronext.
We're very proud of the progress we've made lining up the data centers, retiring some of the legacy centers, and moving
some of our business into these new data centers. 2011 will be the year we officially finish these migrations and close
down the legacy data centers we no longer need. It will also be the year we get the last of our products onto UTP.
Finally, we will continue with a disciplined cost management we have exhibited over the past few years and we will
continue to focus on reducing CapEx down to a more maintenance level which will improve our free cash flow.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results.
Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice
President
Thanks, Duncan and good morning. Slide 11 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year
2010. For the quarter, net income and EPS were below prior year, but rose sequentially versus the third quarter. The
GAAP results for fiscal 2010 were up considerably on 2009. This quarter, we reported an $18 million charge for
merger and exit costs fairly evenly split between severance and data center exit costs.
Last year's merger and exit costs of $43 million were principally for severance. As we have stated previously, the data
center-related exit costs for legacy systems and platforms is expected to reduce dramatically after this year. Our review
of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs as well as
gains from disposal activities.

Slide 12 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the fourth quarter. Excluding merger and exit costs,
diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down 21% versus the prior year's $0.58 and in line with the third quarter of
2010. The $0.58 in EPS last year included a $0.06 positive impact from a special LCH Clearnet dividend and the sale
of stakes in our NYSE Liffe U.S. platform.
Our focus for 2010 was revenue growth and margin expansion. For the full year, net revenue, operating income and
EPS all grew versus prior year despite currency headwind and a sluggish second half for industry volumes. Margins
also improved modestly. As noted in the third quarter call, we stopped capitalizing interest expense on our data center
development projects at the time we went live in the new liquidity centers. This accounted for $4 million of higher
interest expense in Q4 this year versus last.
Slide 13 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. U.S. dollar strengthened this quarter
versus prior year for both the Euro and the British Pound. For the fourth quarter, 47% of our net revenue was
denominated in either Euros or pounds and 53% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact was unfavorable, $19 million versus
prior year and favorable, $11 million versus the prior quarter.
On a currency neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues were down 1% and operating income declined 5% versus the
fourth quarter of 2009. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings segments were down
3% and 4% respectively. And the Technology segment grew 14% versus Q4 prior year.
On slide 14, we show our full year 2010 net revenue split by business activity and segment compared to full year 2009.
The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base, which has helped dampen the impact of FX and
volume. 48% of our net revenues were generated by transaction and clearing fees down slightly from 49% in 2009. We
saw the contribution from Technology Services showed the most meaningful increase with specific gains stemming
from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments, Cash Trading and Listings comprised 49% of our net revenues. The Derivatives segment
contributed 33% of our net revenues; up from 29% in 2009, followed by the Technology segment, which grew from
15% to 18% of revenues. Slides 15 and 16 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. I'm not going
to go through these slides in great detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Derivatives accounted for 33% of our
revenues and 42% of our operating income for 2010. Global derivative volumes increased 24% for the year driven
primarily by market share, and market volume growth in U.S. options.
Volume for Liffe was strong in the first half, but lower in the second half impacted by lower interest rate volatility and
reduced equity volume. Net revenues declined by 6% in the quarter, but finished the year higher by 14% despite a
stronger U.S. dollar. The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe Derivatives was $0.67 per contract in the fourth
quarter compared to $0.59 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $0.67 in the third quarter of 2010. Decline versus the fourth
quarter of last year was due mostly to the stronger dollar. Rate per contract in U.S options was $0.17 per contract in the
fourth quarter. This was down from $0.18 in the prior year and in line with the third quarter.
Our Global Derivatives segment margins were 48% in Q4 and 55% for full year 2010, growing eight basis points
versus full year 2009. This includes an investment loss of $30 million for NYSE Liffe U.S. in 2010, as we prepare for
the 2011 launch of our interest rate future products. Though derivative volumes were seasonably slow in Q4, we are
pleased to report January 2011 volumes for Liffe futures and U.S. options were up 25% and 17% respectably from
fourth quarter ADV levels.
Similarly slides 17 and 18 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listing segments. Cash Trading
and Listings net revenue was $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down 7% versus the prior year period but up
4% sequentially. For the year, revenues were down 10% but only 4% on a currency neutral basis. This was attributed to
lower overall market volumes in the U.S. cash and pricing reductions in Europe cash in 2009. Market share was
relatively stable in Q4 and throughout the year for both U.S cash and in our four European markets, and was – as was
pricing on a currency neural basis.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash trended up to $0.033 per 100 shares handled for Q4 in line with recent trends reflecting
continued stability. Capture increase compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to strong Mahwah's trading volume,

where we have opportunistically increased fees and less clients hitting tiers on Arca. Effective November 1st, we
implemented a new pricing plan for our European market.
Revenue capture for European cash was $0.71 per transaction versus $0.88 in the prior year. Our decline year-over-year
can be attributed to the stronger dollar and prior year price reductions. The increase from $0.66 in the third quarter of
2010 levels was driven by some growth in non-volume based revenue sources, and less clients hitting tiers which more
than offset the impact with the recent pricing reduction.
2010 trading volumes rose 7% for European cash but declined 21% for U.S. cash. January 2011 volumes were 26%
higher than the fourth quarter ADV for European cash and 6% higher for U.S. cash. Operating margin for the Cash
Trading and Listings segments was 32% in the fourth quarter, down from 35% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 34% in
the third quarter of 2010.
Slide 19 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segments.
Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $114 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $11
million or 11% from Q4 prior year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues were higher by 14%. The increase was
primarily driven by an increase in data center revenue from the launch of the Mahwah and Basildon data centers, strong
enterprise software sales and the impact of the NYFIX acquisition.
Operating income was $28 million, a 47% increase to prior year and a 17% increase from the third quarter of 2010.
Operating margins rose to 25% compared to 18% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and adjusted EBIT margin was 32%.
For the year, revenues in this segment grew 22% and margin improved from 15% to 20%, solid progress against our
plan to grow revenues to $1 billion to the 25% to 30% margin by 2015. With our data centers now live, we'll be
focusing our migrating clients and markets into our new liquidity hubs, data center-related revenues begin to accelerate
and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011.
Slide 20 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expense. We're continuing to make excellent progress in
lowering our cost base in real terms of slightly incremental investments to grow the business. Q4 expenses were above
third quarter levels as we began to depreciate the new data centers and invest in new initiatives. That said Q4 costs rose
only $6 million versus Q3, $5 million of which was due to a negative variance in FX.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were down $6 million versus last year on a reported basis. 42% of our expenses in
the fourth quarter were denominated in either Euros or pounds. After adjusting for FX and the impact of acquisitions
and divestitures such as NYFIX and Hugin and new initiatives, fixed operating costs were down $25 million or 6%
from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, total reported fixed operating costs of 1.678 million were below
the low end of our currency adjusted full year guidance of $1.707 million to $1.749 million.
On a constant dollar and constant portfolio basis, full year fixed expenses were down $113 million or 7% compared to
the prior year. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvement that
will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext in the coming years. Despite the more than $50 million of
incremental expenses expected in 2011 with portfolio changes like adding a corporate board member to build out of our
new clearing houses in Europe and incremental costs from the additional technology services revenues, we still expect
to deliver fixed costs in 2011 of less than 1.650 billion. We will provide in greater detail on our full year 2011 fixed
cost guidance at Investor Day on March 8th.
Slide 21 details our cash and deposition as of December 30, 2010. The company ended 2010 in a strong financial
position, well positioned to support future growth and shareholder value opportunities. For the year, we paid down
nearly $400 million of debt while growing EBITDA at 4%. 2010 capital expenditures were in line with guidance at
$305 million including $115 million related to building our data centers. With both our data centers now live, we
expect our capital expenditures to decline in 2011 to around $200 million or potentially lower.
We will provide more guidance to the outlook of CapEx at our Investor Day. At December 31st, our debt-to-EBITDA
leverage ratio was 2.2 times down from 2.3 at the end of September 2010 and down from 2.6 times at the end of 2009.
This improvement in leverage and an upturn in business prospects resulted in the company maintaining A-ratings and
outlook upgrades to stable from both S&P and Moody's. We continue to operate within our long-term target leverage

levels and are committed to return excess cash flow to our shareholders. We plan to discuss this further at our Investor
Day in March. Last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2010 which is
payable on March 31st.
With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer
Okay, thanks Mike, and thank you everybody for listening in. Just a few closing remarks before we open it for
questions as we always do. In closing, our results for the quarter were solid and we're pleased with the progress that
we're making on the multi-year strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to
innovate and collaborate.
As a result of our diversification efforts over the past several quarters, our business model is much better positioned to
weather periods like the one we experienced in the second half of 2010. We also have additional drivers of growth
coming online in the months ahead with our anticipated launch of U.S. interest rate futures in conjunction with the
launch of NYPC.
With TCCC, we are bringing to market a revolutionary new clearing solution that we believe will finally deliver
effective competition to the U.S. futures market and as I said earlier, we hope to launch that in March of this year. We
have strong growth coming from our Technology segment in 2011 and I'm increasingly confident looking at all the
RFPs we're receiving that we are seeing evidence that our solutions-focused approach is going to continue to gain
traction in the quarters ahead.
You have all seen our January volume numbers. We feel good about the rebound in European derivatives and
particularly good about the strong year-on-year numbers from European cash. And lastly the IPO calendar in '11
meaning deals already executed and what the pipeline looks like reflects absolutely a continuation of the positive trends
we saw at the end of last year.
Continuing this momentum, we have a transfer from some other markets. This Friday we'll be privileged to welcome
IMAX to the NYSE. Given that we will be hosting many of you in just a few weeks on March 8th for Investor Day
when you will have the opportunity to visit our Mahwah Data Center, we will take only a handful of questions today
but with that I will open the line for questions.
Stephen, back to you.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.
Please proceed.
<Q - Christopher Harris>: Thank you, good morning. This is a question for Mike. Your compensation expense is
very low. I think it was under 22% of revenue in the quarter. And I guess I'm wondering is that really a good run rate
for you guys now going forward now that you've kind of right-sized your expense base or is there something special
going on in the quarter we should be aware of?

<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Yes, thanks. The comp
expense was in the fourth quarter $11 million lower than the third quarter. It was a little lower than I would say the run
rate. I mean in the quarter a couple of things happened, we definitely true-up our annual compensation based on
performance and goals. We did as part of our cost reduction program and looking at benefit programs and there was a
foreign pension program that when the last executive left the company, we ended up closing. So it was a legitimate cost
to-date but a little larger expense benefit in the fourth quarter, and of course it also reflects continued staff efficiency.

And your next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Yes, good morning, guys.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: I'll take my one shot – will be with Michael, too I guess. And it's on the – you got CapEx
going down by $100 million and but you also got other things that are farther off like the data centers – it's not the data
centers, the clearing, NYPC. So I'm just trying to get a feel for what the cash uses and how you see cash being
apportioned here in 2011?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Sure. I mean I think our
cash flow statement is pretty straight-forward. There's not a lot of working capital in this business. In fact one of the
positives we get is as the IPO market picks up, we pick up cash from that, that doesn't reflect immediately in the P&L.
So, the two key drivers to our cash flows in '11 versus '10 – and we'll talk about more about this in the Investor Day – is
CapEx which is declining. It's D&A which is growing, so the EBITDA and the cash earnings are actually higher. And
so I think in summary – and of course there's EBITDA and profit growth of the business.
So I mean I think we basically are feeling good about our balance sheet ending the year. We feel strong about our cash
flow next year and we believe we have excess cash beyond the $312 million dividend which is that we paid today and
the question is what we do with that excess cash flow, investing in the business and looking at alternatives.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: But I guess maybe more specifically, is there going to be any cash usage for NYPC clearing
or the clearing that you're working towards in 2012?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Yes, I mean there are –
as you move into clearing, there is definitely a little more cash on hand and regulatory capital one needs to maintain,
but which is factored into our plan. So it's really, I would think more of a 2012 and even a 2013 issue on the European
clearing houses and NYPC the cash that we need to maintain is all factored into the projections.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Hi good morning, Duncan. Good morning, Mike.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Hi.
<Q - Howard Chen>: The Information and Technology segment margin expansion this quarter stood out to me. I was
thinking that might come a bit later when the data centers were more fully online. What's driving that and then given
you mentioned the revenue ramp-up from here, should we just assume further margin expansion from here or is it going
to get a little bit lumpy? Thanks.

<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Yes I'll start by articulating, Howard, what the longer term
goal was and then I'll let Larry fill in some of the blanks on that. So it's a multi-year goal that includes increasing the
revenue base from what was $360 million a couple of years ago to $1 billion in the out-years and expanding that
margin which when we put all these businesses together, that margin was around 13% if memory serves and we're
striving for a 25% to 30% margin in that business.
Hopefully which is a combination of some of the things we indicated on the call about the early success we're having
particularly being involved in the infrastructure business, but I think we did make a lot of progress in '10 towards those
goals. Leibo, why don't you just talk a little bit about some of the other things that we're sure to see?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: So I think part of what contributed also was remember we bought NYFIX and then we
started to realize the cost saving synergies of that, so that improved the margins in itself.
I think what we're seeing is this business maturing and getting to scale in certain segments, in particular like the
Network segment where we hope that we start to utilize the network even further as we grow the business. Remember a
lot of these contracts are lumpy but the way we recognize them are spread out over time, so while we may sign a big
deal with someone and they have big headline numbers, well, a lot of them are spread over three, four years. So they
don't actually look that lumpy in the P&L. So this is a trend that we obviously hope to continue.
I think the data centers coming online helps us get some of those revenue streams but more importantly serves as sort
of the catalyst for being able to sell these broader solutions, these broader solution packages because you've got the
new data centers, you've got the critical mass of markets. We've got more and more things going in there that are
attractive to our clients.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Howard.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Daniel Fannon>: Good morning. A question on NYPC, just want to get a sense of I guess the confidence level
around the approval process and the timing of that. And then also do you – are you out marketing this to other
customers? I think you've talked about underway with the kind of go-live members base today. Is that something where
you anticipate expanding that member base prior to approval or is there a marketing campaign that's set to kind of
launch in conjunction with the go-live launch?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Great question, and I'll start by saying we have a tremendous
amount of confidence given our conversations with the regulators that the extensions have been taken. The comment
periods have been, are behind us, and I think what you see that the two primary regulators who have been involved in
this, the CFTC and the SEC converging around an approval date in late February, so that they don't – so one isn't
getting ahead of the other.
For example, the CFTC could have given us the DCO and the cross-margining agreement a week or 10 days ago. They
specifically said to us we're giving you the DCO. We want to converge the cross-margining agreement with the SEC
later in February which makes total sense to me.
This also comes remember because this was a unique approach, this also involved the Federal Reserve as well. So
while they wouldn't go through a comment period or anything like that, they were intimately involved in this process.
And I will tell you as an observer, I thought the three agencies did a very good job of cooperating and collaborating
throughout the process, but because it was a new approach, it did take longer than obviously we all thought it was
going to take. Now in fairness to them, that was compounded by Dodd-Frank as well because that's job number one,
two and three for a lot of the key agencies, but we're supremely confident that by the end of February, we will have the

requisite approvals.
Now shifting gears to the launch, the good news is that if you are connected to NYSE Liffe U.S. there's no more work
for you to do in terms of trading the contracts on our platform, because this is just – think of the standards if we're
adding a new product, right. So we're just putting some new products out there for people to trade. It's a new product
launch, but if you've already got connectivity to NYSE Liffe U.S., by definition you get that.
What we had to do is get people to be clearing members of NYPC and that's really accelerated in the last couple of
months when it became more clear that we were going to get the approvals. Frankly, I don't blame the customers.
Everybody's busy. Us going to them months ago and saying hey, trust us. We're definitely going to launch this thing in
Q1 of '11, I don't blame them for saying, you know what? I'll focus on this when it's more clear that you're going to get
up and running.
So, we've had a lot of success in the last six weeks as it's become more clear that we're going to get there. And I think
another accelerator was the DCO approval, so we're very actively engaged with everybody on the membership side
right now. So that shouldn't be an impediment to launch. And lastly the technology has been built underneath, for the
fixed systems to talk to the NYSE Liffe U.S. systems, that's all in great shape. So that's been one benefit of the
regulatory process taking a little longer, that we've had plenty of time to test those systems. Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hi, thanks, good morning. Can you just – may be a little color on co-location, just sort
of the – give me a little dimension on the ramp you're expecting between first and second quarter? And then my
understanding is that you'll be pretty well ramped up by then that point for the rest of the year, but how do you grow
that business in 2012? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Yes, sure, thanks Chris. This is Larry. First, obviously we don't report co-lo in granularity
as a broken out line item. But the business kind of follows the market that they migrate into the new data centers. So,
we've got European derivatives and cash moved into Basildon. That's most of the way we're ramped up. In the U.S.,
we've got to move Arca into Mahwah, that will bring its co-lo revenues. But remember, we're receiving co-lo revenues
in their existing space already. So I don't know how much material will be added to that.
I think what it really does is then start – it serves as the launching point for all the other services that we sell alongside
it. As we said all along, co-lo is important to what we do, but the reality it's it not the be-all and the end-all and it's
really about having the critical mass that attracts other services like market data, dissemination or ticker plants or
routing or managed services or all the other pieces that we sell along with the solution. And I think that you're going to
start to see those deals start to ramp up. And in fact we've already – that is – on that page that talks about deals, a lot of
those deals really were contingent on us getting towards Mahwah.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Okay. And then a related follow-up, can you just comment perhaps on the recent SEC
proposals for market-making obligations for high-frequency trading firms and how that impacts your thoughts on the
co-lo business?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Well so first, a couple of things. One is New York Stock Exchange has market-making
obligations for DMMs and SLPs that are far in excess of any market maker obligations that have been discussed in the
market. So as far as the core New York market is – there is certainly no impact. Remember...
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: In fact some of the SLPs are what people would say are in
the electronic market.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Electronic market makers. I think what you're going to see is that these SEC
market-maker obligations as far as we can tell so far are really about firms that want to qualify for market makers to get
some of those benefits. To be honest from what we've seen, most of the firms that want those benefits and those

benefits include lower capital requirement, some slight differences in short sale and internalization capabilities, most of
the big guys are going to be able to qualify for that anyway. Most of the obligations that are being thrown around, we
don't think are strong enough that there will be a material impact, and in fact we've argued for stronger obligations in
general. So, we don't think that this is going to be a material difference in the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Hi, good morning. Just I guess to come back to the data centers, like I guess Mahwah in
particular and thinking about the revenue ramp, how much of the rack space that's been taken down actually has client
servers installed and actually actively trading at this point? And I'm asking just to get it sort of the fixed versus variable
revenue component there right now versus maybe what it could be if it was sort of fully utilized?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: First, the Mahwah data center we built out effectively three
out of the five hulls, and when we initially set it out, we devoted about two of those hulls to our own systems and one
for customers. We sold out effectively over 90% of that fair capacity and then what we've done is we've then gone back
and identified some of the stakes and the customers to get an additional yield of 15%ish right off the bag without
having to build out a bigger hull.
So building out a further hull is somewhere in the $35 to $40 million of CapEx. We don't think that we're going to need
to do that within 2011 and that's not in the budget. So, we think that we've got enough room for a bit of expansion here
as we go forward and in general, the customers are relatively happy with the space they have. So we're thinking we're
getting towards steady state then the utilization of that space is going to grow with the core NYX Technology business
itself. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Okay.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: I think that's – I mean,
you said what's currently being utilized in that one pod, it's all of the non-Arca space.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: About 90%.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: About 90% has been
sold but what's in there today would be – the applications that are currently been migrated to the Mahwah which is
principally options and the NYSE Classic.

<Q - Rob Rutschow>: I was wondering are you planning to list your European derivatives and NYPC once you launch
it? And can you give us any sort of color around the decision process there given that the U.S. has some more favorable
bankruptcy laws and so forth?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: So if you mean the interest rate products, Rob, I'll take a leap
of faith that that's what you're talking about. I do think that if the model we're deploying here in the U.S. works and it
proves to be as useful, and is capitally efficient and is innovative to the customer base as we hope it could be, then I
think there are certainly opportunities to think about extending that capital efficiency across border. Now remember if
you've been paying attention to this OTC discussion as a lot of us have, a lot of what the focus on the OTC clearing
discussion has been central to is people are looking for regional – it's not national solutions for some of this.
So we want to walk before we run because it may be that even if we think it's a good idea and even if we think the
customers thinks it's a good idea, if we start to trade products that are from different jurisdictions on different
exchanges, we may run into unanticipated resistance that we didn't see from other places. But in theory nothing would
stop us from listing those interest rate products that are on the short end of the curve on NYSE Liffe U.S.; I think we
will not do that until NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC get some traction. Then and only then would we even consider it and
then after that, it's going to be more than just asking the customers about it. But yes, it's definitely on the drawing
board.
<Q - Rob Rutschow>: Okay. Thanks a lot. That's helpful.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Vinciquerra with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Vinciquerra>: Thank you. Congratulations on all the great work the last year, guys. I just wanted to ask
on the technology side, a couple things you've mentioned here is new opportunities and then you talk about aggregating
liquidity venues across asset classes, and then second of all, you mentioned finding some partners for safety on a global
basis. Can you just touch on those opportunities and how long those may take to ramp?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Sure, I mean I think doing the second one first. As we move into other areas whether it's
Asia, Brazil, other places like that, it doesn't necessarily makes sense for us to build that out all by ourselves. So for
example in Brazil, we already have a partner for extending safety. We have a partnership going in both directions.
And so we look to partnerships to help extend that whether in Canada or in Asia or other places like that. And so part of
that is also on the comment in terms of getting order flows going in both directions. You're doing it based on increased
activity in that region over time. So to me, that's a longer-term payoff and therefore we certainly don't want to spend a
lot of money upfront to get there but we want to create some partnerships.
In terms of aggregating liquidity venues, first I think some of that is going to be markets. Traditional or not we've
opened our doors in Basildon and Mahwah for some of whom you might have thought of as our competitors to be
located with us because we think it's good for our customers in terms of decreasing their cost of connectivity to the
market, it increases their market opportunities, so those are all good things.
The Goldman MTF is a perfect example in Europe of the type of thing we're interested in doing, because that locates a
big customer's dark market or MTF market with us and we think that that will add to the critical mass of that data
center and make other solutions more attractive to all of our clients across a range. So it's something and then there will
be some non-traditional asset classes like FX that we think might be very interesting to locate in our data centers and
that where there might be cross market arbitrage opportunities as long as we do it within the right regulatory
framework.
<Q - Michael Vinciquerra>: Great. Thank you.

And your final question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Kenneth Worthington>: Hi, good morning. Duncan, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that regulatory
changes were positive for the market participants. Based on what you're hearing from regulators now, where do you
think regulatory changes will be most positive for New York? Is it U.S. or Europe, cash or derivatives, execution or
clearing, and then is there any positive impact on the technology business from the regulatory changes? Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: All right, good question, yes, that's a good one, and so I'll
give some thoughts and I'm sure Larry has some opinions as well. As Ken's question articulates, there's a lot of
different regulatory discussions going on. So, if you think about where a lot of the focus has been away from the
financial crisis, both the U.S. and Europe are taking a close look at their cash equities markets, their respective cash
equities market structures. Obviously the U.S. regime has been in place longer than the European regime. And I think
it's fair to say we get the sense in talking to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic that the Europeans seem more
prepared to undo some of the things that were done that have led to increased opacity, increased fragmentation et
cetera. Far from implemented, far from executed, but I think we believe that there is a greater likelihood of more
substantive market structure changes in the cash markets, in the equities markets in Europe than there probably is in the
United States.
I think the derivatives discussion has been sort of put off in our view. This notion of fungibility, interoperability, et
cetera, I think that's going to be postponed until we understand where all the Dodd-Frank will filings land, what impact
that has on the more unregulated parts of the derivatives market, whether it does indeed enhance our ability to manage
systemic risk throughout the various markets or not. So we get the sense that, that is not front and center for the
regulators right now.
If you look at most of where Dodd-Frank is focused to get to Ken's – the part of Ken's question focus on OTC are
listed, I think it's going to have a lot more impact on the clearing side than really on the execution side. Many of you on
the call have heard me say many times that if you think about these less easily standardized derivative products,
focusing on clearing and focusing on transparent reporting makes a tremendous amount of sense to me. Wishing these
all to be exchange-traded makes less sense to me. So I'm still kind of in the camp that says I need to be convinced. So I
think most of the Dodd-Frank filings and similar filings in Europe are going to be focused on clearing of the
standardized products potentially on reporting of those products, but I'm yet to be convinced that they're going to be
that focused on trading.
Now net-net, most of those things I just talked about either leave us in a status quo position or present opportunities for
us to potentially grow or expand our business. That doesn't mean we'll be able to achieve all those. For example, we're
still very much building out our clearing assets, but I think net-net, those are pretty positive for us. Leibo, you want to
add anything to that or did I.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: I mean the only thing I would say is that yesterday the TRF in cap-c was 37%, and so that
number just keeps going up more off exchange volume, obviously from a self-interested standpoint we'd love to see
more happen on exchange. But from a market quality standpoint, I think we're even more concerned with the toxicity of
flow that ends up on exchanges as a result of the cream getting skimmed off in the off-exchange markets, that makes it
harder to incent a provision of liquidity in the public markets. It disadvantages retail limit orders that are resting and so
we think there will be potential for some increased attention there. Now make no mistake about it, we are not against
dark pools. We are not against internationalization. What we're really talking about it is a better balance between them
because at a certain point, the health of the public market suffers and I think we're actually seeing that.
