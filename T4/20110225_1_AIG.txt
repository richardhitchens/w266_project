MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AIG Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Results
Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Liz Werner. Please go ahead.
Liz Werner, Investor Relations
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. On the call today is our
President and CEO, Bob Benmosche, who will take us through the first part of our presentation, followed by David
Herzog, our CFO who will take you through the detailed deck, which is available on our website. Bob and David are
joined on this call by a number of folks on our management team. After we complete the presentation we'll be happy to
take your questions.
If you are listening via phone and haven't already downloaded the presentation, it is available on our website:

Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the
comparable GAAP figures are included therein or in the fourth-quarter 2010 financial supplement available in the
Investor Information section of our website.
With that said and out of the way, let me turn it over to Bob. Bob?
Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you, Liz. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We're really delighted to have the opportunity to
share with you today our financial results, some perspective on how we performed and where AIG stands today as a
global financial institution. As we conclude the presentation, we'll be happy to take any of your questions.
As you all know, for more than two years, AIG has been focused on repaying the U.S. taxpayers for support they
extended to the company during the financial crisis. Six weeks ago, we were able to completely repay the Federal
Reserve two years, and I need to stress, two years ahead of schedule, a huge milestone. One we achieved because of
two things: the dedication of employees and the remarkable partnership of the Fed and the U.S. Treasury.
I would like to start this call by saying thank you to all of these people and to the American people. We thank you for
all that you have done. We're on a path that we believe will allow the U.S. government to recoup its entire – its entire
investment in AIG.
As we look forward – as we now look at slide five for those of you that have the slides, David will walk you through
our fourth quarter results in more detail, but in simple terms our fourth quarter net income attributable to AIG of $11.2
billion reflects $17.6 billion of divestitures, particularly the gains of AIA IPO and the sale of ALICO and the $4.2
billion of reserve strengthening at Chartis.
David will discuss our new non-GAAP financial measures and reserve strengthening later in the presentation as well,
but I would like to say a few things about Chartis up front. The reserve strengthening was a result of our in-depth
review of reserves. We are committed to holding the right level of reserves based on a highly detailed thorough,
thorough process. We continue to hold more statutory surplus than any P&C commercial insurance competitor in the
U.S. market.
Further, our reserves review updated our estimated losses for all years, including the more recent accident years of
2006 through 2009, years to which approximately 50%, 50% of the reserve strengthening excluding asbestos applied.
Net premiums written remained healthy at Chartis, and we continue to hold the line on pricing. As we have said
numerous times in last two years, we have adjusted our business mix to reduce risk and to yield more sustainable
earnings. In particular over the past several years, Chartis has deliberately and strategically shifted its mix of business
away from lines like workers compensation and excess casualty and toward higher margin less capital intensive
segments, such as consumer and specialty commercial businesses.
Let's move to slide six for those of you who have the slides. So much has been accomplished to position AIG for the
future. You already heard me say that we sold ALICO to MetLife and IPO-ed AIA. Those are the big ones. But since
2008, AIG has announced sales of 33 businesses and raised more than $57 billion in cash and securities.
As a result of our success in raising cash, we completed our recapitalization and completely repaid the Federal Reserve
of New York. Government investment in AIG today consists of the U.S. Treasury owning 92% common equity stake in
AIG, which it expects to sell off over time depending upon market conditions.
As a result, as we sit here today, AIG is a much simpler capital structure and a stronger balance sheet. Since the crisis
began in 2008, AIG reduced net debt by more than $107 billion. We stabilized our credit ratings and accessed the
capital markets. During the fourth quarter, AIG raised more than $5.5 billion of new, non-government funding
including $2 billion in senior debt in our first bond sale since the summer of 2008. We also established a $500 million
contingent liquidity facility and established bank credit facilities.

Let me talk a little bit about our success in de-risking the company. The practice we have has been steady and
significant. We brought the notional amount of the legacy AIG FP derivative portfolio down by 62% from $940.7
billion at the end of '09 to $352.8 billion at the end of 2010.
Perhaps more important, the liquidity risk of the FP portfolio is down some 97% from September of '08. The team that
has done an outstanding job, and we are committed to managing the remaining FP book on terms and on a timeline that
is beneficial to our stakeholders.
Now let's move to slide seven. Let's talk about the state of our business and our operations. Our key objectives are to
position our franchises for sustainable growth, which means striking the right balance between growth, profit and risk.
Led by Peter Hancock, we have done a lot of work to enhance enterprise risk management. We hired Sid Sankaran as
our Chief Risk Officer, who is doing a terrific job. We escalate major decisions involving risks we take to the Group
Risk Committee, which Peter chairs. I am also a member as are all of our business heads and senior functional heads as
we continue to bring aboard world-class enterprise risk management professionals to support our efforts and develop
sound, comprehensive tools to value risk and enhance value while supporting business growth.
As I have said many times, our business performance shows a clear pattern. Our insurance businesses are well
positioned. Client retention rates are strong. Surrender rates have improved to normal levels, and in some cases, even
better. Sales and distribution relationships are gaining momentum and employee turnover is well within the norm.
AIG consists predominantly of two core businesses, Chartis, one of the world's largest most successful property and
casualty franchises, and SunAmerica Financial Group, one of the U.S.'s broadest life and retirement services franchises.
These franchises are complemented by investments in other businesses that diversify our risk profile and will contribute
to our success such as our aircraft leasing business, ILFC and United Guaranty Corporation, our mortgage guarantee
insurance business. Each of these franchises is well capitalized and benefits from the simplified and greatly de-levered
balance sheet of the post-structured AIG.
At Chartis, customer loyalty is high and retention rates are up in the businesses where we want to grow, particularly our
consumer and specialty segments. The Chartis team has brought to the market more new products and services, while
continuing to expand and enhance its existing offerings. The business has a powerful global platform and we are
growing. Just recently we launched a tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Fuji Fire and Marine, which
will further strengthen our position as a largest foreign owned insurance group in Japan.
SunAmerica Financial Group includes American General, a leading life insurer and SunAmerica, VALIC and Western
National, all leading providers of retirement products in the U.S.
At SunAmerica, we have focused on innovative products. We greatly enhance distribution, which is key to the
retirement services side of the business. We are thankful to the many distribution partners that stayed with us and have
returned to us. As many of you know, there is an enormous and underserved need in the U.S. life and retirement
services market, and we believe SunAmerica is well positioned for the upcoming retirement boom.
A few words on ILFC and UGC. Over the past two years, these companies have taken significant actions to improve
their balance sheets. ILFC returned to the capital markets last year, stabilized its funding portfolio and has strong cash
flows. Beginning in March, ILFC raised more than $14 billion through a variety of funding sources and other liquidity
initiatives enabling it to pay off loans from AIG and indirectly the U.S. Government. UGC, which was profitable in
2010 saw lower first lien delinquencies and improved both its underwriting and claims operations to an extent that we
believe it will benefit shareholders going forward.
I commend the teams at all of our businesses for their unwavering focus on conducting business during the global
recession and with all the noise surrounding AIG. I truly believe that AIG's greatest asset is our people. Our people
believe in AIG. No matter the environment, they focus on servicing their customers and preserving the value and power
of great franchises.

Recently, we completed an employee survey in which 92% of the employees participated, an extraordinary percentage.
They give the highest scores to teamwork and high standards for ethics and compliance, which was incredibly
heartening. The resilience, integrity and commitment of our employees are at the heart of why I am proud to be a part
of AIG today.
As we move to slide eight, we can see that as we build our recent accomplishments we face new and exciting
challenges. We are squarely focused on making AIG the world's most valuable insurance company. We will pursue that
goal by leveraging our unmatched global presence, franchise, leadership and loyalty that comes from confidence that
our customers have in AIG. Focusing on profitable growth, growing our core insurance operations in particular,
focusing on enhanced risk management framework and effectively deploying our capital to the best opportunities. Our
efforts are intrinsic to our delivering profitable, sustainable growth. We are committed to building on the extraordinary
efforts of the last two years and as we continue to take the right steps to earn and gain the confidence of our
stakeholders.
David, I'd like -
David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President
Thanks, Bob, and good morning everyone. Let's turn to slide number 10. As Bob highlighted, we reported fourth
quarter net income attributable to AIG of $11.2 billion. Here's a quick rundown of the results for the quarter. For
Chartis, a $4 billion loss and a $1.1 billion loss for the year. These results are heavily affected by the prior year loss
reserve strengthening on long tail lines of business of $4.2 billion in the quarter and catastrophe losses of roughly $1.1
billion for the year.
At SunAmerica, we posted income of $1 billion for the quarter and generated $4 billion for the year. For ILFC, a loss
of just over $600 million for the quarter and a loss of nearly $700 million for the year. These results reflect the
impairment charges of about $740 million for the quarter, $1.6 billion for the year stemming from more active fleet and
balance sheet management in large part for the quarter due to recent announcements by one aircraft manufacturer with
respect to forthcoming new aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines.
At UGC, as Bob pointed out, we posted $154 million profit for the quarter and almost $330 million of profit for the
year, reflecting continued improvement in market conditions, lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in first lien
products, a decline in claims and claims adjustment expense, all resulting in favorable prior year loss development.
Let's turn to slide 11. This page shows a reconciliation of our after-tax operating income to GAAP net income
attributable to AIG. After-tax operating income or loss is a new non-GAAP measure we are using in place of adjusted
net income that we formerly used. As you can see, many of the adjustments relate to our restructuring and divestiture
activities that are winding down and are not part of the ongoing operations of the company going forward.
In addition to excluding realized capital gains and losses and derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment, we
will now exclude the deferred acquisition cost effects of capital gains and losses much like other market participants
and show the operating earnings as if there was no deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This makes our non-GAAP
measure more comparable to others in the industry.
Let's turn to slide 12. As a result of the recapitalization, which happened after the quarter closed, our pro forma book
value per share at year-end is $46.80. As you can see with the recapitalization, we have greatly simplified our capital
structure and reduced financial leverage. We have a footnote 26 in our 10-K that shows a pro forma unaudited balance
sheet showing the effects.
Let's turn to slide 14, Chartis operating results. Chartis operating loss was $4 billion as I earlier mentioned, before
realized capital gains and losses and reflected the $4.2 billion reserve strengthening net of discount and loss sensitive
premium adjustments.

The total reserve strengthening represents about 6.2% of AIG's total general insurance net liability for unpaid claims
and claims adjustment expense of just over $68 billion reported at year-end. Major cats in the quarter were about $203
million, while there were none in last year's fourth quarter.
Partially offsetting the adverse reserve development and higher cats was net investment income of about $1.2 billion up
40% from the fourth quarter of 2009, which included a large unusual item. Fourth quarter 2010 includes just over 300
million of partnership and mutual fund returns.
Let's now turn to slide 15. As part of our annual in-depth reserve review, Chartis conducts hundreds of individual
analyses for each class of business in its companies. Across AIG this is a well-established process and with the
assistance of third-party actuaries, our own actuarial teams assess the potential implications of new data, loss
emergence across accident years during the quarter, new and emerging AIG specific and industry loss trends, and
where appropriate we update and calibrate loss models using the best available current information.
We updated our estimated net loss reserves for many accident years, including more recent accident years. As Bob
mentioned, excluding asbestos, approximately 50% of the reserve strengthening related to accident years 2006 through
2009.
As you can see, there is a breakdown of the adverse development by major class of business on the slide. And as you
will note, four classes have contributed the majority of the adverse development over the last five years with all
remaining classes that make up nearly 93% of the net premiums written for 2010 contributing favorable development
of just over $1 billion over the same five-year period.
We have continued to de-emphasize the four long tail classes of business as you can see at the bottom right of the slide,
where we showed that these four classes made up almost 22% of the premiums in 2007 and represent less than 7% in
2010. We are comfortable that our process resulted in our reasonable best estimates, which were further informed by
third-party actuarial indications.
Let's turn to slide 16. Chartis continues to deploy capital in higher margin segments and geographies and has made a
significant change in geographic diversity with growth in the international markets. In the fourth quarter, worldwide net
premiums increased 9.4%, but excluding the nearly $900 million of premiums relating to Fuji, which we now
consolidate, worldwide premiums declined actually 3.3% during the period.
This is primarily due to challenging economic conditions though some global regions are improving and the shift in
business mix away from certain long tail lines or cat exposed lines that are less profitable as Bob mentioned earlier. We
have had some good experiences in specialty markets and with our consumer lines, and niche products we continue to
shift our mix of business.
Pricing in 2010 was relatively stable as we compared favorably to the major U.S. pricing indices. The international
share of overall Chartis net premiums increased steadily from approximately 35% in 2007 to nearly 50% in 2010. For
example the recent Fuji acquisition was very much in line with our strategic goal of increasing both consumer and
international business.
Let's turn to slide 17. The fourth quarter 2010 combined ratio was just over 160 points, including 49 points from
reserve strengthening. In addition to the reserves, Chartis had higher expenses. The expenses were up 150 points due to
higher acquisition cost from delivered strategic shift to increase our consumer lines. As we acquire more consumer
business, we will experience higher expense ratios, as acquisition costs associated with consumer business are higher
however the overall combined ratio on this business tends to be lower.
Let's turn to slide 18. Investment income, as side mentioned earlier increased just over 40% primarily due to the large
unusual item in 2004. But we also had increased partnership income. We have reduced the Chartis municipal bond
portfolio to approximately $36.3 billion net of the prefunded municipal bonds. Current portfolio is high quality with
over 99% of the portfolio rated low single A or better and the majority of the portfolio is in revenue bonds. As part of
our Chartis strategic asset allocation going forward, we continue to purchase taxable instruments in line with liquidity,
duration, quality constraints and importantly that also meet our current risk, return and tax objectives.

Let's turn to slide 20, SunAmerica. With 2010 operating income of $4 billion, SunAmerica is well-positioned,
profitable businesses and holds a number of enviable industry market share positions. SunAmerica essentially posted
$1 billion of operating income each quarter in 2010 and has strengthened its dividend capacity to the parent company,
an important component of our capital management going forward.
Slide 21. Premiums, deposits and other consideration or PDOC as we like to refer to them, decreased 6% for the fourth
quarter from the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower fixed annuity sales. PDOC increased 6% for the full-year
driven primarily by the diversified product portfolio, multichannel distribution network and the work that the
SunAmerica team did to re-engage relationships with distributors and producers.
This increase is despite more than $830 million decrease in the Western National fixed annuity sales, which have been
affected by low interest rates. For the first nine months of 2010, the most recent industry data available, industry-wide
sales of fixed annuity declined 52%. Excluding Western National fixed annuity sales, SunAmerica's PDOC increased
15% for the quarter and 10% for the full year.
A couple of other observations, Western National maintained its number one ranking for fixed annuity sales in the bank
channel and is well positioned to capitalize on rising interest rates. Life insurance sales were up 18.6% for the quarter,
primarily from independent distribution and improvements in career distribution productivity.
Retirement deposits from VALIC reflect successful capturing of individual deposits, a deliberate focus of the VALIC
team over the last few years. SunAmerica Retirement Markets, individual variable annuity deposits more than doubled
in 2010 as a result of enhanced distribution, increased wholesaler productivity and product enhancements.
Let's turn to slide 22. Net investment income is up primarily from higher interest income on the portfolio and improved
partnership returns. SunAmerica's cash position is still significant and cash deployment remains a priority. The Maiden
Lane II investment did well for the year contributing over $500 million to our interest and dividend income, and we
expect the redeployment of cash and short-term investments into longer term higher yielding securities will provide an
opportunity to improve future earnings.
Now to slide 23, net investment spreads. Despite a decrease in the base yields, spreads increased in the fourth quarter
and the full year. Increases for both periods reflect improved partnership returns as well as disciplined management of
crediting rates. The increase for the full year was also driven by improvements in fees received relating to calls and
prepayments of fixed income securities and mortgage loans.
Turning to slide 25, a word or two about the AIGFP portfolio unwind. We've made continued and steady progress in
managing the legacy AIGFP portfolio. This portfolio has been significantly wound down, de-risked and is generating
modest operating profits and providing positive liquidity. Contingent liquidity exposure was about $1.6 billion at
year-end 2010, down over 90% from September 2008.
Since September of 2008, we've reduced the outstanding portfolio trade positions by over 90% to roughly 3,900. The
December 2010 trade count excludes approximately 4,800 positions that are non-derivative asset and liability positions
whose management we transferred to the Direct Investment portfolios at AIG.
We reduced the notional amounts of the derivative portfolio by 82% to just over $350 billion at year-end including
$11.5 billion of intercompany derivatives and almost $60 billion of super senior credit default swap. The risk
characteristics of the portfolio have been significantly reduced.
And finally turning to slide 27, our deferred tax asset attributes. AIG has substantial deferred tax assets that are
available to offset future tax obligations. We have laid out the gross attributes, the gross assets and the basic framework
for utilizing or realizing the tax assets. We have established a full valuation allowance on our DTAs principally because
of our limited ability in the past to project future operating profits of the right character.
Over time this will become much more straightforward, and we will apply our framework for assessing the need for the
valuation allowance. Economically we currently expect to utilize the NOL, the non-life capital loss carry forwards and
the foreign tax credit carry forwards over time. The life capital loss carry forward is more challenging, given its size,
expiration dates and dependency on market conditions. But again I want to stress we have a full valuation allowance

established. So there is no risk to our GAAP equity.
Now Liz, back to you.
Liz Werner, Investor Relations
Thank you, David. Operator can we open up the lines or open up for questions right now?
Q&A
Operator
Yes. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Donna Halverstadt from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Good morning. And thank you for reinitiating your conference calls. It's a very helpful step
for those of us on the outside. I had two questions – two easy questions related to the property-casualty business, one
on the commercial line side, one on the personal line side. With respect to your commercial lines business, if pre crisis
you were the 800-pound gorilla, how much do you think you weigh now, 200, 400, 700? How do you view your market
position on the commercial line side?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll answer and then turn it over to Kris. It's
Bob Benmosche. I would say we're about 780 pounds, and on our way back. I think that if you look at the franchise,
what's important is that we've come through a horrible period of time, where huge questions of the survivability of AIG
in particular, and yet if you look at our client retention it's extremely strong, and it's strong because of the core
competency of the people and of this company. And so we are seeing clients coming back. So I would say that we are
clearly the leader here. And I think that's why we are starting to not write certain businesses because we have the
confidence we can do that. And as the markets improve then we will come back to the markets. But, Kris Moor, would
you want to add to that?
<A - Kristian P. Moor>: Yeah, I – exactly what Bob said. And I would say during that period it strengthened the
organization not only on our strategy and focusing on how we manage our capital, but also we became much closer to
our customers and to our brokers, meeting with them constantly. And so we have our – we're close to our distribution,
we're close to our business. Our global platform, which enables us to service customers' needs around the world, which
includes underwriting, price – policy issuance, claims, engineering services, differentiate us in the marketplace. And
during that time period, we proved those franchise strengths and they just got stronger.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: One thing that we are doing that's not going to
be obvious as much as we'd like for another couple of years is that we used to be an organization that had unlimited
capital and therefore it was about top line growth. And now we're really looking at what our ROEs are by product,
where on a risk-adjusted basis we're making the right return. So you'll see that over time, Chartis will be able to talk
about combined ratios and ROEs in a much more refined way because we're no longer unlimited in our capital. We
have to be more capital light as we go forward.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Great. Thank you. And then I also had a question on the personal lines side, and it's
something I wonder about every time I see one of the very colorful ads. And it relates to your efforts to build your high
net worth personal lines business. And I think high net worth folks are very, very happy to pay Chubb's high rates
because they know that they won't be hassled if they ever have to file a claim. And with a bit of a historic reputation at
least on the commercial lines side for not being the quickest to pay claim, has that been a gating issue in terms of trying
to build the high net worth personal lines business?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that that may be historical
reference to the perception of AIG on the claims side. That's clearly not the case today. One of the factoids that I've got
and maybe Kris can verify it, is that if you look at the Forbes 400 list, I believe a third of that list -

<A - Kristian P. Moor>: Yeah.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: – are clients of Chartis. And so when I meet
my counterparts at the Business Council and other meetings around, there are many CEOs who proudly talk about
being Chartis clients, satisfied with Chartis and confident in Chartis and confident in AIG. So I believe that if you look
at our stats and who we're doing business with we also have the large client base in the high net worth category that are
pleased with us.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Dan Johnson. Please go ahead. Your line is open, from Citadel.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. Thank you very much. Bob, could you talk a little bit about how the reserving process
for this year differed from the one last year? And then I've got a follow-up question.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The process is roughly the same. What you
have are people as they look at recent trends and patterns are now realizing that these as we know in math you can
exponentially smooth things over time or you can look at vectors, which is more of a momentum of the moment. And
they have started to look at the momentum of the moment.
So for example in workers compensation you have to begin to recognize that we are in deep recession. We don't have a
jobs recovery. We do know that people who feel ill during this period of time will tend to go on disability or put in a
worker's compensation claim. So more people claim, employers are less likely to argue it because there is a concern
about jobs in their companies.
And once people are out and if you look at disability carriers as well as worker's compensation, you'll see they're out
there longer. They don't come back to work as easily and so you have to accept that as we get into this analysis that the
recovery isn't as strong as we'd like to see it. And so when you look at all of those factors and also recognizing medical
inflation, which was looked that, recognize that Medicare has decided to put more of the onus for medical costs back to
insurer that sometimes was covered by Medicare as they begin to – the government tries to look at its own cost for
these entitlement programs.
So all of these factors went into looking at what we had and then making some conclusions that we have to make sure
that we are realistic about what we think the future will be. And I think that's what happened this year versus last year
is just the reality. It's another year of extended slow recovery in the United States economy. And that's how we came
about it. It's as simple and as complex as what I just said.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Understood. And how does that sort of reassessment of where current loss run rates are at?
How does that influence the pricing that the market should be seeing from AIG as a result of this re-evaluation of sort
of the loss profile of business?
<A - Robert S. Schimek>: Dan, it's Rob Schimek speaking. If you go back to what David said in his comments the
reserve strengthening really focused on four lines of business. You'll recall those were asbestos, so this has no effect on
pricing there. It's workers compensation and workers compensation in particular the guaranteed cost workers
compensation, we've already been in a mode where it's running at a combined ratio in excess of 100, and it has been
and it is for the industry here in the U.S. more broadly. So I think our belief is it's worse than we had initially believed,
but we never fooled ourselves into thinking that it was profitable in the first place. So I think workers' compensation
just continues to be highly under pressure.
But as you go through the other lines of business that were the drivers of the reserve strengthening, it was primary
workers compensation, excess workers' compensation, which really is not a significant premium volume for us these
days, and it's excess casualty. Excess casualty continues to run as a profitable line, but I would say certainly

approaching the demarcation point between profitable and under stress from a profitability perspective. Those were the
four lines that really drove the reserve strengthening and that's what I think the future effect would be.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: So is the takeaway that sort of a modest impact on pricing even though the loss assumption
profile has changed just because you're either not in those businesses like asbestos or you've greatly cut them back like
excess workers' comp?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that is fair to say. But keep in mind
that that 93% of our premiums now are in products that were not affected by this reserve adjusting. So if you look at the
significant drop-off over the last three years of workers' compensation for example, we're down substantially in writing
premium in that product. So we still feel that those areas where we can get paid for the risk we take and the competency
of the people that we have to work with customers, those are areas where we feel in working with those customers, we
should get a fair return for what we're putting at risk. And those products that are not, we have now significantly
reduced those, which is why you'll see a drop-off in our premiums, but it's not because of reputational issues. It's about
we're just – our reputation is fine, clients are satisfied. This recapitalization has closed any issue that our clients have
had about are we going to make it. And so now it's a matter of can we afford to write the business at a loss and we feel
we cannot.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: That's very helpful. Finally, can I get a SunAmerica RBC number and that would be it? Thank
you.
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: Yeah. Good morning, Dan. Jay Wintrob. The end of the year the whole fleet is at 475%

<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. Thank you very much.

Great. And our next question comes from the line of Ed Spehar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward Spehar>: Thank you. Good morning. First, I want to say our loss is your gain. Liz is a great hire for you.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, Ed. And she is blushing.
<Q - Edward Spehar>: I mistreated her so much here. I figure I have to say something nice now. I have two questions.
First, our new business margins seem to have – new business margins seem to have improved materially in fixed
annuities. And I'm wondering if you could comment on what your new business ROE in fixed annuities is today
compared to last fall, and what's your appetite for growth in this business?
And then the second question is also on annuities. Could you talk more specifically about VA product enhancements
that you referenced in the release? And what type of share gains do you think are possible considering – especially
considering that the market leaders have recently reduced the attractiveness of their products?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We'll turn it over to Jay. Why don't you go
ahead and do that, Jay?
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: Sure. Good morning, Ed. Currently our new business pricing for fixed annuities is
approximately 12.5% IRR after-tax. That's probably somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points higher than last fall,
maybe 50 basis points higher. And the appetite is – exists and I think we'll make progress especially if rates stay
roughly at these levels. They bounced up off their lows from the third quarter of 2010, and as you can see in the
financial supplement we did have good sequential growth in the fourth quarter. I think that was directly related to the
level of rates and we continue to see momentum in the first quarter. Some of that is rate and some of that is re-engaging
distribution, as Bob and David mentioned in their prepared remarks.

On the VA product enhancements, I think it's both a combination of enhancements we made really starting in '09 as
well as last year and again re-engaging distribution and I think there are opportunities. The enhancements we have
made basically have been to provide people with the ability to get more of their money in the form of living benefits
earlier in exchange for a lower amount of living benefit withdrawal rate if they ever go into claims, meaning if their
account value runs out, that's been well received.
We've got extreme flexibility on different compensation rates we pay and the different structures of the products, A
shares, B shares, O shares. And quite frankly a lot of this though is really related to reengaging what were historic very
strong relationships both at the firm level, and I'm sure you know that we recently were reinstated at our largest VA
distributor, at least historically, Edward Jones, but we've also been reinstated in all of our other VA distributors but also
more importantly at the rep level, wholesaler to rep and we have modestly grown our internal and external wholesaling
force, that will continue in 2011.
As far as share gain opportunities, we don't have a targeted amount, Ed, but we observe what you've observed, which is
as the business became very concentrated among the top three players, more so than ever before in history some of
those players have clearly pulled back either because they quite frankly brought some of their product designs more in
line with what our designs have looked like for the last 18 months or so. So the features are somewhat less generous to
the customer, but also I think some of them have reconsidered the exact balance they want to have between variable
annuities and other products they're selling. I think that's an opportunity for us, and I would expect a lot of progress in
2011.
<Q - Edward Spehar>: Okay, if I could just follow-up quickly. I guess on the fixed annuity side, I'm surprised that the
IRR wasn't lower last fall considering where – if we look at spreads between, I think, sort of what the industry was
investing and at what crediting rates were, it seems like there's been a much, much more of an improvement in the
IRRs. Is the reason there wasn't that much of a change for you that back when margins were low, you just didn't
participate and write as much business?
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: It's partially true and as I think you can see that the third quarter of last year was I believe the
low point for our fixed annuity sales. And as you also saw, fourth quarter was the improvement principally due to rates
and just demand. But we have marginally raised our IRR targets I think as I mentioned in the last call, six months or so.
So I would say we've been pretty disciplined, stayed the course, but our price for IRRs has probably only come up
again between 50 and 100 basis points in the last six to nine months.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And keep in mind that what Jay and his team
have here in the fixed annuity arena is a great deal of flexibility with the banks in particular to trade off distribution
revenue for client crediting rate. So they have a very flexible product and they have a team of people that work with our
distribution to do that.
Secondly, they really have a strong competitive advantage in terms of the way they process the business. I would say
that the team they have and we talk about offshoring, but they offshore to Amarillo, Texas. And I will tell you the team
and the design and the way they function there gives them a very, very competitive advantage in terms of what their
costs are per annuity. So between the volume and the plan and the way they operate, it's a huge opportunity for them to
get that kind of return and maintain their discipline with the clients.
<Q - Edward Spehar>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Great. Now, our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: Good morning. I'd like to get some outlook on SunAmerica, Chartis and ILFC. Let me
start with SunAmerica. In the retirement area, the general operating expenses spiked 78% year-over-year and 44%
Q-over-Q to $257 million. In life operations DAC amortization of $256 million was up 47% year-over-year and 21%
Q-over-Q. I'm wondering if there was just something unusual going on in the quarter and where the outlook might be.

Page 11 of 16
So let me leave that question there.
Now moving on to Chartis. Overall, even after that big pre-announced prior year reserve development, if we look at the
loss ratio ex-cat, ex-prior year developments, we're sitting at 109%, and it looks like the expense ratio is four to five
points higher than what we would normally see. It looks like the loss ratios and it's emanating out of commercial in
both international and domestic. The loss ratio is at least four points then it's normally been. Is that the outlook that we
should be looking for, a 109% combined ratio in all of Chartis?
And then lastly, ILFC. So ILFC lost $606 million in the quarter. It's the worst quarter I've seen through the whole crisis.
So I'm kind of wondering, I know that the quote in one of the write-ups, many write-ups last night that AIG expects
that the availability of newer more efficient engines may reduce the demand for certain aircraft in its fleet. I don't know
it seems that there'd be a lot of new efficient engines and improvement over many years and suddenly we see $606
million loss in the quarter. What can we expect going forward from ILFC in terms of earnings? Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Let me start with the ILFC, we'll work
our way back. Clearly, when Airbus came out with their new engine announcement, we had to take a look at our legacy
aircraft. And one of the things we are doing at ILFC that up until now we have not and that is to begin to deal with the
average age of the fleet and begin to recognize the need to sell some of the legacy aircraft over time. Because of that as
they examined what they think the ability to re-lease – do new leases on these aircraft when the leases now expire
looking at what would happen in terms of those rates and the cash flow analysis and so on resulted in looking at a set of
older aircraft that would say that what we're carrying that aircraft now in terms of what its values would be over time is
not correct.
And so therefore we had to take an accounting adjustment to reflect the fact that with these new aircrafts coming out of
Airbus, we think we had to take a charge. So that's just prudent. We did that and we anticipate as we get into 2011, you
will not see the historical earnings that were coming out of ILFC because we're now having a more realistic view of
that earnings relative to getting rid of legacy aircraft and also as you know we've matched our funding.
So we're not playing the yield curve of borrowing short and lending long and getting caught with a $12 billion hole that
we had a couple of years ago. So this is on the right road. There are plans for this year, we know that we can deal with
good profit and we're not going to get into – give any kind of a prognosis of profit today but clearly we see them being
profitable and working through the legacy aircraft at the same time. So that's the positive.
I'm going to have Rob talk about the expenses because clearly as we get into the fourth quarter, there were actually
some unusual expenses related to what we could DAC and could not DAC and some other things. So Rob why don't
you just go over the details.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: And Bob just finishing on the ILFC, so I should feel pretty comfortable then that you've
assessed the environment for aircraft and that we wouldn't expect charges like this at least any time in the next couple
of quarters?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that I can't tell you there won't be
charges, but I believe that they will be in conjunction with if there are, with how we're dealing with the legacy aircraft
that we have on our books, but that will be part of – I don't think you're going to see this kind of one big whack coming
out. This will be business as we evolve going forward, but I don't see it as a big lump coming through. And so I think
you'll see basically ILFC and UGC in my mind once we get going in here over the next few years on some kind of
normalized basis, the two businesses could earn about $1 billion for us.
And we view them as important diversifications of risk, they're investments we're in. We would monetize those
investments where we got the right price for them, more so for ILFC than UGC, quite frankly. But for now we operate
them and do no harm and continue to build value over time, and that's what we are doing. We're not taking any big
risks and we're not going out on a limb, but we will continually buy aircraft, continually insure new mortgages,
continue to run this business in an appropriate way.

<A - Robert S. Schimek>: With respect to the Chartis combined ratio in the quarter, I think, you could break it down
into a couple of pieces that might be more helpful to you in your analysis. If you remove the prior year development
from the quarter, that's about 49 points, as David said in his comments earlier. Recall that whenever you strengthen
prior years, you also need to revisit what effect does the strengthening of the prior year have on your current accident
year loss ratio for those same lines of business.
So for example in the primary workers' compensation line of business where we strengthened reserves, we also had to
increase our current accident year loss ratio there. In addition to that in the fourth quarter, we had some additional
attritional losses. We would call them more significant property losses, for example, that are not cats that also increased
our current accident year loss ratio.
So, in general, you're seeing the effects of any increases in the current accident year loss ratio that we recorded in the
fourth quarter. And remember, since the third – first three quarters were already historically recorded on the books. If
we want to change our loss PIC, for example, the workers' compensation line of business, we've got to change it
retroactive year-to-date all in the fourth quarter, which is exactly what we did.
So, in total, I think you'll see about four points of the increase in the current quarter combined ratio, really driven by the
fact that we've increased the current accident year in the fourth quarter retroactively as well as any additional, in
particular, property losses that we encountered. And as you know that will be lumpy on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
In addition to those increases in the current accident year loss ratio that I just described, we also had $200 million of
natural catastrophe losses during the quarter, largely coming from the Australian floods and the Arizona hail storms.
And we also encountered probably about $100 million worth of large losses that didn't meet our criteria for
characterizing it as a natural catastrophe but nevertheless we would consider those to be severe losses. Frequently
losses like that are somewhere in the $5 million to $20 million range in terms of size so not meeting the threshold for
natural catastrophe. So there were a number of items that I just described that I think significantly impact the fourth
quarter accident year combined ratio that I think you want to factor into your analysis.
With respect to expenses, nothing has changed with respect to our view about the need to very actively manage and
aggressively manage our expenses. With that said, as David said in his comments. You will see an increase in expenses
as we continue to shift the mix of business from some of the commercial type products to more of the consumer type
products. We provide some pretty decent views of that for you in the Financial Supplement, and you can get an idea of
what our shifts of business have looked like go over the last couple of years in particular pages 23 and 24 of the
Financial Supplement might be helpful to you to get a visual view of how we're deliberately and strategically changing
the mix of business.
And then also as Bob said, as we go through the fourth quarter every year, we conduct our DAC study, reevaluating
what can be deferred versus our historical calculation and as is normally the case when premium volumes are declining
you will end up with a situation where some of your previously DAC-able expenses may not qualify to be DAC-able
because we perform a time study and try to evaluate the true expenses that vary with the actual production of the new
business. So I think those are the primary drivers that would help you to get a better handle on what you were seeing in
the fourth quarter.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: Yeah, that was really helpful. The loss ratio in particular was helpful. But on the expenses,
the DAC I mean, would that really explain just I'm kind of scrambling around pages, but for example a move in Chartis
from 28% expense ratio to 35% 3Q to 4Q, I mean, it just – I don't know the premium, maybe that explains part of it.
But I mean just tell me where you think it's going to be going forward? Did we see the normal number?
<A - Robert S. Schimek>: There is also – there is other things I didn't go as far as I probably could, let's stay with this
for a second. So as I'd said to you earlier, we're very in tune with making sure we maintain the proper expense structure
within Chartis. In the fourth quarter we did have a head count reduction in the United States. So along with that head
count reduction does come severance cost. So you're seeing that as another element of expenses in the fourth quarter.
And in addition to that just more broadly, we are in the process in particularly on the international side of the house of
doing a number of very important initiatives including Solvency II in Europe, we're right in the middle of that as we

speak. And that incurs a reasonably significant amount of additional expense. And we're also in the process of putting
in a new financial infrastructure on a global basis. As a matter of fact in the third quarter of 2010 in the United States
we went live with the SAP platform, and we are in the process of rolling that out across the globe.
So, as you can imagine, that's an extremely major initiative as we move forward. And then quite frankly other major
initiatives even include putting in place a single global claims platform across all regions of the Chartis operation. So
those are other drivers that are going on. I think we are investing smartly and strategically in making sure that we have
got the sustainable platform for the future.
<Q - Andrew Kligerman>: That was helpful. I'll follow-up off-line for more detail. But it seems like that number
needs to – will likely come down.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I agree. Jay?
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: Yes. Andrew, on your question about the expense increases at SunAmerica. First, you're right,
both sequentially and year-over-year they've increased similar reasons. The – I think the year-over-year increase was
about $94 million. The biggest piece of that is a guarantee fund assessment accrual that was put up related to Executive
Life of New York, which is just under $60 million.
We also had higher long-term compensation expense in the business. All of this expense is tied to the
performance-based, basically stock-based compensation that's been distributed, and as the stock has performed the
accounting impact on expense has gone up, that's roughly in the neighborhood of about $35 million in the aggregate.
And then there was one legal accrual put out related to an old investment position that was finally settled, which was
the third largest piece about $20 million. So those are the three big pieces for the expense increase.
You asked about the increase in DAC amortization in the life segment. If you take a look on page 41 of the Financial
Supplement, there's a footnote there, footnote seven that ties back to the – page 27, which is where you see the increase.
Basically you've got a trade-off in geography due to an unlocking related to our UL line and the deferred annuity
business in American General. Fee income increased about $58 million. While at the same time volatility of benefits
and claims incurred decreased another $21 million, and substantially all of that was offset by an increase in DAC
amortization related to that of roughly the same amount, about $86 million.
So it really tied into that unlocking on certain assumptions and it was really a change in geography. More fee income,
lower policyholder benefits to the positive and higher DAC amortization offsetting it.

Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Thanks. I'll just, Liz, I'll take the liberty of having a two part – one two part question if
that's okay.
<A - Liz Werner, Investor Relations>: Fine.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: The – and these both are dated. The holding company liquidity, I think your plan has been
$8.5 billion to $10 billion. I believe you raised north of $5 billion if I add up the credit facilities plus the debt in 4Q.
Can you just comment on where you stand there and what the mix would be in terms of the form of capital in terms of
getting to the plan going forward?
And then the second question I had is one AIGFP. I know there has been commentary that the unwind is coming to a
close. Can you talk a little bit about what does that practically mean and will we begin to see, is there a source of
earnings actually coming from this business its a sort of steady state form. Is there redundant capital when I consider
your ownership of your stake of Maiden Lane III, which I believe is being carried at $6 billion and eventually could
you get to that $6 billion? I'll stop there. Thanks.
<A - David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Okay, Tom. Thanks, Good
morning. I would point you to page 53 in the K. You're right, the $8.5 billion to $10 billion was what we had been
targeting as part of our third quarter filing in the Q and that was our objective and frankly we overachieved. As you'll
see on page 53, there was about $14.5 billion of cash and contingent credit capacity. We lay out the compound parts of
that. You'll see in the footnotes there we're using a piece of that for supplementing capital positions in certain of our
operating companies and again I would expect that we would maintain the credit facilities, the contingent capital
facilities and then that number will vary in the perhaps in the $10 billion to $12 billion range. But again that's our
current thinking on that.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: So you're over your initially stated goal right now?
<A - David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. What we do as part of what
we – as part of the recapitalization and part of our enhanced risk management, is we developed stress tests and put
ourselves through a series of stress tests to inform our views about where we would end up and what we would need to
do. And that was frankly part of the criteria to close out the recap. And we've achieved against those and part of the
reason for those stress tests is they give us a forward-looking view in terms of risk scenarios.
And then we'll adjust the level of liquidity and capital at the holding company, which is why I mentioned the
importance of having dividend capacity coming out of our operating companies as part of a – what I would call a
normal operating environment, normal relationship between a holding company and operating company.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Got it. And then on FP?
<A - David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We'll turn it over to Bill Dooley, why don't
you.
<A - William N. Dooley>: Yeah, Tom. Let me just do a – how we started the unwind of the portfolio. When we started
to unwind it back in the fall of '08, we looked at the overall positions and we decided to look at the most complex the
ones that had the most optionality to them and the most that could give us any type of a contingent liquidity risk on
those portfolios. So we went out and attacked them first. And at the same time we then tried to eliminate the various
books that they were in to get the books off the table. And then we went after and closed down certain of the companies
where they are located. So we did Japan and we did Hong Kong and to get out of the various regulatory environments.
So – and over that period of time, not only were we successful in de-risking the book and getting out of some of these
very complex trades, we also were able to create additional liquidity and at the same time we also had positive P&L

through that effort.
What we have done now recently is instead of looking at what the complex trades are in the portfolio because there are
very few of them, if any left today, we are now concentrating on what we want to keep in RemainCo. And because we
feel that there is value left in both the derivative book and the asset books that remain in FP, and we want to create that
value or generate that value over the period of the next couple of years.
Now in order to do that we had to take people from FP, historical FP employees, and we put them into AIG. So we've
taken asset people and moved them into AIG. We are taking certain of their liability people and moving them into AIG.
And on top of that we've moved their operations and risk group into AIG to continue running the risk and operating
systems of Financial Products. So there won't be any type of disconnection from how we've been managing it forward
like this.
At the same time, they're also here to enhance some of our own processes as well. So we're getting two-for-one on that
instance, okay. But the key risk that we've had in the business is the contingent liquidity risk and that as we disclosed in
the paper is somewhat just around $2 billion, somewhat below $2 billion. So when you look at the graphs and you see
the trade count down and the notional count go down and the volatility go down, they're all in keeping with what I've
just stated as far as de-risking the portfolio. The portfolio is still going to be continued to be de-risked along what I just
said, probably through the end of the year – through the end of the second quarter. And then at that point in time, the
RemainCo portfolio is where we expect emergence of profit and additional liquidity.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: So, Bill, if that's the case, will you guys start breaking this out as its own segment again?
Because I assume when you put it in corporate other runoff that this would be a continual unwind?
<A - William N. Dooley>: No, because the pieces that have already moved underneath the governance of AIG Inc. on
the assets. So we took the asset portfolio with the liabilities in FP and we placed that in with the MIP, which was an
AIG corporate portfolio and those being – portfolios are being managed jointly.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay.
<A - William N. Dooley>: The derivative portfolio will stay within a structure of FP because the derivative book can't
move around. But the derivative portfolio historically has been hedged and that's really where the volatility number
comes from. So – and we have the people that have hedged that portfolio successfully. So I'm not looking at that as any
risk at all. We're expecting some profitability, as I said to come out of that portfolio.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: And sorry, last follow-up. Will you be able to – so the Maiden Lane interest that is owned
by FP at least on the way it's presented by you is that something we should think about coming back to you over time
when that eventually is liquefied in terms of the structure?
<A - William N. Dooley>: It's – I don't believe the -
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It is not.
<A - William N. Dooley>: It's not in FP.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: The way it's reported right now, it's an asset in FP or at least the last time you showed a
balance sheet.
<A - David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Tom, it's David. It's reported in the
parent and other. I believe we've given some disclosure in terms of where it is but it's parent. It's not part of AIGFP per
se. It's on the "parent company balance sheet."
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay, yeah. The only reason -
<A - David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Tom, that's Maiden Lane III.

<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Right. Maiden Lane III, my comment was that last time you showed a balance sheet for FP
that was an asset on it.
<A - David L. Herzog, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President>: Yeah. That was part of the parent
company. I don't believe that was the FP balance sheet standalone.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay. I think it was, but we can follow-up off-line.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Let's do it off-line.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Thanks.
Robert H. Benmosche, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. I think that covers it pretty much today. I wanted to just follow-up with what Bill just said, and that is that FP
today really represents to all of us a lot, lot more upside than downside. It's very well managed and very well controlled
as is risk overall in the company. So we have clearly strengthened risk management over the last 1.5 years and continue
to strengthen.
So as a group we're really looking at all of our risk and making sure as David said we have sufficient liquidity, CMAs
and so on between the businesses to make sure money is moving appropriately. Our primary goal is to make sure the
insurance companies continue to be well rated and highly rated and that's how we continue to add customers and retain
customers going forward. So we're in pretty good shape.
I appreciate all of you taking the time this morning and this is the first of many calls we'll have on a go forward basis.
Any of you have any other issues, give us a buzz. Liz?
Liz Werner, Investor Relations
Yeah, operator to everyone who is still on the line, we will certainly get back to everyone who is in queue and answer
all your questions. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have more. And thank you all for joining us this morning.
