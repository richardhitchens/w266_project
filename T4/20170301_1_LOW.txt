Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's.
I'm pleased that we delivered a strong quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.1%, exceeding our expectations. Our
comp growth was driven by a 4% increase in comp average ticket and a 1.1% increase in comp transactions. Our U.S.
business achieved 5.1% comp for the quarter, with positive comps in all 14 regions. During the quarter, we delivered
positive comps in 12 of 13 product categories.
We drove strong holiday performance with our Winter Wonderland Experience, as well as compelling offers in
Appliances and Tools. A favorable macro backdrop, our strength in omni-channel retailing and our project expertise
drove demand across the quarter, with interior category outperformance in Kitchens, Appliances and Rough Plumbing
& Electrical and Outdoor strength in Lawn & Garden and Lumber & Building Materials.
Our emphasis on providing better omni-channel experiences positions us well for continued success, enabling us to
better connect with customers and provide the advice and assistance they count on when completing their home
improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in-store, online, in their home or through our contact centers.
We continue to see strength in our project specialist interiors program with strong double-digit comp growth this
quarter, and we posted 25% comp growth on Lowes.com, driven by robust growth in both transactions and ticket
following our website redesign in Q2. This is a testament to the growing strength of our omni-channel platform.
Pro customer sales were robust with another quarter of comp growth well above the company average. We are proud of
our success with Pro customer and continue to make investments to expand our capabilities to better serve this
important customer. We also drove continued strong performance in international markets, with double digit comps in
Mexico and mid-single digit comps in Canada in local currency. We're pleased with the progress and early success on
the integration of RONA, including the execution of our e-commerce strategy, rollout of Appliances and store
conversions, and remain excited about this compelling opportunity to bring together Lowe's global scale and resources
with RONA's local expertise.
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.86, a 46% increase compared to last year's fourth quarter
adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the
quarter, we repurchased $551 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $306 million in dividends.
Turning to full year fiscal 2016 results, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.2%, with all regions and product
categories achieving positive comps. Sales growth, combined with our sharp focus on improving profitability, led to a
21% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results demonstrate the strong
foundation we are building to enhance the value we provide to customers and further differentiate Lowe's in the
marketplace.
Along with improved operating results, we made meaningful progress this year expanding our customer reach and
advancing our omni-channel capabilities, as evidenced by the rollout of our interior project specialists across all U.S.
stores, our successful redesign of Lowes.com, strengthening our market position in Canada with the acquisition of
RONA, and deepening and broadening our relationship with the Pro customer.
We've entered 2017 from a position of strength, as macroeconomic fundamentals remain favorable and are aligned for
another solid year of home improvement industry growth. The industry is poised to grow its share of wallet as a percent
of overall consumer spending and should benefit from strong consumer balance sheets and debt service ratios near
record lows, as well as continued job gains and income growth. Credit uses continues to improve, supplementing the
spending power generated by stronger incomes.
We expect housing in 2017 to remain a bright spot. Rising home prices should continue to encourage homeowners to
engage in more discretionary projects in addition to ongoing maintenance and repair spending. Improving incomes and
household financial conditions should continue to be a catalyst for household formation, which will help sustain
homebuying and related spending.
Expected growth in the home improvement market is further supporting of the results of our fourth quarter Consumer
Sentiment Survey which revealed that post-election homeowners have an increasingly favorable view of the national

economy and their personal financial situation, and we believe this trend will continue, as almost half of the
homeowners we surveyed indicated that they are very likely to begin a home improvement project in the next six
months. And more than half of homeowners believe that home values are rising and will continue to increase. In 2017,
we look to build upon our strong foundation to better serve the needs of rapidly changing customer and capitalize on a
favorable macro backdrop.
As discussed in our December Analyst & Investor Conference, we're focused on three strategic pillars to drive value for
customers and shareholders. First, we're dedicated to expanding our home improvement reach and ultimately serving
more customers, DIY, DIFM, and the Pro more effectively. And we will further differentiate ourselves by establishing
market leadership for home improvement project solutions.
Second, we're developing capabilities to anticipate and support customers' changing needs. We're evolving our business
to further drive trust and loyalty by empowering customers at every critical moment of their project journey that
includes advancing our customer capabilities through our omni-channel assets. And finally, we are committed to
generating long-term profitable growth and substantial returns for shareholders.
Across the enterprise, we are actively seeking to enhance our operating discipline and focus and make productivity a
core strength. This laser-focus on improving productivity will not detract from our ongoing efforts to deliver
customer-centric omni-channel experiences, rather we see these efforts as complementary, and together, will further
strengthen our relevance and allow for investment in future capabilities to grow the business and better connect with
customers.
These efforts give us confidence in our business outlook for 2017. Bob will share those details in a few minutes. I
would like to express my appreciation to our employees for their unwavering commitment to anticipating and serving
customers' evolving needs. We're proud of our employees and their tireless effort to help customers love where they
live. Our employees fuel our success and have been instrumental in enabling our transformation to a customer-centric
omni-channel home improvement company.
Before I close, I would like to take a moment to personally thank Bob for his distinguished service and his many
contributions over the past 17 years, including 14 years as our CFO. During his tenure, Bob's financial discipline and
leadership have played an invaluable role in our growth and transformation to an omni-channel home improvement
company while at the same time delivering exceptional returns to our shareholders. We congratulate Bob on his
retirement.
We look forward to a smooth transition, as Marshall Croom, a 20-year Lowe's veteran with over 30 years of deep
financial and operational experience transitions to his new role as our CFO. Marshall's extensive experience and
intimate knowledge of our business, coupled with his proven leadership, positions us well for future success.
Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.
Michael P. McDermott
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert shared with you, we delivered a strong quarter, with positive
comps across all regions and 12 of 13 product categories, growth driven by both average ticket and transactions.
We leveraged our omni-channel platform, project expertise, customer experience design capabilities and enhanced
digital marketing to deliver strong holiday performance. Our Winter Wonderland experience provided an inspirational
holiday showroom where customers could see everything from artificial trees and poinsettias to indoor and outdoor
decorations, providing cohesive decorating solutions for the holidays.
We connected our compelling in-store display with digital assets leveraging Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram and
YouTube, as well as a seamless shopping experience on Lowes.com. In addition to evolving our holiday experience,
we also continued to innovate with our product assortment and exclusives, such as our Disney light bay. The customer
response to our Winter Wonderland experience was strong driving comp sales increase of 8%.

We also drove strong comps through our holiday events, with Black Friday representing our largest sales day in
company history, both in-store and online. We expanded our events, capitalizing on customer excitement for the season
with compelling offers and tools, holiday décor and appliances. Throughout the quarter, we captured project demand,
leveraging our in-store experiences in-home selling program, strong value proposition, enhanced online selling tools
and improved marketing speed from our digital capabilities, driving gains in multiple categories.
We recorded above-average comps in Appliances, Lawn & Garden, Kitchens, Lumber & Building Materials and Rough
Plumbing & Electrical. We saw broad-based strength in both indoor and outdoor projects. We drove high-single digit
comps in Appliances leveraging our investments in customer experience both in-store and online.
In-store, our appliance suites, showcasing coordinated appliances allow customers to visualize how their appliance
purchase will look in their refreshed or remodeled kitchen. Online, we have enhanced the customer experience and
presentation, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product
presentation like 360 degree views, and simplified product groupings to make it easy for customers to select their
products. Our focus on advancing the customer experience through our omni-channel assets, together with leading
brands, breath of assortment, competitive pricing, knowledgeable sales specialists, as well as delivery and haul-away
services, drove our share gains in Appliances.
This quarter, we also delivered high-single digit comps in Kitchens, led by strength in cabinets and countertops through
a combination of targeted promotions, our investments in project specialists who meet customers in their homes, and
our strategy of focusing the entire kitchen project. In order to sell the complete kitchen, we display our projects,
including cabinets and countertops, immediately adjacent to our appliance offering. We're leveraging our customer
experience design capabilities to create store sets and inspire customers to envision a variety of project possibilities,
such as a series of kitchen vignettes to show all the elements of a complex installation like a kitchen remodel pulled
together into a beautiful finished project. We're using our stores as an additional source of inspiration while making the
buying process for projects simpler and more intuitive.
We also saw strength in outdoor project categories. We achieved high-single digit comps in Lawn & Garden as
customers in the South and West took advantage of warmer weather early in the quarter to complete lawn and garden
projects. And we also achieved strong comps in Lumber & Building Materials driven by continued demand related to
recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew and the Louisiana flooding, and not to mention the strong performance with
our Pro customer.
As customers engage in both indoor and outdoor projects, we leveraged our omni-channel capabilities to help them
throughout their project journey. We drove 25% comp growth on Lowes.com, as well as above-average comp growth
from our in-home sales program. Our interior and exterior project specialists represent another important element of
our omni-channel strategy as they serve the do-it-for-me customer who needs a bit more help navigating their project
while we meet them in their homes to design, plan, pull together products across multiple categories and manage their
project to completion.
We're also deepening and broadening our relationship with the Pro customer, driving comps well above the company
average with our outstanding portfolio of brands, our strong value proposition through our 5 Ways to Save, as well as
our omni-channel offering through our growing ProServices team and LowesForPros.com.
We continue to evolve our capabilities to connect with the Pro across channels, and we are seeing the Pro engage more
in the channels that best fit their unique needs, with events online with LowesForPros.com, at the market level with our
Account Executive ProServices specialists or at our stores with our dedicated in-store ProServices teams.
Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair
and operations or MRO customers, further solidifying our relationship and targeting property management companies
as they make more trips and shop more categories across our platform.
We've greatly improved our Pro offering with key brand introductions and investments and the breadth of assortment to
ensure that Pro customers have the right selection of products ultimately serving as a one-stop shop, a place where Pros
can purchase all the products they need to complete their project and get back to the job site quickly.

Our 15% comp in pneumatics this quarter, driven by our home channel exclusives with Hitachi and Bostitch, the top
two brands in pneumatics, is a testament to the power of our successful brand partnerships. We're also reconnecting
Pros who have not recently purchased at Lowe's to show them what's changed in our stores and online using targeted
marketing, including expanded digital capabilities, as well as exclusive Pro offers to drive awareness and generate new
business.
We've also enhanced our Buy in Bulk program with new signage in-store, and new digital focus on LowesForPros.com
and marketing campaigns designed to drive awareness of the great values we provide this customer.
During the quarter, we also demonstrated the strength and flexibility of our supply chain, as we were faced with a
variety of weather conditions ranging from unseasonably warm temperatures to severe winter storms. We're proud to
say that we were able to serve customers regardless of unpredictable weather.
Our supply chain demonstrated agility and flexibility, holding inventory centrally, then working to efficiently move
product to areas of heightened demand to meet customers' needs, reaching areas in the path of storms within hours of
impact. We continue to focus on opportunities to drive further efficiencies in our supply chain as well.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we also continue to focus on making productivity a core strength
while investing in the areas that matter most to customers. The latter portion of the quarter, we rolled out a new store
staffing model across all U.S. Lowe's home improvement stores to ensure that we are optimally prepared for the
upcoming spring selling season.
The changes streamlining our management structure provide better leadership and accountability to drive improved
customer experiences. We're also expanding our central production offices, moving scheduling of installation services
from a store level activity to a more efficient centralized approach in our call centers, enhancing consistency and
proficiency of communication and delivering a better customer experience.
We're pleased with our fourth quarter results and the progress we're continuing to make on our initiatives to drive top
line growth, enhance our productivity and profitability and position Lowe's for the future.
Turning our attention to the first quarter, as spring approaches, we're excited about our omni-channel kitchen and bath
and outdoor refresh events, which offer unique customer touch points, compelling content and superior values. Our
events coordinate engaging experience for customers designed to capitalize on their excitement for the season,
including our refreshed seasonal pad and new online patio experience that showcases curated collections and the latest
in-style trends. And our new grill display featuring Weber Genesis and Char-Broil Grill innovations.
We'll leverage the national launch of our in-home selling program during our kitchen and bath event and all year long
to help customers bring their project aspirations to life. We're also excited about our upcoming programs delivering
great values both in-store and online at LowesForPros.com.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull, Jr.
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $15.8 billion, an increase of 19.2%. Total
customer transactions grew 15.1% and total average ticket increased 3.6% to $69.58. The transaction growth was aided
by both the 53rd week and RONA. The extra week in the period added roughly $950 million in sales, contributing
7.1% to sales growth.
RONA sales were approximately $825 million or 6.2% of sales growth. Comp sales were 5.1%, driven by an average
ticket increase of 4% and transaction growth of 1.1%. The comp sales calculation included 14 weeks this year versus
the comparable 14-week period. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 4.7% in November, 6.3% in December and
4.2% in January.

We estimate that weather positively impacted comp sales in the quarter by approximately 100 basis points. The
majority of this came from serving customers in storm-impacted areas in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew and the
flooding in Louisiana. Lastly, new stores drove 80 basis points of growth.
For the year, total sales were $65 billion, an increase of 10.1% driven by comp sales of 4.2%, RONA contributing
3.8%, the 53rd week adding 1.6% and new stores.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.1% of sales which decreased 25 basis points from Q4 last year. Gross
margin was negatively impacted by RONA due to both purchase accounting adjustments and the mix of business. In
the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 25 basis points.
SG&A for the quarter was 23.99% of sales, which leveraged 455 basis points. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded
a $530 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the decision to exit our Australian joint venture. This
year-over-year comparison drove 403 basis points of expense leverage.
In Q4 2016, we experienced 59 basis points of benefits leverage primarily related to incentive comp as we had lower
attainment levels relative to last year. We also experienced leverage in store environment, store payroll and many other
lines as a result of the strong sales growth in the quarter.
Somewhat offsetting these items were severance-related costs for organizational changes that were part of our
comprehensive effort to focus and prioritize resources. The changes resulted in a charge of $84 million which caused
53 basis points of deleverage.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $374 million, which was 2.37% of sales and leveraged 44 basis
points. Earnings before interest and taxes or operating income increased 474 basis points to 8.05% of sales. For Q4, we
estimate that the 53rd week aided EBIT are roughly 30 basis points. The severance-related costs hurt EBIT by 53 basis
points in the quarter. The RONA impact associated with purchase accounting adjustments, the mix of business, and
integration costs negatively impacted EBIT by 36 basis points in the quarter.
For the quarter, interest expense was $159 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.3%. The higher rate
was driven by a tax charge primarily related to final Internal Revenue Code Section 987 regulations which triggered the
reversal of deferred tax assets associated with cumulative currency translation adjustments for our international
operations.
Earnings per share was $0.74 for the quarter, including approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week. There were a number
of discrete items not in our business outlook that impacted EPS for the quarter. First, the charge associated with
severance-related costs hurt EPS by approximately $0.06. Next, the impact of the new tax regulation, noted a moment
ago, reduced earnings per share by $0.04. Lastly, there was a $0.02 negative impact associated with the takeout of
RONA's preferred shares in the quarter which reduced net earnings allocable to common shareholders in the EPS
calculation.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, which was 45.8% higher than Q4 2015's adjusted $0.59. For 2016, adjusted
earnings per share of $3.99 were up 21.3% versus 2015. The extra week in 2016 aided EPS growth by 250 basis points.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was
$558 million. Inventory at nearly $10.5 billion increased $1 billion or 10.6% versus the end of last year, just over 60%
of the increase related to the addition of RONA with the balance to support strong sales growth. Inventory turnover was
4.05, up 13 basis points to last year. Asset turnover increased 5 basis points to 1.85.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $6.7 billion represents a $1 billion or 18.1%
increase over Q4 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms of improvement as well as the addition
of RONA. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.21 times. Return on invested capital
was 15.8%. The impact of the charges hurt ROIC by 154 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, annual cash – annual operating cash flow was $5.6 billion, capital
expenditures were $1.2 billion resulting in free cash flow of over $4.4 billion, which was up 24% to last year.

In November, we entered into a $190 million accelerated share repurchase agreement which settled in the quarter for
2.6 million shares. We also repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $361 million through the open market. In
total, we repurchased $551 million of stock in the quarter and $3.5 billion for the year.
In January, our board of directors authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. The new program has no
expiration date and when combined with our prior share repurchase program, we have approximately $5.1 billion
remaining authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. In 2017, we expect total sales
increase of approximately 5%. The sales increase is driven by a number of factors. First, we are forecasting a comp
sales increase of approximately 3.5%. Second, sales growth will be higher for the first five months until we anniversary
the RONA acquisition, which drives about 2% growth. Also, we plan to open 35 stores which adds approximately 1%.
However, total sales growth will be reduced by roughly 1.5% related to the comparison of 52 weeks in 2017 versus 53
weeks in 2016.
On an adjusted basis, we are anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 50 basis points, driven entirely by expense
leverage. For 2017, we expect expenses to grow at roughly 60% of sales growth. Regarding EBIT, a full year of RONA
results versus roughly seven months last year will pressure EBIT by an estimated 15 basis points to 20 basis points for
2017.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 37.8%. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.64,
which represents a 16.3% increase over 2016's adjusted EPS. On a 52 versus 52-week basis, EPS growth will be 240
basis points higher. In comparing our guidance model to First Call estimates, the quarterly earnings per share estimates
look fine, but there are a couple items I'd like to address related to the complexion of Q1.
There's a calendar week shift as a result of 2016's 53rd week. This year's first quarter will include one less week of
winter and one more week of spring than last year. While this has no impact on comp sales, it does benefit first quarter
total sales by approximately $500 million.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the mix of RONA's business will impact EBIT until we anniversary the acquisition in
the second quarter. The estimated negative impact to the first quarter EBIT is approximately 60 basis points.
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.9 billion, and capital expenditures of
approximately $1.4 billion. This results in an estimated free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion for 2017. Our
guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2017.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. A question for Bob Hull, and wish you well, Bob. So, it's
something I asked at the Investor Day, thinking about the flow-through for 2017. I think the guidance was somewhere
around 25 basis points for every point of comp above 1. I think – the question then is the same now, what's driving it? I
think it implies slightly higher incremental margins than what the business has been delivering. And so what's
changing, and any other color on that? Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: Thanks, Simeon. So as we look at the outlook for 2017, on an adjusted basis, we're looking
at 50 basis points of EBIT expansion. I commented that the impact of the full year RONA results versus seven months
in 2016 pressures us by 15 basis points to 20 basis points. So if you take the midpoint of that, call it, 67 basis points,

with a 3.5% comp, the flow-through per point of comp above 1 is about 27 basis points. So, we feel good about that. As
I indicated, we're expecting flattish gross margin for the year with all of that increase coming from expense leverage.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow-up, more of a near-term question, and no secret that Feb and
March are tough compares. Seems like the business has good momentum through January. I know you don't normally
comment on it. Curious if you have any thoughts, and I don't think tax returns are normally a factor for this segment, so
just curious on sort of what you're seeing currently in the business.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: Yeah. So, Simeon, Q1's off to a great start. We're ahead of plan. We're really excited about
2017.

Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, guys. I had a question kind of around the marketing plans for 2017. I mean, I'm not sure
you'll divulge too much, but just remind us. I think marketing was kind of an issue last year, at least during the middle
part of the year. How are you planning it to do that differently as we look through 2017? That's my first question.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Peter, this is Mike McDermott. Look, we're excited to welcome Jocelyn Wong to the
expanded role of Chief Marketing Officer. She's going to have responsibilities in 2017 for customer experience design,
content strategy and development, customer relationship management and advertising and media across all of our U.S.
home improvement businesses. So we think we've got the right collection of areas to focus on, and I'm confident that
she and the team will continue to enhance our efforts to drive a more integrated and omni-channel approach,
recognizing that we have a number of touch points to leverage with our customers to drive traffic.
So you'll see us be very focused on connecting with customers with more personalized messages really tailored to meet
their specific needs, and we'll continue to reach out and leverage the advancements we've made in our assortment and
our offering with the Pro customer. So we've got a lot of activity going on in marketing. I feel very, very good about
our new campaign, and the team's really poised for success in 2017.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. And then maybe one for Bob. The hurricane and the flooding
impact, do you expect that to continue, Bob, through 2017 or so? Anything that you need to call out on that front?
Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: So, Pete, we do expect some benefit in 2017. We do, however, expect that to wane as the
year progresses, especially as we get closer to the activity in the second half of 2016 (sic) [2017].
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question will come from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. And Bob Hull, best of luck to you going forward. I know that
at your Analyst Conference in December you spoke about the effort to align costs, and that you had followed a difficult
third quarter on the expense line. I guess there have been two rounds of activity that we've essentially read about, one
relating to some restructuring the store, a second more recently relating to some restructuring at headquarters. If you
could just help frame some of that activity in the context of the plan that you've set out in December, particularly with

regard to how roles are changing in the stores and around the organization, how labor dollars are being reallocated and
then how that flows into your financial outlook? Thank you so much.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, Matt. It's Robert Niblock. I'll start. As you're aware, we have announced some
staffing changes over the last 30 days or so, both in the store and at the corporate office here. And as we see what's
rapid shift that's changing in our customer expectations and what they expect of retailers, our whole movement to be a
customer-centric omni-channel home improvement company really dictated that we needed to allocate our resources
differently so that we could better meet the needs of customers. It's something we have to continually do which is to
make sure we have our resources in the right places and to continue to meet their needs.
From a store standpoint, I think our new staffing model helps ensure us that we're kind of optimally prepared hopefully
for the upcoming spring selling season. The changes we've made in the store we think will really improve our
leadership capabilities with an enhanced focus on training and really empowering our associates to lever on improved
experience for the customers. We're really pleased with the receptivity we've seen and getting that done ahead of the
spring selling season.
Here at the corporate office, the changes we just made to corporate headquarters are really designed to create more
agile, efficient and customer-focused operating structure we needed. As we continue to migrate from being a single
channel retailer to an omni-channel home improvement company, we really needed to step back and make sure that we
have our resources aligned in the proper way so we can best take advantage of the opportunity that we see in front of
us. And as we've talked for many quarters here, online, in-home, and contact centers, those other things that are part of
our omni-channel strategy are where seeing the highest growth. And we wanted to make sure we had our resources
aligned behind that. So we're excited about it. It's always tough when you make those changes and impact people's
lives, but I think it's the thing that is the right thing to do to continue to move us forward and capitalize on the
opportunity we see ahead of us.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Matt related to the impact to our guidance provided at the Analyst Conference, they
were incorporated in the outlook that we shared at that time.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and best of luck, Bob. It's been a pleasure all
these years. I wanted to talk about the sort of outlook that you've put out in December, specifically related to 2017.
There's this big pause in the industry over the summer, but things have accelerated strongly. So two parts to the
question. In retrospect, what do you think drove that pause? And then thinking about the – what you were looking at
when you put your Analyst Day outlook, did that affect your outlook? In other words, it doesn't appear like the back –
it appears the backdrop has actually accelerated since then. So do you think that your outlook could prove conservative
in that regard? I guess better asked, did that summer pause actually impact how you put out forward guidance?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: Chris, we look at a number of factors, macroeconomic factors, our ongoing performance,
input from vendor partners and other sources to try to understand what's going on with the consumer, industry demand
drivers, et cetera. So, certainly, as we came out of third quarter and saw trends in fourth quarter leading up to the
December meeting, we're certainly aware of our performance. Also mindful of actions we were taking to drive
consumer demand to drive productivity et cetera. So what I would say is, we talk about our outlook for the year is, I
feel really comfortable about our opportunity to hit the $4.64 for the year. It's going to happen differently than we
planned it, but as far as getting to EPS, I think there's confidence with the team that that figure is more than achievable.

<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: So I guess it's not that that's from a top line perspective that summer pause
really impacted putting out the 3.5% comp guide?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: No real impact, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. And then one follow-up. Can you share with us, I'm assuming you're
going to report comparable weeks – same-store sales for comparable weeks, can you share with us what the comparable
same-store sales would have been based on the week shift in 2016?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: So our comparable sales calculation does use the comparable weeks. So weeks 53 of 2016
comped over week one of 2016, which is the comparable week for the period, which is consistent with how we reported
comps the prior three 53-week year since I've been CFO.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. So there's no – we can look at what you reported as comps last year as
the right comparable when we're putting our estimates together?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: The 14-week period was compared against the comparable 14-week period. So, yes, the
comps as reported are what they are.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood. I can follow up. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. And, Bob, best of luck. Robert, I
wanted to ask about the increasing focus on productivity. Your SG&A per foot stands around $70. There's obviously a
lot of moving pieces in there, but what do you see as the optimal level of SG&A per square foot? Is there a way to size
the aggregate opportunity from your productivity measures? And how do you harvest that opportunity on enhancing the
culture to ensure that you have the necessary level of in-store execution?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, Michael, I don't think we really measure it that way. What I can tell you is that, as
we've gone through and looked at, as I said earlier, the evolution, as we've gone from a single channel retailer to an
omni-channel home improvement company, we certainly have made changes along the way in the way that we have
reallocated resources.
But when you look at the continual shift that you see taking place in the customer and the way that they want to interact
with us, you realize that we needed to continue to evolve. So if you think about it, you're sitting back with an
organizational structure today that has evolved over time, not the one that you would have designed from scratch if you
were starting out as an omni-channel company.
So as we continue to see that evolution, we said we really need to step back and say, okay, where do resources need to
be allocated at the corporate office. We took out some spans and layers to make us a more agile, nimble organization
from a corporate office standpoint so that hopefully we can better respond to opportunities, better respond to the stores
and our other channels after they've taken care of the customer on a daily basis.
And then also did some hard look at our management structure in the store to say how can we ensure that we're
organized in a right way to make sure that from a leadership standpoint we are leading people in a way that's going to
provide a better experience. So it's really more driven from that standpoint, we look at productivity more as, how do we
take dollars and reinvest them in the areas that will drive better performance? So, yeah, there was obviously – through
that process there's a cost savings impact as well, but it's also if we get them aligned appropriately then we drive better
performance which leads to productivity loop.

<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And my follow-up question is on the average comp ticket growth during the
quarter up 400 basis points driven by the 9% increase in the transactions above $500. Presumably that was helped by
the growth – the above-average growth in Appliances and Kitchen. Was there something from an execution standpoint
that you did better that contributed to the growth, or do you think that it was just growth from the marketplace?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: So, you're right. It was strength of our Kitchen and Appliance business in the quarter,
Michael, that drove that. Also, the above-average Pro performance is a driver for growth in average ticket.
Certainly, as we take a look at our own execution, we strive to be better every day as the items that Mike described in
his comments were all items of focus for the quarter to allow us to take advantage of demand and serve customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Iannarone>: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Rob Iannarone on for Scot. So just two
quick ones. Given some of the volatility you guys have experienced in the top line over the course of the year, what
gives you confidence in your comp outlook of 3.5% for the year? And have you seen any changes to trend in the
Northeast. Specifically I think the Pro was a little bit weaker last quarter?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, this is Robert. We did see continued improvement in the North and our performance
there. So I think certainly some of the actions we see that the team has taken to better resonate with the customer has
certainly started to take traction, so we're pleased with the improvement and performance that we saw there.
As we look at 2017, we look at – if you look at whether it's the underlying macro fundamentals that are out there, still
seeing a very healthy housing market, whether it's from a turnover standpoint, whether it's from an appreciation
standpoint on housing, incomes continuing to rise as we spoke about, employment continuing to improve, all of those
things I think set up home improvement to continue to gain share as a percentage of share of wallet in 2017. We've seen
that trend for the past few years, and I think it sets us up well for this year.
And then on top of that, we've actually on top – behind our post-election, we've actually seen from our Consumer
Sentiment Survey a really strong increase in homeowners' intention to invest in their home and start a project over the
next six months as we've talked about. So as we look at just the underlying factors, some of the momentum that we saw
coming out of our quarterly Consumer Sentiment Survey, it sets us up that – that we think that it sets us up well that a
3.5% comp should be achievable as we look out to 2017.
<Q - Robert Iannarone>: Thanks for that. And just one follow-up. Can you, guys, give us any idea of what the
productivity and cost savings are on more of a run rate basis from some of the recent changes you made last quarter and
you've talked about incurring this quarter?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: So as we talked about in addressing Matt's question, the productivity savings were
contemplated in the model we've put together at December Analyst Conference and consistent as the outlook today.
What I would say is, if you think about prior EBIT expansion, prior flow-through expectations, there is a component of
gross margin in there. We've taken that out, and the entirety of the flow-through in EBIT expansion is driven by
expense leverage. So it's embedded in our SG&A outlook for the year going forward.
<Q - Robert Iannarone>: Great. Thanks for that, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks. First, congrats, Bob, and thanks for all the help over the years. And...
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: Thanks, Greg.
<Q - Greg Melich>: And, Marshall, welcome back to the jungle.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Thank you, Greg.
<Q - Greg Melich>: That's the only way I can put it. So I have two questions. One is, what was commodity inflation in
the fourth quarter? And if you look at your guidance for this year, what have you factored in? And then I have a follow
up on the – on Pro and ticket.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: So, in the fourth quarter, Greg, we actually had modest deflation. We had building material
deflation of 25 basis points driven by roofing installation which offset the, call it, 15 basis points of inflation in lumber.
For 2017, there's only very modest inflation contemplated for the year.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Modest would be something less than 20 bps or 30 bps?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: Less than 20.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay. And on ticket, I saw that the – it was up 9% for the larger tickets. Could you help us
understand a little bit more as to how much of that would have been, say, driven by Appliances versus really building
the Pro basket and driving Pro? Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: Greg, we really don't have the composition of that 9% growth in front of me. It is all of the
above, right? It is the strength of the performance of those categories, and the tactics that we've been taking over the
number of years to better serve Pro customers that are driving the 9% in growth.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Right. I guess then a follow up on Pro, just do you have a credit penetration number for private
label cards?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: The private label card penetration was 28.7%, up about 20 basis points versus the same
period last year.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. Thanks. Good luck, everyone.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. Two things. Curious, on one, the 35 store opens, I understand the emphasis and
the opportunity with omni-channel. But the 35 number, can you sort of remind us what you are spending and the focus
and the expected payback from that? And then secondly, would love to understand what you felt you did differently in
Appliances which underperformed in 3Q and was a much stronger performer in 4Q?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: I'll take the first part, I'll let Mike address the second part. So as we think about the 35 store
openings, that's roughly nine U.S. big box stores, 10 stores in Canada, a few in Mexico, and 14 Orchard locations. So
they are varying formats and varying geographies. As we think about the spend for new stores, that is roughly $400
million in 2017. As we think about return hurdles, we've got risk-adjusted return hurdles for all of our investments,

including real estate. We do expect a portfolio of stores to more than exceed those hurdles going forward.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Eric, this is Mike McDermott. On the product side of Appliances, obviously, the fourth
quarter is a significantly promotional quarter. We made some adjustments in both our traditional and digital advertising
approach to make sure that we were engaging customers in an exciting way. We continue to see benefit from our
Lowes.com re-platform that we did mid-2016. And certainly our associates in the store are providing the right level of
experience for our customers has been great. Incredible vendor partnerships, great values, innovative products and I –
just incredible performance by our supply chain team that made sure that we were in stock in as critical season, really
driving significantly positive performance in the laundry business as a result of some of those buys, and the ability to
move that inventory where it was needed.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay. And then, if I could just add one more. There was a reference earlier on incentive comp,
I'm curious in terms of what happened with store-level incentive comp in 4Q and what the expectations and strategy is
in that area moving forward?
<A - Robert F. Hull, Jr.>: So, Eric, if you recall, we had fairly substantial deleverage in the fourth quarter of last year
based on the strength of performance which really impacted our annual accruals. So we had significant deleverage Q4
last year which, as we planned 2016, that was expected. While we had really good performance this year, it didn't
compare to what we saw last year, therefore the rate of change was less giving rise to expense leverage in incentive
comp area Q4 2016. Going forward, we've got a variety of plan that incent the store management and store associates
to serve customers every day to ensure we help meet their needs, omni needs going forward. So no real change in how
we're thinking about incenting the folks that are on the front line interfacing with our customers every day.
