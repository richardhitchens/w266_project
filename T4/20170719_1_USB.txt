I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start off by discussing a few
highlights from our second quarter earnings results. Terry will then fill in some details, and also provide you with
forward-looking guidance. After that, we'll take your questions.
I'll start on slide 3 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion, or $0.85 per
diluted share. You'll see on this slide that our balance sheet is strong and growing. Sequential loan growth came in at
the high end of our guidance range at 0.9%. As expected, C&I loan growth picked up after a sluggish start to the year
and gained momentum towards the end of the second quarter. Based on current trends, we expect that by the third
quarter total loan growth will be back to the 1% to 1.5% range we think of as more normalized.
Credit quality remains excellent, and we feel good about the risk profile of the loan portfolio. Our net charge-off ratio
was stable in the second quarter and our non-performing asset ratio improved on both a linked quarter and
year-over-year basis.
Shifting to capital management. Our book value per share ended the quarter at $25.55, which was up 4.8% from a year
ago. Our common equity tier 1 ratio estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach was 9.3% at
06/30, a level which is sufficient to support growth, effectively managed through periods of economic stress, and return
capital to our shareholders. In June, the Federal Reserve Bank notified us that they did not object to our capital plan
submitted during the CCAR process. We subsequently announced a dividend increase of 7.1% and a new share
repurchase program for the year.
Now let me touch on our key performance ratios. If you turn to slide 4, our return on average assets for the second
quarter was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.2%. We're proud of our
industry-leading profitability metrics, but we're always striving to improve. Although consistently best-in-class, our
efficiency ratio has been at the higher end of its historical range in the past few quarters, primarily reflecting increased
personnel and technology costs related to the regulatory compliance programs. However, we are nearing the end of the
build-out of these programs and believe the growth rates of these costs will begin to moderate. We expect compliance
costs to grow at a pace more in line with the company's core expense base in late 2017 and into 2018.
When we look out to the remainder of the year, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in both the third and
fourth quarters of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We further expect that the year-over-year noninterest expense growth
will be in line with our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. We believe that our strong balance sheet, diversified
revenue mix, and our focus on expense management, combined with the dissipation of some significant expense
headwinds provides momentum for the second half of this year and into 2018.
Let me stop there and turn it over to Terry.
Terrance R. Dolan
Thank you, Andy. If you turn to slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow-up with the discussion of
second quarter earnings trends.
In the second quarter, average loans increased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.4% from a year ago.
Commercial loan growth rebounded from the first quarter, increasing 2.0% sequentially. Line utilization has not
increased materially; however, deal activity has strengthened and we continue to gain market share. As Andy
mentioned, large corporate lending developed momentum in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, throughout the
quarter we continued to see strong growth in middle market lending across many geographies.

Commercial real estate lending reflects our prudent approach to certain CRE segments, such as multi-family and retail,
given current market conditions. We did have opportunities for growth in construction lending; however, we remain
cautious in commercial mortgage markets, where the competitive environment has created unfavorable conditions from
a risk and return standpoint. In addition, customers continue to refinance commercial mortgages in the capital markets,
given the rising rate environment and opportunity to extend maturities.
We had particularly strong growth in retail leasing this quarter, up 11.0% linked quarter. We are both a prime lender
and a lessor in the auto segment, and our well-established market position, full product offering, and a strong dealer
relationships have provided strong growth in both lending and leasing. We have made significant investment in this
business over the past few years, which is coming to fruition in the form of increased market penetration with both
dealers and manufacturers. We expect growth will remain healthy for the next few quarters as we continue to penetrate
this market.
I want to emphasize that leasing growth is not coming at the expense of increased risk. If you look at slide 6, credit
metrics remain very stable in our retail leasing portfolio. We have not changed our underwriting in this business and are
not enhancing residual values. I would also highlight that in the second quarter, the weighted average FICO score on
originations for our auto leases was 782.
Turning to slide 7, total average deposits increased 0.8% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and 7.7% on a
year-over-year basis. Following the June interest rate hike, our total interest-bearing deposit beta is in the mid-20%
range. As future rate hikes occur, we would expect the beta will gradually trend toward 50% level.
On slide 8 you will see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average
loans was 49 basis points in the second quarter and non-performing assets declined by 9.8% on a linked quarter basis.
I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of second quarter results versus comparable periods.
Second quarter net income of $1.5 billion was up 1.8% compared with the first quarter, but was down 1.4% versus the
second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2016 included two notable items: a $180 million Visa
Europe gain in noninterest income and a $150 million noninterest expense related to interest accruals and a charitable
contribution. Excluding these items, net income increased slightly year-over-year. I will exclude the impact of these
notable items when I discuss revenue and expense comparison versus the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to slide 10, revenue totaled a record $5.5 billion, up 3.1% on a linked quarter basis and 4.2% higher compared
with the same quarter a year ago.
Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.0 billion in the second quarter, up
2.4% compared with the first quarter and 5.9% higher than the second quarter of 2016. Comparisons in both quarters
benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates.
In the second quarter, the net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.04%, in line with our guidance. The increase
was primarily driven by rising interest rates, partially offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and higher cash
balances, which increased to meet certain regulatory expectations related to liquidity. We do not expect average cash
balances to increase meaningfully from current levels.
Slide 12 highlights trends in the noninterest income, which increased 3.9% versus the first quarter, reflecting seasonally
higher fee revenue, particularly in the payment services business. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income
increased 2.0% excluding notable items. Credit and debit card revenue increased 7.8% from a year ago on higher sales
volumes. Merchant acquiring revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, adjusted for the impact of currency rate
changes.
In the second quarter, we exited two merchant acquiring joint ventures, which did not have a material impact on the
second quarter results, but will mute revenue growth comparisons for the next few quarters. The divestitures were due
in part to changing priorities of the joint venture partners that were impacting future growth and profitability of the
portfolios for us. Mortgage revenue grew about 2.4% on a linked quarter basis, but declined 10.9% year-over-year, in
line with our expectations.

Turning to slide 13, noninterest expense increased 2.7% compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting
higher compensation expense and marketing and business development expense, partially offset by seasonally lower
employee benefit expenses. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest expense increased 6.4% excluding notable items.
Growth was driven by higher compensation and other noninterest expense.
Compensation expense grew mainly due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs,
as well as seasonal merit increases and higher variable compensation related to production. Other expenses increased
primarily due to the impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge, which began in the third quarter of 2016.
Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III
standardized approach as if fully implemented, was 9.3%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I will now
provide some forward-looking guidance for the third quarter.
Given recent trends, we expect linked quarter total loan growth to be in the 1.0% to 1.5% range. Average earning asset
growth will track with loan growth. We expect the linked quarter net interest margin to increase in a manner similar to
the first quarter of 2017, which is within a range of 4 to 5 basis points. Let me take a minute to talk about merchant
acquiring revenue.
Last quarter, we indicated that during the third quarter, merchant acquiring revenue was expected to return to a more
normal growth trajectory of same store sales plus 1% to 2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. The
adverse impact on sales volumes from exiting certain large volume customers is beginning to dissipate, with reported
sales volumes increasing 3.3% on a linked quarter basis. Given the anticipated revenue impact from exiting the joint
ventures, we expect year-over-year merchant acquiring revenue will be essentially flat in the third quarter. Growth will
begin to normalize in the fourth quarter, and then heading into 2018.
As Andy discussed, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters supported by
year-over-year expense growth of 3% to 5%, a level we target as more normalized on a long-term basis. Finally, we
expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to approximate 29% in the third quarter.
Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Terry. Our financial performance gained momentum in the second quarter and we expect to continue to
improve profitability and returns as we look into the second half of this year and head into 2018. From a macro
perspective, corporate balance sheets are strong, consumer confidence is increasing, and the evolving economic and
regulatory backdrop has the promise to be conducive to growth.
I just spent time in Washington last week and was left very encouraged by the open and productive dialogue that is
taking place. Nonetheless, progress has been slower than many had hoped. While we have not yet seen evidence of a
resurgence in the CapEx cycle, consumers are spending and businesses are active, and we continue to win share across
our geographic markets and business lines.
We have a solid and growing revenue base, and we believe we have reached an inflection point in expense growth.
Importantly, the profit improvement that we expect will drive improving returns will not be achieved at the expense of
the cost of credit quality, nor will it be achieved at the cost of delaying prudent business investment, which will be
increasingly focused on technology and innovation.
Finally, I want to thank our dedicated employees who work hard every day to be our customers' and communities'
trusted financial partner.
That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill, and I will now be happy to answer your questions

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just following-up on the expense rate of change, it's good to hear and
good to hear that it's anticipated that quickly. So just wondering if you can help us just understand, when you're talking
about both 3Q and 4Q getting back down into that 3% to 5%, what things are getting better and what things are you still
having any inflation in underneath the surface?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So, Ken, let me take that question. So I think there is kind of three broad things.
From a compensation standpoint, we expect that that will begin to moderate and continue to moderate third, fourth, and
into 2018, and that will be driven by the fact that we're getting close to the end of building out those risk and
compliance programs. So that is kind of number one.
Then costs related to risk and compliance such as, like, consulting activities that are really – have been helping to
support some of those programs, has been moderating and will continue to moderate as we go into the next few
quarters and also into 2018. So those would be the biggest things. And then a year ago, FDIC implemented a surcharge,
and so we're starting to lap that, and the year-over-year effect associated with the FDIC insurance will start to moderate
too.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: And I'll keep my follow-up to expenses then. Can you just help us understand the tax advantage
investments, and what does that mean for sequential growth as we go third into fourth as well? It seems like you also
had a bunch of that more in the other line this quarter. So can you just help us understand what that means for
sequential growth as well? Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So we don't necessarily talk about that specifically, but we do typically see the tax
credit amortization expense start to move up in the third, and then the fourth quarter. I think last year from third to
fourth, an example, it was up about $40 million to $50 million, kind of in that ballpark. So that should give you kind of
some sort of a range with respect to how that's going to change.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Ken.

Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Just around the deposit balances, again, for the end of period, just want to get a
little bit of color on what drove that, the end of period coming in above the average and some of the volatility there, and
how we should look at the positive flows going forward.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So on a linked quarter basis, if you end up looking at just averages, we saw growth in
deposits, both in our consumer business, and then also in our corporate trust business. When you end up looking at the
ending cash balances, keep in mind that one of the things we were doing is we were building cash balances in order to
meet some of those liquidity requirements, and in order to be able to do that, one of the things that we did is a little bit
of a pricing change related to some sort of deposits in order to bring some dollars in near the end of the quarter. And so
that's why you see that. Kind of on a go-forward basis when you think about cash balances, we don't expect the average
balances to change much from current levels.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: That's right, Terry. And I'd add, in any particular day that cash balance can be up or down.
There's a lot of volatility, particularly within the corporate trust business with flows [indiscernible] (18:08) there. So
one day, I think, doesn't designate a trend or anything like that.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. So the average should remain where it is, so therefore the EOP is probably going to head
back towards the level where it was?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, I'd focus...
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: ...on average balances.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah.
<Q - John Pancari>: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then on the margin in terms of your expectation, could you remind me
again, you had mentioned 4 to 5 basis points?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So our guidance for the – going into the third quarter is we expect it to expand 4 to 5
basis points from here. And one of the things just when you end up looking at the 1 basis point movement in the second
quarter, we had guided that it would be lower. One of the big reasons for that is really building the higher cash
balances. That cost us about 2 basis points during the quarter, and the flatter yield curve cost us a little bit. But when we
look at third quarter, we feel pretty comfortable with that range of 4 to 5 basis points.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And then jumping off from that point into fourth quarter, how much beyond that would
you think, barring incremental hikes, and then into 2018 if you can give us a little color? Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. When we look into the fourth quarter, at least right now we would expect that the
margin increase may not be at the 4 to 5, but it's still going to be kind of in that range of 3 to 4, somewhere in that
ballpark.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And we try to stay within 90 days, because so much can change with the yield curve in
particular, so we'll continue to give guidance as we go into the next 90 days.
<Q - John Pancari>: Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Terry.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Your welcome.

Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with [indiscernible] (19:45).
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning. How are you?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Great.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Good.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. I just had a couple of questions a little more on the strategic side. Just wanted to
get your thoughts on some of the consolidation that's going on with merchant acquiring over in Europe and how that
plays into your business over there. And any thoughts on incremental investments that you would be looking to make
as a result?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So as you know, Betsy, we're 5 or 6 both in North America, as well as Europe. We
have a great platform, our dynamic currency conversion capabilities, our international payment platform. So I think
we're well-positioned in both places. Merchant acquiring is an area that we will continue to look for incremental

acquisitions, I would call them more bolt-on or add-on as opposed to major deals. We don't need to really expand or
start in Europe, because we already have a very strong presence. But it is an area of focus for us, and one that continues
to grow and one we continue to invest in.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then on the corporate trust side, could you give us some more updated
comments there?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So corporate trust is having a good year. We continue to be leading market share across all
three categories, muni, corporate, as well as structured. We have, again, a good platform and good technology, which I
think is key to that business, and we've been very consistent in terms of our commitment to that. So our opportunity is
to continue to expand in the U.S., but also we have a foothold in Europe and our opportunity to expand there, I think, is
comparable to where it was in the U.S. about 20 years ago.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then just lastly, you talked a bit about deposit betas and how they've been
trajecting. Just wanted to get a sense from you on how close to run rate you are on the corporate side of your business.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: So I think when you end up looking at – if you end up looking at deposit betas overall, I
talked a little bit about that, do you think that one of the things you're seeing on the wholesale side is that the deposit
pricing is getting a little bit more competitive. And so we do see that ticking up both in the June hike, and as rate hikes
continued into the future. I think that that is going to continue to move up, and that's part of what we assume when we
think about deposit betas overall moving up closer to that 50 basis points. You're going to see more pressure on the
wholesale side and on the corporate trust side.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. But feels like we are two-thirds of the way through, or a third of the way
through?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: With respect to this rate hike?
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yes.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I think we're probably further along on the wholesale side of the equation in getting to
normalized betas, and we have more space to go on the retail side, which the beta there has been very low and will
continue to go up as the next rate increases come forward.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yeah, okay. Okay. No, it was interesting just the – I asked the question because,
obviously, we had a rate hike, but yet you did a good job on noninterest bearing deposits growth in the quarter. And so
it kind of suggested to me that maybe you were done on the corporate deposit beta side.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah – no, I don't know if we're done. I think that's all going to be really driven based upon
what we see from a competitive standpoint. But I don't think – based upon the fact that we have cash balances where
we're at, we don't necessarily see a need to drive deposits in. I would agree with you, I don't think that there's a lot of
upward pressure with respect to it. Deposit betas both, whether it's retail or wholesale, et cetera, is really tracking pretty
similar to what we've seen in the past. Maybe just a little bit higher.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Betsy.

<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Good morning, guys. First question is just on loan growth, it sounds like in the aggregate, stuff
is pretty much tracking as you would have thought through the course of the year, where it indeed will accelerate back
into your targeted range in the back half. So that's all good. But it is kind of running a little contrary to the weakness we
still see in the [ph] HA (23:48). Just curious if you can spend another moment or so just talking about exactly where it
ends up coming from; how much of it is market share versus internal growth, et cetera?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So I'll start then; then I'll ask Bill to add on. The areas of growth continue to be in a few –
middle market is doing exceptionally well. That's in excess of 2% on a linked quarter basis, and we continue to see that
accelerating or being about that level in future quarters. It's doing well. As Terry and I both mentioned, we saw some
growth in the second half of the second quarter in the large corporate wholesale part of the category. And then our auto
leasing, as Terry mentioned, it's very high quality. But given the great platform and relationships we have, that has
shown some growth. So those are areas that I would say are principal areas of focus. Bill, what would you add?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, that pretty much hit on the – I mean, the consumer, we expect to remain fairly strong for
the latter half of the year. So we continue to see good demand in auto loans and leases, and again, that's a very prime
portfolio for us. We've always done it that way and we've stayed consistent in that area. We also do see some demand
on home equity. That's a tough market, but we haven't seen the big decreases. We do still have strong originations
there.
Andy talked about the commercial side. I will say on the commercial real estate side, although we do see some roll-off
of our – what we call our mortgage portfolio or standing loan portfolio. I guess there's very aggressive terms in – by the
life companies and the CMBS market. We are still an active construction lender, so we've seen growth there. And we
also – our client base is a lot of REITs, and much of that actually shows up in the C&I line, and we're seeing good
growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year there. So there is a lot of spaces where we're continuing to see good
demand.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay. That's perfect. I appreciate the color. And then just separately on just the idea of positive
operating leverage, it looks like both the quarters in the back half of the year we should get it, which is good. Just
curious about your updated thoughts on positive operating leverage for the full year and sort of when you would expect
to see that. I think you had previously been hoping to generate positive operating leverage for the full year 2017. I
guess just my rough cut on the updated guidance suggests that will still be little bit of a challenge, but just would be
curious to hear your thoughts.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Scott, we'll get it third quarter and fourth quarter, and we'll be very close, if not on, for the
full year.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, guys.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. Yes being short answer to that question. We would expect to have positive operating
leverage and closer to our long-term growth projections as we move into 2018. And that is what we talked about at the
Investor Day, and expense ratio in the 3% to 5% and revenue growth above that. Now, that's assuming sort of a normal
yield curve, economic growth that isn't abnormally low, or anything like that. But we would expect to continue to have
that into 2018. Absolutely.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: That was very clear. Thank you. Follow-up on some of the deposit questions. Some of
your peers have noted that if the Fed does reduce its balance sheet or begin reducing its balance sheet by September,
they believe that the outflows will be most vulnerable in wholesale deposits. And I'm wondering what your color is on
that – your take is on that and whether or not that could potentially accelerate betas even further for U.S. Bank.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So let me take that. And so the Fed is still kind of in the process of defining what the
level and – level of balance sheet reduction and the pace of that over time. And our expectation is that, first of all,
they're going to be very transparent as they go through that process, and the pace is going to be very gradual, most
likely over several years. Okay?
So we do believe that as kind of excess liquidity comes out of the market, we would expect there to be more
competition for deposits, and that is going to end up impacting pricing. I do believe that just because of the nature of
the deposits on the wholesale side, you're going to see more of a competitive environment associated with that.
Whether I'd – yeah, I'd be surprised if it's going to significantly impact 2017, and I do believe that just because it's
going to be very gradual, it's going to also be very manageable and the market's going to kind of respond accordingly.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Thank you. And just one last follow-up question. I know you always get asked on this
call about an update with the Consent Order, and I'm wondering if I can ask a more technical question. Is the Consent
Order from the OCC applicable to the holding company? And I'm just wondering whether or not there is a way to
isolate the Consent Order to sort of unshackle you more strategically.
<A - P. W. Parker>: The Consent – I mean, the OCC, obviously, regulates our national bank, so that's where it is. But
our national bank is essentially the holding company. I mean, I think it's over 99% of the entire bank. So all the
operations occur within that national bank. So what the OCC – it really applies across the board.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And, Erika, we continue to expect to have our – the people and process are in place. Our
technology will be complete by the end of the third, into the fourth quarter. Then it gets to the sustainability and part of
the equation, and that goes into early 2018.

Your next question is from Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky from Matt's team. Wondering if I could just do a bigger picture
question first. I wonder if you can touch on some of the items on the growth front that you mentioned in the past.
Maybe it's in payments or in wealth penetration. Maybe frame out what those could mean to revenue as we think about
both the rest of this year and into 2018 and beyond.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So I think our – I mean, let me just sort of go across the business lines. You asked for a high
level. Wholesale continues to be an opportunity to expand our dominance in terms of being the bank of choice for large
corporate customers. We have a number of capabilities that we've built over the years, and we continue to take market

share in different categories, particularly in the commercial products group, as we move up the league tables. On the
wealth management side, I do think the extension of corporate trust as well as the wealth management piece of the pie,
particularly we're focused on the emerging affluent, that represents a great opportunity.
Payments across all three categories, merchant acquiring, card issuing, as well as corporate payment systems, I think
we have the technology and leaders to continue to grow that. I think particularly in regard to Elavon, I think the
opportunity is both here as well as in Europe. And then finally, retail, we're doing very well in terms of small business
as well as retail core customer growth. And so I think across all of our business lines, as we've said many times before,
I think we're in a strong position and we're not really seeking to have major adjustments. It's just taking advantage of
the opportunities we have in front of us.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Okay, great. And then maybe separately, it seems like energy and maybe oil prices are starting to
come back into the conversation a bit more. Some analysts are calling for sub-$40 oil prices by 2018. Just wondering if
you can remind us again what your exposure is to that space. And it doesn't seem like there's any real signs of
deterioration in your portfolio, but wondering if you could talk again maybe about the quality.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Sure. Yeah, I mean, our book is relatively modest in size. We do finance the energy sector, but
we're below 2% of our commitment level and less than 1% of our loans is in that sector. When the original price
decline took place, we obviously did see some impact. This quarter, NPAs were down, in part because of some of the
resolution of those original non-performing loans. But we've been bringing our reserve levels down, but it's not – it's
just not a material impact to our overall performance. So we think the – we're at a – going to a $40 price stack, we think
that's a comfortable place to be. So we expect to continue to see improvements in that portfolio.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

And the next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Vivek.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hey, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi. Hi. Couple of questions, and maybe this one goes to Bill. Credit card net charge-offs up 58
basis points year-on-year. It's running a little higher than your peers. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on
here?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, sure. I mean, I think – I'll start with saying that the forward look is lower than that. Right?
It'll come back down. It'll be below 4%. So it's not a trajectory thing. I think what you see is that we have continued to
grow that portfolio, both with acquisitions and internally and through our branches. It's been solid growth. So there is a
seasoning impact and you've probably seen that across the industry. But we have – we do have a seasoning impact
there. But our outlook is very solid. We haven't loosened our underwriting standards to gain that growth, so...
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And it's a prime portfolio across the board [indiscernible] (34:15) there's no subprime
activity in there and that's not something we're worried about with that.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. All right. Second topic, mortgage banking. You all had talked about that on last quarter's
call, Terry, Andy. In terms of your applications are up pretty sharply. It seems like gain on sale margins were down.
Can you give some color as to what's going on and what you expect to see on that?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So maybe just to talk about the second quarter first. Mortgage applications on a
year-over-year basis were down about 16% for us, and that's pretty much in line with what the market was
experiencing, and that's driven in large part by the refinancing. The second quarter mortgage applications, we did see a
nice movement up on a linked quarter basis. When we end up looking into the third quarter, we would expect mortgage
applications to continue to move higher. That is kind of seasonal effect. And we also have a nice mix of retail end on

the purchased mortgage side, so that seasonal effect we'll continue to see in the third quarter. Gain on sale margins in
the second quarter did come down. I think you saw that kind of in the industry. Our expectation or outlook is that
they'll be relatively stable going into the third quarter, so...

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods.
<Q - Brian Klock>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, Brian.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Klock>: I wanted to just follow-up maybe a little finer tooth on the expense guidance. On the
year-over-year basis, I mean, would you think that – if we look at the 3% to 5% range, do you think that sequentially
we're looking at expenses – especially I think Terry if you mentioned the impact of the amortization of the low income
housing tax credits, should we be up low single digits on a sequential basis third versus second?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. I mean, usually there is a little bit of a seasonal effect that comes into play with
respect to the third quarter, but I think that that's a reasonable assumption when you think about the third quarter.
<Q - Brian Klock>: Okay. And I know you talked about earlier the deposits and the expectation around just the
seasonal. There's a seasonal runoff that comes back in the second half of the year. So cash balances on average, I think,
will be unchanged. So with the recent issuances of some longer-term debt, are you planning to add anything else to the
investment securities portfolio? Are you planning to keep the securities portfolio relatively flat?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. We end up increasing the securities portfolio really in line with the overall balance
sheet growth. So if you think about what average loan growth is going to look like, our average earning assets really
kind of tracks in a really similar manner. So we would be adding to the investment portfolio in order to be able to do
that. But that's kind of one way to think about it.
<Q - Brian Klock>: All right. Thanks for your time.

– triangulating that into NII growth getting the numbers of around, I guess, 3%, 4% sequential growth, is – am I – it's a
little bit higher than I thought, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something in terms of triangulating NIM
into NII growth.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. I mean, I know you can do the math based on what we ended up laying out, but I
think that's a reasonable assumption.

<Q - Saul Martinez>: Got it. Okay. Perfect. Now I guess a little bit of a bigger picture question on Elavon merchant
acquiring business. Sort of a follow-up to an earlier question, especially in light of some of the consolidation you see in
Europe. But we have heard – and feel free to disagree with this, but we have heard from some that we feel like you're
sub-scale in the acquiring business in both the U.S. and Europe and, obviously, you've exited some low MDR
relationships, you've exited some JVs.
But can you talk a little bit more about the business strategically in terms of where you see the opportunities and how
Elavon – how you capitalize on those opportunities? Where do you see Elavon fitting into the entire payment space and
the merchant acquiring space? And how do you differentiate yourself and drive better growth on an ongoing basis?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So I think first on your scale question, I think we have sufficient scale to be very
competitive, and I think we've had that for a number of years. We're focused on a few areas. Number one is verticals. I
think, as you think about the merchant processing business, it's migrating from a financial transaction business to an
information business, and being very focused on verticals and providing that information is hugely important.
And we have a number of verticals, the travel industry, hotels, small retailers that I think we're very good at. Healthcare
is another one. So our focus is in that information and in terms of innovation and technology, providing beyond the
financial transaction. And as well as the expansion of our sales force, both domestically as well as Europe, and then
finally the whole e-commerce side of the equation is another area of focus for us in terms of investment and growth.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Got it. And how do you feel like your e-commerce capabilities are now versus where you want
them to be?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I think they're fine. I want them to be better.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.

Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin Barker>: Good morning.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Hi, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin Barker>: Good morning. I just had a quick question on tax rate. You mentioned it was going up to 29%, if
I'm right there, on the third quarter. It's been quite volatile over the last few quarters. Are you still sticking with the
27% to 28%, give or take, range for this year and maybe longer term?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. I think that when we end up looking at the tax rate on a tax equivalent basis, on a
long-term basis, just because of growth, it's going to – because of the marginal effect, it's going to drift upward. So
when I end up looking at certainly the next few quarters and going into 2018, that 29% is probably more reasonable.
<Q - Kevin Barker>: Okay. And then in regards to growth, obviously C&I has been the main driver of growth that
we've seen in the last few years. It slowed recently here. When you look out the next one or two years, do you feel like
the consumer and retail lending will start to take the lead, or do you feel like C&I lending will continue to be strong
over the next couple of years?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I think wholesale will continue growing as is, and I think we'll start to see a turnaround in
the retail. So we've had strong growth on the leasing and auto portfolio that we've talked about. A little bit less in terms
of the home equity and traditional retail loan areas, but I think we'll start to accelerate in future periods. And I think
that's how we get to the more normalized long-term growth rates.

Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Oh, hi. I just had a follow-up question. It's around the CCAR process and the ask,
and really the question is around the dividend. I saw you had a nice increase in the dividend, but yet you have one of
the lowest volatility earning streams of the group. And it feels like there might be some room to boost up the dividend
component of the capital return. Just wondering how you're thinking through that.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, Betsy, that's a fair question. So I think, first of all, we're starting from one of the
lower capital ratios. You're right that we have the lowest volatility and the lowest downturn in this stress environment.
In fact, we still make money, as you saw. But we're starting from a point that's not far away from what we think is our
optimal capital structure, the 8.5% versus the just over 9% we are today. That's number one.
Number two is we're always wanting to make sure that we are successful in the outcome of the CCAR process, and
then finally balancing between the buyback side of the equation and the dividend. What we've done is what I would call
a very predictable, continually steady growth, and we would expect to continue that in the future. We might balance a
little bit more and we will balance a little bit more towards increasing the dividend probably more than the buyback in
future periods.

Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hey, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Can you guys give us some additional color? You touched on in your opening remarks about
the commercial real estate markets. You are seeing possibly some weakness in the multi-family space. Can you share
with us, is there any geographical areas that you see it more concerning for you at this time?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, there are certainly some of the cities that have very strong multi-family growth, and if you
look at some of the rent forecast, then this is – there is plenty of companies that do this. You'll see there are markets,
some of the coastal markets of Boston and D.C., where the forecasts are for either no or slightly decline in rent growth.
Now that doesn't mean we won't do projects there. We follow our client base, and if they like the project, we like the
project, we'll still do something. But some of the markets have seen a lot of multi-family. Minneapolis is another one,
where you've got to be cautious about it.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. The second question was – and I think you may have touched upon this, and I
apologize if you did. Can you guys give us your view of – obviously, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that they're
going to start unwinding their balance sheet and it will go into full-speed operation in 2018. How are you guys looking
at that and the impact it may have on deposits in the banking system, and then for USB as well?

<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, Gerard, thank you. We talked a little bit about that earlier, but when you end up
looking at what the Fed – the Fed still needs to kind of define the level of reduction in the balance sheet and really the
pace of it. And I think that they've been really transparent that that pace is really going to be gradual over several years.
And I think that that will cause any impacts of it to be very manageable on the banking industry and as the market
adjusts.
I do think that as – or we think as excess liquidity comes out of the market, you could expect to see and you will expect
to see more competition with respect to deposits. I would also expect that the long-end of the curve on a relative basis
would be a little bit higher as a result of some of their activities. That competition from a deposit standpoint is most
likely to come on the wholesale side of the equation.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. And then just lastly, obviously, you guys have industry-leading profitability with
your ROA and your ROE at the present levels. Is it going to be more than net interest margin improvement or the
efficiency ratio when you look at how you're going to – or could drive that higher? As you know, in the past your
numbers were higher. Is it more of a margin issue, or is it more of an efficiency ratio or leverage? What are you guys
looking at for the levers to even take it higher than where it is today?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Gerard, I think it's both parts of the equation. It's accelerating revenue growth and
moderating expense growth. Positive operating leverage, which will improve the efficiency ratio, and ultimately
improve ROA and ROE.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Terry.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: Hi. Good morning. One question. The bottom of slide 8 really stands out, in that U.S. Bank
has built reserves for the last six quarters, whereas your peers, even through 2Q for those that have reported, continue
to release those reserves. So could you talk about is it something in terms of the mix shift or the loan portfolio that's
driving your ability to grow reserves, again, when your peers are just not in that same position?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, one of the things you're looking at is lot of the peers have larger energy exposure, so they
added more. And like us, we can see improvement this quarter, so they may have released more reserves out of their
energy book. And we're pretty much steady as she goes from a credit standpoint. So at this point in the cycle, we have
very stable credit environment and we're still growing loans. So that's what we look at, and we will add to reserves to
support loan growth. If you think about what they're for, they are for potential future losses out of your loan book. And
as you grow the loan book, that's what the reserve is for. So if we don't have big upswings with needing to add to
reserves in a downturn like the energy portfolio took, then we're going to be adding for loan growth.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So our volatility, Bill, has been a lot lower than everyone else, and so I...
<A - P. W. Parker>: Correct.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: ...simply stated, if we're not adding a lot, we're not subtracting a lot, unless we can do it.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: And then just a follow-up question for me. Andy, this concept of one U.S. Bank, which
you've talked about I believe is in the annual report, as you think about the second half of this year, are there any areas
within your core businesses that stand out in terms of benefiting from this strategy as you work together under this one
U.S. Bank kind of a strategy?

way we handle our call centers, to the way we do innovation, to the way we communicate with our customers, to how

Your final question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Oh, hi. I just had a couple of small ones on making sure we're getting the payment – merchant
processing JV exits right in the model. So were there any gain associated with the exit, either in 2Q or back half of the
year? And then the second, just in terms of the guide, I think you said you're at 3% FX-adjusted growth now in
merchant processing and you'd see that flat in 3Q. Was that – how is – is it the earnings? Is it like equity method
accounting that was being booked or is there revenue, and then we should think about some expense coming out
elsewhere in the P&L? And then I guess last, maybe like just curiosity, I mean, which JVs are you exiting? I saw
something about Santander, but couldn't find the other.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So first I'm going to ask Terry to fill in the other details. There was no material gain or loss
in the second quarter as a result of these exits. Terry, take the others.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. So if you just end up looking at and trying to think about the growth rates over the
next couple of quarters, certainly reported growth rate is about 2.7%, excluding the foreign currency, as we said. I'd
also say that, same-store sales percentages and organic business growth has generally been quite strong, which I think
is good to see. That gives us good insights with respect to the future. Reported gross sales have been impacted by three
factors. Okay?
We talked last quarter about exiting some large-volume, low-margin customers, and that's been muting sales volumes,
and that has been dissipating and it's getting behind us. It certainly will be behind us as we get into the end of the third
quarter. And so we're starting to see sales volumes starting to grow. We are experiencing some margin compression in
Europe because of interchanged caps that were put into place late 2015, and that has continued to impact our
year-over-year sort of growth rates and will continue to impact at least through the third quarter. That will start to
dissipate in the fourth quarter, and then really be behind us as we get into 2018.
And then the impact of exiting the two joint ventures will have an impact on merchant acquiring really for the next
several quarters as we think about the year. To kind of give you some maybe specifics, when we look at the third
quarter, we do expect the year-over-year growth rate for the third quarter to be essentially flat, and that's essentially
what we said. As I look into the fourth quarter, I do expect the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate to be similar to
what we saw in the second quarter or this current quarter. And then as we continue to see organic growth that we are
experiencing, that will start to benefit us as we go into 2018.

<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, I mean, the – one joint venture is related to our joint venture in Spain with Santander.
And really they've had change in priorities with respect to what they want to focus on. And as we think about Spain, it
continues to be an area that has some economic challenges. So from our standpoint, we really do believe that we have
the opportunity to continue to grow in that market on our own with a focus on the right customers. And I'd be very
clear we're not exiting the market.
With respect to the second joint venture, that is the joint venture with KeyCorp, so we call it Key Merchant Services.
And in that particular situation, our partner really wanted to focus on a third-party servicing arrangement, and we
