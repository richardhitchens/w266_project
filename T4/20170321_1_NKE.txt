MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2017 third quarter conference call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Nitesh Sharan, Vice
President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.
Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risk and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC,
including our annual report filed on Form 10-K.
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of future changes in total
revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order
cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from
quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations including
equipment, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf are not included in these futures numbers. Following the conference call,
the futures order schedule will be posted to the financial schedules on the NIKE investor relations website.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equipment sales and
constant dollar revenue. References to wholesale equipment sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall
current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of
actual results.
Similarly, references to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business
eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and
statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. To the extent nonpublic financial and statistical information
is discussed, presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be available at NIKE's
website at investors.nike.com.

Mark G. Parker
Thanks, Nitesh, and good afternoon, everyone.
We had a solid third quarter, delivering revenue growth of 5% for NIKE, Inc. to $8.4 billion. On a currency neutral
basis, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 7%. Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 44.5%. Earnings per share increased
24% to $0.68. And we delivered ROIC of 33%. Q3 saw NIKE sustain our positive momentum. Let's start with
highlights from an amazing quarter for our athletes.
Serena won her 23rd Grand Slam, Roger took the Australian Open against Rafa to extend their great rivalry, and both
NIKE and Jordan continued to dominate basketball's biggest moments at the NBA All-Star Game with 20 of the 25
players on the roster and in March Madness with 12 of the teams advancing to the Sweet 16.
This quarter, we also raised the voice of our athletes with the Equality campaign, showing yet again that when NIKE
stands up for our beliefs, our message spreads far and can be a catalyst for true positive change.
With widespread energy behind the athletic industry right now, NIKE is aggressively competing in every market. And
we're creating our own opportunities using our combined power and scale.
Last quarter, I talked about our relationships with consumers and how we're getting sharper and moving faster to serve
them. That sense of purpose has only accelerated over the last 90 days. The consumer has decided digital isn't just part
of the shopping experience, digital is the foundation of it. This and other factors have shifted consumer patterns,
especially in North America, impacting traffic, the economics of brick-and-mortar retail, and is driving a more
promotional environment in the near term.
While we are mindful of these near-term dynamics, we remain focused on the long term. The current backdrop
represents a tremendous opportunity for NIKE because the brands that win are going to be the ones that have been out
in front with digital and leading with service. While we don't expect this transition to be simple, we are clear about
what it will take to get there. We're aligning all of our firepower against the consumer experience.
To exceed consumers' rising expectations, we're driving fundamental change in three core areas of our business:
through the innovation that inspires them, the supply chain that delivers it quickly, and in the marketplace where we

connect personally with consumers. And while we continue to see great success against all three areas, we've
committed to doubling our impact in each of them. We call it our triple-double. So what do I mean by that?
In product, we're doubling our cadence and scale of innovation through performance and sports style. Throughout our
supply chain, we're doubling our speed from product insight to delivery to the consumer. And in the marketplace, we're
doubling our direct connections with consumers through digital, membership and personalization.
To win now and create the future, we're obsessing these three areas: 2X innovation, 2X speed and 2X direct. I'll give
you some detail on each.
Let's start by going deeper on 2X innovation, where we're shifting to an even faster innovation cycle and scaling more
effectively. Our consumers will feel the impact of this immediately. For example, in just a few days we're launching
our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max cushioning system ever. We'll continue to push the edges
of style with Air VaporMax and quickly scale it into new models.
And to kick off the sub two-hour marathon Breaking2 project, we've developed a disruptive design with the NIKE
ZoomX midsole. The ZoomX provides runners with an incredibly comfortable ride and energy return like we've never
seen before.
With running footwear, we're always looking to improve efficiency. That's why we're so excited about the new NIKE
Zoom Vaporfly 4%. As a former marathoner, I know that even a 1% gain would be an impressive accomplishment. But
over our previous best shoe, this delivers an astronomical 4% gain in efficiency. It's no surprise that feedback from our
lead athletes has been off the charts. We can't wait for more runners to give it a try when we release the NIKE Zoom
Vaporfly 4% in early June.
Later this summer, we'll unveil a third platform, a next-generation cushioning system designed in radical new forms
that helps runners and basketball players increase their performance and stay fresher longer. Using a new material, this
will be the first widely available NIKE platform that merges our new algorithm-based approach to designing with data.
Combine this new system with VaporMax and ZoomX, and that's three new cushioning platforms coming to market in
the months ahead. As our consumers will soon see, this is truly a cushioning revolution from NIKE.
In apparel, NIKE and the NBA will bring fans closer to courtside next fall. We're delivering innovation that extends
way beyond the court, covering every stage of the players' journey. That's a huge untapped commercial opportunity,
and our strategy will be to blend sport with everyday lifestyle for both the athlete and the fan.
All of this innovation gives NIKE a critical edge in the near term, but we know a loaded innovation pipeline is what
ignites our next phase of growth over the long term, and there's plenty ahead. Looking toward the future, we're in the
later stages of evolving and scaling personalized performance beyond the HyperAdapt 1.0 with more comprehensive fit
systems, including continued advancements in our FlyEase fit technology.
A new level and look of Flyknit that's so strong it can withstand the forces of the NBA's most powerful players,
emerging performance and style in another new cushioning platform that actually conforms and shapes to the foot for
ultimate comfort. With all of these products to hit the market over the coming months, it's clear NIKE is driving a faster
innovation cycle and bringing it to more people than ever before.
Our second area of focus is to create a more agile and opportunistic organization, or 2X speed inside and out. To
continue to stay one step ahead of the consumer, we will cut our average product creation cycle in half. One way we're
doing that now is through our Express Lane, where our global product teams and our product engines make real-time
adjustments to DTC and wholesale product lines with local teams in North America, Western Europe, and China. We're
moving faster than ever before, getting products to market in weeks, not months.
Through the Express Lane, we're fueling consumer demand through new localized styles. We're supercharging our
most successful franchises. For example, we've built more flexibility and speed into the delivery of some of our top
sellers like the Air Pegasus, the Air Force 1, and we're looking ahead to include the Air VaporMax, as examples.

Another key to moving our teams closer to market is the work we're doing within our manufacturing revolution. With
partners like Flex, we're expanding into more styles with advanced automation in the build and adhesion processes,
localizing sourcing for quicker material lead time, and reducing waste through advanced knitting and higher-precision
cutting technologies. We're seeing a positive impact to gross margins in the tens of millions, and we expect that to
continue to accelerate.
These are not separate initiatives. We're lining up the pipes of our manufacturing revolution with real-time consumer
insights, seamless inventory, and a hyperlocal marketplace approach, all of which is connecting the dots in the name of
speed for the consumer.
To make room for this speed, we're driving focus through our Edit to Amplify approach. This is an area where we have
not been as sharp as we need to be, as currently 75% of our styles generate 99% of sales. By editing out 25% and
amplifying the productivity of both new innovations and the products consumers already love, we're driving more
growth and choice from fewer styles. And we're already seeing positive near-term returns from our work here.
Edit to Amplify is a mindset that reaches well beyond product. It's about prioritizing every step along the way, from the
category to geos to cities to accounts, all the way down to the door level.
Our final area of focus is 2X direct. This strategy doubles the business that is in direct service of the consumer. And we
do this by leveraging digital and membership to bring the NIKE Brand closer to them. Regardless of whether they're
shopping in our own DTC or with wholesale partners, we want to extend NIKE's home court advantage across all
channels.
We're seeing the opportunity up close. Take NIKE Soho for example, which some of you have visited. When a
consumer walks through that door, they get one-to-one personal shopping service, invitations to join our running and
training clubs with other members, the opportunity to trial our latest innovations, and seamless access to product that
gets them what they want quickly. And what we found is that Nike+ members who use our personal shopping
appointments generate more than three times the average transaction size.
We see the consumer shifts within digital commerce as well, with a larger share of our growth coming through our
apps. It's further confirmation that the consumer responds to a simpler, faster, and more personal connection and right
now that level of service, that deeper experience with the NIKE Brand is driving growth in our own DTC.
Moving forward, we will expand that opportunity by rolling out these successes with our own wholesale partners
around the world. The more directly NIKE engages with the consumer, the greater the return. We've seen it with our
strategic partners and key accounts, such as Foot Locker, DICK'S, JD, INTERSPORT, and Tmall where we've grown
our businesses together despite the uneven environment.
And for those partners who align with our more direct approach to the consumer, we have an opportunity to leverage
the Express Lane even more. And we know there's still more work to be done here. More personal, more mobile, more
distinctive, these are the dimensions that will drive growth, and I'm convinced now is the time to rewrite the playbook
of retail.
When I look out to the next year, we have a lot to be excited about. Now it's more important than ever for NIKE to stay
true to our own values and leverage our competitive advantages. There will always be room to improve, but I'm proud
of the way we're managing our business today, and I'm bullish on our opportunity to extend our leadership position for
tomorrow. Our triple-double strategy is setting the stage for this next phase of growth at NIKE to win now and to create
the future.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor.

In Q3, the NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency
basis. NIKE Brand revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China, and our
emerging markets geographies.
NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 13%, driven by 18% growth in digital commerce, new store expansion, and 6%
comp store growth. Today, NIKE is in a familiar place: on the offense. Mark said we are doubling our direct
connections with consumers and approach that will be seen at retail as we ramp up how we serve our consumers
through digital commerce and membership.
And as always, we work to create brand energy across performance and lifestyle, connecting consumer to the products
they want and love. And we bring it all to life through our geographies, a global portfolio that provides NIKE unrivaled
agility and scale. Now let's get into a bit more detail on these three areas.
Our deep relationships with consumers drives us. We built the NIKE Brand by serving consumers. It is our central
promise. And as we grow in scale and reach, we continue to serve our athletes personally. Mark spoke about the power
of personalized service and seamless commerce in North America, particularly in our Soho and Miami stores. Let me
just add that we're seeing the same success around the world as well.
In January, we opened a NIKE and Jordan store in Beijing, our largest basketball-focused door in China. There, a
NIKE+ basketball trial experience and T-shirts customization offers seamless links between NIKE's physical and
digital platforms. As we roll out more experiences like these, consumers see that retail is more than a series of
transactions. We believe it should be personal and full of energy. For us, personal service is the new premium.
To that point, our NIKE+ and SNKRS apps are successfully serving consumers more individually. Despite only being
offered in North America, they are driving more growth, better consumer engagement, and higher conversion rates.
With our investments in cloud technology, we are accelerating the global expansion of our apps to become even faster
and more nimble in serving the consumers' changing needs. All of these experiences offer powerful examples of the
services that will enable us to double our direct connection to consumers, both in our owned and partnered retail.
At the same time, we are relentless in our goal to design products that deliver both innovation and style. Running and
basketball, two of our most important categories, sit at this intersection. In Q3, running saw continued success,
especially in our international markets, as the Air Zoom Pegasus showed strong sell-through. Also, as we celebrate the
month leading up to the Air Max Day, we've unveiled several styles that are drawing strong consumer demand,
including the first Air Max 90 Flyknit, the Air Max 1 OG in its 30th year anniversary and the Air Max Jewell, a
sophisticated new silhouette designed for women. And, of course, the launch of the Air VaporMax this weekend will be
a significant moment for the NIKE Brand.
We debuted a laceless version of this performance shoe in Paris and drove energy throughout the fashion world. After
all, the quest for perfect performance influences style and vice versa. And the shoes simply constructed of two of our
greatest inventions, Air and Flyknit, fulfills our dream of walking on nothing but air. We will continue to build
consumer excitement for the Air VaporMax by bringing new creative versions and global scale to serve this incredible
energy we are seeing. We have high expectations for the Air VaporMax and I'm very excited about the launch.
In basketball, we're seeing great energy, from the game to our athletes to our products. Let's start with this. The Kyrie
3, launched in December, is now the top-selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. The LeBron 14 is
showing very strong early results; and at the same time, the LeBron Soldier 10 remains one of the hottest styles in the
category.
Also in Q3, the launch of the Paul George 1 saw very strong consumer response. And we continue to drive the demand
for basketball with iconic and popular products like the Air Force 1. Modern looks on this beloved silhouette also sold
very well in Q3. That includes the Special Field Air Force 1 and the high-energy collaborations with creative brands
like VLONE and Acronym, proving yet again NIKE's ability to adapt our most popular styles to serve the audiences.
So NIKE Basketball fueled by the KD9, the LeBron Soldier 10, and the Kyrie 3 is seeing double-digit market share
gains in the $100 to the $150 price zone. And with the energy around PG1, we expect this will only accelerate.

And the future remains bright with the new era of Retros kicking off with the first-ever rerelease of the LeBron Air
Zoom generation. We believe LeBron, like Kobe and Michael before him, will translate his singular greatness to a long
line of products and with the successful launch of his first retro, consumers clearly agree.
Speaking of Michael, the Jordan Brand continues to lead in elevating performance and sports style together. We see
Jordan's energy on the court in MVP-type seasons from Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard and we're seeing it off
the court with several strong sellers in Q3, including the Jordan OVO and our Black History Month's collections.
The top performer, however, was the Space Jam 11s, and when I say top performer, I don't just mean in Q3. The Space
Jam 11 was the largest and most successful shoe launch in the history of NIKE. This speaks not only to the obvious
demand for our products, but also our ability to connect greater numbers of consumers worldwide to the products they
covet.
At the same time, the Jordan Brand continues its expansion beyond basketball, this time with the University of North
Carolina's football team and increasingly into the women's business with the NikeCourt Flare AJ1.
While we're talking about product, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the success we're seeing in apparel, whether that's
our Zonal Strength tights, our popular Plus Sizing line, or Tech Fleece, which continues to sell very well, particularly
the advanced fleece line. Throughout our categories, we are competing on all fronts, attacking opportunities with the
cumulative advantages that NIKE has built.
Finally, our global diversification provides unrivaled agility and scale to sustain growth over the long term. For North
America to Western Europe to Greater China, we are running a powerful global offense where we continue to develop
deep relationships and bring excitement to consumers all over the world.
In North America, our brand continues to be incredibly strong. We see it when our most coveted products sell out
rapidly on the SNKRS app; when members show up rain or shine at our NIKE Run Clubs; when we see consumers
enjoying premium executions in our stores and in our partner doors like Foot Locker's House of Hoops, the Fly Zone
and the Field House at DICK'S Sporting Goods. And we continue to tap into powerful sport and cultural moments. In
Q3, just few days apart, we delivered at New York Fashion Week and at the NBA All-Star Weekend. NIKE and Jordan
celebrated Fashion Week with special product drops and targeted retail executions and then followed it up with special
player editions for our deep roster of All-Stars. Our ability to leverage both these events speak to the distinction of our
brand.
Now while we're seeing consumer traffic patterns shift by digital disruption, retail consolidation and increasingly
promotional environment, this geography continues to move in the right direction. In Q3, revenue was up 3%, gross
margins expanded, and inventory declined 8%. We continue to see that the right product, the right experience, and the
right brand strategy generates tremendous consumer demand.
That said, while we remain focused on strengthening our leadership position, we know we have more work to do to
supercharge performance products in North America, particularly in running. When we see new market or competitive
dynamics within a category, we move quickly to identify the consumer opportunities and we focus our resources
against them. We've proven that this is the right strategy time and again.
For example, last year we were losing share in basketball in North America and now we're taking it back. We're on the
offense and we anticipate accelerating growth in performance, in large part fueled by the Air VaporMax's energy and
the upcoming cushioning revolution that Mark mentioned.
Around the rest of the world, our brand and business are seeing great momentum. In Western Europe and Greater
China, a continued shift to a more active lifestyle is fueling growth. Specifically in Q3, Western Europe had its 14th
consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and Greater China saw its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth. In
Western Europe, we saw growth across nearly all categories, across all territories, and across DTC and wholesale, led
by digital. We also reclaimed Western Europe's number one position in football footwear as NIKE's players dominate
the top leagues, scoring more goals than any other brand this season.

The market continues to grow at a healthy pace. In footwear, we saw growth in running and sportswear, and in apparel,
we saw broad-based growth, led by sportswear and global football.
Now in China, the opportunity is massive. Just over the past five years, the number of marathons there has grown
500%, and China's government predicts a sports economy valued at $850 billion by 2025, by far the world's biggest.
Our leading brand position in China gives us confidence we will continue to see real growth from this expanded
market. Indeed, NIKE and China have a long history together and we continue to connect with this growing sports
culture.
In January, in addition to the Beijing store, the Jordan Brand opened two new Jordan-only stores in Chengdu and
Taipei, celebrating the brand's 20th anniversary in China. And partners like Topsports and Pou Sheng are helping drive
strong sales by scale and elevated experiences across key cities.
In Q3, we also partnered with tennis star, Li Na, to introduce a signature line with women's training and sportswear
styles, our first exclusive line for a female Chinese athlete. And additionally, we are looking forward to China hosting
the FIBA World Cup of Basketball in 2019 and with our recently announced partnership with FIBA, we can't wait to
work together to grow the sport of basketball internationally.
In the end, the NIKE Brand is built to win. We connect consumers with the products and experiences they want across
performance and lifestyle. We strategically balance across a diverse global marketplace and we lead the pack with
groundbreaking retail executions both in premium brick-and-mortar and pioneering digital commerce. As always, we
are on the offense and it's these core strategies that will fuel and extend our leadership position over the long term.
Thanks. Now here's Andy
Andrew Campion
Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello to everyone on the call.
We are pleased with the results that we delivered in Q3. And at the same time, we are not satisfied. We are pleased
because we continue to strengthen the fundamental drivers of NIKE's long-term revenue growth and earnings potential.
Our financial strategy has three pillars: delivering strong revenue growth, expanding profitability, and generating high
returns on invested capital. In Q3, we delivered revenue growth in line with the guidance that we communicated 90
days ago. We drove strong double-digit currency neutral growth in aggregate across our international markets, which
now represent more than half of our global portfolio, and we repositioned NIKE for sustainable profitable growth in
North America long term.
We also expanded profitability well in excess of our guidance, with EPS growing 24%. Finally, we delivered return on
invested capital of over 33%, at the high end of our targeted range, by continuing to edit within our core spending to
amplify more focused strategic investment in areas, such as product innovation, digital commerce, and membership
while also more tightly managing inventory.
Over the past several years, NIKE has become even more fit for growth. On a currency neutral basis, we've built a more
efficient and profitable business model. We've sustained momentum in the drivers of full-price gross margin expansion,
we have systematically reduced SG&A as a percent of revenue, and we have significantly expanded our currency
neutral EBIT return on sales.
But we are not satisfied. We are clear eyed with respect to the challenges we have faced and opportunities we have not
fully capitalized upon in the short term. We have and we will continue to attack those opportunities with urgency.
We are also obsessing over the triple-double that Mark referenced. Doubling the cadence and impact of innovation,
doubling our speed to market, and doubling NIKE's direct connection to consumers in the marketplace. That is the
formula we are employing to fuel NIKE's next horizon of accelerating growth.

As for innovation, we have more than doubled our investment in innovation of late, and you will now see us double the
flow and impact of innovation we bring to market immediately beginning in Q4.
We also see tremendous growth potential in doubling our direct connection to consumers. NIKE's direct-to-consumer
business continues to grow much faster than the broader market. And NIKE branded concepts operated with our
strategic partners continue to grow faster than undifferentiated multi-brand stores. In short, NIKE always wins when we
create a home field advantage that brings together a curated assortment of our products, a NIKE branded environment,
and direct personal service of our consumers.
To be clear, this opportunity is not simply about branded space. It goes well beyond. We see the opportunity to
leverage NIKE Digital membership to elevate personal service broadly across the marketplace. And today, NIKE
Digital members already spend nearly two times what other NIKE consumers spend per transaction.
Identifying and then aggressively seizing upon these compelling growth opportunities is what we mean when we say
NIKE is on the offense always. But before I speak to our go-forward outlook in more detail, let's take a few moments to
reflect on the results that we delivered in Q3.
In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 5%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit
growth in Greater China, Western Europe, and the emerging markets.
Third quarter diluted EPS of $0.68 increased 24% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage,
higher other income, a lower tax rate, and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 140 basis points in the
quarter. Full-price average selling prices continued to expand. However, margin contracted overall due to higher
product costs, FX headwinds, and off-price sales.
Demand creation decreased 7% to $750 million for the quarter, as our fiscal year spending was front-loaded due to
significant investments around the Olympics and European football championships. Operating overhead decreased 1%,
as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains within our core operational spending.
The effective tax rate for Q3 was 13.8% compared to 16.3% for the same period last year, primarily due to a reduction
in tax reserves and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject
to a lower tax rate.
As of February 28, inventories were up 7%, driven by a higher average cost due primarily to product mix and to
support growth of our DTC businesses. Wholesale inventory units were down 3%.
Next, let's turn to a few of our key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and
constant-currency basis, as we continued to see balanced growth across both footwear and apparel, highlighted by
another quarter of strong growth in NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
EBIT growth of 9% outpaced revenue growth as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage delivered increased
profitability. As Trevor detailed, we continue to make great progress in North America, rebalancing supply and
demand, reigniting momentum in our basketball business, and sustaining momentum in sportswear. That said, the
North America retail landscape is not in a steady state.
Digital disruption and other dynamics are resulting in more aggressive promotional activity than we expected 90 days
ago. So we're going to remain tight with respect to the supply that we are putting into the North America market in the
short term while aggressively driving the initiatives that will reshape and grow the market and extend NIKE's
leadership long term.
Now turning to our international markets, where we continue to have very strong momentum, first in Western Europe,
revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis, as we delivered another quarter of strong multi-dimensional
growth, led by our sportswear, running, and global football categories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4% while
EBIT declined 13%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds and higher product costs on gross margin,
partially offset by SG&A leverage.

In our emerging markets, revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, led by our sportswear and running categories.
We also saw double-digit growth across most territories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 8% while EBIT
decreased 4%, as results continue to be heavily impacted by FX.
Last but certainly not least, Greater China delivered another quarter of extraordinary results, with currency neutral
revenue growing 15%. We continue to see strong momentum across the business with double-digit growth in wholesale
and DTC, footwear and apparel, and nearly all categories.
China as a nation is accelerating toward sport, both in terms of participation and passion, and urbanization continues at
full speed. With over 350 million Chinese millennials, one of the largest and most important demographics in the
world, we believe we've just scratched the surface of our growth potential in this important market. On a reported basis,
revenue grew 9% and EBIT expanded 6% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
As evidenced in Q3, we extended our longstanding track record of managing all of the levers within our global
portfolio to deliver strong results in the near term, even amidst volatility. As we look ahead, we will also continue
investing and innovating to exceed consumer expectations and fuel long-term, sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient
growth.
As for our specific guidance, in Q4 we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, slightly below
our Q3 reported rate of growth. On a currency neutral basis, we expect growth in the high single-digit range. We
continue to see very strong growth in our international geographies, ranging from Greater China to Europe to emerging
markets.
In North America, we have made great progress over the course of this fiscal year solidifying the fundamental drivers
of growth. We are by far the leading and largest brand in North America with a $15 billion growing portfolio. Based
upon the breadth and depth of our portfolio, we anticipate that the currently dynamic overall retail marketplace will
create both puts and takes in the short term, so we are being appropriately measured with respect to our Q4 financial
targets for North America. We will keep supply tight, maintaining the strong foundation we've created, while we bring
new innovation to market and accelerate more direct consumer connections.
Shifting to gross margin, 90 days ago we anticipated less Q4 gross margin contraction versus prior year than we have
seen year to date. While we're anticipating greater FX headwinds in Q4, we were also expecting to partially offset that
with significant expansion in our operational or currency neutral gross margin versus prior year.
Today, we expect the same FX impact that we anticipated 90 days ago. However, based upon the currently more
promotional environment in the overall North America marketplace, we do not believe it is prudent to target as much
short-term expansion in our overall operational gross margin. Instead, we are going to maintain the financial flexibility
to ensure that we continue to optimize sell-through. Accordingly, we are now targeting 150 to 175 basis points of gross
margin contraction in Q4 versus prior year, with the year-over-year variance largely driven by FX.
As for Q4 SG&A, we expect it to be roughly flat versus the prior year, as we continue to systematically drive
productivity gains through our Edit to Amplify initiative. Other income net of interest expense is expected to be
approximately $15 million in Q4, and we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.
Note that NIKE Brand futures orders are down 4% on a reported basis versus prior year and down 1% on a currency
neutral basis. As previously discussed, futures are an important part of our operating model, but futures growth is no
longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth based upon several factors we've previously articulated. Illustrating this
point, you will see that China futures are growing low single digits based on changes we have made to our monthly
shipment flow globally. However, we continue to project strong double-digit revenue growth in China.
We are in the early stages of our planning for fiscal year 2018, and we'll provide financial guidance on our next
earnings call. Today, I'll share some preliminary thoughts. We are employing a balanced three-pronged approach to our
planning for fiscal year 2018. First, we will remain appropriately measured. Second, we will be sharply focused,
attacking the most compelling growth opportunities in the marketplace with speed and agility. And third, we will be on
the offense, executing the triple-double that will fuel NIKE's next horizon of accelerating long-term growth.

Financially, we are targeting continued revenue growth across all geographies in fiscal year 2018, led by strong growth
internationally. We also project significant operating leverage and expanding profitability, which on a currency neutral
basis would result in earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial model.
That said, at our Investor Day in October fiscal year 2016, we communicated that we expected FX to be a significant
headwind through fiscal year 2018, as our long-dated hedge portfolio matures and rolls forward. And since that time,
the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most international currencies. At current rates, we project that we will
have absorbed $1.6 billion to $2 billion of cumulative FX downside over fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017, and fiscal
year 2018, with the most significant annual impact being in fiscal year 2018.
We look forward to putting these extreme FX headwinds behind us as we exit fiscal year 2018. In the meantime, we
will continue to deliver strong revenue growth and make NIKE a more efficient and profitable enterprise on a currency
neutral basis.
In closing, we will continue to manage all of the operating levers within our portfolio to deliver strong performance in
the short term. At the same time, we will remain relentlessly on the offense investing, innovating and, in some cases,
revolutionizing the industry to exceed consumer expectations, fuel long-term growth, and create value for shareholders.
With that, we'll now open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Hi, guys. Good evening.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Hi, Bob.
<A - Andrew Campion>: Hi, Bob.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: I guess, if you could spend a few minutes on basketball in terms of what you've delivered this
quarter and the expectation going forward as a driver? And then just if you could spend a little bit more time
elaborating on China in terms of the futures versus the revenue outlook and what exactly changed with some of the
shipment timing that you talked about?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Okay. Bob, I'll take the first one. So, on basketball, we continue to see the basketball
business strengthen. There's no doubt that we're obviously the leader of basketball and there's incredible energy with
our athletes, we see a really strong pipeline of products, and we have the ability to continue to grow the game around
the world. When we think of basketball, we always think about it as a portfolio: NIKE Basketball, NIKE Sportswear,
and the Jordan Brand. What we're seeing is great momentum really across all those dimensions.
First, on the sportswear side, just to give you one dimension, the Air Force 1 franchise is doing exceptionally well in
the marketplace and we're seeing new styles like the Special Field Air Force 1 really become an icon and continue to
grow. The Air Jordan Space Jam 11, which I mentioned earlier, broke launch records. Then you have the Kyrie 3,
which is now the top-selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace.
When you speak about performance, then you go specifically into the KD9, the LeBron Soldier 10, the Kyrie 3 are all
driving double-digit market share gains in the $100 and $150 price zone. And then we've added the Paul George and
then the LeBron 14.
So all-in-all, we have really brought a really strong focus around basketball. We are clearly focused. We're on the
offense. We're incredibly excited about the products that we have coming, in addition to the NBA partnership that we
have on the horizon. So all-in-all, basketball really is just starting to go from strength to strength.

<A - Andrew Campion>: And, Bob, I'll take the China question. The short answer is the China futures in the low
single-digit range reflects purely timing impacts. As we continue to optimize our management of supply and demand
and inventory, one of the opportunities we've identified is with respect to the flow across the three months that
comprise a season. And so we've made some changes that help us better identify opportunities and capitalize on being
in stock in the marketplace. It also has a benefit to us from an inventory management and capital management
perspective. We see continued strong double-digit growth in China. In no way do the futures reflect any change in our
very bullish view with respect to the tremendous performance that we've had and we continue to expect in China.
<A - Nitesh Sharan>: Thanks, Bob.

Operator
The next question is from Kate McShane from Citi.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Hi, thank you. My first question was on the cushioning platforms. I know we typically see these
innovations around the Olympics. I was curious about why they're coming out now instead and how quickly do you
expect to scale these?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: These cushioning systems, all three of them – and in fact there are four. If you listened
carefully, there's a fourth comfort cushioning system in the works. But these have been in development for the past two
or three, in some cases, four or five years. This is part of our double the investment in R&D, and we're really seeing
that investment paying off.
One of the most important outputs of performance innovation for NIKE is in the area of cushioning. So we see some of
this work actually led up to Rio. The top three finishers in the marathon were all wearing the ZoomX technology, and
also in the Olympic Trials leading up to the Olympics.
So you've seen bits and pieces of some of this, but not out in the market at scale. So we're basically ready to launch the
product, excited about every one of the cushioning systems. They not only create a new level of performance and
incredible breakthroughs in the case of the ZoomX, but they also create a whole new aesthetic, which is translatable not
only into performance product but also to the street. So the leveragability and the scalability of these technologies is
tremendous.
The challenge we have, frankly, is to make sure that the focus is on these and we scale these in a way that we can really
tell the stories independently. But together, they form what is truly, and I mentioned it, a cushioning revolution for
NIKE and the industry. As a product geek, I am incredibly excited about what's coming in the next six months.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Okay, great. And then if I could follow up with your commentary on the North American
dynamic, are we really talking about what's happening in the department store channel? I'm just curious what negative
trends continue to persist here when we're starting to approach the lapping of some of the bankruptcies and just what's
driving the level of promotion that you're seeing.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Let me just start on a little broader level. The retail landscape, particularly in the U.S., is not
in a steady state. I think that's obvious. Undergoing some significant shifts, and those shifts really create some big
opportunities and some challenges at the same time.
I think the important thing to point out is that these changes are really being driven by the consumer, and consumer
demand at the same time remains quite strong. But we know that consumer expectations are quite high in terms of
product, the type of product they want, the innovation, the style. They want the product fast, they want it easy, they
want personal service. These are all things that are driving some of these shifts in the marketplace. And that's why
we're focused on doubling the output or the cadence of innovation, our speed to market, so we can be that much more

responsive to consumer needs and deliver innovation more quickly. And then doubling our direct connection to
consumers in the marketplace, using or leveraging the power of digital.
So again, it's a market that's undergoing a lot of shift and change. But again, I wouldn't trade our position with
anybody. I think we're in a strong position to leverage our strength as a brand, as a company, and we expect to do that.
<A - Nitesh Sharan>: Thanks, Kate. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about the triple-double initiative,
especially the speed and pace to market innovation frequency. Maybe help put this in context and help us understand
the impetus behind this. From an external perspective, it seems to a lot of people in the market that the sneaker market
shifted in the last couple years maybe a little bit away from some of the performance styles and looks and products that
have been in the market and maybe a little bit more towards that street and fashion element. Do these initiatives help
you directly address that? And what's the timeframe, I think, for getting the inventory balance right along what the
market's looking for as you implement some of these initiatives, or is that not the right way to think about it?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Well, yeah. The reason we're putting so much emphasis on this triple-double strategy is it's
going to get us closer to the consumer and put us in a better position to serve the consumer with the innovation that
we're creating, do a better job of editing that product selection and really calling out the key stories. The good news on
a macro level is that the consumer appetite for active and sport-based products is I think at an all-time high around the
world. It's just part of the fabric of everyday active lifestyle, and so the demand for the product is definitely there.
People want more. They want product that obviously performs at a high level, but also looks incredible. It's not an
either/or; it's an and proposition. And they want that product fast and they want it easy, easy access to the product.
So our whole initiative is about getting that direct connection strengthened to the consumer and making sure we're in
the best position to keep that cadence of innovation moving out to the market as quickly as we can. It also puts us in a
position to be more responsive. When we see product that's hot, we can turn that product around a lot quicker and get it
to the retailers and through our own DTC to the consumer a lot quicker. So overall, it's just making us more
competitive and more responsive to where the consumers are at.
The Express Lane, let me just touch on that because you asked about speed specifically. There are really three different
components of the Express Lane. Fulfill is one, and that means getting product more quickly, restocking product more
quickly based on what consumers want, and that's real time. And that's through sell-through-based insight. Another
dimension is what we call update, and that means editing materials or colors on popular or existing styles or models
based on consumer feedback or insights that we gather. And then the third dimension of it is create, and this is basically
creating new products from scratch and bringing them to market with much greater speed. Again, that's in half the time
that we've done it traditionally. So that whole end-to-end process is basically being cut in half today, from six months
down to roughly three months or less. And I think that's – again, it's going to put us in a much more competitive
position.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Hey, Omar, I'll just add a couple other things. I would just say that what we see from the
marketplace is consumers want both great performance and they want style, and they want those two things together.
And I think a great example of that is the product that we're actually just launching, which is the Air VaporMax, which
you'll see that there are actually different variations to that product, one which is a very clear high-performance
product, the running shoe, and we've also got a laceless version, which actually appeals for more of a style perspective.
But the shoe in itself is both great performance and it's also superiorly stylish, and so that's we believe is what the
consumer wants. So when we bring new platforms, you will see us bring more variations that gives the consumers more
choice on the things that they actually love all the time.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. The...

<Q - Omar Saad>: Trevor?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Go ahead.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Sorry, I appreciate that. I appreciate those answers. I also wanted to ask a question about SG&A, if
that's okay. It's been down in dollar terms the last couple quarters. You guys have obviously had a track record of really
over-investing to fuel long-term growth. Should we be thinking about the SG&A line differently? Is there something
about this era that we're in where maybe it doesn't require the same spend levels, or is that really just lapping the
year-over-year Olympics and other activities?
<A - Andrew Campion>: That's a great question, Omar. To be clear, our top priority is investing to fuel long-term
growth, so that's where the dialogue with respect to SG&A or capital expenditure starts at NIKE. What we've identified
is over time our growth has allowed us to invest appropriately and in some cases in a very ample, maybe even a little
more than we necessarily needed to. And I would think about it this way. We have existing and new truly
differentiating capabilities or competitive advantages at NIKE. Those include things like product innovation, design,
digital, brand marketing, including sports marketing and our supply chain, especially the elements of the supply chain
that Mark spoke to, the ones that we're looking to get greater speed out of in service to the consumer. That's where our
focus is on investment.
The other functions that we have within the company are certainly important, but they're not differentiating capabilities
for NIKE. And we look at those other functions as functions where we can optimize our spending, not just for purposes
of saving expense, but it actually makes us more streamlined and nimble as an organization. So in some cases, our
editing is aligned with shifting business priorities or with existing business priorities. And in other cases, our editing is
really a form of zero-basing in areas where we believe we have the opportunity. And that's what I would call from the
financial perspective my version of Mark's Edit to Amplify initiative from a product and business perspective. And we
believe that we continue to have opportunity in this regard. Again, if you exclude FX, we've made ourselves much
more efficient and profitable over the last couple of years and we still see opportunity ahead in that regard.
<A - Nitesh Sharan>: Thanks. Operator.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thank you, Andy, Mark and Trevor. Appreciate it. Good luck.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Sure. Thanks.
<A - Nitesh Sharan>: Operator, we'll take the next question, please.

The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Lindsay Drucker Mann>: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask on North America, maybe a
follow-up to Kate McShane's question. I think a couple quarters ago you had talked about the need to destock and clean
up the channel and that as we sort of move through that, you had expected revenue in the U.S. to accelerate. I'm just
curious if you're – given the commentary on the U.S., specifically on your fourth quarter, how are you thinking about
the timeline to a U.S. sales acceleration?
<A - Andrew Campion>: Hi, Lindsay. It's Andy. I'll start on that one. The first part of your question was about what
we've been talking about over the last several quarters, and we have made great progress in that regard. You obviously
saw revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter with inventories declining. That is pretty squarely in the zone
of effective and efficient supply and demand management. So we have re-solidified our foundation in that regard. As
Trevor and I think Mark to some extent touched upon, we've also solidified the fundamental drivers of growth in North
America. Trevor talked about all of the work we have done to reignite momentum in basketball, we have continued
momentum in sportswear.

So what we're referring to when we talk about being measured in the short term in Q4 is the recognition and reality that
it's a promotional marketplace, particularly North America is, in light of some of the digital disruption that's going on. I
think Kate earlier referred to there, select channels that are more challenged than others. What we're most excited about
is their dimensions of the market that are tremendous opportunities and so as we move into fiscal year 2018 what we're
really focused on is creating the springboard for accelerated growth in North America, again, through the triple-double.
And in the marketplace, obviously, one of those three-doubles is doubling our direct connection to consumers through
DTC and our wholesale strategic partners.
<Q - Lindsay Drucker Mann>: Got it. So, to the degree that the environment is disruptive, how do you think about
your ability to achieve the long-term revenue growth algorithm in North America that you laid out in your Investor
Day? Does the market dynamic make that harder to do?
<A - Andrew Campion>: Frankly, we're probably more bullish than ever on the long-term growth projection in North
America, and why I say that is it's becoming even more crystal clear to us that the strategies we've been employing to
elevate the experience; the personal service of consumers in the market; digital, we've been leading with nike.com, but
also membership, we're seeing much stronger growth in the dimensions of the market where NIKE is connecting with
consumers.
Of course, we connect with consumers in our direct-to-consumer business. We do it through concepts like House of
Hoops with Foot Locker. And as we said, in each of those dimensions and when you get down to purely digital
membership, we're just seeing the growth outpace or the sales-per-transaction outpace, and so we see our way to
incredibly strong growth in North America long term. There will be puts and takes in the short term. Clearly, with
innovation and disruption comes both puts and takes. I think by analogy, you might look to Greater China. Greater
China is a market that has had extraordinary growth by really focusing on aligning product, a NIKE-branded
environment but owned and through partners, and digital to fuel sustained growth.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: And one other thing too, I'd just say that the brand is extremely strong in North America,
and consumers' appetite for our brand continues to really be almost unsatisfied. So what we continue to do is make sure
that we line up the right products in the right environment. And as Andy spoke about, especially when we can do that
more direct and we can connect with the consumers more personally, we find that that continues to really allow us to
continue to expand the market and expand our position in the marketplace. So we do feel very confident about North
America in the long term, and we certainly feel the brand is very strong.
<A - Nitesh Sharan>: Thank you, Lindsay. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.
Operator
The last question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Thank you. Andy, a follow-up question for you. Your FX commentary spoke to longer-dated hedge
contracts. I believe you said the most significant impact in fiscal 2018. Can you elaborate some on that, please? Maybe
help us by sharing how much of the $1.6 billion to $2 billion you referenced will have been absorbed by year-end fiscal
2017.
<A - Andrew Campion>: Sure. So, as you probably know, Jim, and for others, we can't eliminate the impact of
foreign exchange. And as you know, over two years ago, we saw a significant strengthening of the dollar pretty
dramatically and quickly against a lot of international currencies, particularly the euro, and we've seen a lot of volatility
over the last couple of years, but largely dollar strengthening.
Our hedging strategy is largely using longer-dated, so 12 to 24 months out forward hedging to mitigate and delay that
impact. So when I spoke to the $1.6 billion to $2 billion of impact over two years, on a rate basis, you see those moves
happen in the foreign currency markets immediately, our hedging strategy essentially steps us down or frankly in the
opposite would step us up, but steps us down to that impact.

The largest, single annual impact will be in fiscal year 2018. That said, it hasn't been insignificant in fiscal year 2016 or
2017. It is actually – the FX impact has been a double-digit negative headwind on EPS growth. So while we continue to
deliver strong EPS growth, what we're actually most proud of is that excluding foreign currency, that would be
double-digits higher in terms of our growth. So that hopefully gives you a little bit more dimension, but we're not
providing a specific forecast as to the impact of FX on fiscal year 2018 today.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Fair enough. Considering the headwinds you are facing from FX, are there other areas in the P&L
that you hope to use to mitigate that as you look out to fiscal 2018?
<A - Andrew Campion>: Absolutely. And we have certainly done that over fiscal years 2016 and 2017. First and
foremost is growth. We are obviously a growth company and obsessed with attacking compelling growth opportunities
in the market. Long term obviously is our focus. But in the short term as well, I'd say from a margin perspective, the
underlying drivers of gross margin expansion are very strong, and we see those being very strong in fiscal year 2018
versus fiscal year 2017, again, on a currency neutral basis.
I mentioned that we continue to see opportunity to become even more fit for growth from an SG&A perspective
through editing to amplify. And what I would say is most importantly for us in the short term is how we're executing
against our long-term strategy. And that's what we're going to be most focused on as we finalize our plans for 2018 and
as we move through 2018 is executing against that triple-double that Mark referenced.
<A - Nitesh Sharan>: Thank you, Jim.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Thank you.
Nitesh Sharan
Okay. I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you, guys, for joining us. We'll speak with you soon.
