MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments second quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief
Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at TI.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available
through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding
forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings,
for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago.
Demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial
market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18%, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15%, compared
with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the
ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We
believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value
in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was
28.5% of revenue.

We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our
manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free
cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the
trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock
repurchases.
From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18%, primarily due to growth in power and signal chain, each of which
grew about the same amount. High volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year
ago, due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our
Other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties
to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
Now we'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive
demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digit. Industrial demand continued to strengthen, with
broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew, while results varied by customer.
Lastly, communications equipment grew, and enterprise systems was about even.
We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are the end markets where we've
been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the
fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they'll provide diversity
and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael?
Rafael R. Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion, or 64.3% of revenue. From
a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million, and on a trailing-12-month basis they were 22.3% of revenue,
which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important
element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of
intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Operating profit was $1.48 billion, or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 31.2%, up
from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated
positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second
quarter was $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, which included a $28 million discrete tax benefit, about what we
expected.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations
was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that
increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year.
Inventory days were 133, even with a year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the
quarter. On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing-12-month capital
expenditures were $527 million, or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital
expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion, or 28.5% of revenue.
Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth,
especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued
only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in
dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in
the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share

count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we
initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns of dividends and repurchases
demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to owners.
In the quarter, we retired $375 million of debt, and year-to-date we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issued
$600 million of debt in two tranches, $300 million each in four-year and seven-year notes. This leaves total debt of
$3.6 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to
our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our
U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and
earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.18, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit.
Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31%, compared with our prior expectation of about 30% due to our
outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assumes no discrete tax, no discrete items, and
it's what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term model.
Next, we're assuming discrete tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2017,
respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, translates to about 29% and 30% in the
third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models.
I will also remind analysts who are beginning to work their 2018 models that we would expect the discrete tax benefit
in 1Q 2018 to be higher than what we are projecting for the third and fourth quarters of 2017 but lower than 1Q 2017.
To estimate the 2018 annual operating tax rate, start with 2017 [ph] PBT (10:50) tax of 31% and apply a 35% tax rate
to any incremental profit. Then model discrete tax benefits by quarter, noting that first quarter is expected to be higher
than the others.
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen
our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let
me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an
opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q>: Hey. This is [ph] Gerald (12:23) on behalf of Ross. Just one question for me. You deal with how your end
markets changed year on year. Could you provide some details on how you estimate they changed quarter on quarter?
<A - David Pahl>: Sure, [ph] Gerald (12:35). For automotive, basically it increased sequentially, with all sectors
growing. Industrial – again, we saw very broad-based growth across the sectors, and overall it also increased. Personal
electronics increased with most sectors growing. Communications equipment was about even sequentially, and
enterprise systems also grew. Do you have a follow-on?
<Q>: Yeah, sure. So you talked in the past about R&D potentially being a little bit elevated near term. Now, you guys
came in slightly below our model for the quarter. How much longer could R&D be elevated in order to invest in the
business?

<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: I'll take that. First, I would point out that I know you're asking about R&D, but let me
address it from an OpEx standpoint. We look at the OpEx as a model, and our model is to be between 20% and 30% of
revenue, and in stable times to be at the lower half of that. In fact, that's where we've been in the last two and a half
years or so, 23% to 22%. Now we're running at 22% of revenue. And, again, in stable times, we think we can operate
there.
Now inside of that, both in R&D and actually in SG&A, we have various investments that are strengthening our
competitive advantages. So on the R&D front we continue to focus on industrial and automotive to continue to broaden
our portfolio. On the SG&A side, we invested to increase the reach of our channels, TI.com in particular. So our
thinking is that we're going to continue to make those investments to strengthen the company.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay, great. And we'll go next to our next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go now to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Adam Gonzalez>: Hi. Thanks. This is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. First question, maybe – could you contrast
auto's demand now versus say maybe six months ago? And industrial is an even larger market for you guys, even
though auto tends to get all the attention. Just wondering, do they correlate at all? Can industrial offset any potential
demand fluctuations in autos? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure. Yeah. So the strength that we've seen inside of automotive is something that we've seen for
probably greater than four years now. So – and I would attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of
our technologies, and really just the overall diversity of our positions. So we've got five sectors inside of automotive
that we're investing in. So that includes infotainment; safety systems; ADAS, or advanced driver assist systems;
powertrain, which includes EV and hybrid; and body electronics and lighting. So we're seeing good growth across
those – we call them sectors that sit inside of the automotive market. And really also diversity across subsystems
suppliers, across car companies, across geographical regions. So we feel really good about that.
Very similar story inside industrial, very broad-based growth. I won't speak to whether they'll be connected through
economic cycles or not. But both do have increasing content. So I'd be a little cautious to think that that increasing
content could offset a correction that we may see in a nearer term in any one given quarter or even in any one given
year. But we believe that there will be more content there over the longer term when you're looking five and 10 years.
And that's why our investments are higher there.
Do you have follow-on?
<Q - Adam Gonzalez>: Yeah. Thanks. My second question's more on your free cash flow growth. I'm just curious
why, if you look at it on a trailing-12-month basis, why free cash flow hasn't grown year on year despite your core
Analog and Embedded businesses growing in the low double-digit range? And what's the catalyst for maybe getting
that back to the higher single-digit, maybe low double-digit range? Thanks.
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Yeah, this is Rafael. Thanks for a chance to clarify that. First, in any given quarter, you're
going to have puts and takes on free cash flow, on any line of the P&L, but particularly on the cash flow statement. In
this particular quarter, and also on a trailing-12-month basis, what you see there is that we had an increased tax
payment in 2Q 2017 that was primarily due to our outlook for higher profitability this year.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Excuse me – with Citigroup.

<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Citi. Yeah.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Yeah, I haven't moved yet.
<A - David Pahl>: You haven't moved yet.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: I was there 15 years ago. Maybe they're looking at old transcripts.
<A - David Pahl>: That could be.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: As long as I'm not unemployed. I had a question on gross margin. So your revenue is
basically back to where it was in the third – well, I guess a little bit higher than it was in the third quarter last year, but
the gross margins are 230 basis points higher. Can you just kind of give us the reasons why they're higher? Then what
would be the gross margin drivers going forward?
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Yeah, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So our gross margins in second quarter 2017 ended
at 64.3%, and that was 300 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. And that just reflects the quality of our
product portfolio as we continue to focus on automotive and industrial, but also the efficiency of our manufacturing
strategy. And, as you know, we have the unique advantage of having a 300-millimeter factory that at the chip level
provides a 40% cost advantage. As of 2016, we had about $2.5 billion of our revenue running through 300 millimeter,
and as we continue to grow the company, and in this case Analog in particular, and that growth primarily runs to 300
millimeter, then we're going to accrue that benefit over and over and over. And it's a cumulative benefit that really
yields some nice results to the gross margin line but even more important to the free cash flow and free cash flow per
share for the owners of the company.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Yeah. Another thing that is going on out there – at least some of your competitors have
talked about their lead times extending. Is that happening at all at TI?
<A - David Pahl>: Chris, I'd describe our lead times as continuing to remain stable. We do have pockets where we've
got a processor package supply tightness, but we're aggressively working those. But overall our lead times continue to
remain stable.
Okay. Thank you. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.
<Q - William Stein>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. It's sort of a follow-up to the last one. We've heard quite a
bit about shortages for complementary products, the semis in particular on the passive side. And I'm hoping to find out
if TI is seeing any sort of capping of its growth opportunities because customers are certainly not going to order parts
from you if they can't get a full kit -
<A - David Pahl>: Right.
<Q - William Stein>: – from all of their suppliers. Are you seeing that dynamic play out at all?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, well, I would say in general, I'm not sure we could see that if it was there. But I'd just remind
you that about 60% of our revenues are on consignment. So we've got no inventory of our product sitting in front of the
customer's production line that they own – we may have it positioned that it sits on our balance sheet – and same thing
with distributors. But we actually do get demand forecasts from them, and those oftentimes will be several months out,
sometimes even as far as six months out. And that doesn't mean that they can't change. And I'd say for that, where we
do have very good visibility, you won't see anything unusual going on inside of there, no unusual expedites or
cancellations or those types of things.

Do you have follow-on?
<Q - William Stein>: Yeah, maybe you could comment on order linearity through the quarter and book-to-bill.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure. Yeah. So, again, I'll make the comment that we've got 60% of our revenues on consignment.
So there we actually don't have orders or backlogs. We only see those demand forecasts. So book-to-bill is less helpful
inside of that. But orders, if you look at through the month, they were strong overall, and they did accelerate as we went
through the quarter and into the month of June. Book-to-bill overall was 1.06.
So. And with that, we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
<Q - Harlan Sur>: Good afternoon. Solid job on the quarterly execution, margin expansion, and on the outlook.
Clearly macro demand trends are strong in your end markets. Similar to last quarter, I'm just wondering if you could
just talk about some of the demand trends from a geographic perspective. I think last quarter you guys saw
year-over-year growth in most of the geographies. Wondering if you can just provide us with some details on the June
quarter.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure, Harlan. Year over year, revenue was up in all regions, so Asia, Europe, the U.S., and Japan on
a year-over-year basis, and that was true additionally on a sequential basis. So we saw growth really across the board
there. And, just as a reminder, some know this well and some don't, that we track our revenue on where we ship it. So
it's not where that product is ultimately consumed. So we may ship into a car manufacturer or a Tier 1 car manufacturer
in Europe, and that car may end up and be sold in China, as an example. So it really is not a good look-through for end
consumption by market.
Do you have a follow-on?
<Q - Harlan Sur>: Yeah, I do. Thanks for the color there. So on Embedded, strong year-over-year growth in sales. I
think your operating profitability was up something like almost 600 basis points year over year. Is this mostly leverage
on the OpEx as you drive revenue growth? Or are there some positive mix benefits? I'm not sure, for example, if some
of your processor solutions going into automotive carry, like, a higher gross margin profile?
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: This is Rafael. What I would tell you is that the main driver of what you're seeing here is the
revenue growth as we have over a number of years now, we've refocused our investments in Embedded. And now that's
really paying off very nicely. Embedded has – quite a bit of our investment there is in automotive and industrial, just
like it is in Analog. And then, as we have said, those are the best markets, and that's yielding very nice results.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah.
<Q - Harlan Sur>: Great.
<A - David Pahl>: Thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to our next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess two questions from me as well. First off,
historically you guys have always talked about this 30 to 40 basis points of share gain I think on an annual basis. I'm
just wondering, given the inflection of R&D higher over the last several quarters now, should we start to think about
share gains potentially accelerating? Or are share gains happening in places where the margin profile is much richer?
And when do you see those benefits starting to transfer for you guys on the revenue line?

Page 7 of 10
<A - David Pahl>: Well, I'll take a shot at that, and if Rafael wants to add something, he can jump in.
I would just say that as we look and allocate R&D, we're allocating those to the best projects that we can find, ones that
are going to produce, get designed into the most customers, into the most markets, and have longevity of revenue. And
really mostly that's about finding better opportunities to invest in than trying to just double the number of product, as an
example that we're doing. But we have found more opportunities to make investments. It's things – as our products live
longer and repurposed products into adjacent markets, we've found opportunities to be able to do that.
So – and I'd say just in general, the quality of the opportunity sure doesn't shift very quickly. And so we're not penciling
in an inflection point inside of our revenue. But when we look at our competitive advantages – and I'd just say, just as a
reminder, all four of those working together and the investments that we're making, and that includes the manufacturing
and technology, the most visible one there is the 300-millimeter advantage that we have, the broad product portfolio,
just the tens of thousands of products that we've got, the opportunity to sell more products to more customers, the reach
of the channel markets, including TI.com that Rafael had mentioned earlier, as well as our sales force, and then just the
diverse and long-lived positions. All those working together, I think, gives us confidence that, in the future, that we can
continue to gain share in that range of 30 to 40 basis points.
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Yeah. The only thing I would add is, as you know, and we talk about it quite a bit, we've
been focusing on automotive and industrial for quite some time now, because those are the best markets. They have the
highest semiconductor content growth, and we're confident that we'll continue to have that for many years to come. So,
as of the end of last year, 51% of our revenue was automotive and industrial, and obviously with the growth we're
seeing year-to-date, that number appears to be ticking up, that percentage. So as that number increases, and we continue
driving performance on those two segments, then mathematically overall our revenue will do better.
<A - David Pahl>: Great. Amit, do you have a follow-on?
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: I do, and hopefully I don't jinx this trend right now, but last four quarters I think in a row you
guys have been pretty much at the high end of the revenue guide that you guys initially provide. Is there a change in the
way you provide guide or you roll up the revenue forecast? I think you've actually ended up at the high end for four
quarters in a row. Or it just happened to be the case?
<A - David Pahl>: It's really the latter. When we look at the out quarter, again, we've got 60% of the revenue that we
don't have order patterns to look at, but we can actually see the demand patterns that our customers have. And that can
move in both directions pretty quickly, right? So even though we've got great visibility there, things can strengthen or
weaken very quickly on us. But we do have very, very good visibility for that 60% of our revenue. And the rest of it we
do look at the backlog. We look at order patterns on – our sales teams provide forecasts as well. So we go through a
bottoms-up and a tops-down approach. So the revenue guidance that we gave you for the third quarter is our best
estimate of what we think we'll do.
Okay. Thank you, Amit, and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results, and thanks for letting me
ask a question. Rafael, I apologize if I missed this, but wondering if you can just talk a little bit about OpEx trends
going into the September quarter. Typically, it's a seasonally down quarter for OpEx. I'm just kind of curious, is that
how we should be thinking about modeling it this September? Or are there some incentive or variable bonus offsets that
might actually have OpEx flat or up sequentially?
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Yeah, I'll be happy to add some clarity on that. As you know, we don't guide specifically on
OpEx or GPM, any line for that matter, other than revenue and EPS. But on OpEx – and I should say on OpEx we
focus on the model, the 20% to 30%, and we've been operating in the lower half of that, so we'd like you guys to think

about it that way. I would tell you, though, if we had anything unusual going on in OpEx, we would point that out,
second to third, and we do not. And we also don't have anything like a vacation or compensation adjustments that
sometimes -or we do see fourth to first, for example. We do not have that going on in that second to third transition.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah. And just to add to that, when you look at our history, we've had some restructurings in the
last few third quarters that you may have seen that transition. But as Rafael stated, there's not a seasonal impact that
you see inside of third quarter typically.
Do you have a follow-on, John?
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah. Dave, I just wondered if you can just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the
auto market, because clearly over the last several years it's been one of the better [ph] markets (31:11) for semis, but
there have been some sort of mixed data points, SAAR's decelerating. You've seen some auto manufacturers actually
cutting forecasts into the back half of the year. So I guess how do you think about kind of SAAR unit growth versus
content growth? And how's the visibility there? And are you seeing things that others might have highlighted last week
on their conference calls?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah. So the one thing that's been clear, our business has grown very strong for four years plus
now. And that's really due to the early investments that we had made inside of this market and we continue to make.
And, again, we're trying to ensure that we're making those investments as broad as we can. So we're not dependent on
one particular technology or one type of portion of the demand that's increasing.
And clearly the – I think it's well-known that SC content has grown faster inside of autos than, jeez, if you just go down
into a showroom you can see that pretty clearly in any car today versus even just a few years ago. So we're confident
that that trend will continue, and we've also seen the announcements, like you've mentioned, that some car companies
have reduced their build plans. We certainly continue to monitor those markets overall, but we're confident in our
long-term position there, and we'll continue to make those investments.
Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

We'll go now to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi, guys.
<A - David Pahl>: Hi, Ambrish.
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Hi.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hey, sorry about that. Straddling two calls, and I apologize if this has been answered
already. In the reported quarter, where did the upside come versus your expectations going into the quarter?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, Ambrish, things were pretty strong, really across the board. So we saw growth really in most
markets, most geographies, and even a lot of the subsectors inside of automotive and industrial.
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: I would just add, three-quarters of our growth came from industrial and automotive, so that
just shows you how strong those were.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay. And -
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Yes, I did, Dave. And this is – you were kind enough always when we have – this topic
comes up every couple quarters, and not surprisingly. We're in an economic expansion for a while now, top of the
cycle. You have metrics that you look at, which are cancellations, booking, and so you share them quite frequently with
us. Where is TI's business on those metrics, Dave? Thank you.

<A - David Pahl>: Yeah. So I would say that if you look again inside of distribution, our inventory there remains at
about four weeks. It's actually down sequentially and down from a year ago. Our visibility into customers' inventories
of course varies depending on if we're on consignment or not. So, with our consigned OEMs, we're not seeing anything
that's unusual there such as expedites that would suggest that we have an issue. And of course our visibility into
inventory beyond what customers manufacture in their operations is very low overall. So again cancellations remain
low. Lead times continue to remain steady. So all of those metrics I think really are very similar to what we saw 90
days ago.
So thank you, Ambrish. And I think we have time for one more call.

We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financial.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. Appreciate it. Congratulations on the nice execution. I wanted
to come back on the gross margin point, so congratulations on getting to 64% in the quarter. When I look at the
incremental for the quarter, it was 79%, which is above the 68% to 69% level that it had been for the last five or six
quarters – not unprecedented, but looked like a step up. Is that something we should interpret as being more
sustainable? Or were there some either mix items or other lumpy 300-millimeter transition items that contributed to the
atypical surge in the quarter?
<A - Rafael R. Lizardi>: Yeah. This is Rafael. What I would tell you is that any given quarter, the pull-throughs will
be a little different. In a company the size of ours, there's just a lot of puts and takes inside this big P&L. The more
important thing to remember is that we have some fundamental structural drivers that have increased our GPM percent,
and we think going to continue increasing our GPM percent for the foreseeable future. And those are the quality of the
portfolio as we continue to focus on the best markets, automotive and industrial, and the diversity and long-lived
positions that we get with those, where we invest R&D today and we get the revenue for decades to come.
And then the other piece is 300-millimeter Analog. As I stated earlier, that it's 40% more cost-efficient than 200
millimeter, and that accrues, meaning you start one part on that and then the next part you start it on 300, and the third
part, and the fourth part, and next thing you know a bigger percentage of your company is running on 300 millimeter.
And it was only the 30% as of 2016, the 30% of the capacity that we have on 300 was used. So we have ample room to
continue growing 300 millimeter and accrue benefits to the company.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Got it. [ph] Great message. (37:31)
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Yeah, thank you. Just regarding the end market color you provided in response to an earlier
question, Dave, comms sounded kind of flattish quarter on quarter. Can you just refresh our memory in terms of where
the company stands with respect to how it's looking at comms from a strategic standpoint and where you see demand as
we look around and look at 4G infrastructure investments being made globally? Thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure. Yeah, so comms equipment is 13% of our total revenue. The wireless infrastructure will be a
sector inside of that, which tends to take a lot of the calls. It's more than half of that end market by itself. So probably
somewhere in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue. And there I think when we look at incremental
dollars of where we're investing, if I refer you back to our capital management call that we gave back in February, we
talked about the fact that we wanted to increase incrementally dollars in both the industrial and automotive markets,
because that's where we believe the growth will be.
With communications equipment, I would say that we've got some caveats depending on which business we're looking
at. In Embedded, I would say that those investments are down versus where they were maybe five years ago. But on the
same view, inside of Analog, they're actually up because of some of the complexity that's being developed inside of the
radio. So we do believe that that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of

time, but we just don't believe that there's going to be significant growth. We don't know of any carriers that want to
take up their CapEx over the next five and 10 years over a longer period of time.
So thank you for that question, Craig.
