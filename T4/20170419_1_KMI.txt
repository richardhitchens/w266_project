MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants will be
in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is
being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Mr. Kinder, you
may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Carrie, and welcome to our first quarter analyst call. As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind
you that today's earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP
financial measures.
We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures
set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.
I'll kick this off by making a few remarks, and then I'll turn it over to Steve Kean, our CEO; and Kim Dang, our CFO,
to give the operational and financial update, and then we'll take any questions that you have.

I want to quickly make two points. First of all, this quarter's good results in terms of EBITDA and DCF, which Steve
and Kim will discuss in detail, demonstrates once more the strength of the asset portfolio at KMI. We're able to
generate substantial amounts of cash flow even in a challenging environment in our business. Sometimes, good solid
financial and operational success, which is made possible only by a lot of hard work by the whole team, gets
overlooked by some investors. But I would argue that it's one of the critical elements to the long-term economic health
of any entity and that includes Kinder Morgan.
The second point I want to make is that Steve will update you in detail on this quarter's developments on our Elba and
Trans Mountain projects, but let me say we continue to make good progress on them and on our goal of strengthening
our balance sheet and thereby allowing us to return substantial value to our shareholders through some combination of
dividend increases, share repurchases, additional attractive growth projects or further debt reduction. Now, as I've said
previously, we currently believe the best avenue for returning value is by an increased and well-covered dividend and
we expect to announce our revised dividend guidance for 2018 later this year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks. I'll give you a few updates on our performance and our key projects. First, we had a very good first
quarter with DCF per share at $0.54 and that's better than our beginning of the year guidance. Right now, we're seeing
that and calling that as timing, so we're still forecasting to be on plan for the full-year, but overall strong performance
for the quarter.
On our Trans Mountain project, we've made progress on the project itself and also on our effort to either joint venture
the project with a partner or to include it in an IPO. On the project, we reached a really significant milestone. We
increased our cost estimate and that increase put us above the contractual cap, so the cap was CAD 6.8 billion and our
revised estimate is CAD 7.42 billion, and that being above the cap, gave our shippers the right to turn capacity back to
us.
At the investor conference in January, we expressed our confidence that the market still had a very strong need for the
project and in fact when all was said and done, all 708,000 barrels remain under long-term contract, but now with the
increased tolls and those increased tolls include our return on the additional capital that was spent.
We ended up with only 3% of the barrels turned back and those were taken up in an open season over the course of a
week or a week and a half. The contracts are 15-year, but primarily 20-year terms, predominantly 20-year terms. This is
a remarkable development when you consider that these contracts were signed five years ago in a $90 a barrel oil
environment and when the Canadian and U.S. dollars were at parity. A lot's changed since then, including the
circumstances of many of the producers in the oilsands as well as the project costs themselves.
Our shippers and our commercial team worked very hard and fast to place the barrels with new customers and existing
customers who wanted more, as those who wanted less looked for places to assign their capacity. The message here is
that even at the higher cost, the demand for the project remains strong and that's huge. We've essentially reconfirmed
the value and need for the project with a 2017 line up of shipper needs and based on 2017 market conditions.
We also received during the quarter our environmental approval from British Columbia and we now have written
agreement on the satisfaction of the BC five conditions which were put forward for heavy oil pipelines crossing the
province. So good regulatory development and an extremely good commercial development as well. So that's on the
project.
On the JV or IPO front, we've advanced on both tracks simultaneously, which is what we told you we would do in
January. We believe this approach provides the best opportunity for us to secure acceptable financing terms for the
project. Our key considerations here are value and control of project governance. Both of these processes are well
advanced and we expect to update you by the end of the quarter on the resolution.

Recall that for our plan we assumed a JV partner picking up 50% of the capital, but we did not include anything for a
promote payment which we would expect to get in coming up with our target 5.4 times debt-to-EBITDA metric. So in
other words, we can do better on that target to the extent we get the promote that we expect to get.
I know everyone is interested in what the value is going to be, but we've avoided putting a marker out there for the sake
of maintaining a strong negotiating position, but I'll say this, it's an attractive return project and is consistent with the
6.7x EBITDA multiple average that we have for the backlog as a whole.
As we announced earlier, we completed our Elba JV transaction in the first quarter and it was at the value that we put in
the plan for 2017 and that included value in excess of our capital spend, recognizing the value that we created in
originating the project.
On the backlog, I'll be brief, this quarter it stands at $11.7 billion, $300 million lower than last quarter. As usual, there
are multiple moving parts, small project additions, and removals, and some cost changes, but the main development is
that we placed into service our Kinder Morgan Export Terminal, liquids terminal dock and cross-channel line project
for one of our refinery customers on the Ship Channel, the Houston Ship Channel.
We expect to update the backlog for the Trans Mountain outcome next quarter, so the project cost would now be
approximately $5.7 billion, and the ownership level is, of course, expected to change.
One more project update before moving to a few commercial highlights, on our Utopia Pipeline Project, our project
team has done an excellent job of acquiring right-of-way and finding routing alternatives where necessary in the wake
of an adverse court decision last year on eminent domain in one of the Ohio Circuit courts. We're pleased with our
progress, and we began the tree felling process in the first quarter. This joint venture project is under a long-term
contract and is expected to be in service in January of this – of next year.
Now, a few commercial market updates, starting with the Gas segment. We experienced slightly increased transmission
volumes year-over-year, but gathering volumes were down. I'll start with gathering. We're generally seeing a leveling
off of volumes in our key basins during the first quarter, but the comparison to first quarter last year reflects the
declines that took place throughout 2016.
Generally, our volumes are in line with what is observed in the basins in which in operate, although we're running a
little bit ahead in our Bakken gas assets with one exception, and that's the Haynesville where we are down on our
KinderHawk asset, while the basin is flat to slightly higher. That's a function of the fact that our primary customer was
not active in 2016. That's beginning to change, and we have added a new customer that's actively developing its
acreage. So we expect some improvement there.
Recall that our Gas segment is 55% of our segment earnings before DD&A, and gathering and processing is only 18%
of that number. On the transmission volumes, we're up 1% year-over-year. The winter was weak, it was weak last year
too, but we had a cold March in 2016. Power demand was down year-over-year. What I've read predicts that gas will
still exceed coal as a share of the power market again this year, but some gas to coal switching did occur on our assets
in the first quarter. Also, we saw higher renewable including California hydropower contributing to the year-over-year
decline.
Overcoming this, though, were exports to Mexico, which were up 16% year-over-year on our system, and now
averaging 2.8 Bcf a day – averaging 2.8 Bcf a day for the first quarter. Recall that the vast majority of our margin here
is secured by reservation fees which are not affected by usage, but the volume information helps give a view on
long-term value for the capacity. I failed to mention also that LNG exports were up on our system year-over-year by
0.5 Bcf a day.
We signed up an additional [ph] 400 (10:14) a day of long-term firm transportation commitments in the quarter. [ph]
100 (10:18) of that was existing, but previously unsold capacity, that brings our total in the last three and a quarter
years to 8.4 Bcf of new sign up, of which 2.2 Bcf is existing previously unsold capacity.
We recently announced two developments related to the Permian. First, we announced a non-binding open season for a
1.7 Bcf new-build pipeline from the Waha Hub in West Texas to Agua Dulce in South Texas, our Gulf Coast Express

project. Last week, DCP announced its potential participation in that project as a partner and a shipper, and we're
working with them over the next 90 days or so to try to finalize that arrangement.
DCP's assets in the Permian would provide good upstream connectivity, and our Texas Intrastate network will provide
excellent downstream connectivity to Mexico, LNG at Corpus Christi and utility and industrial markets along the Texas
Gulf Coast. Gas production is growing in the Permian, and increasingly East Texas is becoming a premium market. I
think the project makes a good deal of sense, but we're in the early days and we have not put it in the backlog.
The second development related to the Permian is we have a binding open season on our EPNG system for capacity to
the Waha Hub. The open season package includes [ph] 150 (11:46) a day of existing capacity, but it also reflects our
ability to expand this system by as much as [ph] 900 (11:53) a day more to meet incremental demand. The expansions
would be relatively inexpensive, and would again demonstrate the value of having existing infrastructure that we can
build off of at attractive returns.
The project with feed takeaway capacity of Waha, including the potential Gulf Coast Express Pipeline in our midstream
business, and we continue to work both of those opportunities over the coming weeks.
The overall summary on gas is that we continue to expect long-term benefit in this sector from increased LNG, Mexico
exports, power and industrial demand which should drive the demand for transportation and storage infrastructure for
the long term.
Shifting to our Products segment, refined products volumes are up 1% year-over-year even though we experienced
some weakness in Southeast U.S. markets. Crude and condensate transportation volumes are also up 1%
year-over-year, notwithstanding declines year-over-year in the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.
KMCC, in particular, continues to show the benefit of its superior connectivity both on the supply in the Eagle Ford as
well as on the market end in the greater Houston area, and holding up very well in the face of declines experienced in
the Eagle Ford, as a whole, on a year-over-year basis.
In our Terminals business, our liquids terminals utilization climbed to over 95% as we continue to benefit from the
strong positions we built in, in several liquid hub locations. And this team has been gradually migrating its business
increasingly to the liquids part of the business. We are now at 80% of our segment earnings before DD&A coming
from the liquids part of the business and increasingly, our development activity is in the hub positions that we have
built in Houston, Edmonton, New York and Chicago over the years.
We have kept our Jones Act vessels under charter on renewals that we've experienced, on rollovers and renewals.
We've had to discount to do that, but we expect to be slightly ahead of our plan on this business and we currently have
all of our vessels under charter.
We continue to make good progress on our Base Line Terminal expansion at our Edmonton hub, and as I mentioned,
we've put our Kinder Morgan Export Terminal project in service on the Houston Ship Channel.
In the CO2 business, we came in slightly ahead of plan for the quarter, with pricing offsetting lower crude production
volumes. Also of note is that we achieved record CO2 volumes during the first quarter. Our demand was up and so
were our third-party sales, good strong demand for CO2 off of our system.
So again, overall a strong quarter, with strong financial performance, continued progress on our project execution and
on our joint venture plans for our key projects.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Great. Thanks, Steve. Today we are declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, which is consistent with our budget. On
the performance, let me hit the high points first and then I'll take you through the details.

I'll start with the GAAP numbers and then move to DCF. DCF is the way we look at and think about our numbers and
performance.
Earnings per share attributable to common stockholders is up 50% in the quarter. Now, it would be nice to take credit
for a 50% increase, but I don't think that gives us an accurate – that's an accurate view of the way we perceive our
performance.
Adjusted earnings per share, which we've added for you on the GAAP income statement, and adjust for certain items, is
down $0.01 a share.
DCF per share, which is the primary way we judge our performance, is down 1% or $18 million versus the first quarter
2016. All of which is attributable to the sale of a 50% interest in SNG. So after the sale, DCF per share would be flat.
For the first quarter, the DCF per share of $0.54 is slightly better than our budget, and for the full year, we remain on
target to generate $1.99 of DCF per share.
On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA, consistent with where we ended 2016, but a
significant improvement versus the 5.6 times in the first quarter 2016.
Now for the details: looking at the preliminary GAAP income statement, let me point out a couple of things to you
there. You'll see that revenues are up by 7% in the quarter, the cost of sales is up by more, resulting in about $121
million reduction in gross margin. Adjusting for certain items, gross margin would actually be down slightly more,
would be done $146 million.
The largest contributor to this decrease is the 50% sale of SNG. As a result of that sale, we no longer consolidate SNG's
revenue and cost of sales, but report our 50% interest in net income further down the income statement as equity
earnings.
Now keep in mind also that SNG did not have significant cost of sale. The impact of de-consolidating SNG was
approximately $145 million reduction in gross margin for the quarter. Therefore, excluding the sale, gross margin
would essentially be flat, which is consistent with how we would view our results.
Net income available to the common shareholders is $401 million or $0.18 a share versus $276 million loss or $0.12
per share – $276 million of income, sorry, or $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Resulting in $125 million or
$0.06 per share increase, or 45% and 50%, respectively.
Net income available to common shareholders before certain items or adjusted earnings of $371 million or $0.17 a
share versus the adjusted number in 2016 of $402 million or $0.18 a share.
Certain items in the first quarter of this year are income of $30 million, the largest of which is associated with proceeds
we received from the sale of a bankruptcy claim from one of our natural gas pipelines. Certain items in the first quarter
2016 were a net expense of $132 million, driven primarily by project write-offs and impairments.
Now let's turn to the second page of financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and the year and is reconciled to
our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. As I said earlier, DCF is the primary financial measure on which we judge
our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.215 billion versus $1.233 billion for the comparable
period in 2016, down $18 million or 1%. There are lots of moving parts, but the simple explanation I gave you earlier is
true, which is that after the sale of 50% interest in S&G that occurred in the third quarter of 2016 we would be flat.
Segment EBITDA, before certain items, is down $90 million when you look up at the segment. That's primarily due to
$113 million reduction in our Natural Gas segment. Of the $113 million reduction, $83 million is attributable to the
SNG sale and the Natural Gas decline is partially offset by a $26 million increase in our Terminals segment which is
associated with expansion projects coming online in the marine division and in the Gulf Coast.
G&A and interest are a benefit of $44 million in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2016, both largely as a result of
the SNG transaction. In our adjustments to convert net income to DCF, we add back JV DD&A and subtract sustaining
CapEx to more closely reflect the cash we expect to receive from our JV. Because SNG is a JV in the first quarter of

2017 versus a fully consolidated asset in the first quarter of 2016, there is approximately a $17 million benefit between
the two periods in our adjustment from net income to DCF to reflect the economic impact of the SNG JV.
So $90 million reduction in the segment, you add back the $17 million benefit to reflect the economic impact of the
SNG transaction, the $44 million reduction between interest and G&A expense, and that gives you a net reduction of
DCF of $29 million, which largely reconciles to the change of $18 million in DCF.
DCF per share was $0.54 versus $0.55 in the first quarter of the prior year, or down $0.01, almost all of which is
associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through. This $0.54 in DCF results in $935 million of excess
distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter.
As I said earlier, for the quarter we are ahead of budget, but for the full year we expect to be on budget largely as a
result of some timing associated with sustaining CapEx, interest and cash taxes that occur in the second, third and
fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet, on the balance sheet, as I said, we ended the quarter at 5.3 times net
debt-to-EBITDA, consistent with where we ended 2016. Our budget for 2017 is that we would expect to end 2017 at
5.4 times debt-to-EBITDA. After the first quarter performance, we're still on track to achieve that. Remember, as Steve
said, the budget nor the current forecast include any proceeds from a Trans Mountain promote which we would expect
to receive, and therefore, we would expect that our actual results will improve on the 5.4 times budget and forecast.
I'll reconcile debt for you, we ended the quarter at $37.8 billion of net debt. That's a $317 million decrease from the end
of 2016. We generated DCF of $1.215 billion. We had expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments of
$773 million. We had asset sales and JV proceeds of $462 million, the largest of which was $391 million that we
received from the Elba JV. We paid dividends of $280 million, and then we had working capital and other items of a
little bit over $300 million.
The working capital is what we would expect in the first quarter. In the first quarter we typically see working capital
associated with interest payment because we have a large portion of interest payments which occur in the first quarter.
And so interest was a use of cash of $165 million in the quarter. We pay a significant amount of property tax in the first
quarter that was a use of cash of $77 million. And then bonuses get paid in the first quarter, and that was a use of cash
of about $75 million. So those were the three primary uses of cash in the $300 million of working capital.
So with that, Steve, Rich?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kristina Kazarian of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now
open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Kristina. How are you?
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Good. Afternoon, guys. How are you doing?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: All right. So can you guys talk to me a little more about how you're thinking about the new
Permian project, particularly the gas takeaway pipe; how the DCP deal came about? And if you're also willing, maybe
project costs and any updates on the open season?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So I'll start with the open season. It's closing shortly. Again, it's non-binding. The DCP
discussions started early, even before our announcement of the deal, then continued up until – well, they'll be
continuing on, but ripened enough that they – we did a joint announcement of their participation.
And again, the rationale there is we get upstream connectivity with their processing assets and pipes in the Permian.
And then we have downstream connectivity from all the market that we connect to on what we think is the best
intrastate system in Texas connecting to LNG, Mexico, et cetera.
We're – I think there's enthusiasm for it but again, it's non-binding. Producers, I think, are increasingly turning their
attention to finding additional routes out of the Permian. Sometimes that takes some time to ripen, but certainly there is
interest in it. And we'll also cultivate interest on the demand side as well.
And on the demand side, one of the things that we can do and have talked to people about is, we are a buyer of gas in
Texas because we have a lot of sales gas customers in the state of Texas. And so one of the things we could do is buy at
the inlet to this piece of pipe, and that may serve as a bit of a bridge for some of the producer markets out there.
So any parts of your question I missed?
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Project cost.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Cost, yeah, we haven't come out with costs yet, but I mean it is a 1.7 Bcf new-build projects.
You're looking at north of $1 billion.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Perfect. And then my next question is, we've seen a good bump in Eagle Ford rig count
recently. Can you maybe talk about how this is trending versus your original expectations; and any chance for a
positive revision related to this?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I mean, I think it's going, I think, as we expect with the price recovery that we've
seen. So I think generally what we're seeing in the basin is a bottoming out of volume, both crude and gas really this
quarter trending flat to slightly up starting next quarter and then probably finishing the year higher than it is today.
And that's kind of where we set our plan coming into the year, and I think generally that's how we're seeing it play out,
maybe slightly more activity than we were anticipating to this point. But I think how all that materializes as far as
actually bringing volume online versus just drilling, that still needs to be play out over the year.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I think we build – as we started – we ended the year kind of where we started with some
declines early and then picking up. I think some developments that have been encouraging is the rig count has been up
a good bit. The other thing is – and these are related – is that acreage has been changing hands down there. So it's going
from people who are not actively developing to people who are actively developing, and that's a positive indication for
the basin, too.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: And, Steve, last real quick one from me is, I know you said end of 2Q for timing and we're
still waiting on FID and arranging project financing. But any other color you want to give maybe for what we should be
waiting for?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. Those are the key things, really. I mean we're running both of these processes
simultaneously, and the reason for doing that, of course, is to get to a value point that reflects a fully negotiated deal or
a fully marketed process. And it's not fully marketed or fully negotiated until it's done. And so we're not there yet, and
so we haven't picked yet.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Got it. Nice job on the quarter, guys. Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering Holt & Company. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brandon. How are you?
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: I'm good. How are you, Rich?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Let's see, after probably just a couple of follow-ups on Kristina's questions. One on Gulf
Coast Express, Steve, you talked quickly about some projects on El Paso I think on the inlet side of that pipe. So I was
wondering, one, if you could describe in a little bit more detail what those projects would look like? Are we talking
about reversing compressor stations? Or adding compression? Or both? And then more detail on the downstream side
of that pipe. Clearly, there's a way to get volumes up and down the Texas Gulf Coast, but any comments on is there
anything that needs to be done to that intrastate system? Or is there just plenty of unutilized capacity there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. Yeah. So the open season on El Paso has [ph] 150 (29:41) a day of capacity that's
existing. That comes in a bit over time as the contract rolls off, but that's [ph] 150 (29:49) without moving a muscle.
We've got that capacity available, and we can do it today. We can get another [ph] 900 (29:56) of expansion. And the
first, if you want to think of it this way, the first half of that roughly is relatively small CapEx. It's back pressure valves
and things like that that we could probably do on our – and a few pipe modifications.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Very small.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Meter station modifications, and we can probably do that under our blanket certificate,
could do that relatively quickly. And that's a nice pickup and again underscores the value of having pipe in an active
basin that we can make some adjustments to.
The second half of that expansion to get up to that [ph] 900 (30:35) a day of incremental would require compression.
So that's a little bit pricier, but again, not much. It's not significant, little bit of pipeline build, Tom, maybe, but it's not a
significant investment, but that would require a 7(c).
In terms of getting – once you get the Texas, gas will be flowing south and east primarily, east to Corpus and south to
Mexico. We are expanding that network with the crossover expansion that we've got in service – that we put into
service in September of last year. So we've got – and it's a network, so you've got options there, and it doesn't cost us
much to expand that as needed for takeaway. But my guess is, and Tom you're going to opine there may be some
expansions – if people want to take significant volumes to Houston, we may need some expansions.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. If they want to take all 1.7 Bcf to Houston...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. That will be a problem. We will be happy to have that problem, but...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Short of that I mean there's a lot of really just changing the direction of the flow. I mean,
we compressed [indiscernible] (31:43) today, and a fair amount of that going to serve Mexico in that – some of that
market today. So it's just letting that volumes stay north, and then actually we could pump some of that pump, maybe,
originally these facilities were constructed to move gas from South Texas to Houston. So we have that capability today.
And the other takeaway, there is other takeaway, when you get to Waha that's a significant hub and there is significant
capacity coming on line from Waha to Mexico. So that's the other value adding component of the EPNG project.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think once again we've said over the years how valuable it is to have the huge footprint
that we have, particularly on the natural gas side, and this is just one more indicator of how valuable that is. Now, the
project is not done yet, the open season hasn't concluded, but the fact of having all that pipe in the ground is an
enormous advantage when you start talking about expansions and extensions of your system.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Great color. And then I'll probably just follow on on that topic. Competitive environment
we have three pipes essentially very similar paths announced in the same time period. So, one, just what the
competitive landscape looks like that vis-à-vis producer interest? And then related, is there any chance of moving

around the project if there is demand and interest, say, earlier in 2019 or even late in 2018. Is there something that can
be done more quickly in order to satisfy some residue gas takeaway issues?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, it's an intrastate project, so it's not a federal process. So if the demand is there and it's
there in a hurry, we can move more quickly. Yeah, it is a competitive environment, but I feel like we've got the best
downstream connectivity here. And we touch all of the major markets including all the big growing markets, and I
think that's a real advantage. I mean, getting to Agua Dulce didn't used to be a very big deal. You were just in South
Texas. If you're in Agua Dulce and connected to our system and you can go to Mexico or you can go to Corpus Christi
or you can go to Houston, then you've really got something.
Now, we're working to solve for the upstream piece, and that's where DCP, I think, is a very nice fit. But there are
others out there, too, who we could coordinate with to make sure that we can get the gas to Waha, and of course EPNG
expansion fits very, very nicely with that.
So, we think we've got a very good offering. I'm sure that the other competitors would say the same thing, but I think
that you look at the upstream and the downstream and we've got a very nice offering.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: And one thing I'd add, Steve, is we are – we do see interest from some of our customers
and the intrastate network actually wanting to reach back potentially all the way to Waha, so again, I think that's
something that we offer in our project that our competitors don't.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right. Plus, we'd like to buy some of the gas.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Right. Perfect. Thank you very much, guys.

Our next question is from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Shneur. Good afternoon.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just to start off following up on some of the questions with
respect to the Permian Gulf Coast Express. With respect to that project with DCP potentially being on the project, how
far away are you from getting to a commitment level that you would feel comfortable moving forward with the project?
Does it get you fairly close?
And then, secondly, when we think about project returns, I know that the board has sort of been enforcing a mid-teens
type of return hurdle. Is that something that you would need for this project to proceed or just given the contracted
nature of a pipe like this, you'd be willing to accept a lower return hurdle to move forward with the project?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's early to be talking about that. I mean, we've got a non-binding open season that's closing,
and I think while there's shipper interest, certainly, producer interest, this is a maturing situation as they're looking at
takeaway capacity out of the Permian and their own production. And so I think, frankly, we're a ways off there in terms
of maturing or ripening the project.
I think we've got a good offering. I think DCP can bring volumes to it themselves. We can bring purchase requirements
to it. I think there are a lot of things that are compelling about it, but I think we're a ways off.
Now on returns, yeah, we've been using as a starting point 15% unlevered after tax returns, and in projects where we're
building off of our network, we've been pretty effective at getting those kinds of returns. And this has some of those
characteristics when you look at the downstream network and you look at upstream potentially on EPNG.
On the other hand, where we have secure cash flows under long-term contracts with good credits, we've certainly
talked with our business unit presidents about don't say no to those if they are just – because they were a point or two

up, bring them to us, let's have a look at them and see if on a risk-adjusted basis we're comfortable with them. So it's
not a hard and fast. It's a totality of the circumstances kind of evaluation.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And just pivoting to TMX for a second here, you have federal and B.C. approvals
in hand, but there's a lot of jawboning in the upcoming B.C. elections, about TMX as well, too. I guess, kind of, two
questions, one, what avenues would a new government have in British Columbia to interfere with the project? And then
I guess secondly, does the discussion with any JV partners – or is it potentially suspended until after the election result
is in? Or the discussions continuing and ongoing and it doesn't really influence this back?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. I'll go with the last question first. And so, no – there's no suspension of any process.
We're going full speed ahead on both processes here.
On the B.C. election, as you pointed out, we do have our federal and also our provincial approval. And that includes the
EA, and then also the environmental approval, and it also includes reaching agreement with British Columbia on
benefits. There are five conditions which are primarily benefits to B.C. as well as risk reduction associated with marine
and land response. There're also many other benefits of this project to British Columbia that we think are recognized
and think and hope would be taken into account.
We're creating a lot of B.C. jobs here. There's economic development. There's benefits to the First Nations and the
communities along the route that we've entered into mutual benefit agreements with. And we've got a lot of detailed
plans and protections that we put in place and that the British Columbia and federal governments have put in place to
mitigate any perceived risk from the project.
Now we are – it's also, this is a federally sanctioned project. Now we're watching or certainly following developments
very closely. And the B.C. – the government in B.C. can, certainly, have an impact on the project, but it's probably a
little premature for us to pine on those exact impacts at this point.
We have a lot of momentum in both – on both the federal and the provincial level from all the work that we've done
and that those governments have done to address the concerns that have been raised and to make sure that there are
benefits that are shared with the broader public. So we think we've got good strong support behind us, both at the
federal and provincial level.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And one final question. Last quarter, you talked about green shoots potentially
emerging. Q1 seem to have some momentum in it as well too, but you sort of didn't change your year-end leverage
targets and so forth. Are you seeing these green shoots develop? Could we see you exceed your leverage targets by the
end of the year, or rather your EBITDA target? Just wondering if you can sort of comment on what you're seeing in
terms of flows and green shoots?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Again, we're not changing our outlook, notwithstanding the strong first quarter performance,
we're not changing our outlook for the full year. In terms of the debt-to-EBITDA metric changing, I think the main
mover there is probably getting the financial arrangements in place for the Trans Mountain project. We're just a few
weeks into the second quarter here, and I think there's some promising developments there. The rig count is one thing
we mentioned; our Haynesville producer becoming more active on the gathering part of it. We're happy to be up 1%
year-over-year on crude and condensate and refined products volumes, but it's just a little early for us to be calling
anything different on our EBITDA at this point.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate the color.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: So I guess just thinking about the JV and the promote on TMX and what you just announced
on Elba a little while back, is there a – are those terms that you sort of came to on Elba a read through for us in terms of
how you'll think about Trans Mountain both from your perspective and then the way a potential partner might think
about the investment in Trans Mountain?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I don't think so. They're very different projects. As I said, the Trans Mountain return is
consistent with the average return or the overall return in our – or the overall multiple of EBITDA in our backlog,
which is about 6.7 times. So they're not – they're really very – they're very different projects and so I don't think you
can analogize much except to say that we got compensated for the work that we did in originating and developing the
project at Elba. And we expect – as we did on Utopia – and we'd expect the same to be true in Trans Mountain.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah. The construction – when you look at how those projects are built, the construction
is different. It's going to take longer to construct Trans Mountain than it takes to construct Elba. Elba is a self-contained
site with a signed EPC contract. In Trans Mountain, you have multiple spreads over many miles. So the projects just
have different returns and different risk profiles, and so I would expect that investors, potential JV partners would take
all those things into effect – account. And so I don't think you can take an Elba promote and apply it to Trans
Mountain.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think that's right. I would add that, of course, what we have on both projects is very strong
long-term contracts with creditworthy entities. And again, I think we just can't overemphasize on Trans Mountain the
fact that we have all these shippers who are signed up for 708,000 barrels a day, almost all of them for 20 years, and
that is a very important factor just as Shell has signed up on Elba over that period.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Great. And then I know this came up a lot at Analyst Day, but just a thought that if you can't
come to terms that you think are attractive for a JV partner and promote and the things that you'd like to see, let's say
the election goes south on you next month, I mean, you are still willing to walk away from the process or an IPO and
are you willing to just self-build the entire project or would you then move to just the IPO process, just where your
head is on all that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. That's not a decision we're confronting yet. We fully expect that the two track process is
going to produce a successful result for us, and so that's what we're basing our decision-making on right now.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. Fair enough. And then if I could do one more smaller one, the two Section 5 rate
cases that you got hit with earlier in the year, just how much of an annual revenue impact would you see from those if,
let's say, those pipelines were returned with let's call it reasonable ROE as the FERC sees it, what would be the revenue
impact there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, first, I'd say we feel very strongly that it was not appropriate to initiate those proceedings
because not all of the facts around those assets were fully taken into account in the Section 5 process. We are also in
discussions with our customers right now, and we do not expect there to be anything other than at most a de minimis
impact on the margin for those assets.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. Perfect. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Hi. Good afternoon. As you look at adding to your backlog, should we think of the DCT
JV as an indicator of broader interest in getting into the Permian in a bigger way or just more opportunistic since you
already had existing gas assets and you'd sort of continue to focus on building out existing basin footprints?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We would like to – we have existing assets that serve the Permian, EPNG, of course. We have a
line on the Texas Intrastate, so that line is fully utilized and constrained and difficult to expand. So we're already there,
and we are absolutely looking to expand our presence there.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Great.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I should have mentioned, too, NGPL serves the Permian and brings the gas northbound to
Chicago, and there are opportunities on that system as well to take advantage of the developments there.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Great. And then I don't think that this is big for you, but can you just give a sense of how
much of your backlog is waiting for a FERC quorum to move forward?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think – Tom, correct me on this, we got orders on the projects that were time-critical...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Right.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: ...already before the quorum disappeared in early in the year. And so now I think where we are
is we're not going to find a time-critical issue so long as they get quorum by mid-year thereabouts...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Or even later.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: ...even late 2017. So it's not constraining us right now, Jean Ann.

Thank you. Our next question is from Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Danilo.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been hit, but I had a couple of follow-up questions on
TMX. Within the B.C. agreement that you signed earlier this month, I think you stipulated a June end decision time line
followed by a July 2 announcement. Is that the absolute latest we'll hear something or can you announce something
prior to that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, that was really to set a date that was out there kind of at the end of the timing we're
thinking. And so it was just a negotiated date, and it was put out there to be kind of at the end of the timing we're
thinking.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Okay. So we could hear something earlier than that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Possibly.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Okay. Secondly, within that agreement, is there any protection that you have from a potential
change in political regime in the province?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Something in the agreement?
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Right. Meaning, if there's a change politically with the elections next month, does the
agreement change in any way, shape or form?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. The agreement doesn't change. No, the agreement does not change.

Thank you. Next question is from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, John. How are you doing?
<Q - John Edwards>: Good, Rich. Thanks. Just a real quick – couple of quick ones here just on the real strong export
volumes from Mexico this quarter and what kind of growth rate is expected for the rest of the year in terms of export
volumes for Mexico?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Tom, do you have a feel for that?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: That's a tough one. I mean, I think it really just depends on the timing of additional capacity
coming online. I'm not sure if I could give you a number. I mean, we should be trending up from here, but not at a very
steep climb, I think it will just continue to grow.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then just on the dividend, I know anymore thoughts on kind of step it up high with a
slower growth or step it up not as much and grow it fast, any kind of preliminary thoughts on dividend policy?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We're going to step it up high and grow it fast. Just kidding, John. Look, we're going to
have more to say on that later in the year, but as we emphasize consistently, we're going to have the firepower, we
believe, to significantly raise the dividend. And when we do, we're going to make certain that we – that dividend is
strongly covered.
And one way of looking at it is we'd like to be able, in an ordinary year, to be able to fund the equity portion of our
expansion CapEx out of the cash flow, which would lead to good coverage of whatever dividend we're paying. But we
haven't made any detailed decisions on it. And again, as we promised, we will do that later this year and get back to
you with our outlook for 2018.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. Great. And then just one other question on Trans Mountain. You may not be able to
comment on this, but in terms of the timing of the payment, I know at Analyst day, if I recall it correctly, there was
discussion about having a good chunk of the promote be paid upfront versus over the construction process. And any
other data points or color you can provide on that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: That's still consistent with our expectation.
<Q - John Edwards>: Which one, Steve?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: The upfront – getting a significant portion of the proceeds upfront.
<Q - John Edwards>: Paid upfront? Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.

<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good afternoon, Rich. Hope you and everybody is doing well. Steve, just a quick
question for you on Gulf Coast Express. When we put all the pieces of the puzzle together, of the 1.7 Bcf/d that's being
marketed, inclusive of the residue gas that BCP could commit and we can all see what that is, and the options both
upstream and downstream of the pipe that you talked about, based on what you're marketing, how much total capacity
do you think is necessary to commercialize the project? And then as you mentioned, it makes a world of sense to be a
buyer of that gas, especially if basis comes back and capitalize on some regional arb, so how much capacity would you
want to just leave open for that opportunity?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Very early to tell, again, Darren. It would be – if the demand is there at a high enough
rate, you wouldn't have to fill the whole pipe. Our purchase business is over a Bcf a day, that's the whole portfolio,
right?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Probably 2.5 Bcf a day.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: 2.5 Bcf a day. And Eagle Ford is declining. So it would be a nice – at an attractive price, a nice
way to fill in for that in the purchase part of our portfolio in the Texas Intrastate. But too early to tell what that mix will
be.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. Do you have a sense – and this is my follow-up, and I'll leave it here. Do you have
a sense when you look at what's being marketed out of the basin relative to residue gas supply growth expectations,
either yours or from third parties, do you have a sense of how much takeaway capacity is actually going to be
necessary?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: I mean, I think at least one pipe and in some analysis we see requires two additional pipes.
So definitely enough to fill this project.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Jeremy. How are you?
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good. Good afternoon. Thanks. Going back to TMX for a second here. I was just wondering
if you could remind us if you guys had kind of finalized whether or not the JV, an IPO process, whether that would
include existing assets or is it just the project itself, could you just walk us through your latest thinking there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, so it's very difficult to – really it's effectively impossible to separate the expansion from
the existing Trans Mountain system. It's effectively a twinning of that system with some line reactivations and common
facilities at the terminals and at the dock. So really, the way we would be selling this in either a JV or an IPO is with
the existing system as well; and in the IPO, potentially with a broader offering of our Canadian assets as well.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. Thanks. And just one more. As far as the Gulf Express there – and congratulations
on that project or the open season there, I was just curious as far as the interplay between kind of new projects and kind
of returning the dividend to a higher level in the interplay because I assume 2018 CapEx steps down somewhat from
2017 and that kind of helps you in the process of being able to lift the dividend. And so it's a great thing to win new
projects, but then you see the interplay there as far as the leverage is concerned. So just wondering if you could walk us
through your thoughts there.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think it goes back to what Rich said earlier. We would look to have enough coverage over our
dividend to be able to continue to fund the equity portion of a growth capital plan. So we're looking at – we're going to
be looking at all of that as we come up with our guidance to the latter part of this year – in the latter part of this year.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. Great. Thank you.

FID come sort of concurrent with that or is that running on some sort of a separate track? Thanks.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: The timing is this quarter, and we haven't been more specific than that, Michael. We're running
both processes simultaneously. And again, the point there is that we want to get ourselves to a fully negotiated on the
JV side or a fully marketed on the IPO side to kind of see what our value is. We would expect that the FID would come
close in time with the conclusion of those processes.
<Q - Michael Blum>: Got it. Thank you.
