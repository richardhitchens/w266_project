Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to
prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin the
conference.
James H. Rowe
Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President,
Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is
being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are

I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan.
Timothy J. Sloan
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I want to thank you for joining us today on our call. We produced solid
financial results in the first quarter. It has been seven months since the retail sales practices settlement and we continue
to take important steps in making things right with our customers and rebuilding trust.
I want to start by acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our team members throughout Wells Fargo who are
focused on putting our customers first and helping them succeed financially. This commitment has been demonstrated
through our improving Retail Banking customer service scores, record client assets in Wealth and Investment
Management including banker closed referrals once again reaching $1 billion a month, more primary consumer
checking customers, and industry-leading mortgage originations during the quarter.
Before I provide more details on the actions we've taken and an update on the monthly customer activities trends we've
been sharing regularly, let me briefly summarize our financial results of the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5
billion and EPS of $1. We generated $22 billion in revenue reflecting lower fee income from a year ago, which was
partially offset by a 5% increase in net interest income. Average loans grew $36.4 billion, up 4% from a year ago; and
average deposits increased $79.8 billion, up 7% to a record $1.3 trillion.
Our credit results improved with a net charge-off rate of 34 basis points, and we had a $200 million reserve release. We
returned $3.1 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. This reduced our
common shares outstanding by over 19 million shares from the fourth quarter, bringing our shares outstanding below 5
billion shares for the first time since 2009.
During the first quarter, our efficiency ratio increased to 62.7%, and even taking into consideration normal first quarter
seasonality, it is outside our range. John will discuss the drivers of this increase later on the call, but I want to make it
very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable.
We are committed to improving our efficiency in addition to our current efficiency initiatives, which are expected to
reduce expenses by $2 billion annually with those savings being reinvested in the business. We will talk more about
specific areas of cost saves and reinvestment at our Investor Day in May.
March Retail Banking customer activity is shown on slide 3, which we've been updating monthly since October. It is
encouraging that most of these trends have improved from their post sales practices settlement lows and many have
continued to improve throughout the first quarter. Starting with customer interactions on an average per day basis, total
branch interactions declined 6% from February and decline 4% from a year ago. The year-over-year decline was less
than we have seen in recent months, and March has historically had fewer interactions per day than February. We had
strong growth in digital secure sessions, up 8% from a year ago, as our customers are increasingly using our online and
award-winning mobile capabilities.
Deposit balances remained strong and customers opened more checking accounts than they closed. Our attrition rates
are now back to pre-settlement levels. We had 23.6 million primary consumer checking customers in March with a
second consecutive month-over-month increase. Primary consumer checking customers increased 1.6% from a year
ago. We do expect this growth rate to continue to decline in the near term, driven by year-over-year decline in checking
account openings. However, the growth in average consumer and small business banking deposits has remained strong,
up 6% from a year ago.
And activity among our debit and credit card customers also remained strong with debit card transactions and consumer
credit card purchase volume both up 5% from a year ago on an average per day basis. In addition, consumer credit card

balances grew 7% from a year ago. New consumer credit card applications increased 10% from February on an average
per day basis, the largest month-over-month increase in September, but were still down from a year ago. Point-of-sale
active consumer credit card accounts were up 4% from a year ago.
Our team members remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and our retail customer experience
scores have improved for five consecutive months. Overall satisfaction with most recent visit scores were our near
pre-settlement levels and customer loyalty scores have steadily improved from the lows in October 2016.
While not part of our regular monthly reporting, I want to highlight trends in referred investment assets. We've talked
in the past about the successful partnership between Wealth and Investment Management and Community Banking,
which was averaging more than $1 billion in monthly closed referred investment assets prior to the sales practices
settlement. In March, closed referred investment assets from this partnership increased to $1 billion, up from $700
million per month, which is what we have been averaging during the months after the settlement announcement. We're
pleased that the results from this important partnership have rebounded, which is an indication that our bankers and
financial advisors are focused on meeting our customers' financial needs and that we are competing successfully.
We implemented our new Retail Banking compensation program early in the first quarter and initial survey results
from our team members have been positive. We are also seeing an improvement in team member retention. We will
continue to survey our team members, monitor the outcomes and behaviors, and we will make changes as needed.
Another important step forward we are making is the launch of a new marketing campaign next week called building
better every day. It focuses on how we are building a better company for our customers, our team members and our
communities.
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to acknowledge the release of the report from our board containing the
findings of an independent investigation into retail sales practices in our community bank. This is available on our
website. Also during the first quarter, our board accelerated its ongoing process of board refreshment by electing two
talented new independent directors, Karen Peetz and Ron Sargent, to succeed long-serving board members.
The issuance of the board's report, which was appropriately thorough, was an important step in rebuilding trust and we
have made significant progress in making things right with our customers and addressing issues, including addressing
several identified in the investigation. We've changed leadership, held executives accountable, changed how we
compensate and lead our retail bankers, and centralized key control functions. We have also launched our management
commission third-party reviews of our culture and practices.
In addition, we announced in March that we reached an agreement in principle to settle a class-action lawsuit
concerning Retail Banking sales practices for $110 million. We expect this settlement to resolve claims and 11 other
pending class actions, another step in making things right with our customers and rebuilding trust.
We also achieved some key milestones that are not related to sales practices, including filing our response to the two
remaining deficiencies found in our 2015 resolution plan, and we completed our latest capital plan submission earlier
this month. We also recently introduced six new goals to our team members to better reflect our current challenges and
opportunities.
We want Wells Fargo to be the financial services leader in these six areas: customer service and advice, team member
engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship and long-term shareholder value. We will share our
specific strategies we are taking to help achieve these goals at our Investor Day. We've accomplished a lot in the past
few months, but we still have work to do. We understand that nothing is more important to Wells Fargo's future than
ensuring we have a culture and an operating model that works for all of our stakeholders – our customers, team
members, investors and communities.
John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.

Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report that we earned $5.5 billion in the first quarter, the
18th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. There was a lot of economic volatility and
uncertainty over this period, and these steady results reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and its
ability to perform consistently over time.
Turning to page 6, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Our balance sheet remains strong with high levels of
liquidity and capital, record deposit balances and improved credit quality. Loans were down from the fourth quarter,
and I will discuss that in more detail later on the call. Cash and short-term investments reached an all-time high of
$328.4 billion, up $41.7 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in deposits and a linked quarter
decline in the loan portfolio. Investment securities were down $387 million, less than 1%, in the first quarter, as
approximately $16 billion in gross purchases were more than offset by run-off and sales.
We always balance a number of factors when determining our investment activity, and during this transitional period
for rates, our decision to maintain a relatively stable investment portfolio was driven primarily by interest rate and OCI
risk management. We will continue to analyze the outlook for interest rates as well as our liquidity needs, and we look
forward to re-investing more into loans and investment securities over time.
Turning to the income statement overview on page 7, I'll be describing the biggest drivers of revenue and expense
growth later on the call, so this is a couple of points I want to make here. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was
27.4%, which included $197 million of discrete tax benefits, of which $183 million was associated with newly adopted
stock compensation accounting guidance in the first quarter. We currently expect the full year 2017 effective income
tax rate to be approximately 30%. We had $403 million of equity gains in the first quarter from a number of venture
capital, private equity and other investments, partially offset by $91 million of non-controlling interests primarily
related to these gains.
As shown on page 8, average loans increased 4% from a year ago, but declined $502 million from the fourth quarter, as
$5 billion of broad-based growth in commercial loans was more than offset by declines in consumer loans, primarily in
residential real estate. The benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 6 basis points in the quarter.
Period-end loans grew 1% from a year ago and declined $9.2 billion or 1% from the fourth quarter. H.8 data indicates
there was softness across the industry in the first quarter and our growth rate was in line with that national trend. There
were a variety of factors impacting our portfolio, so let me discuss these trends in more detail.
Commercial loans were up $16.8 billion from a year ago, but were down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter. We've not
changed our relationship-based approach to meeting the lending needs of our commercial customers. Our commercial
customers are generally optimistic about the current environment, and this positive sentiment should lead to more loan
growth, as business activity and investing increase. C&I loans declined $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter, as $4.5
billion in growth from Wells Fargo Capital Finance, asset backed finance and commercial dealer services was more
than offset by businesses with typical first quarter declines, including a $2 billion decline in short-term loans to global
financial institutions.
We had continued declines in our oil and gas portfolio, which was down 29% from a year ago and down $2 billion or
14% from the fourth quarter. The linked quarter decline was spread across all oil and gas sectors, and roughly half the
reduction was from proceeds the borrowers raised in the capital markets and used to pay down loans. The strong capital
markets environment also resulted in additional payoffs of C&I loans from other borrowers. The commercial real estate
portfolio increased $189 million from the fourth quarter with growth in commercial real estate construction, which was
diversified across geographies and asset types, partially offset by declines in commercial real estate mortgages driven
by pay downs.
We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on page 10. Our first mortgage loans declined $946 million from the
fourth quarter due to continued run-off of higher-yielding legacy portfolios, more than offsetting $4.1 billion of growth
in nonconforming mortgage loans. Our junior lien mortgage portfolio continued to decline, as payoffs offset new
originations. Our credit card portfolio declined $2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal activity, as
customers paid down their holiday purchases. Growth was also impacted by a slowdown in account openings, which
started in the first quarter of 2016, and increased after the announcement of the sales practices settlement.

The $1.9 billion decline in our auto portfolio reflected lower origination volumes, which were down 29% compared
with a year ago. We've tightened credit underwriting standards in response to early signs of rising delinquencies in the
industry and declining used car values. As a result, the quality of originations has improved and we expect to see the
size of our auto portfolio continue to decline in 2017. We recently named a new leader to this business, and we're
focused on improving execution and efficiency through increased standardization and centralization. We'll share more
about our auto strategy at Investor Day. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined by $981 million with
$539 million of the decline from personal loans and lines reflecting lower branch originations.
As highlighted on page 11, our first quarter average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $79.8 billion, or 7%, from a
year ago with growth in both consumer and commercial deposits. Our average deposit cost increased 7 basis points
from a year ago and 5 basis points from the fourth quarter. We've not made any material changes in rates paid on
consumer and small business banking deposits, and we've seen very little market response with the majority of our
peers holding rates steady. We have implemented some incremental commercial deposit re-pricing in line with the
market from the rate increases in December 2016 and March of 2017, and we will continue to monitor the overall
market and be responsive in order to remain competitive.
Net interest income increased 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by growth in loans and investment securities and
the benefit of higher interest rates. Net interest income declined $102 million from the fourth quarter primarily due to
two fewer days in the quarter. The benefit from the interest rate increases as well as growth in average investment
securities was offset by lower average trading assets and mortgages held for sale and typically lower first quarter
income from variable sources.
The net interest margin was flat from the fourth quarter, as the benefit of higher interest rates, a reduction in short-term
market funding, and growth in average investment securities was offset by lower income from trading assets and
mortgages held for sale, higher deposit and the long-term debt balances, and lower income from variable sources.
Noninterest income increased $522 million from the fourth quarter, driven by a lower net hedge ineffectiveness
accounting impact in the first quarter as well as higher trading gains. Net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impacts are
reflected in other income, and in the first quarter, we had a loss of $193 million largely from foreign currency
fluctuations compared with a loss of $592 million in the fourth quarter due to key interest rate and foreign currency
fluctuations. A year ago, we had net hedge ineffectiveness accounting gains of $379 million. The current accounting
rules cause volatility, which we believe do not reflect the actual underlying economics. So we're pleased that the FASB
has issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines, which, if adopted in its current form, would significantly
reduce the interest rate-related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges.
Mortgage banking noninterest income declined $189 million from the fourth quarter. As expected, residential mortgage
origination volume declined due to lower refi volume and seasonally lower purchase volume. Applications were down
21% from the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter with a $28 billion unclosed pipeline, down 7%. The production
margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, unchanged from the
fourth quarter. Given current industry pricing trends, we expect the production margin to decline in the second quarter.
Mortgage servicing income increased $260 million from the fourth quarter primarily due to lower unreimbursed
servicing costs and lower prepayments. We took actions last year that increased these unreimbursed servicing costs
primarily in the fourth quarter. These costs are now at more normalized levels and we currently expect them to improve
slightly from first quarter levels.
On page 14, we provide details on trading-related revenue and the impact to net interest income and noninterest
income. Trading-related revenue was up $448 million from the fourth quarter. Trading-related net interest income
declined $100 million in the first quarter, reflecting a 9% decline in average trading assets, tighter spreads and lower
periodic dividends and carry.
Net gains on trading activities increased $548 million from the fourth quarter. This growth was primarily driven by
higher client volumes in credit trading, equity trading and derivatives. $144 million of the increase in net gains in
trading activities was from higher deferred comp trading results, which was largely offset in employee benefits

expense, and there was a $65 million increase from valuation adjustments, as credit valuation adjustments on tightening
spreads and investment grade and high-yield debt were partially offset by debt valuation adjustments from tightening in
Wells Fargo market spreads.
As shown on page 15, expenses increased $577 million from the fourth quarter and $764 million from a year ago, and
our efficiency ratio increased to 62.7%. As Tim mentioned earlier on the call, this ratio is unacceptable, and while we
expect our efficiency ratio to remain elevated, we are committed to improving our efficiency.
On page 16, we highlight the drivers of the expense increase from the fourth quarter. We had $900 million of higher
personnel expenses. $790 million of this increase was from seasonally higher employee benefits expenses from higher
payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. These
seasonally higher personnel expenses will decline in the second quarter, but salary expense is expected to increase
reflecting annual salary increases, which became effective late in the first quarter. Partially offsetting the higher
personnel expenses in the first quarter was the decline in expenses that are typically high in the fourth quarter,
including outside professional services, equipment, advertising and T&E. We also had higher operating losses in the
first quarter compared with the fourth quarter on higher litigation accruals.
On page 17, we show the drivers of the $764 million increase in expenses from a year ago. Over 60% of the increase
was personnel expenses. Salary expense increased $225 million, reflecting annual salary increases and FTE growth.
FTEs were up approximately 4,200, or 2% from a year ago, driven by increases in technology, risk, virtual channels
and operations. These are non-revenue generating areas and are higher than average salaried team members.
Employee benefits expense increased $160 million, including $141 million in higher deferred comp costs which was
offset in trading revenue. Incentive compensation was up $80 million from a year ago, with approximately 40% of the
increase from higher revenue-related incentive compensation costs.
Our efficiency initiative, which includes centralization and streamlining of processes, should reduce FTE levels over
time, and in some businesses like mortgage, FTE levels will be adjusted to reflect market conditions.
$264 million of the increase in expenses was from outside professional and contract services related to higher project
and technology spending and legal expense. The first quarter included approximately $80 million of expense related to
sales practices matters and meaningful spending on regulatory and compliance initiatives, including regulatory and risk
data, resolution planning and Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs. While we do not expect these
expenses to decline in the near term, over time we should be able to spend less in these areas. We also had $83 million
in higher FDIC expense due to the special assessment which began in the third quarter of 2016 and is expected to
continue through mid-2018.
The purchase of the GE Capital CDF business and the sale of our crop insurance business increased expenses by a net
$23 million. These two business mix changes were reflected in our results beginning in the second quarter of 2016.
They will no longer impact year-over-year variances.
Finally, there were $101 million of other expense increases driven by higher equipment spending and charitable
donations. These higher expenses were partially offset by $172 million of lower operating losses on lower litigation
accruals in the first quarter compared with the year ago.
As highlighted on page 18, we remain focused on expense management and efficiency. While many of the higher
expenses I just described will remain elevated, it's important that we operate in the most efficient way possible. As we
discussed last quarter, we've been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by
approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018, with the full-year benefits starting in 2019. However, there will
not be a bottom-line impact, as these savings will be reinvested in the business. We will provide more detail on these
efforts at Investor Day.
We are committed to improving our efficiency while continuing to invest in our top priorities, including risk
management, cyber security and innovation. We will be highlighting a lot of new innovations at our Investor Day
including our recently launched Card-Free ATMs, making us the first large bank in the U.S. to offer the feature for our

entire ATM network. We were also the first bank to integrate [ph] this already (26:24) user interface into our mobile
app, enabling our customers to use this enhanced functionality in making person-to-person payments. And we were
recently awarded first place in the Keynote Mobile Banking Scorecard for our overall mobile banking offering.
We also entered into an agreement with Intuit which allows Wells Fargo customers who financial management tools
such as QuickBooks Online to use an API when importing their bank account information, giving our customers greater
control over their financial data. You will see more announcements like these as we continue to invest to bring more
ease and convenience to our customers.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 19, Community Banking earned $3 billion in the first quarter, down
9% from a year ago and up 10% from the fourth quarter. Community Banking results benefited from the discrete tax
benefit I highlighted earlier on the call. I have already discussed many of the business trends within Community
Banking, so I won't go into more detail here, except to note that we closed 39 branches in the quarter, and we are on
schedule to close approximately 200 this year.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.1 billion in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 4% from the fourth
quarter. Revenue was up modestly compared with year ago, as 11% growth in net interest income was mostly offset by
a 10% decline in noninterest income. The decline in noninterest income was driven by the impact from the sale of our
crop insurance business last year, which generated a $381 million gain in the first quarter of 2016.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $623 million in the first quarter, up 22% from a year ago and down 5%
from the fourth quarter. First quarter results reflected strong growth in net interest income, up 14% from a year ago.
Average deposits were up 6% and average loans increased 10% from a year ago, the 15th consecutive quarter of
double-digit year-over-year loan growth. The benefit of higher market valuations and continued positive net flows led
to another quarter of record WIM total client assets, up 9% from a year ago to $1.8 trillion.
Turning to page 22, net charge-offs decreased $100 million from the fourth quarter, with 34 basis points of annualized
net charge-offs. Commercial losses declined $108 million, driven by $76 million of lower losses in our oil and gas
portfolio and from higher recoveries. Consumer losses increased $8 million, as lower losses in residential real estate
and other revolving credit were offset by seasonally higher credit card losses. We had a reserve release of $200 million
driven by improvements in the oil and gas portfolio performance and continued improvement in residential real estate.
Our first mortgage loan portfolio had only 1 basis point of loss in the first quarter, and our junior lien mortgage
portfolio continued to improve with 21 basis points of loss, which is less than half of the loss rate from a year ago.
Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $698 million from the fourth quarter, with improvements across our
portfolios and lower foreclosed assets.
Turning to page 23, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.2% in the first quarter.
Our internal target of 10%, which includes the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer, has not
changed. The primary driver of our ratio remaining above our internal target this quarter was lower RWA than last
quarter and lower than forecasted in our 2016 capital plan, resulting from loan growth trends, continued credit
discipline and improved RWA efficiency.
We returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases,
and our net payout ratio was 61%. Based on our updated TLAC estimate as of the end of the quarter, we believe our
shortfall is approximately $1.4 billion. This represents strong continued progress towards fulfilling the requirements
and results largely from lower RWA as well as issuance during the quarter. We currently expect our total TLAC
issuance in 2017 to be similar to the $32 billion we issued in 2016 to fund both maturities and our remaining build of
qualifying debt.
In summary, our results in the first quarter, which included a 1.15% ROA, an 11.54% ROE and a 13.85% return on
tangible common equity, demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, which has generated over $5
billion in quarterly earnings every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2012. We look forward to our Investor Day next
month where we will share our strategies for acquiring new customers, building lifelong relationships with our existing
customers and our focus on generating operational efficiencies while managing risk.

Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Erika.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: I just had a clarification question. You both mentioned on the call in the prepared remarks
that the 62.7% efficiency ratio is not acceptable, but you also emphasized that the $2 billion currently identified cost
savings won't fall to the bottom line. And your NII was down in a period when the – where the Fed raised rates in
December by 25 bps. So how do we square future efficiency ratio improvement from here when those two big pieces
seem to be going the other way?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. So let me start and, John, jump in.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And let's talk about the revenue line first, Erika. You're absolutely right, the net interest
income was down from the fourth quarter, but that was because there were two fewer days in the quarter. And as John
pointed out, the net interest income year-over-year was up about 5%. So we feel comfortable that we're going to see
continued net interest income growth over the rest of the year, and we can talk about that more later if you'd like.
In terms of efficiency, as I highlighted, and as you know, the first quarter tends to be a bit higher because of the
compensation-related activities that are concentrated in that first quarter. Even when you strip those out, and that's one
of the reasons why we wanted to provide the detail about our expenses, not only year-over-year, but also a sequential
quarter; you'll see an increase in our expenses. And so even without that first quarter seasonality, we would've been
operating outside the range that we've talked about historically of between 55% and 59%. And as I said and as John
said, operating outside that range, from our perspective, is just not acceptable.
Now, as it relates to the $2 billion of reductions that we've talked about previously, again, as you highlighted, all of
those are going to be re-invested in growing the company and making the necessary investments for our success over
the long term. In addition to that, we appreciate that we need to improve the efficiencies of this company. And we're
going to provide more detail about how we're going to make those improvements at Investor Day. So imagine at
Investor Day, we'll be talking about additional efficiencies that would fall to the bottom line beyond that $2 billion.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One thing I'd add, and I think we'll provide some more clarity at Investor Day, the $2
billion that we're talking about reinvesting; we're essentially reinvesting it today. And so there's a little bit of a – there
needs to be more clarity, I think, on the – on just the time element of what happens to be $2 billion. To the extent that
we're already in an elevated situation, then from that point, it would be contributing to the bottom line at that point, not
from the more efficient place that we were recently. So it's not as if, if we operate outside our range today, for example,
and then we came up with the $2 billion of efficiency, we would spend another $2 billion; it's contributing to paying for
what is elevated today.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: That was clear. Thank you. Just on the net interest income side – Tim, thank you for
bringing that up – you have, in a very low – in a low rate environment been consistent over the past couple of years at
growing this in the mid-single digits. And I'm wondering if we take into account a better rate backdrop and also
account for some of the runoffs that you told us to expect, I'm wondering if this year you could do better than that

mid-single digit pace.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, we hope so, Erika. I think we're comfortable with the range that we've provided. And
on one hand, for example, just in the last few weeks, we've seen short-term rates increase, which is helpful. On the
other hand, we've seen a pretty significant rally in long-term rates. And so it's a mixed bag, but I think we're generally
comfortable.
John, I don't know if you want to [indiscernible] (36:07)...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: No, I think that's right. So where short-term rates are and are going is a big part of it.
Where long-term rates are, matters a lot, because we generate interest income by investing at the longer end of the
curve. And to the extent that that outlook is lower than it was earlier in the quarter, then it'll be harder to generate
incremental growth net interest income from that activity. We have to have a good handle on where both deposits and
loans are going to be growing. And there's nothing to suggest that we're – but we feel comfortable in the
mid-to-high-single digits, frankly, in the ongoing deposit growth, and loans are probably in the low-single digits, so
that has to be factored in.
And then the deposit response, the realized betas that the market is offering and that we're taking will be the big swing
factor, and we'll observe that over time. I think as we've said and I think I've heard already this morning, it feels like
there hasn't been much of a move on consumer and small-business deposit pricing from the last couple of moves. To
the extent that we get a couple of more moves and those – and realized betas begin to pick up, then what feels like
outperformance today could be tougher later in the cycle. All that will matter.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. Just if I could slip one more question in, I apologize, but in putting it all together and
what you know now in terms of the realistic outlook and what you have planned for the rest of the year, can Wells
Fargo get back in that 55% to 59% range this year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Erika, I think it's going to be a challenge to do that in terms of averaging that for the year.
My guess is, we'll be at the high end of that range. But as you've pointed out in your questions and as John's pointed
out, there's a lot of puts and takes to get to what an efficiency ratio looks like is not only a function of expense levels,
it's also revenue level. But I think that operating at an elevated level, as we've said, is something that you should expect,
but, again, long term, that's not our goal and that's not our expectation.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And we should have some more clarity for you at Investor Day as well.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thanks. I appreciate it.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks a lot. John, I wonder if you could talk more about that OCI risk management and the
trade-off between that longer part of the curve. When we saw in your 10-K that the unrealized loss component did go
up, and it seems like you did reinvest a little less this quarter, can you just talk about like the balance between your
decision tree on putting more into the book here and versus balance sheet risk and the decision tree between investment
securities and maybe keeping more mortgages?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So in terms of keeping mortgages, we've – keeping conforming mortgages on the
books really hasn't been the tool that we've talked about. We've got – we're adding what we think is plenty in the way
of that asset category on the nonconforming side. So, for the moment, anyway, that hasn't been a strategy that we've
considered.

With respect to OCI sensitivity, and the big topic since the election has been what's going to happen with long rates,
were they going to make a move. And I think the whole market was discounting for a while what the possibility was of
meaningful tax reform, some form of infrastructure stimulus. And if both of those things get dropped on an economy
with relatively full employment, that's inflationary. And if that happens, there's a very reasonable expectation of higher
long-term rates.
And with that as a backdrop, of course, until it didn't happen, at least in the short term, preparing ourselves for a
meaningful move up at the longer end of the curve, both in terms of the capital impact of our existing stock of AFS
securities, as well as the decision around dry powder and whether you reinvest in the first quarter, the second quarter,
or the third quarter depending on where your entry points are, that has been a consistent topic. So because that stimulus
hasn't occurred, it still may, but it certainly is a lower probability today than it was in November and December, we're
back down in lower 10-year rates, lower mortgage rates than we were there for a while.
And now we have to ask ourselves again, are we going to be lower for a while, lower for longer, or are we still waiting
for a shoe to drop and for there to be a big backup in rates. Sensitizing what that means to capital, for every 50 basis
point, 75 basis point or 100 basis point move in the 10-year or in mortgage yields, that's the risk that we are trying to
manage as we navigate. And the trade-off, of course, is scary in the short term. We had positioned ourselves very
heavily invested, lower for longer in an outspoken way before the election, and now we're contemplating what profile
to maintain going forward.
We want to have – we want to retain or, frankly, maybe even increase our asset sensitivity, which is – which we've
talked about is sort of 5% to 15% and at the lower end of the range. And every incremental decision we make to get
invested to turn cash into HQLA reduces that asset sensitivity. So, if we are in a rising rate environment, one way for us
to preserve that – one way, there are others – is to delay investments in fixed-rate securities that we would otherwise
make. That's what we are talking about.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. And then as a follow up to that, just on that last point about the asset sensitivity then, I think
you guys have talked about previously what you thought the December hike would mean for first quarter. Can you talk
about – I know this goes back to your point about betas, but has the sensitivity changed much intra-quarter here with
the betas and the fixing out of that cash into securities? Can you just give us an idea of what the next hike might mean
to NII?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. Well, it's hard to parse each piece. We sort of outperformed our expectation in the
first quarter because deposit prices didn't react the way that we had originally modeled them. But we have to imagine
how the market pricing will react for each subsequent move. When you put all the pieces in, a few moves, loan growth,
deposit growth, investment activity, I think that sort of mid-single digit NII growth over the course of the year is a
reasonable expectation. And there are other things in there as well, but looking at the first quarter and looking at where
we are, and maybe with room to miss on the upside, that's how I would think about it right now.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Got it. Thanks, John.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, John. I wanted to ask about the efficiency initiatives slide, slide 18. I guess the
first thing is, can you tell us the relative size of the three main buckets of phase? Are they in size order like the
centralization and optimization is the big source there?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So I would say that the first bucket is half and the other two buckets comprise the other
half.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. That's helpful. And how much in branch reductions – can you just remind us,
how much in branch reductions are in there in the second bucket?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Have we highlighted that? Yeah.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, John, my suggestion is we'll provide you with more detail on that at Investor Day. I
think there's – that's not a significant part of this $2 billion. We really came up with this $2 billion initiative prior to the
beginning of the reduction in branches that we've talked about for this year. And as you know, you generally don't get
the benefit of any sort of reduction or the expense reduction from branches in that first year, it tends to lag just a little
bit. But we'll provide some more detail in that in John's presentation and in Mary's presentation at Investor Day.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. I guess I was just kind of getting at how the branch rationalization is going and
what would drive you to accelerate the branch reductions, or is it just too early to make that call right now.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's a little early, but we'll be updating our approach with each passing quarter. So even
though we said 200 a year for two years, we will learn from the process that we are going through. And I think the
presentation that Mary will give at Investor Day will very specifically describe the criteria that we're using, why these
and why these now, and what we'll be looking for to make decisions around incremental ones going forward. And I
think that should be pretty transparent and helpful. And just – I think I mentioned it earlier, but we have closed about
40 in the first quarter and are on track for the 200 for this year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just elsewhere on expenses, with the board review done, how long
could – would you – might you expect the professional fees to be elevated in the range that you highlighted on slide
17?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I would expect them to be elevated for a while because the board review was certainly
part of it. It was conducted by an outside firm, and that cost rolls through that line item.
Recall that in connection with the consent orders, we've – there are a couple of outside firms that are doing major
reviews internally. And then separately, we did something similar outside or in addition to the consent order to look at
every part of the sales practices of our firm with actually another third party. We've got programs around cyber,
programs around data, programs in a handful of areas that are all at least in part relying on some combination of outside
professional services firms and/or contract services firms, contract labor. So, some of those will be around for several
quarters, even though the board report is done.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And, John, they're running a little higher than your previous targeted range.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: They are.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Can you just comment on why that is?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. Well, so in the first quarter, with outside professional services firms, some of that
is sort of their billing cycle, et cetera. So we estimated I think $50 million to $60 million a quarter ago. In the quarter –
or I'd say now, at least for the next couple of quarters, it looks more like $70 million to $80 million. We'll give a
quarterly update on that to provide transparency and try and be as accurate as we can.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Along the lines of what John McDonald was just asking about, I just want to dig a little bit
deeper on that side around expenses. Whether it be on the branch side at $200 million a year and also just looking at the
size of the bank and the different businesses and the different markets you're in, it feels like when you look at it on
paper that you have a lot more room than potentially the $2 billion to pull back on costs in order to address the
efficiency ratio this year.
Is that something where you're actually maybe considering where you could come up with a bigger number for us as
you look at this and as you're looking at the Investor Day here? Is that something that we could – that is possible as you
look at the franchise more on a near-term basis?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, John, I would look forward to that at Investor Day. I mean, just to reinforce, right,
62.7% efficiency ratio, even taking out the seasonality in the first quarter, is too high. We've got a $2 billion expense
initiative that we've talked about over the last few quarters that is primarily focused on reinvesting for the long term. In
addition to that, we appreciate that we've got to improve our operating efficiency – our expense efficiency ratio, and
you will see more about that at Investor Day and you should expect a bigger number.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. And then separately, if I could just ask, along the CCAR side,
could you give us your updated thoughts around your positioning for CCAR, particularly given the living will issues
you had, the sales practice issue, the CRA, all that type of stuff, how are you feeling about CCAR for this year,
particularly from the standpoint of your qualitative – the qualitative aspect of it? Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We're feeling thorough, helpful and cooperative as it relates to CCAR this year. A big
part of CCAR is the expectation that firms do a great job at identifying their own risks and addressing their risks in
their forecasting and then laying their capital plan on top of that with that realistic assessment. We think we've done a
very good job at that. Of course, it's early in the review cycle, so we'll know as time passes. But we're very self-aware
of the possibilities of the areas for criticism or skepticism based on our own peculiar specific circumstances, and we
think we've accounted for that.
We've been transparent, cooperative, and had a lot of discussion with our regulators, but now we're in the process.
We've done a good job at this before. We think we're doing a good job at it now. We think we've positioned ourselves
for it, but now, we're in the review.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I had a question. Last quarter, you mentioned that you had proactively decided to
keep the – I think it's the non-bank balance sheet in line with September 30 levels. I'm just wondering if you persisted
in that this quarter.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We have persisted in that this quarter. We did that just as a cautionary approach because
if you recall the feedback that we got around resolution planning, it said that if we didn't appropriately remediate the
identified deficiencies with the passage of time that one of the next step remedies that the regulators maintained and
could take was to ask us to roll back our balance sheet size to September 30 of last year. So just because we wouldn't
want to put ourselves in a position of having to make an abrupt change for something that was out of our control, we
decided to leave things at that level, and they're still operating there today.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So could you just remind us what it takes to get that approval to put more balance
sheet to work in non-bank? I'm guessing that that constraint weighed somewhat on your revenues relative to if you
hadn't had to have that constraint. And maybe give us a sense as to what kind of potential you could see as you are able
to reallocate capital to that business.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So I think we mentioned that, in part, our net interest income was impacted about
$100 million for our average trading assets being lower. In part, that would have related to keeping them at a level that
was underneath the cap that we put in place. So I think that could be a placeholder for the impact. I don't think that it's
preventing us from conducting the business that we want to conduct. And what it would take for it to change, of course,
is there the acceptance of our remediation approach to the deficiencies that we filed on 3/31.
And then also, frankly, the review of our 7/1 plan, right? We're all in a new resolution planning cycle, and we all
meaning the banking community, and we need to get feedback on that plan to make sure that it's well understood what
the profile of our non-bank activity means to our preferred approach to resolution. So my expectation is that we'll
probably be around where we are today or maybe somewhat higher until we go through this full resolution planning
cycle.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And that's another three or four quarters, I'm just wondering how long you think that
is.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, we file on 7/1. It's hard to say what the response time is for that. We could get
more information or have a better understanding between now and then or during the process afterward, but on the one
hand, there isn't a pent-up demand for an excessive amount of incremental assets in that business, so it's not – we want
to be able to serve all of our customers and have flexibility there, that's valuable, but it's not something that's waiting to
happen. And then on the other hand, the timeframes are uncertain because we're not in control of that process.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: So you've given us a lot of detail and a couple of examples of kind of depressed profitability,
and what I'm trying to get at is aggregating some of the drags from the regulatory and sales practices issues. You just
mentioned there might be a $100 million drag in trading versus what you could otherwise do over time. You pointed to
$80 million of sales practice expenses. And you kind of implied there were some other expenses, but I'm just
wondering if you can kind of aggregate all in as you think about the drag to profitability that you're experiencing now.
How much would that total, as I would assume it's something that you're thinking about internally a lot.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, Matt, it's a very fair question. I think it's difficult to pinpoint an exact number, though,
again I understand why you're interested. I think the way that I would maybe try to categorize things is that the retail
sales practices issues primarily impacted our retail banking business, so when you look at the progress that we've made
in terms of customer experience scores, customer loyalty, you've seen the increase in the number of primary checking
accounts and so on, you see progress from the lows of the fourth quarter and in many of the metrics you're seeing
progress throughout the first quarter, but they're certainly not back to pre-settlement levels, right?
And so my expectation is that over time we'll continue to make progress. I think Mary and her team in Community
Banking are doing a great job. We talked about the success with Mary and Dave and his team in terms of the Wealth
and Community Banking partnership. And so I think that that's where I would focus on. Clearly, we've seen a reduction

in new account openings and credit card, and my guess is that when you look at the annualized numbers, you'll
continue to see some deterioration in the second quarter, and then we'll begin to rebound from that. But that's where I
would focus on the retail side.
For the rest of the company, you look at Wholesale Banking year-over-year, up 10%. You look at Wealth and
Investment Management year-over-year, up 22%. I mean both of those businesses had some of the best quarters in their
history. So we've got some challenges on the retail side, we're very focused in that, but I think the rest of the bank is
continuing to perform well, and the retail bank business is really performing better than the lowest points in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter.
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is there a revenue that's being suppressed from all of
this because there's a lot of metrics out there that it's hard to translate some of these Retail Banking metrics into
revenues. The existing customer base seems to be performing well. We can look at your credit card balances overall,
the fee revenues. So I think part of the thesis on the stock would be that you're under-earning now because of some of
these issues impacting both revenue and expenses. And I'm just trying to square a lot of disclosures that are out there
with that. And again, you provide us some metrics on the revenue expense, which is helpful, but that's really the angle
that I'm coming from.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, I understand, Matt. I mean look, we always think we are under-earning, right? So
it's not – we don't want to get away from that – the fact that we think that we can continue to grow this company.
Clearly we've had a difficult period in our history, right? But another one to highlight, for example, would be, you look
at credit card balance growth and fee growth, they were in the high-single digits over the last few years, and now we
have drifted down a bit. Can we get that back up? Of course, we can. Is it going to happen in the next month? No, but
it's going to happen over time. And again, I would look at the detailed metrics that we provided as it relates to the retail
business, look at where we were historically, where we are now, the pace of recovery, and then step back and make
some educated guesses, and my guess is that you'll probably be right.
<Q - Matt O'Connor>: And then a bigger picture question related to this theme. Just in terms of how much time is
senior management still spending on kind of all of these issues and you can include anything from a regulatory
perspective that's new the last six months, the sales practices. If you had a percentage you had to put on how much time
you, John, and the business heads put towards this. And then the same question for the line staff because I would think
at this point, the line staff is maybe starting to turn the page in terms of looking ahead more, but just trying to get a
sense of maybe how things really feel inside the different layers.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. So let me start, and then John, jump in. I was in Arizona this week and in a few of our
branches, and I will tell you, for our team and our branches, they haven't turned the page and they are in a different
book, okay? They are out there serving our customers every day, and they are making progress and you see it in the
numbers. I think that one of the keys to the progress that we've made over the last six months, and we've accomplished
a lot in a difficult environment, that's not to say we're not through it, is that we task individuals to spend 100% of their
time on some of the regulatory issues. For example, we talked about the fact, publicly, that we established a rebuilding
trust office, meaning that we didn't want lots of people to be spending 10% and 15% of their time on some of these
issues, we wanted them to spend 100% of their time.
So we created a new group and they are spending 100% of their time on some of the issues in and around the consent
orders and some of the other remediations that were done. As it relates to senior management, it really depends on the
business, depends on the activity and depends on the day. It's episodic. I have to say some days I am probably spending
100% of my time on some of these issues. And you know what? That's a great long-term investment because if we
believe what we say, which is that rebuilding trust is the most important activity, we can, I spend 150% of my day on
that. So it's episodic. But I think every day we're continuing to make progress. I couldn't be more proud of the progress
that our team has made. I think they've made nine months of progress in six months and they should be congratulated.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great. Thank you. A quick follow-up question maybe on the gain on sale. You mentioned
you're expecting it to decline in the second quarter from the first quarter. I guess since we're so early in the quarter,
what's driving that forecast down quarter-on-quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think it's excess capacity in the industry. If the mortgage market is going to shrink to
$1.5 trillion, $1.7 trillion worth of volume, and there was more last year than there are people who are going to try and
price down to utilize as much capacity as they can. So it may not be down a ton, but I think that the margin will be a
difference maker.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: I mean, I guess, when you say down a ton, are you looking at maybe 20 basis points off of
the fourth quarter or 30 basis points?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. I think we're still north of [ph] $150 billion (01:01:25). That's the right area.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And I guess just a follow-up lastly, again, on the margin and the ability to remix the
balance sheet. I mean I hear what you're saying about the OCI risk management, but isn't that what the held-to-maturity
category is for?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. We're a significant user of that category. There are liquidity limitations when you
move a lot of assets into held-to-maturity. They're not as readily available in modeled terms, in regulatory terms as
ready liquidity, so you have to be cautious about how you do that, but we are a heavier user of that these days for that
very reason.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: But even if you took a 20% haircut on liquidity, in fact, for the LCR, it doesn't seem like that
it's a huge number in the overall given where your LCR is. I mean it's north of 100%.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Right. And we've begun to use held-to-maturity in a more significant way for the very
reason that you're describing, but nonetheless, we have a lot of interest rate sensitivity in that portfolio, and that's
probably the chief driver of volatility around our capital levels, and we're cautious about it. And, of course, if you
believe like it was reasonable to believe during the last quarter that a significantly more attractive entry point might be
in the relatively near future, then you would pause or slow down anyway. And that's what we're wrestling with,
especially now that rates have rallied back and it looks less likely that sort of the investable part of the curve that we're
talking about is going to be substantially higher in the future. We have to have an opinion about that and then suffer the
consequences once we've made our choices.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Sure. Thanks.

Your next question comes from line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So I guess I'll ask a bigger picture question that cuts
across a lot of the numbers and the more specific questions and answers that have been made. You, obviously, as any
public company have multiple stakeholders, you want to earn a fair return for your shareholders, you obviously want to
meet your regulatory obligations, you want to be a good corporate citizen and do good for our society and country, and
whatnot. But I guess what I'm getting at is how you think about balancing all those things in light of the sales fraud
issues and the fallout from that, and whether you think it is adversely impacting your ability to achieve positive
operating leverage in terms of the magnitude and the timing of that in terms of pulling the cost lever maybe a little bit
harder, doing things like rationalizing branches. So I guess I'm just asking how you think about it more from a big

picture standpoint, and whether you think it is having an impact on the magnitude and the timing of when you could
start to achieve positive operating leverage.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, it's a very good question, and the short answer is, of course, it's having an impact on
the performance of the company. I mean I think that when you step back and you look at how serious the retail sales
practice issues were, and the reputational impact on the company, you can only reach that conclusion, right? Having
said that, I also step back and appreciate that we've been in business for 165 years and we've had periods in our history
where we hit some rough patches. And I think what we've been able to demonstrate historically and that what our team
has been able to demonstrate over the last few months is we can work through those challenges and we will work
through those challenges, but in the short term, it's had an impact, it's had an impact in reference to Matt's question
about the time that we're spending in various activities, but I think it's making us a better company.
I've seen the management team of this company step up and accomplish things that I wouldn't have imagined. I think
we've asked a lot more of ourselves. It's increased the pace at which the change that we are making in the company and
all the while, right, we just had our 18th consecutive quarter of generating more than $5 billion of earnings and we have
achieved industry-leading or near the highs ROA and ROE, right? And that's a reflection of the quality of the team that
we have and that's the reflection of this diversified business model, which is incredibly valuable. So it's a big picture
question and that was a big picture answer, but there is no question in my mind that we are going to continue to
improve from here.

Your next question comes from line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, Tim and John. A couple of questions. Firstly, the board's report that came out said that the
sales practices, the issues you were having were identified as a serious risk to the board from 2014. Any color on why if
it was notified to the board at that point 2014, why it wasn't disclosed in your public filings since then?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, Vivek, I would prefer on this call not to spend a lot of time dissecting the board's
report. I think that the board's report was a very tough and comprehensive review of issues over a long timeframe that
dealt with some very serious historical challenges. Having said that, hindsight is incredibly valuable when you look
back at the reputational risk, a reputational impact on the company. And I think that based on the information that we
had at the time, I think we made appropriate decisions in terms of our disclosures and I think that the report reinforced
that. But again, knowing what we know now, would we have made different decisions? Not necessarily in terms of
disclosure, but in terms of actions that we took and changes that we took, absolutely.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Let me switch to my fundamental question. Credit cards, your charge-offs were up quite a
bit, 45 basis points linked quarter, auto was up also year-on-year. John, Tim, any color on where you see that going,
outlook for those?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: For those two specific portfolios?
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Yeah, because those have gone up quite a bit, so. And especially auto because of everything
we're hearing in terms of used car values and all the press you have seen. I don't need to regurgitate that so.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, so, good questions. I think that you've got to look at the performance of those
portfolios in context of, one, the size of those portfolios in terms of our entire loan portfolio, number one. And number
two, in terms of the credit quality of the rest of the portfolio, which is as good, if not the best that I can recall seeing in
my career. In terms of auto, and John did a good job of kind of walking through it, we saw and became concerned
about where used car values and where competitive pressures were, going back to the middle of last year. We have
been very transparent about that and we think that we've gotten ahead of any significant issues and that's why you're

seeing originations be down in the double digits year-over-year.
And that's not just something that happened this quarter, it's been the last few quarters. I don't know exactly where auto
losses are going to go. They certainly could go a bit higher, but I think that the changes in the decision that we made
over the last six months has reinforced kind of the long-term view of how we manage credit at this company. In terms
of credit card, I mean, John, jump in, I think some of that was seasonality, but I wouldn't get overly concerned about
how that could impact our earnings. I don't know, John, if you feel...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I don't think it will have an impact on our earnings, but it is an observation that
consumer unsecured credit is probably the weak spot in our overall credit portfolio. They're a little bit worse than they
were. We also have our own – we slowed down the growth of the size of the portfolio. So there's little bit less of a new
customer phenomena, a little bit more of a seasoned customer phenomena. So it's going to behave a little bit differently
if it's growing at a different pace than it's used to. I think we've got some fanning of the performance of different
cohorts of origination from year to year, and I think at the margins, it's a little bit worse. It's not a big enough
contributor to our performance overall where it's going to make a big difference. I think it's price for the risk that we
have, but the losses are a little bit worse.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I also think as we – we had historically been originated primarily through our branches,
which is well understood, and we have been experimenting with other channels of origination. And as we do that, I
think there is an expectation that on average those other channels will perform a little bit worse than people who are
already our deposit customers. We think we can price for that risk. We think that's – that's how the industry works. It's
a reasonable approach. But when comparing history with present, we should display some difference in performance.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Can you guys share with us, of your average noninterest-bearing deposits, about $364 billion,
how much is that in the commercial area versus consumer? And I think you mentioned on the call that you raised some
deposit rates in the commercial area. Could you share with us how many basis points you lifted them up in the quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, so it's correct that our deposit pricing changed in commercial almost entirely
versus consumer or small business, and so really the full move in average deposit cost for the company is coming from
commercial. So we'll do some quick weighted average math here and describe it, but if it's roughly half of the deposits
of the company, the impact on commercial was roughly double what the average was for the company as a whole.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I think that's fair.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And frankly, that isn't necessarily a widely programmatic pricing change, but it's through
different categories of customer based on relationship, based on value of the deposit, et cetera. So it's been somewhat
sort of by appointment as we've navigated through these rate increases.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And following up on the value to the customer, the compensating balances, would you expect
as rates go higher that your customers, your commercial customers, will be able to lower their compensating balances
amounts to still be able to receive the products you provide to them?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, yeah, because we need to adjust our earnings credit rate, the ECR rate that we pay to
those customers, so I think that's fair.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. John, you spent a lot of time about the OCI and the work you guys have done there.
Have you had any success in trying to figure out how much, based on what the Fed's balance sheet is today of $4.5
trillion and the talk of the unwind that's coming down the road over maybe the next 12 months, do you guys have any
estimate of what you think the impact on the 10-year government bond yield is due to the daily buying that the Fed
does to maintain that $4.5 trillion balance sheet?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We were hoping you'd tell us.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: There are a variety of academic studies that we've processed because, as you're
accurately pointing out, that is sort of the key risk in our OCI analysis, especially as the talk's been heating up about
them being more explicit about a QE reversal. And I think as you weighted average or look through those studies and
see what they mean, and of course this is going to feel different on different days as the market reacts to the notion of
selling, but in terms of that supply ending up having distributed back throughout the investing community, the market
would suggest you're in sort of a 60 basis point range in terms of yield differential. I mean there's a lot of assumptions
that are baked into that, but that would be sort of a consensus of the academic work that's been done on the topic.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And all kidding aside, there's a difference, I think, between the impact on treasuries and also
the impact on MBS. At the same time, it's hard to say if all other things were equal because when you think about the
impact on MBS, at the same time that that could be happening, we could be having a restructuring in terms of Fannie
and Freddie and the mortgage market. And so I think we've got to make sure that we're taking that into consideration.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. There could be wild volatility on any given day or...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. Absolutely.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: But once all is settled, that's the estimate of the full absorption of that overhang of
supply.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But I think if you – to John's point, I think if you assume kind of a high-double-digit range,
60 basis points to 70 basis points, 80 basis points, that's as good as we can imagine right now.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. And then just finally, you've talked about your efficiency ratio and obviously
you're not pleased with where it is today. When we look at your noninterest expense and divide it by average assets, the
stated numbers, it's about 2.86%, which is unchanged from a year ago. How much of the improvement in the efficiency
ratio that you foresee will come from revenue being better than – and I know you're going to focus on expenses, but
how much could come from better revenue?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, that certainly could happen, but that's not what we're focused on in terms of improving
the efficiency of the company, and I'm glad you pointed that out. I mean that would be – if revenues grew at 2x what
we've talked about, then the efficiency ratio very quickly would fall within our ranges. We're not going to declare
victory because of that. We're going to focus on improving the efficiency of the company. We'll measure it by the
efficiency ratio, but we'll certainly not take credit for the benefits that occur because revenues are up. We want to stay
with the risk discipline that we have as an overlay to all this. There's no question about that, but we want to improve the
operating efficiency of the company.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You're welcome.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: I just wanted to follow up on one of the broader themes of the board report, which related to
the compliance function and how it functioned. And could you just give us a sense of what – you've talked a lot about
changes to the comp structure and such, but in terms of the centralized oversight of the retail function, can you give us
a sense of where you are in that remediation?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. I'm glad you asked the question. So one of the areas that the board focused on was the
historical structure of the company, which I would describe as very siloed in terms of each business having its own
compliance functions, credit functions, finance functions, HR functions, and just think about all the enterprise
activities, technology, all the enterprise activities that you would need to operate a business like that. And I think the
report appropriately highlighted that that structure didn't allow for the appropriate escalation, the timely escalation of
the underlying issues, number one.
And number two, it didn't allow for as strong of a check and balance that we would have hoped for. We've
fundamentally changed that. And what does that mean? That means that we've moved the folks that were in risk within
the Community Banking business to our enterprise risk function, so they now report to our Chief Risk Officer, Mike
Loughlin. We've moved the human resources team that was in the Community Banking business and they now report
up through our Chief Administrative Officer, Hope Hardison. I could go on and on with each one of the activities.
So we centralized our enterprise activities. That's going to create some efficiencies over time, but the primary reason
we did that was so that we had a more appropriate escalation of risk and a more timely escalation of risk. And I can see
that working now in the company today, and that's some of the hard work and effort that the team's been focused on
over the last few months, and that's completed.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And you anticipated my follow-up a little bit, which is it would seem that
centralization should be ultimately a source of some efficiency, but I imagine there's also some investment going on in
these functions. So kind of net-net, how should we think about just kind of the cost of compliance within retail or
perhaps at Wells more broadly?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think that you should imagine the cost of compliance being elevated right now. And the
reason it's elevated right now is that, as you pointed out – or the reasons you pointed out, there's a lot of change going
on and we want to make sure we do it right. We have two consent orders that we need to comply with, and we've
invited third-parties to look at our practices and our culture across the company. So I would say that they're elevated
right now, and once we comply with the consent orders and we make sure that there are no other issues that we need to
deal with, then you can imagine those going down over time. But right now, the most important job of this company is
rebuilding trust. We can't sacrifice short-term efficiency for doing that over the long term, we're going to do that, and
we'll talk about that efficiency more at Investor Day.

into my head every time I start thinking about this. You said you're seeing progress in the retail bank, but you're not
back to pre-settlement levels, and I guess I would have to ask, what makes you confident that you can get back to
pre-settlement levels since a lot of the metrics we were seeing pre-settlement were bogus? So I guess what is going to

happen that sort of takes us back to this new path that's going to enable you to sort of get to a new plateau or the next
level?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. So, Nancy, I might push back just a little bit on the bogus comment because that would
indicate that our statements were materially inaccurate, and they weren't, okay? Having said that, you make a really fair
point, and candidly it's one we're wrestling with, because some of the metrics that we're seeing, and that we'll talk about
at Investor Day, for example, would tell us that the average value of the new primary checking customers that we're
bringing on is more valuable than maybe one year ago, two years ago or three years ago. And so we certainly could
imagine an environment where, let's say, the rate of new primary checking growth in Community Banking may be
lower than pre-settlement levels, but the value and, therefore, the revenue impact over time might be higher. And so
we're working through all that right now, but I take your point.
I didn't mean to suggest, and I appreciate the correction that I didn't mean to suggest that we think we're going to get
back to exactly to those numbers, but clearly primary checking account growth at less than 2% is below what our
aspirations are, and we can do better than that over time, delivering service and advice and products in the right way.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And I have a question for John, a follow-up for John. Deposit rates in the retail bank
are not up overall, but have you had to – in certain markets or certain customer subgroups, et cetera, had to compete
with deposit rates just to sort of overcome the sales fraud issues?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: No. In fact, we haven't. We've sort of stuck with our approach and the value proposition
of being a retail customer of Wells Fargo with the whole bundle of capability, functionality, et cetera, and the
relationships that we've had. So we haven't been competing in retail banking on price.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And just, Tim, one final question for you. The board report and the news of the
clawbacks, et cetera, et cetera, it was all very dramatic. In your view, does that sort of represent – does this report and
the events around it sort of represent the high watermark, I guess, of headline risk to the company? Did you get better
from here, I guess, is what I'm asking.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You know Nancy, the short answer is I hope so, but one of the things that I've learned
painfully, and I think we've all learned painfully over the last six months, is that regardless of how well we perform or
how dramatic the changes are, we don't control the headlines. I wish we did. I wish that the media would cover the fact
that we're one of the most generous, if not the most generous firm in financial services. I wish the media would cover
the fact that we've now had our 18th consecutive quarter of earnings over $5 billion. I wish the media would highlight
all the changes that we've made in headlines in this company over the last six months, but the news business is
different. It changes. They're under more pressure. I respect that. We respect it, so we're going to work very hard as we
continue to rebuild trust and do everything we can to put the headline risk behind it, but I don't control it, and we don't.

Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Thank you. You touched on this earlier about your cash balances and how that plays into
HQLA. Obviously, cash has gone up dramatically in this quarter. Could you talk about your targets or your long-term
targets on where these cash balances could settle down over the long term? I believe you said something around $200
billion back in the Investor Day last year.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, well, so it depends on what the calculations are for outflows under LCR because
our combination of cash and HQLA, which for LCR purposes are indistinguishable, is a function of those possible
outflows under stress. So it's going to move around. It's probably in the $200 billion range, but the decision about
whether to have a little more than that or a lot more than that plays back into this question of what are you going to do
with the rest of it, is there meaningful loan demand in that period, is there an attractive entry point for adding to our

investment portfolio in that period, and how is that influenced by our OCI sensitivity at that point in time given where
rates are and where they're likely to go on a probabilistic basis. All of those things fit together. But at least with the
balance sheet structured the way that it currently is, our commitments or other sort of calls on liquidity the way they
currently are, $200 billion is probably not too far off of a reasonable level.

through 2017 or is this something longer term that you're considering?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Do I consider our total available cash to decline toward more of a minimum, is that the
question?
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Yeah, that's right. Right.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. If we begin to get either a rate move-up or more certainty that the bigger stimulus
which might cause a big rate move-up isn't going to happen one way or the other, my sense is that we'll probably get a
little bit more invested throughout the course of the year, or of course if there are big moves in loan growth beyond
what we would reasonably imagine, which is the first call on all of our liquidity.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, thank you.
Timothy J. Sloan
Thank you. Well, I want to thank all of you for your time this morning. I know it's been a very busy morning for all of
you. I want to thank you for the depth and breadth of your questions. As we've mentioned, our number one priority here
is rebuilding trust in all of our stakeholders including you, our all very important stakeholders for our company, and
we're doing that with the overlay of making good long-term decisions to provide the best long-term returns to our

I couldn't be more proud of our team in terms of the progress that they've made over the last six months in terms of how
