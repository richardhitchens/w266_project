David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Christian, and good morning to everyone.
The events in Japan, geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, and worse-than-normal weather patterns
impacted the global energy industry in Q1. And these events weighed on our results, particularly causing a significant
decline in our Eastern Hemisphere margins in the first quarter, and magnified the seasonal drop-off we historically
experience in the first quarter of the year. This sharply contrasted with the excellent performance in North America,
where margins progressed as rig activity grew modestly in the quarter.
Given these factors, I am extremely pleased with our Q1 results. In my 16-plus years of experience at Halliburton,
we've never had a quarter that's had so many moving parts in it. And despite these headwinds, the events that transpired
have absolutely not dampened our enthusiasm for the long-term prospects of our business. And we continue to believe
that the industry is on the verge of the next major up cycle.
Overall revenue in the first quarter was $5.3 billion, which was a new company record. Against the prior year, revenue
and operating income grew 40% and 81% respectively, primarily from continued growth in our North American
operations.
Let me now discuss our operating results in more detail, starting with North America.
So there's no mistaking our view going into this discussion, since you know what our headline is, there is clearly room
for revenue and operating income to grow as we get further into 2011. Compared to a U.S. rig count increase of just
2%, our North America revenue and operating income grew sequentially by very nice rates of 13% and 16%
respectively. The growth came from our continued strategic investments in the North America market. Our Q1 results
were impacted by abnormally harsh weather in areas such as the Mid-Con, the Rockies, and particularly the Bakken,
where we have a disproportionate market share of the work.
As we pointed out in our fourth quarter call, we estimated that there were approximately 3,100 uncompleted wells at
the end of the year. Given the constraints brought about by the weather in the first quarter, we believe the number of
uncompleted wells increased to roughly 3,500 at the end of Q1. We expect to work off some of this backlog in the
second quarter, depending on industry capacity adds and customer activity levels.
The shift to the oil and liquids-rich plays remains unabated, and it's evidenced by oil-directed rig count growing 11%
while the gas rig count declined by 5%. Horizontal oil-directed activity represents the fastest-growing segment in the
market today, growing approximately 170% over the prior year. The structural change toward oil and liquids-rich
reservoirs has favorable implications to our overall business. Oil development requires longer laterals, a higher number
of frac stages, much more complex fluid systems, and increased prop and volumes. These factors are driving the
increased service intensity of the unconventional oil reservoirs compared to those in the dry gas areas.
Historically, service intensity has been measured primarily by horsepower deployed per job. However, given the
structural change toward the liquids-rich reservoirs, the driver for service intensity has shifted toward fluid chemistry,
completion design, and other technologies. Taking all of this into account, we currently estimate the average revenue
per oil and liquids-rich well could be 1.4 to 1.8 times that of a dry gas well, depending on the basin that you're in. The
work in oil and liquids-rich plays is technically more complex. We believe the shift to these resources will persist and
continue to benefit service providers that have reservoir knowledge, premium technology, and most importantly
integrated service offerings. We are developing, also, fluid solutions that set new standards for environmental
performance. We continue to improve public access to the ingredients we use in our fracking fluids and are disclosing

the ingredients used in a typical fracturing formation on our website.
Going forward, I feel even more confident about the resiliency of North America activity through 2011 than I did at the
beginning of the year. Elevated oil prices are increasing operator cash flows, which, together with their ability to raise
capital, provide us an expanded availability to use these funds as they invest them. In addition, the geopolitical turmoil
in certain international oil-producing basins is once again forcing customers to look toward more stable markets like
the U.S. This could lead to even further acceleration of upstream spending in the U.S. and North America.
Gas-directed drilling activity continues to be curtailed, now down about 10% from the levels experienced during the
summer of 2010. In the near term, we continue to believe that gas drilling could remain under pressure as gas produced
in association with oil and NGLs inhibit the correction of the oversupply situation. However, any curtailment in natural
gas drilling should be more than offset by an increase in liquids-directed activity. As such, there is a bias toward
increased activity on U.S. land for the remainder of 2011. And this is reinforcing our confidence on the sustainability of
our North American margins throughout the year. We are seeing some inflation on various cost items, like labor,
chemicals, and proppants, which may temper margin increases as we move forward throughout the year.
As you know, we've been very bullish on the U.S. market when some of our competitors were not. We remain
extremely bullish on this market, and we are very happy with the position we have in it today.
Another very positive development in North America is the issuance of 10 drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico. If
you look at the service contracts associated with these wells, Halliburton will be performing approximately 30% of the
drilling services and 40% of the completion work on them. This is actually higher than our historical market share. Our
customers continue to communicate their commitment to the Gulf and discuss potential projects using our existing
contract base. Our strategy of keeping our infrastructure and most of our head count during the deepwater drilling
suspension of course impacted our short-term results but is now giving us the ability to respond to our customers
quickly. As activity recovers, we should start seeing the benefits of this strategy. And we'll start moving some of our
personnel and equipment currently deployed on U.S. land back into the Gulf in the coming quarters.
Let me now turn to our international business, starting with Latin America. Latin America posted good results for the
quarter. We are seeing shale development work evolving in many parts of Latin America, and we are excited about
leveraging our expertise in unconventional resources to help our customers unlock the potential of these plays. Mexico
continues to be challenging, and we expect growth in our Latin American region for the rest of 2011 to be led by
Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Argentina. In Mexico, we continue to make progress in our Remolino Lab project
that will be utilizing our horizontal and completions techniques to enhance production for the Chicontepec field. We're
also seeing potential increases in offshore activity. But despite these opportunities, the reduction in activity in the
northern region will temper the expected overall growth in Mexico for 2011.
Now let's turn to the Eastern Hemisphere. In our fourth quarter call, we reminded everyone of the typical
seasonality-related declines that historically occur in the first quarter of the year. These items were further exacerbated
by harsher weather and disruptions caused by the turmoil in North Africa and the continued impact of overcapacity,
leading to pricing pressures. Now, so you don't get too excited about our Eastern Hemisphere margin drop, we expect
our Eastern Hemisphere margins to improve in the second quarter. They will, however, continue to be impacted by the
situation in Libya and by competitive pricing. As activity accelerates during the second half of the year, we anticipate
margins will return to the levels seen in 2010.
Now let me tell you about the events that impacted the results in Q1. Normal decline from Q4 due to seasonality of
software, sales, direct sales, and weather-related slowdowns accounted for approximately $110 million of the decline.
North Africa political unrest and other disruptions to operations causing operating losses and the Libya charge
accounted for about $105 million of the decline.
We also experienced delays in Iraq, where we finished workover activity and expected to immediately begin the
integrated drilling programs on several of the contracts that we won. There have, however, been customer delays,
mainly due to site access issues and unexpected delays in the government ability to move forward with the approval of
contracts. All of this, we estimate, reduced operating income by approximately $20 million over Q4 in Iraq. Going

forward, weather should clear itself up in Q2 and not have a significant impact on our near-term results.
Egypt, while not operating at 100%, should be nearing normal activity levels in the next several months.
In Libya, there is no relief in sight, and our operations are completely shut down for the foreseeable future. We took a
charge for receivables and some personal property-related issues and some compromised inventory. We have, however,
taken no impairments for fixed assets at this time, and we have some insurance to cover issues like this, but
impairments to fixed assets could occur, as the situation remains very fluid. And obviously, we will continue to monitor
it carefully.
And in Algeria, while things are getting better, the industry is still having issues getting administrative approvals on
contracts and contract extensions.
In Iraq, the impact of project delays was unfortunate in its timing, as we were fully mobilized to move from workover
activity to integrated drilling. We have, however, maintained our mobilization readiness despite these delays, and we
now expect that our work on these projects will start in Q2 and Q3. We are still very optimistic about the market in
Iraq. We continue to win work there, and we expect to be profitable in our operations in 2011.
Pricing also continues to pressure profitability, and leading-edge pricing remains highly competitive across the industry
in almost all markets. Tendered or negotiated prices that were set in the last several years will continue to hamper any
significant margin improvement in the international margins for the entire industry, despite the higher volumes that we
are seeing. So as I said, we expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to improve in the second quarter. They will,
however, continue to be impacted by the situation in Libya and by competitive pricing. But as activity accelerates
during the second half of the year, we anticipate margins will return to the levels seen in 2010.
Going forward, oil fundamentals remain robust. As supply disruptions stemming from the unrest in Libya and other
countries continue to exert pressure on the industry's overall production capacity, some of our customers have indicated
to us that they are now looking to increase activity in other parts of the world in the second half of the year.
One example of this is in Saudi Arabia, where our customer is planning to increase the rig count approximately 30% in
the coming year. Fortunately, 60% of this increase will be assigned to the Manifa project. Manifa would add
approximately 900,000 barrels per day to the country's production capacity. Halliburton, as you will recall, won the
offshore portion of Manifa in 2008. The project was delayed due to the global recession but will now start mobilizing
in the next several months. And we believe you will see an impact from the increased activity on Manifa in the second
half of the year.
The potential activity increase in Saudi, although positive, has not changed our view on the pace of the international
recovery. We have won a number of recent contracts in strategic growth areas, giving us further confidence in this
strengthening market, and Tim will discuss these in a few minutes. We are very pleased with the progress we have
made so far in focusing our resources into the market's fastest-growing segments. We continue to commercialize our
core technology. We continue to win key contracts. And we continue to make the necessary investments to ensure that
we gain momentum as the industry enters the coming up cycle, both in the U.S. and the international markets.
Now I'll have Mark give a little more flavor on the financial results. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.
Our revenue in the first quarter was $5.3 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter. Total operating income for the first
quarter was $814 million, down 17% from the previous quarter, as strong growth in North America was offset by
declines in our Eastern Hemisphere business. As Dave mentioned, the first quarter results included a charge of
approximately $59 million, to primarily reserve for doubtful accounts receivable from the Libyan national oil
companies and certain inventory that we believe has been compromised during the unrest.

Now, I'll be comparing our first quarter results sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2010, excluding the impact of the
Q1 Libya charge.
For North America, margins in the first quarter increased from the prior quarter due to stronger activity and improved
pricing across most basins. March activity came in much stronger, and margins significantly improved coming out of
the winter season, assisted by higher capacity and pricing. Even with relatively stable pricing and activity, we're
anticipating an increase in North America margins in the second quarter, although they could be somewhat restrained
by cost inflation.
Now, in terms of the segment results, Completion and Production revenue increased $187 million or 6%, while
operating income remained flat. Strong North America and Latin America results were offset by the declines in the
Eastern Hemisphere, where we saw lower vessel and other activity in the North Sea, seasonally lower completion tool
sales, and political unrest and other disruptions in North Africa. Looking at Completion and Production on a
geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 16%, while operating income grew by 19% due to higher
activity and pricing in oil and liquids-rich shale basins, where increased completions intensity continue.
In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 11% and 50% respectively due
to increased cementing activity in Colombia; higher stimulation activity in Argentina, driven by higher shale work;
higher well intervention; and vessel activity in Mexico.
In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income decreased 22% and 89% respectively,
due to lower vessel and other activity as a result of weather-related issues in the North Sea, seasonally lower
completion tool revenue across the region, and activity disruptions in Egypt and Libya.
In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted sequential decreases in revenue and operating income of 7%
and 31% respectively, due to project delays in Iraq, as Dave mentioned, and seasonally lower completion tool sales in
China. This was partially offset by stronger boots and coots activity, particularly in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Australia.
In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income declined, primarily as a result of seasonally
lower direct sales for wireline and Landmark Software, delayed drilling activity in Iraq and the UK, and the shutdown
of operations in Libya. This lower activity was partially offset by improved North America results.
In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue increased 7%, as most of our product service lines continued to
benefit from the increased horizontal rig count, which grew approximately 4% from the fourth quarter. This has
favored our well construction technologies, and we expect this underlying trend will continue.
Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income declined 3% and 26% respectively, due to the
typical slowdown in Landmark revenues across the region, offsetting higher shale activity in Argentina and Mexico and
increased fluids business in Brazil.
In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were down 7% and 38%
respectively, due to weather-related seasonality in the North Sea and Russia and activity disruptions in North Africa,
which are partially offset by higher offshore drilling activity in Angola and East Africa.
Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue and operating income were down 12% and 56% respectively, from
seasonal declines from Landmark Software and direct sales in China, and cost incurred from delayed project startups in
Iraq.
Now I'll address some additional financial items. As we discussed in our fourth quarter call, we're making some
additional investments in our business model throughout 2011 to lower our service delivery cost in North America and
reposition our supply chain, manufacturing, and technology infrastructure to support our projected international growth.
These investments, which we're including in Corporate and Other, impacted our results by approximately a penny per
share in the first quarter. We slowed down these activities as we experienced significant declines in our Eastern
Hemisphere operations. Over the coming quarters, we plan to continue to separately highlight these investments for
you, and we currently expect the impact to be $0.01 $0.02 per share in the second quarter. And outside of these
investments, we expect our Corporate and Other expenses to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million per quarter

for the rest of the year.
Our first quarter 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax election we made with respect to a foreign
subsidiary that allowed us to recognize some additional foreign tax credits. We expect the effective tax rate for the
balance of the year to be between 32% and 33%.
And finally, a year ago this week, the industry experienced one of its biggest operational and environmental challenges
with the accident in the Gulf of Mexico. While more than 100 crewmembers survived, it's with great sadness that 11
lives were tragically lost. Out of this tragedy, however, have come unprecedented changes in establishing improved
best practices, particularly when it comes to safety and the approach to sustainability.
Along with all the changes in industry practices, there are also many moving parts on the legal front. Over the next
several weeks, we expect a number of claims, counterclaims, and lawsuits to be filed among all parties involved in the
well alleging ordinary and gross negligence against each other in order to preserve their options in the ongoing
litigation. Given the current and impending legal challenges related to the incident, we'll not entertain further questions
regarding these issues on this call.
Tim?
Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development
Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
As Dave mentioned, we've been very pleased with a series of contract awards this quarter, which underpin our thematic
growth areas. Internationally, we're seeing strong trends in the development of complex higher-temperature and
higher-pressure reservoirs, and we saw success in penetrating key deepwater basins with our high-pressure,
high-temperature technologies, and key wins with Chevron Thailand and Statoil in Norway. We've invested in the
development of the broadest portfolio of high-pressure, high-temperature technology in the industry, allowing us to
execute complex wells in the harshest offshore environments and, of course, to strengthen our position in these
markets.
Since the beginning of 2010, we've won approximately 70% of all HP/HT services that have been tendered in the North
Sea. In addition, we're pleased to have been selected for the provision of a wide range of services in the Malay Basin,
including directional drilling, logging while drilling, cementing, fluids and testing, and completion services. The Malay
Basin, incidentally, has the highest temperatures amongst offshore basins, and this project pushes existing technology
limits, with requirements exceeding 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
Integration of our services has been an important differentiator for us in driving market penetration in support of our
key growth themes. We've supported this with technology investment in highly efficient workflows under our Digital
Asset initiative and are providing compelling value propositions to our customers.
We recently announced a contract award for integrated drilling and well services in Norway for fast-track development
projects on up to three offshore rigs that are designed to reduce time from plan to production in half. This, together with
the Shell Majnoon and Exxon drilling package contracts award in Iraq, provide growing evidence of our customers'
interest and our ability to integrate drilling and completions workflows to provide efficiencies for their projects.
We envision that these types of contracts will continue to grow faster than our discrete business portfolio. Upcoming
projects for Apache in Argentina and PEMEX on the Mexico side of the Eagle Ford play will also largely be delivered
through our packaged and integrated service model. Contract models are evolving from fixed price contracting
arrangements to models that include performance-based and various other risk-reward mechanisms, which are quite
attractive to us. The integrated and packaged services model has grown significantly for us over the last two years, and
our project management team is today managing over 100 strings globally.

David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Tim. Just to summarize the call, going forward I feel even more confident about the prospects of our North
America business in 2011 and beyond. We believe there's room for upside in both revenue and margins as we respond
to the continued increases in service intensity. And while our Eastern Hemisphere margins were adversely impacted in
the first quarter, we expect recovery in the second quarter, and as activity accelerates in the second half of the year
expect margins to return to 2010 levels. And finally, we are gaining momentum in targeted growth areas, as evidenced
by us winning several large key contracts.
So with that, let's open it up for questions, and we'll go from there.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead
with your question.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. Good morning, Dave. Quick question about your margins going forward, really on
the D&E side. Seems to me one of the keys to earnings growth for Halliburton in kind of '12 and '13 is getting the D&E
international margins up higher. Just stepping back, I guess, from some of the issues we've seen this past quarter, can
you talk about where you see some of the drivers to materially improve these? And when do you see them kind of
eclipsing the 20% mark?
<A - Tim Probert>: Dave, this is Tim. I think a couple points there. I mean, clearly, D&E was impacted quite
significantly by the unrest in North Africa – important market for us. And, as you know, we've been gearing up quite
significantly in Iraq for our drilling packages there also. And the sort of delays that Dave referred to on the call with
respect to the start-up of those projects, because of delays in clearing sites and getting the civils completed, were also
quite impactful to us, too.
So I think number one obviously, then, is the restoration of some of those activities around getting back to normality
for some of those projects. Clearly we're going to see a significant improvement in Saudi in the coming couple of
quarters. We're going to see a significant impact. The Saudi activity, offshore Manifa, is a significant project for us.
And as you well know, the service intensity in Saudi in their offshore and onshore projects is quite high. So the
combination of that, plus the mobilization for a number of the project wins which we have made I think are all
contributing factors to us getting back onto a stronger trajectory for D&E margins in the second half of the year.
<Q - David Anderson>: Now, is that partly also a function of where we are in the cycle? I guess would you expect that
D&E – because I guess I noticed in kind of '06 to '08 is when you really saw the D&E margins pick up. So is that sort
of a function of the cycle as you kind of get more into the exploration side as well?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Yeah, most definitely. I think as exploration
activity starts, we're clearly going to see a significant increase in exploration during the front end of this cycle. That's
always very helpful to D&E margins.
<Q - David Anderson>: I guess on a related note, I was curious about what you're hearing out there on offshore
development activity. Would you expect that to start picking up over the next 12 months? And in the discussions you
have with operators, are they talking about moving projects forward? Is there kind of a greater sense of urgency out
there right now with kind of oil prices and potential supply disruptions?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Well, I think in general, I would say that
there was an increasing confidence. The psychology of the market, as you well know, is really important. And so this
does create a sense of confidence in terms of the underlying commodity price. So I would say just generally, yes, there
is a stronger sense of wanting to move ahead confidently. However, we also have to say that I don't think it's actually

been seen yet in terms of actually increasing overall activity or putting incremental rigs to work. But in general, to
answer the first part of your question, clearly we're pretty enthusiastic about offshore activity in general in the second
half of this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Doug Becker>: Thanks. Dave, you mentioned that international pricing's still highly competitive in most markets.
Does this mean that we're still seeing pockets of weakness? And what would have to change to change your expectation
about the pace of the international recovery?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, I think you've got to look at it sort of two ways. One, I think we clearly see the volume
increases coming at us because of the activity increases, and that will absorb the overcapacity out there. And I really
wouldn't say that there's pockets on a geographic basis of sort of price competition. I would just say on any large tender
today, there's plenty of competition and significant price concessions being given. That tends, in my experience, to go
away as capacity gets absorbed and people start to focus more on margins and returns and less on getting the original
contract in hand. And I think right now we're still in sort of the competitive phase of this, but we see sufficient volume
coming at the end of this year and into next year that hopefully will absorb that capacity.
<Q - Doug Becker>: And just a quick follow up. In terms of – when you think about capacity utilization, how do you
think about that? Should we be looking at rig count, or is there a better way to be measuring that?
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I think rig count is probably the best
surrogate, especially if it's a deepwater offshore rig. And then you sort of apply your service intensity multiple to that,
and I think you can make a pretty good estimate of how fast the spare industry capacity in oil services can get soaked
up.

Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Two related questions. One, on the CapEx side, are
there any changes to your plans, and how is sort of the rollout of equipment in North America proceeding? And along
those lines, how should we think about North America pricing as we kind of go forward over the next several quarters?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Stephen, on the CapEx side, I think we're still on our plan. You should expect, I think,
2011 CapEx to be probably closer to about $3 billion. That's sort of where we've been aiming. Again, most of that
CapEx – or at least a higher majority of it – will be North America, as we're rolling out pressure pumping capacity this
year. We've got a number of infrastructure projects going on around the world as well that will be influencing that
number. In terms of capacity rollout, we're on schedule. I mean, I think that you saw a little bit of that influencing our
March results and why they came in so strong, and we continue to see that CapEx rolling out systematically as the year
progresses. It's contracted. We know where it's going to go to work. And we're staying the course as we speak.
Your second question – I think that our general view, because that capacity is basically being fully absorbed, we saw in
the quarter a continued increase in service intensity. We saw increases in the amount of horsepower required per job.
And we saw an increase in the amount of 24-hour operations. That tells you that the environment is still ripe to
continue to move pricing. And so we're continuing to do that, particularly with regard to making sure that we're more
than covering cost inflation; that's also pushing against us. And so we still believe that we can continue to move
margins forward as the year progresses in North America.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: That's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: Hi, thanks. Just – I'd like to follow up on that last comment and looking at North America pressure
pumping intensity versus overall service intensity – clearly up nicely in the quarter. But can you talk about how much
of that sort of revenue growth came from the pressure pumping intensity side of it, than versus the just overall increase
in service intensity from some of the other value-added services that you mentioned in the press release and during the
conference call?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Yeah, I think just a quick comment on
pressure pumping first. During the course of the quarter, utilization levels actually surpassed those of 2008, which I
think is another interesting data point for you. But to answer your question fully, I think we're seeing it across the
board. Whether or not it's pressure pumping, drilling and evaluation, or completions activity – or others, for that matter.
It's an across-the-board phenomenon. And I think as I referred to in my kind of prepared comments, this sort of concept
of integration is something that is working very positively for us. We believe that it's a differentiator for us, and it gives
us the ability to provide a platform in which we can essentially bring everything along in that portfolio at a fairly sort of
even level, and benefit all elements of the company equally.
<Q - Dan Boyd>: That makes sense. Can you comment or give us a little more detail on the strategic placement of frac
stages that you highlight in the press release, and just how meaningful was that to the business? Where are you in the
evolution of that? And I assume that's something that is more unique to the integrated providers like yourself.
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: I think that clearly, as Dave referred to,
we're seeing a significant shift in the way in which the industry's evolving towards both oily and liquids-rich activity.
And there are significant differences in terms of the way in which we complete those wells relative to dry gas wells.
And so what you're seeing is an increased degree of complexity and, frankly, an underlying commodity price which
allows you to drill longer laterals, so more stages, and more complex completions than we have seen hitherto. And
that's driving the service intensity change of sort of 1.4 to 1.8 relative to dry gas that Dave referenced in his call.

Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Yeah, thank you very much. On the seasonalities and weather number highlighted at $110 million,
how much of that was domestic versus international?
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Ole, none of it was domestic. It was all
international. As I said, we had a slight disruption to our U.S. operations due to weather, mainly in the Rockies, the
Mid-Con, and Bakken, that caused a slight decrease to the margins and revenue stream with respect to Q1. But the
amounts we highlighted were totally Eastern Hemisphere.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: So if we add all that up, then, the $110 million, the $105 million, and $20 million, that's $235
million; you did $2.3 billion of sales internationally. So that should suggest about a 10% margin effect?
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. Yeah, that's about right,
Ole.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: And you did a 9.4% margin internationally, so this suggests that in a normal environment and
today's pricing – I mean, normal environment, we can all scratch our head and ask what that is, of course – but does
that mean that we're looking at an underlying run rate really in the high teens when the world settles down again, with
no further pricing improvements?
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You know, I don't know. I
haven't sat here trying to do the math, but I don't know that that would work out that perfectly. I mean, clearly there's a

pricing impact that's continued to impact margins overall. As Dave indicated, pricing continues to be fairly competitive,
and as contracts start, we're still having the influence of the negative pricing over the last year or so that's still creeping
into the margins. So I don't think it would work out that perfect. But clearly some of these things have an impact on
margins strictly because of your fixed cost level that you have to incur to maintain operations even if the weather shuts
things down.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Yeah, but it does suggest that the underlying international activity or profitability level may be
significantly better than what these numbers suggest.
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think, Ole, that's why we
indicated that we're confident that margins will start to increase next quarter and head back to where they were last
year.
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah.
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: And then you've got to factor in sort of
where the pricing competition evolves the balance of the year. So as Mark said, I don't think it's a perfect calculation as
you laid it out, but the trend would certainly be toward swinging it back to last year's margins, if not a little higher.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Perfect. And how do you think about, Dave, allocation of capital-constrained equipment, whether
it's directional drilling, rotary steerable? I mean, I'm sure you have a whole bunch of tools that you consider where to
send around the world, and you're making these kinds of returns in North America. I'm a little baffled that international
pricing is as competitive when you can make these outstanding returns in North America in a market that arguably is
becoming a lot more visible and transparent with the order lag. So how do you think about that?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Ole, I think that argument would
presuppose that all equipment is created equal for all applications, and that's really not the case. What we use, how we
use it, and essentially the orientation of businesses in North America tend to be quite different than the international
markets. As you know, in the international markets, they tend to be much more drilling and evaluation led. The North
America markets tend to be more production and completion led. And so I think that's probably one of the underlying
reasons why you don't see the sort of complete freedom of movement of assets around the globe, because they're not
completely suitable in those applications.
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Of course, the other thing I'll
also say, Ole, is that we were hurt clearly by the issues in North Africa. We can't get those assets out of Libya right
now; that's part of the issue. So you've got assets that are sitting there that no service company can actually get access
to.
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: As a closing comment, in general, the
international markets tend to use a higher service level. Our service intensity in international markets, even on land
rigs, tends to be much higher. Use Saudi as an example or Kuwait as an example. It's much more comparable in terms
of equipment delivery with something that we might utilize in the Gulf of Mexico than it is onshore in the U.S.

Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Thanks, good morning. Mark, back to North American pricing and margins for a second here. You
talked about the fact that there isn't a whole lot of difficulty absorbing the incremental frac capacity that's being brought
online, that as pricing continues to move higher, you're going to be offset by oil service cost of goods sold inflation.
And my question is how does that distill into a view on incremental margins? And last year, for the first three quarters
while you were getting pricing activity and service intensity uplift, incrementals for C&P were between 45% and 56%
quarter on quarter. We had a drop in the Q4, 28%, because of – I would assume in part due to the drop in your Gulf of
Mexico work. And then we had, again, relatively subdued incrementals in Q1 of 31%, 32%. So how should we think

about incrementals going forward?
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, we're not going to give
any specific guidance for competitive reasons, Bill, appreciate that. But I think that you should pick up from our
comments that we do remain confident that – we think that the incrementals will continue to be good -
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Yeah.
<A – Mark A. McCollum – that they will continue to increase. We feel we've kind of hit the bottom on the Gulf of
Mexico, with the increased permits. While it'll take some time, we still expect that as the year progresses, the Gulf of
Mexico will start getting back to work. And that comes at a nice, consistent margin that historically has been quite
good. So that will add to the mix favorably.
And then when we look at our margins, particularly in March, where you had a month that was not influenced by
weather, with stronger activity and the rig count, it just says we do expect a bump in our margins in Q2. And as we
look out across the year, there's no reason in our view today to expect that that will not continue to sort of move up as
the year progresses. Now, it's not going to be at the same pace as we had last year. That's certainly the case. But there is
incremental opportunity to continue to improve our margins.
And, of course, the second thing, a part of these strategic initiatives that we're working on that we highlighted at our
Analyst Day last year is continue to work hard on addressing our cost structure as well, so that we can continue to be
the lowest-cost service provider out there.

Our next question comes from Roger Read with Morgan Keegan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger Read>: Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the issues weighing on the international margins. As
you kind of look by region, obviously, Manifa's going to kick off here, you've got the trouble in North Africa, but
maybe a little more detail on Latin America and the Asian markets, if you could.
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Well, first of all, just on Manifa, obviously
Manifa will be a benefit. But bear in mind that those rigs will come in sort of ratably over the balance of this year, so
we will not see a sort of significant one-time impact of that. It will change as we go through the course of the year.
You mentioned Latin America. Clearly Brazil continues to be a positive growth environment for us. Argentina we've
referenced a couple of times, particularly as it relates to unconventionals and the growing benefits there, particularly as
our customers derive benefit from, quotes, "new gas" pricing, which is providing them some confidence to do
additional work and invest incrementally. Andean countries in particular are showing some positive signs. Mexico – the
brightest spot there, I think, revolves around two things for us. Number one is the southern development of the Eagle
Ford, both in terms of the dry gas leg and also the oily leg for PEMEX in Northern Mexico, which is clearly a positive
for them and us, and the very good progress that we're making with our Remolino Lab in Chicontepec, which, if you
recall, is – PEMEX is focused on really adding a greater degree of G&G capability and underlying science to the
development of that reservoir.
<Q - Roger Read>: OK. And as kind of an unrelated follow-up, in North America on the cost inflation side, could you
kind of give us an idea of what the bigger issues there are, other than the obvious one of labor?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Well, clearly labor, yes, it most definitely is
tight. That is a significant component of all of our – in fact, the largest single component of our cost structure. And
clearly all elements of inflation are kicking in for us, whatever they may be, whether they're on proppants, whether
they're on transportation, you name it.
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: [ph] Inflation (48:56) has also
gone up quite dramatically.

Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: There's been a lot of conversation as relates to the margins in Eastern Hemisphere and with
the progression, maybe, there. I was just curious, as we look more from a top line perspective, 2010 versus 2009,
Eastern Hemisphere revenues were essentially flat. Can you talk about what kind of growth we're expecting on the top
line, Eastern Hemisphere, maybe 2011 versus 2010, as you guys see it right now, given what's going on in North
Africa?
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Again, I don't think that we want
to give specific guidance as to what we think will be happening. As we've said several times, we think activity is
coming. We've seen that. We've seen our customers' budgets, as you have, increase significantly. We see a significant
number of offshore rigs coming into the market. And so areas like the North Sea, West Africa, we expect as the year
progresses will begin to pick up.
Tim mentioned Brazil just a second ago. I think that the issue that we're seeing right now, and part of the reason why
you see the impact of just sort of year-over-year flat revenues, flat top line growth, is the impact of pricing, that pricing
has remained competitive. And that influence continues to mask some of the other activity-related increases that we've
experienced and we believe will be coming. And so we think that, as Dave mentioned, activity is coming. It's going to
pick up as the year progresses. And that will have a pull, activity-led sort of margin pull, for us in the early part of the
year, and we are hopeful that as capacity utilization increases, that the markets [ph] in and old change (51:07) that will
allow us to begin to think differently about pricing as we tender for contracts later in the year between us and our
competitors, which will probably have more of an influence in 2012, but hopefully we'll get some of that in the late part
of this year.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Sure. The project delays that were noted in Iraq of roughly $20 million, do you all believe
that's specifically just a function of your specific customers, or was that something that you think everyone in country
likely experienced?
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that if you look at, if you
[ph] had instead of a (51:43) brownfield drilling site, you have your infrastructure in place and you probably are not as
likely to have been delayed. And we didn't see delays, for instance, in a lot of our workover activities that we were
doing for various companies. But when you go to more of the greenfield opportunities, one of the things our customers
are experiencing is preparing pad sites, and typically that is out of scope of our contract. And when they're developing
the roads to and these drilling sites, what they're finding is lots of unexploded ordnance resulting from the Iraq-Iran
war, and various wars that have been in there, and it's taking them substantially longer to get these drilling sites ready
for us to mobilize to. And so I think – I would think of it more in terms of it's brownfield versus greenfield. It's the
greenfield projects that are tending to get pushed back a bit because of these site development issues.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning. Hey, just wanted to – I know you've mentioned the international margin on
a number of different fronts. And just for a clarity point, I just wanted to make sure I understand it, that on the
international margin for 2011, on the year, if you look at 2011 versus 2010, are you looking at the same margin for the
full year, or are you guys thinking more on the second, third, and fourth quarter that '11 would look like 2010? I just
want to get some clarification on that, please. Thanks.
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Yeah, I think we're looking at the –
obviously going forward here, Kurt, I think clearly the first quarter's been a very challenging quarter, and I don't think
that we could expect at this stage get that one to make up. So I think you're looking at it correctly by looking forward.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And second – OK, all right. And then just a follow-up here on the frac capacity. What do you
think's coming into the capacity in the market here in 2011, and are you still seeing interest from your customers on
term contracts? And are those term contracts 12 months, 24 months, 36 months? Has there been any change in the
length that your customers are trying to contract out this frac capacity?
<A - David J. Lesar, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer>: Essentially, we could contract out most
of our capacity, probably about any terms we wanted to dictate at this point in time, but typically we are keeping that
relatively short. We are not doing essentially fixed-price contracts. We're doing performance-based contracts, which
force us and our customers to reach certain levels of productivity or we have the right to move that spread on to
someone else. And we think that's the best way in this, basically, this market that doesn't have enough capacity to
handle everything that's there. So we're trying to preserve our ability to be opportunistic but make sure that as every
piece of equipment comes out of the manufacturing plant we have, that it has a home to go to on day one.

Our next question – I'm sorry. Go ahead.
<A - Mark A. McCollum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I was going to say, I think in
terms of our – the overall estimates of overall capacity coming to the market, our estimates haven't really changed. I
think we still think that probably in the 3 million, 3.5 million horsepower is probably what's coming into the market
this year.

Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim Crandell>: Good morning. I want to ask another question on pricing internationally. It seems to me that the
anecdotal stories about pricing, not just at the commodity end but what have heretofore been the very large largest,
highest-margin jobs, has gotten extremely competitive out there. And I think, Dave, you voiced optimism that when
activity comes, it'll all go away, but – or at least it'll improve. But is it true, in your opinion, that pricing conditions are
worse at this time than you might see at this point in other cycles, and do you think it may not all go away, just due to
various company strategies that exist out there?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Jim, this is Tim. I would say in general, yes,
I think things are more competitive today than we've seen them in the last couple of years, certainly. I mean, typically
when we think about pricing and you think about tightening pricing, you really think about changing the trajectory of
the market. And I think you would agree that we haven't seen a significant trajectory change in the market.
I think what we're starting to see now are some significant signs of trajectory change. Our IOC customers and
independent customers are getting more confident about their spend, and in particular the NOC customers – and you
see that – obviously Saudi Aramco would be a good example, KOC [Kuwait Oil Company] is another example of – and
also in the UAE, we're starting to see some significant changes in terms of NOC spending patterns. They don't always
typically follow the natural progression of commodity prices. But as they kick in, you're going to see a change in

Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks, good morning, guys. Could I ask you – let's see what's left here. Maybe, Tim, you could
come back to your comment about your receptiveness to performance-based and the risk-reward mechanisms and your
enthusiasm about that. In tenders, are you now driving offerings to that regard, or rather are you generally being pulled
into offering that sort of thing? Talk to us a little bit about that, please.
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: No, I think we're very much driving towards
incentive-based contracts. I think they provide good value for us, and I think that, we have invested – as you know,
Brad – quite a bit over the course of the last couple of years in really developing efficient workflows which can stitch
together all the key elements of our operation. The key to our customer is a value proposition. They're not interested in
just a collection of services at the well site. They want to see real value. And I think that we're delivering that value
proposition, and it's making it a much easier sell for us to engage them in discussions around incentive contracting. And
so I do expect that to continue over the course of the next year or two.
<Q - Brad Handler>: To what extent are these about the timing, efficiency of well construction, versus, say,
productivity or really production related?
<A - Tim Probert, President – Strategy and Corporate Development>: Yeah, I think today we're very much
focused on time-based efficiencies, I would call them, both – primarily in the well construction phase. But I definitely
think that over time we have the potential to evolve those to production-based efficiencies, too.
