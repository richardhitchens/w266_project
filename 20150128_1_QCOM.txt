Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong quarter, achieving record revenues and
non-GAAP operating income. QCT shipped a record number of MSM chipsets and delivered our highest-ever revenue
and earnings before tax. QTL operating performance was ahead of expectations and I am pleased to report that we have
resolved our previously disclosed dispute with a large Chinese licensee. We are continuing to cooperate with the
NDRC as it conducts its investigation and believe it is progressing toward a resolution. During the quarter we also
returned approximately $2.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and buyback activity, consistent with our
increased capital return targets.
Turning to QCT, our first fiscal quarter was very strong with revenues and MSM chip shipments up 14% and 27%
year-over-year respectively. MSM chip shipments were at the high end of our expectations as we saw broad strength
across multiple OEMs driven by demand in emerging regions and strong device replacement in the U.S.
While our outlook for the first half of the fiscal year is ahead of our prior expectations, our QCT forecast for the second
half of the fiscal year has been reduced due to a number of factors. First, we are currently seeing a shift in share among
OEMs at the premium tier, which has reduced the near term addressable opportunity for our Snapdragon Processors
and has skewed our product mix toward more modem chipsets in this tier.
Second, we now expect our Snapdragon 810 Processor will not be in the upcoming design cycle of a large customer's
flagship device, impacting our outlook for both volume and content in that device.
And thirdly, although we had a very strong competitive position exiting fiscal 2014, we are seeing heightened
competition in China at the mid- and high tiers. We are continuing to gain share year-over-year with OEMs based in
China, but not at the pace we previously expected. This is in part due to some product challenges with one of our chips
in meeting some of the more demanding design points of those tiers. This has provided an opening to competitors who
are being very aggressive in order to establish a position in the marketplace, resulting in more pricing pressure than
previously expected.
We have already addressed many of the initial product challenges in order to support early customer device launches in
these tiers and are continuing to further enhance the performance of this chip. As a result, we continue to expect to see
a broad range of devices successfully launched and drive volume with this chip.
We estimate that these factors will impact our QCT revenue growth and operating margins through the near term
product cycles. However, despite these near term factors, our view of the long-term strategic environment and QCT's
leadership position remain strong.
Design momentum for the Snapdragon 810 Processor remains robust, with more than 60 products in the pipeline,
including the recently announced LG G Flex2 and the Xiaomi Mi Pro Note. Snapdragon 810 is performing well and we
look forward to a growing number of devices to be launched by our customers throughout the year.
Snapdragon 810 delivers 64-bit CPU capability using licensed technology and is fabricated in 20-nanometer. As you
know, the use of internally designed custom CPUs has been a core part of our strategy that has worked well for some
time. With the 810 we made a conscious decision to use licensed cores to accommodate the accelerated shift to 64-bit.
The competitive landscape has underscored the importance of differentiation associated with our internal custom
designs, and looking ahead, our next premium processor will use our own 64-bit custom CPU architecture as well as

the most advanced process node. We expect this product to sample in the latter half of calendar 2015.
In China, the expanded FDD licenses, increased competition between carriers, and the accelerated pace of LTE device
penetration aligns with QCT's LTE leadership. We believe we are well positioned going forward for three primary
reasons. First, we expect the modem transition, driven by LTE Advanced, including uplink carrier aggregation will
drive a new device design cycle beginning later this year, which our road map anticipates. Second, we will drive our
road map to advanced performance nodes to enable us to competitively address the opportunities ahead. And finally,
we are differentiated both in terms of features and scale, which will allow us to help OEMs based in China meet the
specification and deployment challenges related to expanding their businesses outside of China.
For Qualcomm overall, our longer-term growth drivers remain strong, both in smartphones and adjacent areas where
our mobile technologies and capabilities can bring next-generation solutions, areas such as automotive, internet of
things, mobile computing, networking, small cells and data center solutions.
At the Consumer Electronics Show, it was clear that many industries looking to leverage mobile technologies into their
products and businesses are looking to the leaders in mobile, such as Qualcomm, for support creating an internet of
everything. We demonstrated a broad set of products and equipment that are already shipping with Qualcomm
solutions inside, including the areas of automotive, smart home, smart city, networking, mobile healthcare and
wearables.
On a related note, the very strong results of the AWS-3 spectrum auction here in the U.S. reinforces the need to
continue to invest in cutting-edge modem technologies that provide great user experiences while helping operators
improve their return on the spectrum asset investments. We are very well positioned to enable operators and OEMs to
bring new spectrum bands online as quickly and as broadly as possible with technologies such as advanced carrier
aggregation.
I would now like to now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.
Derek K. Aberle
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. QTL delivered a strong quarter, with revenue and earnings ahead of
expectations and total reported device sales of $56.4 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of our prior
guidance.
I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved the dispute with the major Chinese licensee that we previously
disclosed. Importantly, we were able to successfully resolve this dispute despite the pending NDRC investigation. In
addition to the licensee agreeing to report and pay royalties on past unreported sales, the resolution includes an
expansion of the existing license agreement to include royalty-bearing licenses for 4G-only products, including
three-mode LTE smartphones sold for use in China.
We believe the licensee has fully reported its September quarter shipments in our first fiscal quarter, and we expect the
licensee to report in our second fiscal quarter a catch-up for units that were sold in periods prior to the September
quarter but were not previously reported due to the dispute.
We continue to believe that some of our Chinese licensees are not reporting all of their sales of licensed products. We
have increased the number of audits that we are conducting of these licensees and are attempting to resolve the
instances of underreporting. While we always prefer to resolve these types of issues amicably with our licensees, we
are, of course, prepared to enforce our rights under our license agreements if that becomes necessary.
Although we continue to sign new 4G-only and other license agreements, including in China, and the recent resolution
of the licensee dispute gives us even greater confidence that we will be able to collect royalties over time on
substantially all LTE device shipments, including three-mode devices in China and other currently unlicensed products,
OEMs supplying a meaningful portion of three-mode devices and lower tier 3G connected tablets remain unlicensed.
We are in discussions with many of these OEMs and are making progress, but we expect it will take some time to

conclude all of the negotiations.
As to the NDRC investigation, we are continuing to engage and fully cooperate with the NDRC as it conducts its
investigation. We have discussed with the NDRC a number of proposals for addressing its concerns and we believe we
are making progress towards a potential resolution. Having said that, the timing and outcome of any potential
resolution remains uncertain, as does the potential impact on our future business in China.
Now let me provide an update of our view of global 3G/4G device demand. We're seeing demand for global 3G/4G
devices continue to grow at a very healthy pace, and we have increased our calendar 2014 global 3G/4G device
shipment estimate to approximately 1.35 billion units, up approximately 25% year-over-year. As a reminder, this
includes those devices we expect to be reported to us through the first calendar quarter of 2015 as well as our estimates
of unreported and unlicensed device sales, but excludes TD-SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE.
The broad availability of compelling devices at the mid and low price tiers in emerging regions is driving strong
demand for and migration to 3G/4G devices. We're also seeing an increase in the replacement rate of devices in the
United States. Looking forward, we're also increasing our estimate for calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments.
We now expect approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion units to be shipped during 2015, up approximately 11% to 19%
year-over-year, with a bias towards the high end of the range, driven by continued positive upgrade trends in the United
States and accelerating migrations to 3G/4G devices in China and other emerging regions.
As we explained last quarter, several factors, primarily related to challenges in China, are currently causing shipments
reported by our licensees to be less than the global 3G/4G unit shipments I just explained. For calendar year 2014, we
are increasing our estimate of reported 3G/4G devices to between 1.135 billion and 1.175 billion units, which is
approximately 200 million units below the global 3G/4G device estimate of approximately 1.35 billion units at the
midpoint. This represents our current view of unreported and unlicensed activity for calendar year 2014, and after
adjusting for resolution of the dispute, is in line with our prior expectation of the percentage of global device shipments
that we expect to be unreported or unlicensed.
Turning to estimated 3G/4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to QTL during the first quarter of fiscal 2015
was approximately $197 at the midpoint. The sequential decline in the reported ASP was primarily driven by a weaker
premium tier in the September quarter ahead of new flagship launches, heavier price reductions of certain handset
models, additional reported units from the Chinese licensee whose dispute we resolved, and foreign exchange effects.
In the second fiscal quarter, we expect both the global and reported ASPs to be higher sequentially as the strong
holiday season at the mid- and high tiers more than offset some additional foreign exchange headwinds. We expect the
reported ASP will be significantly impacted by the dilutive effects of catch-up units sold during several prior periods
that we expect to be reported in the second quarter as a result of resolution of the licensee dispute.
We are now forecasting global 3G/4G device ASPs to decline approximately 12% to 13% year-over-year in fiscal
2015, instead of our previous estimate of 9% to 10%, with the delta being driven by stronger-than-expected unit growth
in emerging regions, the September quarter pause in the premium tier, increased OEM competition and mix shifts, and
negative effects of foreign exchange, which alone contributes approximately $2 dollars of the ASP decline. Within this
overall view, we are seeing relative stability in developed region ASPs as well as increasing ASPs from Chinese-based
OEMs.
In total, we expect global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2015 to be up approximately 6% to 9% over fiscal 2014 global
3G/4G device sales, which is in line with previous expectations as the growth in volume from an increase in the
replacement rates in the U.S. and accelerated emerging region migration offsets moderately-increased ASP declines,
including the expected impact of foreign exchange headwinds.
To conclude, we continue to see strong 3G/4G device demand from both higher replacement rates and faster 2G to
3G/4G migration. We are pleased to have resolved the previously disclosed dispute with the major Chinese licensee,
and we remain focused on resolving our remaining challenges in China.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to George Davis.

George S. Davis
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results came in above expectations on
better-than-expected operating performance from both QCT and QTL. Fiscal first quarter revenues were a record $7.1
billion, up 7% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.34, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP
earnings per share were $0.10 above the $1.24 midpoint of our prior guidance range.
QCT accounted for approximately half of the upside on strong MSM demand and lower operating expenses, with the
balance coming from improved total reported device sales, lower operating expenses in QTL and other businesses, as
well as the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $56.4 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance
range, with an average selling price of $197 at the midpoint and reported shipments of 286 million 3G/4G-based
devices at the midpoint.
QCT achieved a number of records in the quarter, including shipments of 270 million MSMs, revenues of $5.2 billion,
and earnings before tax of $1.1 billion. Revenue per MSM was lower sequentially, as expected, reflecting a greater mix
of modems. QCT operating margin was 22% in the fiscal first quarter, reflecting strong MSM shipments and lower
operating expenses. For the company overall, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our
expectations, decreasing 3% sequentially, reflecting timing of certain program spending and cost initiatives in the
quarter.
Turning to capital structure, during the fiscal first quarter we returned approximately $2.4 billion to stockholders or
112% of free cash flow, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and approximately $1.7 billion in
stock repurchases. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, we had approximately $3.6 billion remaining of our stock
repurchase authorization.
Additionally, since the end of the fiscal first quarter, we have repurchased an additional 6.8 million shares for
approximately $500 million. Cash flow from operations was approximately $2.4 billion, or 33% of revenues, and we
ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31.6 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18% in
the fiscal first quarter, and we now estimate that our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%,
slightly higher than our original estimates on business mix.
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2015. Our revised financial guidance for the fiscal year reflects a reduced
outlook for the QCT business in the second half of the fiscal year. We now expect 2015 total Qualcomm revenue to be
in the range of $26 billion to $28 billion, up approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint and lower than our
previous guidance midpoint by $800 million. We now expect 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of
$4.75 to $5.05, down approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint and down 6% from our previous full-year
guidance midpoint. We estimate fiscal 2015 QCT operating margins will now be in the range of 16% to 18%, which
reflects a reduction of about 200 basis points at the midpoint.
Our QTL forecast for the fiscal year is modestly improved, driven by an improved TRDS outlook, partially offset by a
modest increase in the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to expect that fiscal 2015 QTL operating margins will
be approximately 85% to 86%. Combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to grow approximately
3% to 5% year-over-year, in line with prior expectations. As a reminder, we continue to expect lower investment
income in fiscal 2015 as compared to the strong investment gains reported in fiscal 2014 as we rebalance the risk levels
in our investment portfolio.
Looking to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately
$6.5 billion to $7.1 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per
share in our second fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.28 to $1.40 per share, up approximately 2% year-over-year at
the midpoint. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up 6% to
8% sequentially, reflecting normal increased seasonal expenses primarily related to employee payroll taxes.

In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $69.5 billion to $75.5 billion will be reported by our licensees in the
March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint,
reflecting the busy holiday season. We also expect to see a benefit from previously uncollected royalties for
prior-period sales related to the resolution of the customer dispute in China.
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 220 million to 240 million units during the March quarter,
down approximately 15% at the midpoint sequentially, coming off the busy holiday quarter, and up approximately 22%
year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. We expect QCT
operating margin to be approximately 16% to 17% in the fiscal second quarter, lower sequentially, reflecting the impact
of lower seasonal volumes.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
Warren Kneeshaw
Thank you, George. Brent, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thank you very much. I guess I just want to focus on the operating margins for QCT, et
cetera. Can you give a little bit of color on what's driving those down for the year? Like how you're having to spend
additional funding or spend additional money versus just pricing pressure and that kind of thing?
Then I'm also wondering if you can talk through more medium- to long-run what you think your to-do list looks like to
recapture the lost share and better reassert yourself in the markets where you're feeling the most pressure? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi, James. It's George. Really, the op margin effect in the near term that we are talking about
is typical seasonal coming off of a very strong December quarter. For the full-year, the reduction of the 200 basis points
we talked about is really a function of the change in outlook for the year which is being driven by impacts at the
premium tier and so that's having margin pressure. You're also seeing some of the OpEx benefit we saw in the first half
was really timing of programs and so that will be in the second half of the year impacting margins as well.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: This is Steve. With respect to the medium-term long or long-term, I think I would view
this more as a product cycle issue versus anything else. If you look at – one of the hardest things for us to do is to
project what the mix is going to be, whether we are going to sell a lot of thin modems or whether it is going to be
Snapdragon processors and I think the largest impact in terms of the change of the outlook is really due to the mix of
products. As I said in my remarks the 810 is actually doing quite well. Any concerns about the 810 in terms of design
traction really are probably limited to one OEM versus anything else.
In the low tier in China it's very competitive right now, primarily because there are a number of new entrants trying to
get share. We think there will be a modem transition in the second half of this year and we are anticipating that. We
think that will be a good strategy. I think long-term we don't see a change in the competitive dynamic or even a change
in the strategy of particular customers. We think more this is more of a product issue.

<Q - Brian Modoff>: Steve, off that last statement you made in terms of modem transition in the back half of the year,
can you give us more color around this? Is this still 20-nanometer or is it going to be more the 16-nanometer? How is it
going to be different?
And then what you're seeing competitively in China, are you seeing competitors coming with something more than a
three mode solution or are you seeing something more advanced than that?
And then on – George, the question, or Derek, this licensee that you settled with in China, can you give us an idea of
what the rates are for that licensee? Is it around your corporate average and does that include single mode LTE as well
and the ability to collect on that as well as collect on multi-mode that includes TD-SCDMA? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: So, Brian, in China, we're not seeing anything different than really three mode in China.
We're not seeing much ability for the competitors to go outside of China and we have anticipated that carrier
aggregation would be important in China across tiers and we think that that will happen here sometime in the second
half of the year. It's always difficult to time transitions in China but, as you're aware, it's a pretty fast-moving situation
there.
If you look at year-over-year, we are still going to see share move up in China in these tiers, we just anticipated that it
would grow even more and I think that's exacerbated by the pricing pressure, as I mentioned. So we are looking
forward to seeing a modem transition. We will follow that up with FinFET products eventually. We are going to
transition our existing products to more advanced nodes but I will try to keep some of that proprietary for us right now.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Brian, this is Derek. We can't talk too specifically about the terms in the agreement, including
the rates, but I guess I will just say that we are pleased with the resolution of the dispute. As I said, we believe that in
this quarter the licensee has now reported the full volume that they were supposed to report under their agreement.
They will also, we expect, be reporting a catch-up amount for prior period sales next quarter that will benefit for us.
And then we were able to extend the scope of the agreement, to your question, to include LTE only licenses. This
particular licensee was already licensed for 3G, but we've now extended that to include 4G only, including the three
mode devices sold for use on China Mobile's network. So all in all, we feel very good about the result.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim Long>: Thank you. Just one follow-up and another one if I could. If we could just go back to the, maybe
George, the $800 million revenue reduction and $0.30 in earnings, it seems like a pretty large incremental margin
implied there. So maybe you can just walk us through how there's that big of an impact on that type of revenue miss.
And then I'd love the opinion of you guys on this Xiaomi-Ericsson deal in India where Xiaomi is allowed to ship with
your products in there. Just curious what you think that means for the chipset business for the Chinese to export, and
does it mean anything for the licensing business and potential discussions with NDRC? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi, Tim. This is George. So on the flow-through issue, which is essentially seeing $0.30 off
for the full year on what we're looking at, what you're really seeing is the fact that, while we described kind of three
themes in terms of impacting the second half of the year for QCT. It's really the themes that impact the premium tier
that are driving the impact, and so the margin flow-through impact on that revenue is in line with the adjustment that
we're talking about. So it's really driven by the fact that the impact is happening at a place where we have strong
operating margins.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tim, this is Derek. Let me answer your question on Xiaomi. So I think we've consistently said
that we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help the Chinese OEMs build their businesses outside of China. That
comes, obviously, both from a product perspective in terms of our scale and ability to do that as well as the
cross-license rights that we've obtained as we've negotiated agreements over the years. And I think you're seeing some
of that play out now in India.

On the licensing side, I wouldn't draw any direct correlation to the NDRC, but what I would say is we've talked from
time to time about tools that we have at our disposal to deal with companies that are not complying with their
agreements or not signing licenses, and I think you can look at what's going on in India as just one example of the tools
that are available.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Great. Thanks. Just for Steve, going back to the QCT guidance, can you update us on
expectations for revenue per MSM that's implied in your guidance with the mix shift?
And also just longer term, on a bigger picture view with Qualcomm's long-term business model, really has been about
increasing dollar content or revenue per MSM over time. After this product cycle with some of the misses, do you think
this metric can return to growth in fiscal 2016? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi, Mike. This is George. On the outlook for the year, we haven't guided but effectively what
we did say, it'll be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. For the full-year and the second half, again, pointing to the
premium tier weighting of some of these issues, it will have a dampening effect, but we'll just leave it at that.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Yeah, Mike. This is Steve also. In the long term I would say that I'm not sure we see a
difference in terms of what the market is looking for. In fact, I would suggest that even though our mix is probably
more thin modem versus Snapdragon-based, the overall market appears to be absorbing new technology quite rapidly,
even to the point where it appears that perhaps even in certain tiers, the replacement rate is improving, because people
are upgrading to a larger screen or what have you. And we think that's a good trend for our business both on the
licensing side as well as the chip side, eventually.
I want to be clear, too. I think the 810, we think is going to be quite strong in terms of design traction and they'll be in a
lot of devices. Like I said, it'll be over 60 devices, and it'll be interesting to see how it sells through. But we're definitely
getting the sense that you still have to provide leadership technology in order to win.

Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
<A - Warren Kneeshaw>: Yep.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Awesome. Thanks. Appreciate it. Couple questions. Can we just hit at the heart of the 810
issue? There's obviously been a lot of news in the press about overheating, and if we could just kind of hit on – just
want to confirm, is it your opinion or thought process that the issues with that flagship device happened on a
compatibility issue or incompatibility issue between 810 and that particular device, and that any other device those
issues are not a concern? If you could just give us a little detail on why that might be to let us get a feeling as to maybe
there's nothing particularly wrong with the 810 per se but that it just happened to be a match up with that one device,
that would be helpful.
George or Derek, now that you have that licensee signed up, can you give us a sense, A, as to how large is this catch-up
going to be next quarter and is that in the guidance so we can take that out and get a sense as to what the pure guidance
for next quarter would be without that catch-up and your new numbers for the recognized volume for 2014, I believe it
was, included 20 million higher than it was before, it's 195 million is the delta between the recognized and
unrecognized TRDS whereas now it's 195, last time it was 215. I don't want to get too complicated but is that 20
million improvement in the difference between the global TRDS and your recognized TRDS, is that all due to this one
licensee? Thank you.

<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Ehud, this is Steve. On the 810, I'll be very clear. The device is working the way that
we expected it to work and we have design traction that reflects that. If you look at the number of designs, it's over 60.
It's essentially won all the premium designs across multiple ecosystems in China, Windows Mobile as well as Android,
so we're quite pleased with how that is performing.
There is concern, as you mentioned, it's really related to one OEM and I don't think you should extend that to imply
that something has changed fundamentally between us and that OEM. And of course that OEM has a number of
different models that we feel well-positioned across our entire product tiers.
So I think that's going to be great product for us. We are going to follow that up, as I mentioned in my script, with a
device that returns to our internally developed CPU with integrated modem and our – going at the latest node, so I don't
think we seen a change in strategy and we're quite pleased with that device. We just wish it had won one more design.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: This is Derek. You might recall that when we gave prior guidance, just given the amount of
issues that were on the table and the uncertainty associated with the timing of resolution of each of those, we gave quite
a wide range and said to get towards the higher end of the range we needed to resolve or make progress on several of
them. So, in essence, the resolution of the dispute was already baked into guidance from that perspective. The catch-up
payment is also effectively included within the guidance that we provided for Q2.
On the math exercise, I actually figured somebody was going to ask this question. Let me try to break it down for you.
Remember, we gave quite a wide range of the under-reported or un-reported amount because again, there's uncertainty
around exactly what that would be. Everybody kind of gravitated towards using the midpoint of 215 as the talking point
although we don't have any more confidence necessarily in the midpoint than we do in other parts of the range. The
way you get to the 215 is sort of assuming at the low end of the range there is no resolution with this particular licensee
and at the high end of the range assuming that there would be full resolution, so the midpoint is actually something in
between.
So when you actually try to deconstruct the math it's basically pretty hard to get there but let me just basically tell you
the net-net of all of this is there is an improvement based on resolution of the dispute so therefore less units being
underreported but also the overall end market, we believe, is going to grow at a faster pace than we did during the last
time we provided guidance, and so even though the percentage of units that we believe will be unreported is basically
staying in line with our prior expectation, the actual number of units would have gone up but for the resolution. So the
net of it is, it comes down but it doesn't necessarily – you can't attribute the delta exactly to the amount that's resolved
from the dispute.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Tim M. Arcuri>: Thank you very much. Derek, just on that point about the increase in the TAM for 2014 and
also 2015 can you talk about what regions that that's coming from and maybe what portion of that is China?
And then as a follow-up for George, just on capital return, the stock is down now in the mid-60s here post market. You
bought back $500 million during January which is the same run rate that you bought back during the entirety of
calendar Q4 yet it doesn't even really scratch the surface on really what you could do. Is the thinking around more
capital return just China and getting that resolved? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tim, this is Derek. So I think on your first question, really the growth in the market is
primarily coming from a stronger view on emerging regions, which includes China but is not entirely China. So other
regions such as India, Middle East and Africa and some others are contributing to that as well.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hey, Tim. Now on capital return, obviously we increased our program in this area
substantially starting last year, and this quarter we talked about returning over 112%, our minimum commitment being

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. First, I want to take a little bit of
exception to your point that the unit TAM is going up. It looks like the unit TAM is going up for the global market but
your global ASPs; you've guided them down quite a bit. They were down 9% to 10%, now they're down 12% to 13%. It
doesn't look like you took your estimates for the global market value up at all, so all of these units are coming in but
they're coming in at a lower ASP and there's no revenue growth upside versus where you were modeling before. So
how should we think be thinking about, I guess, the impact of elasticity here in units and growth? And how do we think
about the marker growth going forward?
Secondly, I'd love to get some feeling – I know you're doing your best to enable the China OEMs to grow outside of
China and maybe you don't have any choice. So I'm just wondering, is that a good thing to do? Maybe it gets back to
the first point, what does it mean for the long-term business as the China OEMs gain share outside of China and start to
take share potentially in developed markets with ASPs that are probably quite a bit lower than what you're enjoying
there today?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Stacy, this is Derek. On the market growth, effectively, when you think back to the discussion
we had in New York, really what we said is about 6% to 9% global TRDS growth, and we had a view on what ASPs
would do throughout the calendar year. But we also made the point that in 2014 and 2015, we really view this
fundamentally as an elasticity-of-demand exercise, and as ASPs come down, that units would go up so even if there
was an increasing pressure or decline on the ASP in the next year or so, that would drive higher units, and essentially
that's what we are seeing, those two dynamics are playing out. The growth in the market overall from a TRDS
perspective is in line with what we expected in New York earlier in the year, but it's just a little different mix in terms
of units versus ASP.
And you might recall, we did talk about a number of factors which we think long-term cause the ASP declines to
moderate. And I think that also applies to your comment on the Chinese OEMs. I think a couple things we expect will
happen over time. One is that there's going to be consolidation among the Chinese OEM base. There's just really too
many players to sustain themselves long-term. And as that happens, as well as they become more successful outside of
China, invest in building their brand, invest more in R&D, that there's no reason their pricing profile would not become
more in line with what we're seeing from some of the other OEMs today, and actually we commented on that today in
the scripts, that we actually are starting to see Chinese OEM ASPs increase.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Stacy, this is Steve. I think also you should think about the Chinese OEMs really as
being multiple tiers. We see a grouping that in many ways is filling in some of the gaps that are being left because some
handset manufacturers that historically have been in the United States and Northern Europe or even in Japan have
exited portions of the world. And they've been filled in largely by some of the higher-tier Chinese OEMs and they have
strong ambitions and they're really developing the assets to be able to do that. In addition, there's a lower tier product
which I think is being used really to drive the migration from 2G to 3G/4G, and both of those trends we think are good
for our business.

<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Thanks. Steve, two for you. Just to clarify in your answer to Ehud's question on the large
OEM, is that a product line you'll be selling a thin modem into or no chipset at all?
And then secondly, you mentioned or, I guess, hinted at a modem transition in China later this year. I suspect that's
carrier aggregation. Do you have any sense of your lead against your major competitor there on getting a carrier
aggregation chip in that market? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Tavis, it's Steve. I will try to stay away from talking a lot about the different design
dynamics in a particular OEM. in part because I'm not sure it's even been determined yet as to how that's going to settle
out and also it's just part of our – we just don't talk about those things but we did think it was important to disclose how
it impacted our financials with respect to the 810.
On carrier aggregation I would say LTE feature set broadly, which is quite diverse as you probably recall from our trip
in November to New York, we feel like we're in a very strong position, not just in terms of feature leadership at the
high tier but we have moved carrier aggregation down in through the tiers, and similar to what we did with the
transition to 4G where we made a transition to make sure that we were there for that move in China. We think there
will be feature updates happening in China.
We also believe that long-term, you need to offer international markets to the Chinese OEMs because of the answer to
the previous question and therefore you trip on the requirement to add new bands, to support things like VoLTE and
SRVCC, things that really stress the modem feature set, so we feel like we have a strong lead there. We are starting to
see three mode competition come in but we don't believe that to be enough of a feature set to really cause us to change
our view of the strategic environment.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Hi. Thank you for the question. My first question is for Steve, which is with this
transition of the major OEM, I know you booked a lot of 810 design wins and that's reassuring, the issue being at the
high end of the market. What has become very clear in the last three or four years is there are two vendors: one of them
doesn't use your Snapdragon, the other one seems to be de-emphasizing it, frankly and so the issue here being is that if
condition prevails you're kind of making a bet that market share in the high-end, which has proved very hard to crack,
is going to somehow change and what confidence do you have that therefore the 810 will drive an improving mix at
some point, two or three quarters – I'm trying to understand the dynamics of where the confidence comes from that it
could be a good product for you in the QCT business really.
And then for Derek, my question is on the resolution you've had with this one licensee in China, the lower end of your
TDRS range has gone up by only $5 billion and so on the high end it hasn't gone up as you probably anticipated it
maybe coming through. What I'm trying to get at is, has the outlook for the licensing opportunity in 2015 ex- this
resolution, deteriorated this year for various reasons, whether it's ForEx or ASPs or mix and that kind of thing? Is that
the right way of thinking about it ex- this resolution? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Kulbinder, it's Steve. In terms of the long-term, I think it's – our view is that it probably
won't consolidate to just two OEMs, and in fact I think it will be broader than just two ecosystems will be successful in
the mobile computing area. And I think even in the near term if you were to look at our market or region such as China
and you would look at how the share has changed around over time, you've seen a number of different OEMs who have
really taken share at the premium tier. They tend not to be household names in the U.S., or in the developed world yet,
but we think there's an opportunity for that to occur.
In addition, I don't think you've seen things – we haven't seen things settle out in terms of how the different ecosystems
will play over a multi-year period. And I think if you look at the views that we have had over the years in terms of
which OEM was going to win, we've been very, very hesitant to make a particular bet or a strategy based off of that and
just the shift shares between what's happened to either Nokia or RIM or what have you over the years have really

reinforced that to be the right place.
What we tend to do is drive technology. We tend to have an interest in technology and make sure that that's the key
thing. Now, we are very, very aware that as the market opportunity narrows because of a particular thin modem going
better versus the AP, we have to watch that in terms of how we spend our investment and we're trying to do that
judiciously.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Kulbinder, this is Derek. On the second question, really if you look at it, like you said, we
kept the high end of the reported TRDS range the same but brought up the bottom end of the range by about $5 billion
which would actually shift the midpoint up. And there's a bunch of puts and takes in that.
Obviously, the resolution of the dispute would push it up but there's also some offsetting factors with FX, ASP, and
unit, so you can't necessarily triangulate the $5 billion just to the licensee dispute. But the net-net of that is actually
probably a more positive not negative picture and I would say incrementally we're feeling more positive about the
outlook for the business in the fiscal year than in November even.

Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. I have questions about your cash position, U.S. cash position. It declined year-over-year
substantially, from $8.7 billion to $4.1 billion if my numbers are right. That means that you will run out of domestic
cash in the next nine months or so if you burn the same amount of cash, so it's also declined substantially sequentially.
What are the puts and takes in the cash burn? Is there anything else outside of dividends and buybacks that we need to
consider?
Then the second question is, assuming you're going to have access to more capital, whether it's through debt raising or
repatriation even, whatever it is, what are going to be the uses of cash? Are you going to increase the dividend
substantially or do you have any set agenda on the right dividend if you have more access to capital? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: So consistent with what we've said, the step-up in our return of capital is going to draw down
our domestic cash balance and that's really what you've seen. We indicated either on the last call or at the analyst
meeting – I believe it was on the last call – we'd be in the market raising debt in our second fiscal quarter, which we
still believe we will do. And again, really to try and maintain a cash balance in the $2 billion to $4 billion range at all
times domestically for flexibility but, as you've seen in 2014, we returned capital ahead of our minimum commitment
of 75%, closer to 100%, and we're ahead of that in the first quarter having returned 112%.
So it's really returning capital more aggressively in the form of share repurchase plus the last two dividend increases
were 40% and 20%, so significant increase in our dividend outlays as well, all part of our program that we talked about
last year and are executing to.

deceleration of unit volume in 2016, so looking out another year, and I'm just wondering, do you think that ASP

the total market value? I know that's looking a long ways out but I'd be curious to know what you're thinking there on
ASPs. Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Rod, this is Steve. So on share, I think what you're really seeing is a change in mix
versus a fundamental share picture in QCT. You tend to see more thin modems versus Snapdragon processors and that's
everybody is working through changing their portfolio to respond, I think, to a very strong player in the premium tier
that's changed the mix of products. And then, in addition, I would say in China we're going to see share gains
year-over-year, but not as much as we had expected. It's pretty competitive in terms of the environment there, but it's
really more a mix story versus a share story.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Rod, this is Derek. Let me just kind of go back; I'll try to recap some of the stuff we talked
about in New York. We really gave a view on ASPs for 2014 and 2015 and then talked about we think that they're
going to stabilize or moderate more longer term. And so we haven't given guidance all the way out into 2016, but if you
kind of think back to some of the drivers that we still see as playing out over the longer term, right now we think a lot
of this is coming from an accelerated growth of emerging region volume, which we think will – the relative growth
versus developed will moderate over time. We also think there's going to be a replacement cycle over time in the
developing regions, then we gave a number of statistics, I think, back in New York around increases in affordability
and the amount of disposable income that people are willing to spend on their mobile device.
And in fact, there was just a Boston Consulting Group report that was released last week in Davos that really
underscored that, I think, in India it was about 45% of disposable income is what people would spend on their mobile
device. China was around that same range, maybe a little lower. So we see a longer-term picture where affordability
and then people trading up as they move into the smartphone tiers will help actually stabilize or even increase selling
prices in emerging regions.
And then as we talked about with the Chinese OEMs, one of the things that's going on right now is basically share shift
between non-Chinese players to Chinese OEMs in China and other regions. And today that's coming at a lower ASP,
although we think over the long term that that will stabilize as well as there is consolidation and these companies get a
stronger position in the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yes. Thank you. Derek, you may have read that Apple and Ericsson are in a licensing dispute
with Apple saying that, among other things, that the royalty should be – the rate should be based on the price of the
baseband chip. And that's sort of added to concerns that we may have this spillover effect from China into other
regions, and I was hoping you could talk about that, and if you could, just update us on when there might be some
major contract renewals.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Okay. Well, why don't I take the first. I'll try very hard not to comment specifically on the
litigation between Apple and Ericsson, given that they're both partners and customers, but let me just kind of take it up
a level and talk about the baseband chip level licensing.
There have been, I would say, efforts or arguments made for a number of years both in patent litigation as well as
standards bodies that the appropriate royalty base should be the chip instead of the full device. Those have actually
never succeeded anywhere where the argument has been made. And even the damages law in the U.S. is not consistent
with that when you think about portfolio-based licensing. So we'll have to watch this and see where it goes, but
certainly the norm in our industry has been very much in line with the way that we have licensed historically, and we
think there's a lot of good reasons that support that long term.
Also, I don't want to comment too specifically on China; there have been obviously a lot of rumors and things in the
press, but you even look at the Chinese OEMs that have disclosed how they might license their IP portfolios, and they
talk about licensing at the handset level, not the chip level, and some of the decisions that have come out of China in

the legal system have been consistent with that as well.

<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you. Gentlemen, in the early stages of the smartphone market it was really about getting your
phones out to the market, velocity of market, getting it out there, and so that favored the integrated solutions. Now with
this concentrated market share and the increased choice of components, local competition in China and as the market
further matures is this part of a broader trend to kind of unbundle and dis-integrate components in flagship devices,
how we should be thinking about it over the longer-term?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Mark, this is Steve. When we look at the accounts and we look at the competitive
situation, I would not make that conclusion. Most of – in fact, without question every competitive solution is trying to
get to an integrated space. Part of that is in order to compete in the marketplace you have to fit within an area and a cost
target that without integration is very, very difficult to do. There's really only one OEM that doesn't do that and does
that well and they tend to play at a very high tier which gives you a little bit more freedom not to do that but the vast
majority of units worldwide don't have that luxury, so we tend to see everybody trying to produce integrated solutions.

are you so confident this is good for the company? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure, Brett. On your first question about the 810 in a particular account, I would think
of it as isolated really to one account and one portion of their portfolio I can't really talk about what would happen in
the future. It's really a better question for them versus us.
Broadly in the industry I think we're quite pleased with the design traction and we would love to see them take more
share versus some other folks in the – to see the premium tier growing more would be great for that product I think is
really the key.
In terms of the relationship with Samsung LSI and Samsung in general, it really hasn't changed. We've had a
long-standing relationship with Samsung across different things, whether it's licensing or product business or the
foundry or even our collaboration across mobile and different devices. We have a very broad relationship. I wouldn't
think that there's a change in that and it's not a new relationship as well.
As I've mentioned a number of times, the fact that Samsung now has a leading node tends to be something that's good
for the Qualcomm business. It allows us to compete with other competitors in the marketplace. So we have a very
intricate but, I think, a good relationship with Samsung.
