Chris Suh
Thank you, Rhea. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are: Satya Nadella, Chief
Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff,
Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and the financial summary slide
deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of
differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures
provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in
accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the

All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise
noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our
underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
At the start of fiscal 2018, Microsoft adopted ASC 606, the new revenue accounting standard. Today's Q4 earnings
report and any forward-looking statements follow the current revenue accounting standard, consistent with our
reporting throughout fiscal 2017. In early August, we will be holding a conference call to provide you with information
that will aid you in the transition to the new standard.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is
available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live
transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on
the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 20, 2018.
During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements
about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the
comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other
reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any
forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris, and thank you to everyone joining on the phone.
This quarter, we delivered $24.7 billion in revenue, up 10% in constant currency. For the year, we are at $96.7 billion
in revenue, up 5%. I am proud of the progress, particularly the strength of our Commercial Cloud results. FY 2017 all
up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with Cloud, AI, and digital transformation.
Our technology worldview of an intelligent cloud and an Intelligent Edge is resonating with businesses everywhere.
Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth as well as a strategic partner
who can help build their own digital capability. Microsoft is that trusted partner.
Now let's look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes
[PBP]. The workplace is transforming, from changing employee expectations, a need for more diverse skills and
globally distributed teams, and an increasingly complex threat environment. Only Microsoft gives customers a
comprehensive approach for this new culture of work. Earlier this month, we introduced Microsoft 365, which brings
together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility and Security in a complete secure solution to empower
employees, safeguard businesses, and simplify IT management.
Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design, build, and go to market to address customer needs. Fortune 500
customers FedEx, Dow Chemical, Staples, Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365. The success of our secure
productive enterprise offering with its triple-digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for
businesses of all sizes.
We continue to see strong growth of Office 365 with customers like Nissan, Quicken Loans, KeyBank, Deutsche
Telekom all choosing Office 365. And importantly, customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt
higher-value workloads. For example, we have seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage, which nearly doubled
year over year.
The classroom is also transforming. This quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education, the
digital hub for students and teachers. Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern
classroom environments. With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students, share

materials, manage assignments, Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love the most, teaching.
Now I'll talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing Business Processes. We're investing in
LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth. We saw continued
momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform, with sessions up more than 20% for the third
consecutive quarter.
And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform. We launched a new
messaging overlay, resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn, and introduced a career advice marketplace
that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world. On
top of that, Talent Solutions saw record level growth in confirmed hires and in mail response rates this quarter.
I've talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn. Earlier this month, we launched Microsoft
Relationship Sales Solution, bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as Dynamics
365 solutions for retail and talent. In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process, we
continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern modular business applications that are infused with AI.
We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process
applications and build new ones using Dynamics 365, Power BI, PowerApps, and Microsoft Flow. A global healthcare
solution provider and partner, Indegene, is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales. Customers like
HSBC, Best Buy, Dolce & Gabbana all chose Dynamics 365 to transform their own business processes and experience
the benefits of moving away from monolithic suites.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our Commercial Cloud annualized
revenue run rate now exceeds $18.9 billion. This quarter's cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we
set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in Commercial Cloud ARR in fiscal 2018. More than ever before,
customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft Cloud.
Azure revenue accelerated this quarter, growing 97% year over year. CIOs and business decision-makers increasingly
prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy. They value our hybrid consistency, developer
productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted approach.
And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity, as we have done with
our South Africa data center expansion, bringing Azure to 40 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider.
And as part of our commitment to trust, we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR [General Data Protection
Regulation] compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline.
AXA Global, KPMG, Dun & Bradstreet, Hearst, Walgreens, T-Mobile, and Sephora all chose Azure to transform their
businesses. Box announced that it will bring its content and collaboration service to Azure and plans to use our AI to
simplify discovery and use of all types of content across the enterprise. And Baidu will use Azure to take its
autonomous driving platform worldwide.
The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive
advantage. It all starts with having the support for the comprehensive data estate, spanning Azure Database, Cosmos
DB, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. Azure Cosmos DB is the industry's first globally
distributed database service. It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at
unprecedented scale and performance, from IoT to AI to mobile and much more. Retailer Jet.com is using Azure
Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day.
Customers are infusing AI into their products and services, using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as Bot
Framework and cognitive services. Sabre, a leading technology provider to the global travel industry, is piloting
AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers. And Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our
cognitive services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent seamless experience across online and
in their stores.

Azure is also unique in its support for these emerging Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge applications. Azure IoT
Edge extends cloud intelligence to edge devices. This means IoT devices can act locally at the edge while taking
advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale.
Azure is the first cloud to provide true hybrid support that customers predominantly choose. Azure Stack extends Azure
to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way, whether they're run on the Intelligent Cloud or at
the Intelligent Edge so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or
disconnected locations, like cruise ships or oil rigs.
Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Against a backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10
monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem, I want to highlight a couple of
key strategic areas this quarter. Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling
employees to transform the way they work. Increasingly, commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation
for a secure modern workplace. Enterprise and education deployments increased 33% over the last quarter, as
companies like NASCAR, Emirates Airlines, BMW Group, Bank of China all adopted Windows 10.
This quarter we introduced Windows 10 S, streamlined for simplicity, security, and superior performance and tailored
for the classroom. Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer, ASUS, Dell,
Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern devices that enables affordable powerful
scenarios from Windows Ink to 3D. We also introduced the Surface laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to
continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device categories.
Now on to gaming, our gaming business now is more than $9 billion and growing profitably. The gaming world is
evolving faster than ever before, from game player across multiple devices to the explosive growth in streaming and
e-sports to new subscription services and mixed reality scenarios. We're uniquely positioned to capture a large share of
this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live, now 53 million
strong and growing, and to enable new experiences across PC, console, and mobile. Our approach is to let gamers play
the games they want with the people they want on the device they want. At E3, we celebrated the passion of gamers by
introducing Xbox One X, broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world's most powerful console.
We launched two new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience, both of which are off to a
very strong start. Mixer, our new live streaming service, makes it easier than ever before for gamers to create and share
across platforms and to interact in entirely new ways. The Xbox Game Pass is a digital subscription service that
expands our existing gaming value proposition.
In closing, I'm proud of the progress this year, both in our own continued transformation and in how we're empowering
customers to digitally transform. As technology disrupts every industry and has the power to make a difference in the
lives of everyone, we strive to create local opportunity and growth and impact in every country around the world. Our
platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public sector efficiency.
We also support new startups, improve educational health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.
Our sense of purpose lies in our customers' success. Transformation is a continuous process of renewal and
reinvestment. We will continue to invest in the high-growth opportunities, lead innovation in cloud and AI, and bring
our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock new value for customers.
Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look
forward to rejoining for your questions.

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
This quarter, revenue was $24.7 billion, up 9% and 10% in constant currency, with stronger than expected performance
across all segments. Gross margin grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 13% and 16%

in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.98, increasing 42% and 43% in constant currency, which includes
$0.23 from the utilization of Phone-related losses from prior years that were previously non-deductible.
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth. LinkedIn's
operating loss of $361 million was a 6-point drag on total company operating income growth and is entirely attributable
to the $371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx.
From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends. The large markets like the
U.S., Germany, and Japan performed better than we expected. We had a strong quarter in our commercial business,
reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year.
We increased commitment to our Commercial Cloud and healthy renewals on a record volume of expirations. We
closed the highest number of multimillion-dollar Azure deals to date and improved our annuity mix to 86%, up 3 points
year over year. As a result, commercial bookings grew 30% and commercial unearned revenue was $27.8 billion,
significantly higher than we expected. Our contracted-not-billed [CNB] balance increased to more than $31.5 billion.
As Satya mentioned earlier, our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $18.9 billion this quarter,
growing 56%. We finished the year with nearly $15 billion in Commercial Cloud revenue.
At the start of the year, we committed to material improvement in Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage and
dollars. This quarter, our Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage was 52%, up 10 points year over year, with
positive gross margin in each cloud service. Commercial Cloud gross margin dollars grew 92% from strength across all
services. Our company gross margin was 66%, up 1 point from the prior year, as sales mix of higher-margin products
and services offset the impact of a growing mix of cloud revenue and $217 million of LinkedIn amortization cost.
FX was mostly in line with our expectations, with 1 point of negative impact on total revenue growth, even with the
slightly weaker than expected U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a negative impact of 2 points on Productivity
and Business Processes, 1 point on Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point on More Personal Computing. Total operating
expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154
million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.
Now to our segment results, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in
constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office Commercial revenue
increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 43% and 44% in constant currency,
with continued install base growth across all workloads, ARPU expansion, and emerging E5 momentum. For the first
time, Office 365 Commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business.
Office Consumer revenue increased 13%, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base.
Our Dynamics business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, and Dynamics 365 grew 74% and 75% in constant
currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than expected.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, with 12 points of contribution from LinkedIn,
including $217 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined from increasing cloud revenue mix and the
impact of LinkedIn related amortizations. Operating expenses increased 41%, with 40 points from LinkedIn, including
$154 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 8% and 5% in constant currency, with 12 points of
impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.4 billion of revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Our
server product and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity revenue
growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 97%, up 98% in constant currency. Azure premium revenue grew triple
digits for the 12th consecutive quarter.
Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by lower volume of Windows Server
2003 custom support agreements, partially offset by growth in premier support services.

Segment gross margin dollars grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined
due to increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in
Azure margins.
We grew operating expenses by 2% and 3% in constant currency, with continued investment in sales capacity and
developer engagement. Operating income increased 15%, up 18% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing, revenue from this segment was $8.8 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency,
with 4 points of decline from Phone. Our OEM business grew 1% this quarter, as both our commercial and consumer
OEM businesses were slightly ahead of the PC market. OEM Pro revenue grew 3%, ahead of the commercial PC
market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Windows 10 deployment cycles continue to drive commercial
customer hardware demand. OEM non-Pro revenue was flat, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive
impact from Windows Premium device mix. Inventories remain in their normal range.
Windows Commercial Cloud products and services grew 8%, driven by annuity revenue growth. Enterprise customers
increasingly chose Windows 10 on new and existing devices, which led to install base growth and higher adoption of
our cloud security solutions.
Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 10% and
11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume.
Devices revenue declined 28% and 27% in constant currency. Our Surface business performed better than we expected,
declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early
positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface laptop launch in June.
Our gaming business grew 3% and 4% in constant currency. Xbox software and services growth of 11%, 13% in
constant currency, offset declines in hardware. And our engaged user base grew 8% to 53 million monthly active users
across console, mobile, and Windows 10 platforms.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased,
primarily due to a sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 10% and 9% in
constant currency from lower Phone expense as well as Surface and gaming marketing spend in the prior year. As a
result, operating income grew 68% and 72% in constant currency.
Now back to the overall company results. This quarter we invested approximately $3.3 billion in capital expenditures,
including capital leases, up sequentially in part due to the planned Q3 data center spend pushed into this Q4. This
includes approximately $2.3 billion of cash paid for property and equipment, which was down year over year as we
utilize more capital leases.
Free cash flow grew 50% year over year, driven primarily by operating cash flow growth of 30% as well as lower cash
outlays for CapEx. Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings
growth, as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business. Other income and expense was $215
million, more than originally planned, as we continued to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains
throughout the quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6%, significantly lower than we expected, due to a $1.8 billion impact
related to the utilization of prior years' losses from our Phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred.
Excluding this item, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter and 20% for the full year.
This quarter, we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now, let's turn to the outlook. The key trends for FY 2018 from the financial analyst briefing remain largely
unchanged. For the full year, we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact, assuming current rates remain stable. In
our Commercial business, we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue
to drive a higher annuity mix. Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline, driven by the transition
to the cloud. We remain focused on improving our Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud

services. As a reminder, given seasonality and revenue mix, Commercial Cloud gross margin will experience quarterly
variability.
Cloud migrations, deployments, and new scenarios are driving greater customer usage. We will increase our capital
investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. Total CapEx spend will continue to have variability quarter to
quarter.
At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about 1 point in FY 2018, with increasing cloud
revenue mix, a full year of LinkedIn amortization, and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X.
We expect LinkedIn quarterly amortization expense in COGS to be approximately $220 million or about $880 million
for the full year.
Next, operating expenses. You should think about our FY 2018 operating expenses in two categories: first, organic
Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to
support our top line growth; second, LinkedIn. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its
continued strong revenue growth. Additionally, we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses, including
$620 million of amortization expense.
Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about 1 point, as we continue to grow our
cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn
amortization in COGS and OpEx. Excluding the LinkedIn impact, operating margin should be flat year over year.
Next, our effective tax rate. As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least three major factors: the proportion of
services revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vest. As cloud
revenue mix increases, we anticipate our tax rate will move higher. With quarterly variability based on these factors,
we anticipate our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23% plus or minus 2 points. And finally, we expect LinkedIn
ex-purchase accounting to be non-dilutive in FY 2018, as it was in Q4.
Now to the outlook for next quarter. Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on
revenue growth overall and for each segment. We expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of
$24.85 billion to $25.05 billion. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.1 billion and
$8.3 billion. Office 365 Commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by installed base growth, ARPU
expansion, and adoption of premium services like E5, and should outpace the rate of transactional decline.
We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office Consumer business given prior-year comparables. In our
Dynamics business, Dynamics 365 will continue to drive our cloud mix higher. And we expect approximately $1.1
billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion. Customer demand for Azure and our
hybrid cloud offerings remains strong. And we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server
products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements.
We expect More Personal Computing revenue, between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion. We anticipate OEM revenue will
move more closely in line with the PC market. Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior-year
Phone comparable. Surface revenue will continue to be driven by the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our
new Surface laptop and Surface Pro. In search, Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC should be similar to prior quarters. And
we expect gaming to have typical seasonality revenue pattern for a pre-holiday quarter.
We expect COGS between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion, including approximately $400 million from LinkedIn.
LinkedIn COGS include about $220 million of amortization.
We expect CapEx on an accrual dollar basis to be similar to Q4, as we grow our investment to meet demand. We
expect operating expenses of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, with about $1 billion of LinkedIn, of which roughly $155
million is related to amortization.

Other income and expense should be about $250 million, as we expect to realize more gains in our equities portfolio.
Given the volume of equity vest that occur in our first quarter and based on today's stock value, we expect our first
quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 4 points lower than the estimated full-year tax rate.
Finally, we adopted the new revenue standard, ASC 606, effective at the start of fiscal year 2018. To assist in the
transition, Chris along with our Chief Accounting Officer, Frank Brod, will be hosting a conference call in early

Operator
Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman
Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great, thank you very much for taking the question. Amy, I had a question about Commercial
Cloud COGS. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of these roughly is related to
depreciation. And how should we think about the pace of your CapEx deployments versus what you have been
experiencing in Commercial Cloud to support the initiatives and the vast growth opportunities that you see ahead as we
look out over the next 12 to 24 months, if there's anything you can share with us around that? Thank you.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Let me break down the question a couple ways. Overall, when you think about COGS and the
pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change. It's generally over a three-year period, and there are other
pieces of equipment that have longer or shorter depreciation lives, so that pace of depreciation doesn't change per se.
If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter, in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand
across all three services, but in particular with Azure. I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin
improvement across all those services. I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall
Commercial Cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we're getting. All of those things,
I think it's not really about the pace. It's as much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as
we can, and I feel really good about the team's execution.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great, thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Heather. We'll move to the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. There are a lot of rumors
and speculation around sales reorganization of you guys shifting around resources to better distribute to the cloud and
the new technology. I was wondering if you guys could dig into that for us a little bit. What kind of changes are taking
place in terms of go-to-market distribution heading into FY 2018?

<A - Satya Nadella>: Let me start there. And first of all, thank you for the question, Keith. Overall, the approach we
have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it's the product
creation, how we are organized in the RMB, how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we
may have had in the past, how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach, and then of course, even
with the go-to-market. And this transformation is ongoing. This has been happening over multiple years, but we have
now got very good customer momentum because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much
bigger than anything that we have participated in the past, so the total addressable market is much bigger. And second,
our customer expectations and our partner expectations of how we show up with them has changed.
And so over the years, we have been making changes. And now that we have a lot more momentum and critical mass,
we are going to that next phase, and that's what you're seeing us in terms of changing the skill sets, changing the scope
of how we show up to support the digital transformation needs of both large customers as well as small businesses.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: And I think in many ways, Keith, what we've done is really a natural extension of some of the
investments we've made over the past 18 months to add technical resources, to be more present in customer accounts,
to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes. You're seeing it even in our Intelligent Cloud results last
quarter and this quarter. We're taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale
across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they'll have a good long-term return in that
next phase of transformation.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Thank you, a question for Amy. Amy, there were a lot of numbers in this print that look
very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%. You did touch on it a little bit in
your remarks, but if you don't mind, I'd love to ask you a few questions.
One is, you mentioned that maybe part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals. Does it feel like maybe last
quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush; in other words, it might have been a bit of a one-time phenomenon?
Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract structure or invoicing too that would result in bookings
being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more up front? And lastly, is it fair to interpret the strong bookings
performance as giving us, and I suppose you, comfort in your revenue growth profile in fiscal 2018 as all those
bookings obviously convert to converted revs? Thank you.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Karl. I'll make sure I cover off on most of those. Let me start by saying the biggest
driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals. The second
component of that is the execution on new revenue. In particular, Azure as well as Windows Commercial, and billings
in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall. There was no change in any way to invoicing, people
paying earlier, paying more up front. That's definitely not an impact on that number.
And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance
the most, it's really, I think to your point, it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going
into FY 2018 to come into the GAAP reporting numbers.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Got it. Thank you, Amy.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Karl.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi, thank you. Amy, I'm wondering on the gross profit growth, I was looking at the slide
deck, and it looks like gross profit growth in PBP was up about 2%. You saw some strong trends in different parts of
that business, and I think that 2% I would have thought would have been higher. Could you help us understand the puts
and takes around gross profit growth in PBP?
<A - Amy E. Hood>: There are a couple things, but in general it's almost always mix shift. While we saw
improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that, it's also the balance.
This is the first quarter where we've actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus
perpetual. So I actually feel very good that as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you're not seeing,
frankly, much impact on the gross margin line, and we're seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way
down to the operating income line.
<A - Chris Suh>: Okay, thank you, Walter. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. Amy, Commercial Cloud ARR grew 24%
Q-over-Q, which is the largest Q-over-Q growth so far. I completely understand that Q4 is a big quarter for closing
business, but $3.7 billion is a large number. Can you give us some more color on exactly what's driving this growth?
And then I have a quick follow-up.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Sure. When you think about – you're right. It is a big number, and I feel very good about it. And
for the year on a pure basis, it was $15 billion of Commercial Cloud revenue. So we're starting to get to that point,
Mark, where you have a big base which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big
jumps in the one that you saw this quarter. And you're right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter, and this one
certainly was as well.
But you also saw – and what really does matter, especially in Azure, is usage growth, really consumption growth,
having customers use, deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think meters up and running, and that
continues to build on itself. And so when you start to see that, you can and I do think we'll continue to see good growth
in this number.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Excellent. As a quick follow-up, how should we think of how that sets us up for 2018 in
terms of hitting expectations, beating expectations, continuing strong 40% to 50% year-over-year growth?
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Let me start by saying first, I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in
Commercial Cloud ARR. Next, I think across every service, the momentum we've seen in Q4, and in particular I would
say I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows, E5, advanced threat protection services, those
types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings.
One of the things we often talk about is we sell Microsoft 365. That's Windows 10 with security and services. It's a
modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365. It includes EMS. We really did see strength across all of them,
so I don't really think it's about a percentage, but it's about each of them continuing to make progress.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Excellent and congrats.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Hey. Thanks, guys, and congrats on another great quarter. A question first for Amy on Office
365. Office 365 Commercial revenue continues to outpace the unit growth of monthly active users. So you're still
seeing that trend up to E3, E5, et cetera. I wonder if you could take us through where we are in that life cycle.
And also, just to follow on your comment to the last question, Satya, you launched at Inspire Microsoft 365 that Amy
just mentioned. How should we think about Microsoft 365 in the context of Office 365, also just given the fact that
Windows Commercial actually accelerated this quarter as well?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Maybe I can start, and then...
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Why don't you start, and I'll do the next one?
<A - Satya Nadella>: So one of the things that we're very excited about and have learned a lot from is the secure
productive enterprise offer that we have had now last year, and in fact in Q4 it really accelerated significantly. And so
that's helped us in fact come up with Microsoft 365 as this very strong offering that brings together Office 365,
Windows 10, as well as our Enterprise Mobility and Security, and support even cross-platform devices. So we think of
the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones with iOS and
Android. But they need both productivity, creativity, security across all of this estate of art there. And that's where I
think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition.
So that's what Microsoft 365 embodies. It's today available for enterprises, and in the fall you will have the midmarket
version of it, which I think is another very big opportunity because it really helps take what we have learned in the
large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute. And so we're excited about that, where at
Inspire the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: And, Phil, to your point, and it's a nice transition from Satya's point about especially the
midmarket offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365, is the install base growth. You're right. In terms of Office
Commercial 365, the primary driver is still install base, both the transition as well as new. I think we're optimistic as we
head into FY 2018 for the install base growth that's possible, in particular for some of these mid-market offerings that
we're quite proud of.
The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen in the past couple of quarters continues to primarily still be related still
to the E1 to E3 transition. When we mentioned E5, I think that's frankly encouraging for us because all of these
premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion. People start using E1, then they use E3, and then you
start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that. However, in terms of ARPU impact, very, very small in quarter.
So that's something that over time you would continue to see improvement in, in terms of impact on ARPU.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Phil.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Awesome, guys. Thanks a lot.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you. We'll take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hi, thank you very much. I'm curious if you can shed a little bit more light on commercial

and judging from the fact that the commercial business, non-Azure component of it was about steady and growth rate

[indiscernible] (46:28) Azure went through some significant acceleration, which has yet to be reflected in your
forward-looking revenue. So if you can just shed a little bit more light and drill into any two or three product SKUs or
areas or geographies that contributed to that off-the-charts performance, that will be great. That's it for me. Thank you
very much and congrats.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Kash. Let me go through the bookings. Again, with that 30%, the first and best
contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter. It was reasonably consistent, Kash. There's not
a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier, although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany,
they did have very good years, in particular in Q4.
Now, if you separate the fact that we had the large base, which clearly contributes to that bookings number being big,
aside from that, in particular Azure, in the last – to your point, did it really show up in that $18.9 billion? It didn't. The
strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide, and it was
significant, and a lot of that is the Azure billings. I think we felt very good. Those as well I think were pretty
broad-based across industry. I would also say across geo. And so while we of course get some strength from our largest
geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors, it was actually quite broad. There's not really one
place for me to say that we just saw it here.
And then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated, and where you'd see that, Kash, again
versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there, was that final piece around our security value prop. ATP,
Windows annuity growth was very good. That's in the KPI Windows Commercial products and services, is the place
you'll look and see that number. And outside of that, those really are the biggest contributors.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Thank you.
<A - Satya Nadella>: If I can add one thing, I'll just say that nothing shows up in just one quarter. We have been
working on this for a long time, whether it's the product and the approach we have taken, from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS,
even the diversity of our SaaS offerings. And also how we think about going to market, all of these have been multiple
years of hard work. And clearly there is momentum across the board. And that I think is what you're seeing, and we're
excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future. But the
key is for us to recognize that this is about long-term commitment to a big opportunity and making sure that you line up
your execution against that.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: And I think maybe I should have also mentioned – when you think about seeing that type of
performance – and Satya mentioned it's not just because of work done this quarter. It's a great point. But it's also the
investments we've made. We've committed. We did sales overlays. We added technical resources. We put resources at
customers ahead of the curve. We did that. You saw that in the Intelligent Cloud OpEx growth over the past few
quarters. That execution is what's landing.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Clearly something inflected, and it looks like you're gaining share, so congratulations. Thank
you.

<Q - Mark R. Murphy>: Yes, thank you very much, and I will add my congrats. Amy, going back to the large size of
the expiry base in Q4, when we look back three years to June 2014, in that quarter the commercial bookings grew 23%.
I'm just curious. Is that representative of the portfolio that flowed through into this quarter on a three-year cycle, or is it
more complex than that?

And just finally, I'm wondering. Again, looking back three years, it was a different number in the September quarter
that followed. And can you help us just with the year-over-year growth of the expiry base for the September quarter?
I'm not sure if you had commented on that.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Okay, you're right. Mark, it's not exactly – if I said is the Q3 from three years ago exactly the
expiry base, it's not exactly, but it is directionally. And so that's a good example to say every three years tends to be the
length of our agreements, and so you do tend to see that repeated. And so that's what we mean by the record or the
largest expiry base, and that is the pattern.
In terms of LinkedIn having any impact, it did not. So that is the cleanest way to think about that number.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Mark. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks very much and my congratulations as well. I'm actually going to ask a question about
the traditional server products business, which once again had a pretty strong growth rate, up 5%. I think the last few
quarters you've been trending at mid-single digits or even higher. And, Amy, I'd just love your thoughts as we progress
through fiscal 2018, just so we think about this in the right way. How would you expect that growth rate to trend, and
should we be aware of the comps that come up in Q2 and beyond?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Maybe I can start and at least give you how we think about it technically and product-wise, and
then we can go into talking about the future in terms of the results itself.
First of all, we don't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud. In other words, the Intelligent Cloud and the
Intelligent Edge is the architecture or pattern for which we are building. Whether it's SQL Server 2017 or with
Windows Server, the container service, everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain
distributed. And it turns out that it's helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their
portfolios of apps as they lift, shift, modernize as to what they run in their data centers or in our data centers, but also
forward-looking new workloads.
If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud, is cloud applications that reactively
require an edge. Azure IoT or Azure Stack are becoming the runtime to the edge, where you do need not only the
ability to do compute and storage, but to run the AI inference on the edge. So to me, that's what we are building to. It's
actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely of this as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of
this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications that I quite frankly feel very, very good about
leading.
And so in that context, our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and
mix shifts. But from a forward-looking perspective, I want us to be very clear that we anticipate the edge to be actually
one of the more exciting parts of what's happening with our infrastructure.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: And so that leads – why I always tend to say I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know
both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that's why I tend to focus on that all-up server KPI
combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge, which is the on-prem. And so I think we remain
confident in that double-digit target that we have for that KPI. And there isn't really, I don't think, a comparability
challenge per se, but that's why we try to keep it at that high level, to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know
the TAM expansion that's possible. We know we can grow within it.
And I apologize, I didn't answer Mark's last component, so let me just go back. I had forgotten, which was, was there
anything unique in the expiry base for Q1. The answer is it's up a little year over year and certainly not the same type of
Q4 comparable. When we tend to have these, we try to call them out, like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So Q1 I would
say is just up a little, so I wouldn't expect any material impact.

Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill in on the premium service in Azure.
Satya, you talked a little bit about SharePoint taking off and being a big part. Can you talk a little bit about the portfolio
you have there? And I also wanted to contrast it a little bit with one of your main competitors who keeps coming out
with products just to get to that premium service and the advantage that you guys have given the IP that you've built up
over the years. Thank you.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Yes, I think we have premium services, whether it's in Office 365 or on the Fast side with
Dynamics 365. And that's where the SharePoint comment came that there's a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle
beyond Exchange or email.
On the Azure side, my comments in fact walk that entire tree, so to speak, which is there's the infrastructure there,
where in fact, even on the infrastructure side, there is no such thing as one generic infrastructure when I look at the
diversity of the virtual machines, what's happening with AI infrastructure with GPU compute, so there's a lot of
richness there. The layer above that for me is the data estate. One of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the
growth in Cosmos DB, our Data Warehouse product, the Data Lake, so that's a place where we are seeing significant
attach. On top of the data is where the AI service is, whether it's the Box framework, the cognitive services. So that's all
the rich services where we are seeing significant customer action.
The other side of it is the edge. So Azure IoT smart service both in the cloud and the edge. And Azure Stack now, truly
starting this quarter, is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud
deployment. So that's what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have.
And then one linchpin that we have between in fact our Fast services as well as Azure is Azure Active Directory. 90%
of all the enterprises use Active Directory, and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what
applications they have in whichever cloud because that becomes a very key control plane for IT.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect, thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Raimo. We'll have time for one more question, Rhea, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Brad Reback>: Great, thanks very much. Amy, as the Azure business continues to gain scale and, to Raimo's
question, the premium mix continues to become a bigger part of that, is there any reason to think that the gross margin
gains shouldn't accelerate in 2018 versus where they were in 2017? Thanks.
<A - Amy E. Hood>: Thanks, Brad. The way I tend to think about is with any service, you want the gross margin itself
to improve. And that includes in the Azure services components themselves. The difference between core compute and
store versus the premium layers can be significant, and we've had improvement across all of them. So the real question
on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about the ultimate mix of those. We saw significant
improvement this year. We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. And where the
actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we'll just have to wait and see, and that's why I tend to not focus at that
layer. It's like can you get every service better or can you make material improvement. And then, of course, can you get
usage and consumption going, that leads to premium service usage. And of course, over time, you'd expect a higher
mix of premium versus core.
