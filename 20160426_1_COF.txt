Stephen S. Crawford
Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1 billion, or $1.84 per share in the first quarter.
Pre-provision earnings increased 10% in the fourth quarter to $3 billion as we had higher revenues and lower marketing
and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased linked quarter driven by higher charge-offs and a $286
million allowance build, including $73 million of allowance build in our oil and gas portfolio.
As you can see on slide four, reported NIM decreased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 6.75% driven by one
less day to recognize income and a full quarter of lower yielding GE commercial assets, partially offset by higher
interest rates. NIM increased 18 basis points year-over-year, fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business.
Turning to slide five, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 11.1%, which
reflects current phase-ins. On a Standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.9%.
We reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the quarter as we completed our previously-announced
incremental $300 million in repurchases in the first quarter. We are on track to complete our remaining CCAR
authorization by the end of the second quarter of 2016. As we continue our parallel run for Basel III Advanced
Approaches, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was above our target of 8%.
Let me now turn the call over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with our Domestic Card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%. We continue to like
the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we're booking.
First quarter revenue increased 12% from prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin
declined modestly. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. As a reminder, Payment Protection revenue contributed
about 25 basis points to full year 2015 revenue margin. Because we completed the exit of our back book of Payment
Protection products at the end of the first quarter, we expect this contribution to go to zero in the second quarter
revenue margin.
Purchase volume in the first quarter increased about 20% from the prior year. Net interchange revenue for the total
company also increased 20%. Although the two growth rates were the same this quarter, we've consistently emphasized
the need to look at longer term trends to understand net interchange growth without the quarterly volatility.
For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase
volume growth. We'd expect this divergence to continue as we continue to expand and strengthen our Rewards
franchise by originating new Rewards customers and extending Rewards to existing customers. Also, a few of the
largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks that will make their way into interchange
revenue over time.

First quarter non-interest expenses increased compared to the prior year quarter with higher marketing and growth
related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. As we've discussed for several quarters, two
factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on
delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The
second is seasonality. All else equal, the first quarter is the seasonal peak for charge-off rate.
Our guidance for Domestic Card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from growth math
will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be
around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer
behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rates in the
low-4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates drove
an allowance build in the quarter. We expect allowance additions going forward primarily driven by growth.
Slide eight summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were down a little less
than $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending
deposits were up about $5.3 billion versus the prior year. Auto originations in the first quarter were $5.8 billion, about
13% higher compared to the first quarter of last year.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, originations shrank, particularly in sub-prime. This quarter, originations growth was
stronger, including in sub-prime. We had good success with our originations programs, and it appears that competitive
intensity may have softened a bit in the quarter, but we wouldn't take much from any one quarter of results. We still
feel the same way about this business as we have for several quarters. We remain very vigilant about competitor
practices. In our underwriting, we assume used car prices decline further. We continue to focus on resilient originations
and we continue to expect gradual normalization of margins and credit.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased modestly from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from
growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage
balances. First quarter revenues were also aided by a Rewards liability release associated with discontinuing certain
checking products. Non-interest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans
and an increase in retail deposit marketing.
First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, mostly as a result of growth in auto loans and a
modestly higher auto charge-off rate. We also added to the Consumer Banking allowance for loan losses in the quarter.
As we previously discussed, we expect auto charge-offs to increase gradually, and in the first quarter, we observed a
decline in used vehicle values. These two factors drove the allowance addition.
In our retail deposit businesses, customer needs and preferences are changing, driving changes to the function, format,
and number of our branches. Like all banks, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better
meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital.
In 2015, branch optimization costs were about $50 million. We're planning to accelerate these efforts and we expect
branch optimization costs to be elevated in 2016. We're still formulating specific plans and timing, but based on what
we see today, we expect to recognize branch optimization expenses of about $160 million in 2016. In the first quarter,
actual charges were $11 million. These costs show up in the other category rather than the Consumer Bank P&L.
We expect several factors to put pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results in 2016. In the home loans
business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In auto finance, margins are compressing and charge-offs are rising
modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect these factors
will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016, even as we continue to
tightly manage costs.
Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances in the quarter increased 27%
year-over-year and average loans increased 24%, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business.
Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 10% year-over-year. While competition

is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select
specialty industry verticals.
Revenue in the first quarter increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth was below average
loan growth because of continuing spread compression. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and
Taxi Medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $168 million from the prior year quarter to $228 million
as we continued to build reserves. We've been building reserves over the last six quarters in anticipation of increasing
risk in oil and gas and Taxi Medallion loans. Downgrades of oil and gas loans drove first quarter increases in criticized
and non-performing loans. The Commercial Bank criticized loan rate was 5.6% in the first quarter, comprised of the
criticized performing loan rate of 4% and the criticized non-performing loan rate of 1.6%.
We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on slide 10,
our total oil and gas loans ended the first quarter at $3.2 billion, or about 1.5% of total company loans, as some
exploration and production customers drew on their lines in the quarter.
Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion. Total exposure, including both loans and unfunded exposure, declined to
$5.9 billion. We expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to
reflect that concern. At quarter-end, approximately $262 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was
specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8% of total oil and gas loans.
Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we hold $359 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas
portfolio. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today, as the turmoil in the energy
industry continues, future developments could lead to further reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on the first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another strong
quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, driving strong year-over-year growth in
revenue as well as related increases in operating expense, marketing, and allowance for loan losses.
Non-interest expense decreased 6% from the linked quarter, driven by seasonal declines in marketing and operating
expense. First quarter non-interest expense does not represent a run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several
reasons. The first quarter is typically a low point for non-interest expense. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect
about $100 million in elevated branch optimization costs to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect the net impact
of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expense beginning in the
third quarter of 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter. We added to the allowance for loan losses primarily because of
Domestic Card loan growth and the expectation of higher Domestic Card charge-off rates because of growth math. We
expect these factors to drive further allowance builds in 2016.
We also build Commercial Banking reserves in the quarter to reflect increasing risk in energy loans. Our efficiency
ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency
ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items.
To be clear, there were no adjusting items in the first quarter. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite the
additional pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and a deterioration in market
expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time and we
continue to tightly manage costs across our businesses.
Pulling off, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and
sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.
Now, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Thanks.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Rich, I heard you say don't look just at each quarter in terms of the growth rate of
interchange income, but you had a couple of quarters where it's kind of matched or been close to matching the level of
the growth rate in spending volumes. Can you just talk a little bit about what will cause it? I mean if you're saying that
it will diverge and go lower, like, what is the cause in the future. And have you got specific plans for growth and can
maybe just relate that to how you see the competitive environment for Rewards right now?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay, Moshe. So the most important point is to just reflect on the volatility of this
number. And particularly, as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where – the number meaning the net
interchange growth number – where it is as high as it is, we go out of our way to remind folks that there's a lot that goes
into this particular calculation, and these contribute to its volatility. So let me start, Mosche, with just the volatility side
of this thing.
The net interest interchange metric includes partnership, contractual payments and International Card and Consumer
Bank net interchange. And also we update our Rewards liability every quarter based on points earned and redeemed
and the redemption mix and redemption rates. And so, any one quarter, we probably spend more calories explaining
that volatility than we do just reporting it just to make sure that folks focus on the longer term trends.
If you look at the full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume
growth of 21%.So, if we get past the quarterly noise part of the conversation, let's talk about why net interchange
growth has generally lagged Domestic Card purchase volume growth and why we also expect that to continue.
Our Rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with, yes, of course, strong growth in flagship
products like Quicksilver and Venture and our Spark card. But we're also building a long term franchise very
consciously and consistently by upgrading Rewards products for our existing Rewards customers and extending
Rewards products to some existing customers who don't have Rewards. And as you can imagine, this entails some near
term cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger deeper customer franchise.
And those trends, I mean we're well on our way with respect to those trends, but they will continue. And also, this is
something that will be a newer effect in the numbers that's not in our prior numbers. A few of the larger merchants have
negotiated custom interchange deals with the networks, and those economics negotiations that have now happened will
make their way into the interchange metrics for card players.
So, and you asked a question about Rewards competition. This is a very competitive space. I think the competition has
intensified a bit over the past years, over the past year, really. Issuers are continuing to introduce new offers; upfront
bonuses have been gradually increasing over time. I still look at the players. It's generally rational, intensely
competitive, and our strategy is designed to go right into a marketplace like that.
So while – we'll keep an eye obviously on interchange risk, I mean, that's a different orthogonal factor, but I think that
we still feel pretty optimistic about that variable overall in the marketplace. And, all in all, as we post another quarter of
pretty strong performance, it's really more of the same story that we've seen in the past, and despite intense competitive
pressure, we still see a window of opportunity to grow. And beyond sort of the notion of window here, I think it's just

part of a sustained strategy of Capital One to invest in going at the top end of the marketplace. And I think we're very
pleased with our success.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Thanks very much.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Thank you for taking my questions. Really they're sort of related. Rich, you've been very
clear about your decision to be a little bit more cautious in auto. Over the last several quarters, or actually going back
probably four quarters or five quarters, you've been pretty bullish on the opportunity in the card space. Do you see that
opportunity still being there? And in light of the growth that you're experiencing now, I understand the growth math
impacting losses into 2016. Why are you so confident that they're going to start to flatten out into 2017 as you continue
to grow?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. So, Rick, several questions there. First of all, you mentioned auto and card. So let
me do a little cross calibration relative to those two. We see growth opportunities in both businesses. In fact, you saw in
auto actually growth stepped up a little bit. Although we went out of our way to say, don't get carried away with that. I
think our message is really the same as before. Frankly, in both business, our message is really the same as we had last
quarter.
On a cross calibration, I think the auto business is a little bit farther along in the sort of the natural evolution of a
market and the competitive dynamics associated with that. And I think we see less growth opportunity there, even
though at the margin, we're both vigilant and very much working to capture the opportunities that are consistent with
our underwriting.
On the card side, I think that the marketplace is, despite very competitive, is still – I still say it's very rational. The
competitors have staked out different positions in the marketplace with different strategies, and several are succeeding
all at the same time. Where we are finding growth is in opportunities that are the result of investment for years and
strategic focus and testing and a lot of things that give rise to a more sustainable growth opportunity.
Again, I still would flag nothing lasts forever and we'll take this one quarter at a time, but we feel the same way about
the card business as we do a quarter – did a quarter ago. I think there is still lags on the growth opportunity here. And
again, it will all be done with an abundance of caution and knowing that windows always open and close, but I think
we still are quite bullish about this opportunity.
Now, then you said, so, what about growth math? The growth math – because we have – the key thing about growth
math that is so, you know, that's so central to our explanation about credit at the moment is not just that we're doing a
lot of growth right now. And as you know, Rick, growth entails sort of peak losses on a vintage in the first couple years
before things settle out. So you have that component. But the fact that it is on top of a almost – we've never quite seen
before the extent of such a seasoned, resilient back book that is a juxtaposition of high growth on top of a highly
seasoned back book, creates particularly more dramatic growth math effects.
All of that said, it's also the case that if you – overlaying a bunch of vintages that have the same credit growth
dynamics, there's just a natural seasoning effect that occurs. Frankly, whether growth continues or whether growth
slows down, that becomes a pretty strong effect in causing the credit effects of growth math to settle out in the latter
part of the time horizon that we have provided guidance for.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. One was just on, Richard, you mentioned
the custom deals that the larger networks have struck with some of the larger merchants. I just wanted to get a sense
from you as to the pace of impact on your fee rate that you're anticipating from this. Is this something that is a few basis
points over a year's time, or is this tens of basis points over a couple of quarters? Maybe give us a sense of magnitude
and timing? And then whether or not you feel that as this plays out to other merchants that this is just something we
should put in our models for the next year or two years.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, I think there's really kind of a couple of one-off things that have happened that have
been negotiated, and those will become enduring effects relative to those merchants. So those effects will make their
way over the course of the next number of quarters into a change in the run rate of interchange from those couple of
merchants. And I don't think this is just like a sea change in how the industry works, but we just wanted to flag that
these I think well-known things that have gone on in the marketplace have a natural impact as they flow into any of the
major card players.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: [ph] And how is the industry (29:37) changing your go to market strategy with
Rewards, as you indicated with – that this just kind of noise in the background as opposed to, we have to change how
we're thinking about Rewards with the custom deals happening?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: The reality is the merchant marketplace, even though it's a lot more consolidated than it
was years ago, is still – when you really stand back and look at it, a strikingly fragmented marketplace, and this does
not have any impact on our overall strategy.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. Rich, you talked about possibly more provisions in the oil and gas portfolio.
Could you just talk about the sensitivity going forward?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So I think that – look, I don't think we want to be in the sensitivity business. I think we
did a scenario last time that went through sort of the mathematical impact of a – one unique set of assumptions about
prices. And all that happened is our own provision was different – both the external scenario was different and our own
allowance build reserve and everything else ended up being unique.
So I think what I would say is this. It may be useful just to pull back and just talk about the provision in the quarter for
a minute, and then I come back and comment on your question. But if we look at our – we had – $157 million of the
$228 million commercial provision expense was related to energy. And $18 million was due to charge-offs, mainly in
the oil field services segment. We built reserves by $139 million. And of that, our unfunded build was $54 million, as
we used higher utilization assumptions for some borrowers given the somewhat defensive behavior that we saw during
the quarter. And then lower oil and gas prices, runoff in hedges and declining collateral values also impacted our
borrowers and contributed to the reserve build. And then there were some odds and ends to round out the build in
provision.
So I think that what we have done in terms of allowance and unfunded reserve build reflects what we see with our
customers and in the marketplace at this time. But I think it is also the nature of markets that sometimes feed on each
other that I think that this still needs to – the deleveraging of the oil and gas industry still needs to happen. I think we've
reserved for that which we see. And I think it's our expectation that it will take a while and have continuing credit
impacts as this thing fully plays out.

<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Okay, great. And just a follow up: just that revenue margin, disclosures going forward in
terms of protection products, how much of the 25 basis points was in the first quarter that's going to go to zero in the
second quarter? And then when I look at the U.S. card – or, sorry, the Domestic Card revenue margin, that came down
quite significantly year-over-year. Could you just maybe speak to the trajectory going forward maybe? Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. So the – first of all, to your cross sell question, yeah, so we, as we mentioned, we
fully exited cross sell at the end of the first quarter and will have no cross sell revenue in the second quarter. But, yeah,
some of that effect happened in the first quarter. The first quarter was – I don't have the exact number in front of me,
but something in the neighborhood of half of the...
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: It was around 10 basis points.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: It was around 10 basis points, it being the amount of revenue that we got, and that was
around 10 basis points. So that would be your answer on that.
The Domestic Card revenue margin, it's interesting how stable that has been over the years. That has been – there have
been a lot of factors that have worked in opposite directions on that margin. There has certainly been a macro effect
that has – that we have been flagging over time in terms of things that we call franchise enhancements, where we
continue to make choices in the customer's favor that have a bit of impact on revenue. The most dramatic of these in
recent years has been this cross-sell effect, and it is now fully playing out.
I think the biggest impacts on revenue margin going forward will not be so much the further franchise enhancement,
although here and there those always go on. I think it's whatever happens in the competitive marketplace, which is very
intense, and we will continue to monitor that. But I think we're going to stay out of the forecasting business with
respect to revenue margin.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.

We'll go next to David Ho with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David Ho>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to talk about some of the asset sensitivity. And what's
been coming down the last three quarters or four quarters, I know that the outlook on rates obviously continues to
evolve, but certainly, a little lower here versus your expectations. Can you talk about just your balance sheet strategy
and how you think about positioning this year?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah, so, it's not our policy to try and end up with a large asset sensitive position. That's
kind of naturally what we end up with as a result of the balance sheet that we have. So we find ourselves in an asset
sensitive position, but I think we probably if we could do it in an efficient way, work to not have as much sensitivity. I
should mention we do have some work underway that suggests deposit pricing may not lag as much as we originally
estimated. There's no final decisions that's been made on that point. And we probably won't have a more fully formed
analysis of that until the second quarter in terms of how it might change our disclosed impacts. But we're taking all of
the actions that we can that are accounting friendly to manage the interest rate risk. And really what we're trying to do
is balance kind of near term net interest income sensitivity with longer term changes in economic value.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

extremely low across the industry? What is it that you're seeing that leads you to the conclusion that it might not be as
low?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: I think we're all struggling with, and as you look across the industry at management
comments, with the extraordinary change in the actual balance sheets of the different depositories, and then the
extraordinary influence of Central Banks in the marketplace, and a real uncertainty as to how regulation impacts
deposit flows going forward and the nature of competition, we're not at a period where history provides much comfort
to try and figure out where we're headed. So I think it's just not surprising that we will continue to look at our
assumptions on interest rate sensitivity and risk management and frankly try and be creative about how this
environment, which is so different and unprecedented, how that's going to unfold and what that should mean for how
we manage interest rate risk.
Now, if in fact things do change and our models suggest we are less asset sensitive, I think that will be a good thing.
And we'll have avoided, for instance, putting on more hedges than we would have otherwise done. So – but I think this
is something that everybody in the industry expresses a lot of uncertainty about and is continuing to look at what the
implications of that are for rate risk and rate risk management.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: So if you look – that means we're up almost 10%, expenses are up 6%. I take the fact that there
are some head winds over the next couple of quarters from the branch optimization from the FDIC. But if we continue
to see loan growth at the very strong levels, can you help us understand just the magnitude of efficiency improvement?
Do you think you can continue to draw similar like levels to what we've seen year-over-year? Would you expect to see
somewhat of a deceleration? And what is the future benefit of the branch optimization that you're doing this year?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. So, we really spent a lot of time on the guidance that we gave last quarter. And
Rich talked about some of the challenges that have emerged over the last three months to that guidance, which we're
absorbing and keeping where it is. And I think with all the puts and takes, that's about as far as we're prepared to go.
Obviously, the branch optimization in and of itself on a narrow basis creates savings, but we're also investing in that
business in other places, and really what we want to do is talk about this on a consolidated level.
Rich, I don't know whether you have anything to add?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: No, I'm good.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Okay.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you had any
additional color you could provide on the strong purchase volume growth in the U.S. card business? 20% is very
strong. And it seems like most of your competitors are trying to piggyback on your Quicksilver and other successes in
the cash-back space. Any thoughts on the competitive environment related to that 20% growth? Can you sustain that
level? And I'd also like you to try to address the private label business? Is that contributing to that strong growth or is
that actually dragging on that? Because it seems to me you haven't really invested or done a whole lot with the private
label since you bought that HSBC business. Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. Chris, the purchase volume continues to be strong. Let's talk about where we're
seeing it. We're seeing it across various segments in our business that are growing nicely. And obviously the Spender
and Rewards business, it's growing in our revolver business where we focus on revolvers other than high balance
revolvers. We see it in small business. But the growth results from success of our Rewards programs. It results from
new account origination, but also credit line increases. And there is an element of this as you're familiar with the fact

that we, over the last couple of years, increased credit lines quite significantly making up for kind of a brownout that
preceded that period of time. Now, we're in equilibrium with respect to credit line increases. But as people utilize extra
line, as you have new originations, just the utilization of the card, all of these things help grow purchase volume.
So, the purchase volume numbers are the result of direct success in spend-oriented programs as well as its a byproduct
of all the growth that's going on at Capital One. Can we sustain this? Well, I think that we're in a good competitive
position. But obviously a lot of other competitors are investing heavily and have a lot of very successful things that
they're doing. So we'll continue to take this opportunity as far as it will take us, but we're cognizant of the intense
competition there.
Private label with respect to growth rate is in a different place because that's a relatively modest growth rate because we
have not been adding a lot of big partnerships. Some of our existing partnerships are having nice growth. But that
business is in it, in an intense competitive period around auction prices. And we've gone through a bunch of options.
We've tended to come up empty handed lately because we've not been willing to go to some of the extreme levels that
we have seen where the market clearing price goes. All that said, we like the partnership business and I think it has
continued opportunity. But in that business, that is so auction driven, I think we have to be very respectful about the
nature of the auction pricing cycle within that business and make sure that we don't do unnatural things for the sake of
growth.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Citi.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes. Rich, if you look around the at major card issuers, it looks like consumer credit's very
strong. But if you look on the edges, for example, the marketplace lenders, they're starting to have problems. And I was
just curious if you thought that could be a canary in the coal mine, or if you think that's just more of a reflection of
aggressive growth and maybe not having good credit underwriting in their DNA?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: First of all, I'm going to start with your opening point. Consumer credit and especially
card credit have been exceptionally strong for some years now. And for Capital One, if you peel away the effects of
growth math, that's still very much the case. And when we look at our back book, for example, credit is strikingly
stable with some pockets of even continuing improvement.
And this very strong credit environment has been the result of – for ourselves and the industry, highly, highly seasoned
back book, which made up largely of customers who weathered the Great Recession, a more disciplined consumer who
is less likely to be overstretched or over-indebted, and an economy that has, slow though it has been, has been sort of
on a long sustained kind of recovery here.
But from where we sit today, my biggest worry and it kind of gets to your question is the potential impact of growing
competition and actually the growth itself that we see of credit around us. We've seen a growth of revolving debt creep
up to about 6% recently. That's pretty high relative to the low and sometimes negative levels since the recession. And
both consumers and creditors have been very cautious.
Beyond card growth, we've seen growth in other non-mortgage debt. We've seen it in student lending, auto lending and
installment lending. And we're watching that closely as well. And installment lending, which I think the banks have
gradually returned to, has been the primary asset class for the alternative lenders. And you may remember, we had an
installment lending book that into the Great Recession was probably our worst performing portfolio. So we – my point
is partly an installment lending point, but the broader point is all of this – the math of the amount of growth that we see
in the credit marketplace is not lost on us. Now it is in the context of – particularly on the card side, growth being
flattish for a long period of time. So we're not overly alarmed by just a surge of growth, but we'll certainly have to keep
an eye on this.

And we know that in the end, growth – the things that we see in the marketplace with respect to growth not only affect
our growth opportunity, they can affect credit, with the selection quality of new originations, and can impact existing
customers who take on more debt from other players. So, all of that is stuff that we look at. At this point, Don, we have
not seen these effects in our performance. We have reaffirmed our guidance. But it's just a reminder why we focus so
much on resilience. We don't set growth targets in the company. We focus on capturing highly resilient opportunities
when we have them. And in the end, know always that we're in the risk management business. But right now, net-net,
we still feel very good about our opportunity here, and we feel very good about the credit outlook.

And we'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Matthew Bruce>: Thanks. Good evening. I would like to piggyback off of the questions around credit.
I guess you've talked about the general performance, but can you address the sub-prime portfolio – sub-prime credit
card portfolio that's obviously grown a whole lot? And I'm just interested if it's performing in line with your original
expectations. And if you could dimensionalize how you expect the [ph] economic set (50:02) of that portfolio to
perform over the next year, year-and-a-half? Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Ken, it is performing consistent with our expectations. And we have been in that
business for a long period of time. And what we see is consistent with what we've learned over the years about that
business. And we like – it's profitable business. We like its resilience, and we're continuing to grow in that as one of
many segments that we're growing in at the moment.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Maybe just a follow up on that last point. Could you give us a sense of –
in the new accounts that are being booked, how they compare from a FICO stratification standpoint or some other kind
of underwriting metric to the historical growth?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. Look, we're growing in segments in which we have a lot of history and a strong
track record, even through the Great Recession. In our branded card business, it's probably not an exaggeration to say
when we look at the major places we're investing, we're growing in all of them with the exception of one – we're
growing in all of those, and there's one place we're not growing, we're actively working to continue to dial that down
and to shrink it, and that's the high balance revolvers. The combination of these factors has driven our portfolio mix of
660 and below assets a little higher over the past year. Generally, though, our portfolio mix has been about one third
plus or minus. I think recently it's been a little bit more on the plus side.

We'll go next to Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson.

some of that business that you've built organically. And are you pursuing that strategy – is there an opportunity to grow
that or acquire other businesses related?

<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, we – we're not – we certainly are in that business. We're not a big player in brokerage
and wealth management space. I think that it is not – well, it's an area on an organic basis we continue to work to
pursue growth opportunities. We're kind of a small player. I don't think the big wirehouses are shaking in their boots
about Capital One, but especially for our existing customers, we've got some really nice, very refreshing high value
products for our customers. But it's still off of a very small base at this point.

We'll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, I wanted to follow up on a couple
of earlier questions in terms of – you've mentioned for several quarters the opportunity particularly for growth,
particularly in cards. I'm curious what you see as a potential yellow flag or warning signal that might signal to you that
maybe that growth opportunity is coming to an end. Is it economic factors, or is it some of the competitive factors that
you mentioned earlier?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So I think – look, the economy is always a wild card there, but I don't think that that is
where that – as our growth, I think is going to be more driven unless there's a dramatic kind of change in the economy.
I think it's going to be much more driven by the competitive environment and the related impacts of that competitive
environment on the credit environment. And we just learned long ago one of the things that makes this business what it
is in terms of the opportunity to make money and get growth opportunities, but on the same time, is always something
that we have to remind ourselves is the relationship between competitive practices that's both how intensive the
marketing is, the underwriting practices, the pricing and those things, how much they impact not only growth, but
ultimately make their way into the credit side of the business as well. And this is one business where our own
customers, in a lot of credit businesses, customers have a lending product from one bank. In this case, people can have
credit cards with a lot of players. And of course, they hold lending products from others as well.
So, as I have said, and I still actually would describe the credit card marketplace this way, on a cross calibration with
the rest of the industries that we are in, I think this is the most rational of the marketplaces. But certainly, the thing that
we are watching the most is the level of supply out there. And I think the underwriting competition has been very
rational, which is a good thing. But we will continue to watch that competition and then look for impacts that can come
with that that would signal to us that it would be appropriate to slow down or whatever. But again, you always know
us. We're always in the go out and look out and obsess at things to worry about. But I think that we continue to like the
opportunity in the card space.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Our final question today comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I was just curious to follow up
on the last question, as we look at the disclosures in your 10-Q, we see that your sub-prime credit card balances have
been growing in the high-teens or even 20% in the fourth quarter. In terms of the competitive landscape there, are you
really facing much competition or do you have a lot of running room compared to what other issuers are doing?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, one of the things that has been striking to us is the amount of – there's a lot of
consumer credit is in that space. There's – a number of major competitors are actually growing in that space. And also,
what impacts that business a lot is the what spills downstream from the prime business as consumers migrate. And so
when you, and you can look at the overall disclosures on how much the various banks have of 660 and below. And you

can see that there's a pretty sizable amount of business that each of the players have. I think they have different
strategies with respect to them.
Capital One's case, we explicitly actually target certain pockets within that business. Other players, it's more of a
byproduct of more generalized marketing that they do. And some of the retail bank players, I think they go into this
space with their own customers that they know well. So I think that it's more competitive space than I think sometimes
urban legend would have it. But Capital One, I think just has a more unique approach to the business.
And one of the striking things I'll mention again about the card business is the major card players have staked out
unique strategies for how they play in this business. And relative to most businesses that we're in, I'm struck by the
differences in those strategies. And frankly look around and see a lot of successful players doing smart things given
where they are and the bone structure of assets that they have. And it leads to the simultaneous success, I think, of a
number of players.
