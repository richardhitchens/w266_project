So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul S. Otellini
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. As you know, I have a month left in my career at Intel, and this will be my last
conference call with you. I've been doing these calls since 1993 and have done approximately 80 calls with you. I
wanted to take a departure from my traditional remarks during this my final earnings call. During the next few minutes
I'd like to share some perspective on the company and on our industry, drawing from my career and my experience as
Intel's fifth CEO.
I came to Intel nearly 40 years ago, eager to join a team of extraordinarily smart, creative and driven engineers and a
legendary team of founders, some of the greatest minds in technology.
In 1974, Intel was still a startup, with revenues of $134 million and a culture built on relentless innovation and designed
to thrive on change. A revolution in computing had just begun. But it would take us another decade before we realized
how dramatically it would change our business and the world.
Amidst all that change and reinvention there has, however, been a constant. From the early days of DRAM to the era of
the first microprocessor, from one architectural battle to the next, and across generations of form factors and operating
systems, Intel has grown and thrived. Naturally, constant change and reinvention creates plenty of room for both
opportunity and skepticism. As the industry and the company evolved, risk and uncertainty were common but the
company's inventiveness, architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise, and intense drive allowed it to create and
capitalize on opportunity over the long haul.
In May of 2005 I became CEO and over the past eight years we've executed a broad strategy to reposition the company
to participate in all segments of computing by capitalizing on all of our considerable strengths. We implemented the
tick-tock model, which set the pace of innovation and has become an industry benchmark of execution. We developed
the Atom microarchitecture to address low power and low cost market segments.
Through the acquisitions of Infineon Wireless Solutions and McAfee, we've invested in strategic capabilities like
baseband technology and security that position us to deliver important new capabilities and compete across an even
broader range of devices. And we've invented and implemented manufacturing breakthroughs that are allowing us to
deliver on the promise and competitive benefits of Moore's law.
Never in the history of our company has our ability to participate across the spectrum of computing been greater. From
industrial machines that are increasingly connected to the internet to the smallest battery-powered devices, from
traditional PCs to ultrabooks, and from high-performance servers to microservers, storage and networking equipment,
we now compete wherever there is computing.
At the same time, we've put more distance between us and the rest of the semiconductor industry than ever before. In
the first quarter, we shipped our 100-millionth 22-nanometer processor, using our revolutionary 3D transistor
technology, while the rest of the industry works to ship its first unit. That breakthrough is just one in a long history of
materials science firsts, following innovations like string silicon and high-k metal gate. This leadership in materials
science and manufacturing technology is the foundation on which our future success will be based, arming us with the
world's lowest power and lowest cost transistors.
But even as I prepare to pass the baton to a new generation of leadership, I know Intel's story is nowhere near
completely written. I'm excited about what lies ahead for Intel. The company has a historically broad portfolio of
products, spanning the spectrum of computing and price points. And as we begin to transition to 14-nanometer
technology later this year, our architectural and process technology investments and innovation will become
increasingly apparent and valuable for our customers and to the market.

Over the past few months I've been traveling to our sites here in the U.S. and around the world. That creativity and
drive that first attracted me to Intel almost four decades ago has never been higher. The company's core architectural
and manufacturing strengths have never been more valuable, and the opportunity presented by the evolution and
expansion of the computing industry has never been greater. It's for those reasons that I'm confident that Intel will
continue to invent, grow, thrive, and deliver the best technology to a world increasingly hungry for the products of the
microprocessor revolution.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Paul. I'd like to take a minute and talk about what we're seeing in each of the segments of our business and our
expectations as we look forward to the rest of the year.
Starting with the PC Client Group, PC Client volumes were down seasonally in the first quarter, consistent with our
expectations. In addition, we believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in inventory levels in
the first quarter as customers decreased inventory of older-generation PCs.
In the second quarter we will launch Haswell, enabling a new wave of ultra-sleek designs across multiple form factors
by our customers. We believe the combination of an improving macroeconomic environment, Haswell coming to the
market, ultra mobile form factors like ultrabooks, convertibles and tablets and touch-enabled devices leads to a return
to growth in the second half of this year.
Moving the Data Center Group. Data Center Group revenue in the first quarter grew 7% from a year ago. On a
year-on-year basis, we saw significant growth in both the cloud and high performance computing segments of the
market. We continue to refresh our product lines to expand our offerings across all ranges of performance, performance
per watt and performance per watt per dollar.
At IDF Beijing last week, we announced that our next generation Atom processor for the microserver segment of the
market, codenamed Avoton, and our Ivy Bridge product for Xeon class servers will be shipping in the second half.
These leadership products coupled with our leading edge process technology and the secular growth trends of the data
center market give us confidence in double-digit revenue growth for the year.
We are making significant progress in tablets and phones. First quarter tablet volume more than doubled from the
fourth quarter and we expect it to double again in the second quarter. We have shipping designs across both Windows 8
and Android operating systems. In the second half we will launch Bay Trail, which will further extend our product line
across screen sizes and price points.
In the phone segment, we had a good first quarter in our baseband business. We are shipping LTE versions today and
are on track to ship multi-mode voice and data LTE baseband solutions by the end of the year.
We are winning designs with our new Clover Trail+ apps processor where customers and third parties are highlighting
both the performance and power efficiency of our architecture and are on track to ship our next generation product
codenamed Merrifield by the end of the year.
In other important segments of our business we saw year-on-year growth in both our software and services group and
our NAND business.
Turning to our financials, first quarter revenue finished at $12.6 billion, in line with our expectations. We are
forecasting revenue of $12.9 billion for the second quarter, which is slightly higher than the average seasonal increase
as we expect some pipeline inventory replenishment as we launch Haswell and in anticipation of a stronger second half.
Gross margin of 56% was down 2 points from expectations. Increased demand from our customers allowed us to
increase production of Haswell products prior to qualification for sale. The result of this was a higher than anticipated
inventory write-off, which we expect to get back throughout the rest of the year as the product is expected to qualify for

sale in the second quarter.
In addition we saw higher than expected excess capacity charges in older generation process technologies. We are
taking advantage of the excess capacity on older generation process technologies to take capacity offline and reuse
more equipment and space for 14-nanometer and beyond.
The result of these actions allows us to lower our capital spending forecast for the year by $1 billion, down to $12
billion. In addition, our inventory decreased almost $400 million from the fourth quarter. For the second quarter, we
expect gross margin to increase two points to 58% and the gross margin forecast for the year remains 60%, with gross
margins in the second half back into the low-60s. Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion with earnings
per share of $0.40.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $17.1 billion, down $1.1 billion from the
fourth quarter. The reduction in cash was the result of shifting almost $1 billion from short-term to longer-term
investments.
In the first quarter, we generated approximately $4 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in
dividends, purchased a little over $2 billion in capital assets and repurchased $0.5 billion in stock.
As Paul said, our manufacturing leadership is extending and gives us the world's lowest cost and lowest power
transistors. In the first quarter we shipped our first silicon to a foundry customer and we announced a significant
foundry design win with Altera, who will move their leading edge products to our 14-nanometer process technology.
Building on this leadership we are on track to start production on 14-nanometer process technology in the back half of
this year. The combination of an improving macroeconomic environment and new products coming to the market over
the course of the year that take advantage of our manufacturing leadership, increase our confidence in being able to
achieve financial growth in the second half of 2013.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Thank you, Paul and Stacy. Before we begin the Q&A, I do recognize that there are questions about the upcoming CEO
transition. The selection process is on track and the Board's goal remains to name a successor by the time Paul retires at
the annual shareholder meeting in May. Beyond this, we won't be offering any additional commentary on the status of
the process or the candidates.
Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one
follow up if you have one. With that, Sammie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sumit Dhanda of ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Yes. Hi, guys, and, Paul, congratulations on a very successful career.
Two questions for you. Stacy, it seems like notebook ASPs were up a little bit sequentially based on the data that you
provided in the CFO commentary. Could you help us understand what that was due to? Was it enterprise versus
consumer mix? Or was there a bigger proportion of touch that was shipped in the quarter?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, there wasn't a very significant change quarter-on-quarter in terms of notebook
ASPs. I would just characterize it as a fairly benign pricing environment. The way we characterized it at the beginning
of the year is that we have, I think, a strong product position really across different form factors in the market and it

played out as we expected. So I'd characterize that as just not a lot of change from the way we saw things a quarter ago.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Okay. And then for my follow-up, just on the server piece, the last couple of quarters units were
pretty flat and then volumes were down [inaudible] (13:39) in the calendar first quarter. I would have thought that with
the easy comps you might have seen a slightly better volume pickup in that business. Anything you could talk to with
respect to why that did not occur?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, on a year-over-year comparison, units were up and ASP was up a little bit in the Data
Center Group. I think it's a little bit of an improvement of what we saw in the fourth quarter in the enterprise segment
of the Data Center. And then we continue to see very robust growth rates across the high performance computing and
the big IT data centers that support the cloud. So a nice continuation of growth in those segments and then a little bit
better in the enterprise segment, and as I think forward to the back half of the year, my suspicion is we'll start to see the
enterprise segment growing again just based on macro-economic improvement.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Thank you, and I'll echo what Sumit said. Paul, it has been a pleasure interacting with you
over the years. All the best.
Couple of questions. My first one is, Stacy, if you could please talk about the capacity. About how much of the CapEx
is – can be moderated lower if the PC industry continues to be weaker than probably what you thought going into the
year? So that's my first question.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Okay. I'd say we're really well-positioned right now from a factory and a utilization standpoint,
and let me just rewind what we did in the first quarter. We saw that units were a little bit weaker than we expected and
our expectations came down a bit. That allowed us to bring utilization down on some older generation process
technology. You can see we brought our inventory levels down pretty significantly and actually a bit more than I
thought when I started the quarter. And we took $1 billion out of CapEx by rolling forward some older generation
technologies to offset things that we needed to buy for 14-nanometer and new process technologies.
In terms of your question of the levers that we have, I think that's a good example of how we can be responsive in a
very tactical time horizon to changes in demand. And as I look forward across the year, the prediction right now is
we're going to run in a healthy rate of utilization. In fact, we're starting the quarter at that utilization rate. I think
inventories will continue to be healthy. If demand turns out to be stronger, we have some white space that we can grow
into so we can respond up. If demand ends up being a little weaker than we thought, you saw the playbook in Q1. We
can pretty quickly react and bring CapEx down if that's the case.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay. And then my follow-up on the foundry strategy, maybe for Paul or for you. What's
the long-term vision – getting Altera was a feather in your cap. But then looking out ahead, what implications does that
have for, a, business mix and then also for the long-term margin structure for the company? Thank you.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Sure. Well, I've described the strategy before as a crawl, walk, run strategy. We're past
crawling. We're in the mode of collecting serious customers. The design win activity leads the announcement activity,
as you'd expect in this business. And there are some other customers that we still have not yet publicly announced.
In terms of the business, as Stacy said I think last quarter, it will not have a significant revenue impact to the company
for two to three years. That's the design cycle for these products. And in the case of someone like Altera, the products
tend to run for quite some time. So think of that as something that will start two-plus years from now and run for quite
a number of years thereafter on several generations of technology.

The business model that we have for the foundry assumes value-based pricing. That is the people that we are soliciting
and people that are attracted to us are those who see the advantages of our technology as it manifests itself in their
products and gives them an advantage in the marketplace. So it's a healthy business for us.
<A - Mark Henninger>: All right. Next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, Paul, let me add my congratulations and best wishes in the next stage of your life.
A couple questions here, guys. First, just relative to what your units did in PCG versus some third-party data and kind
of your commentary that you thought that the PC supply chain went through an inventory reduction. There seems to be
a little bit of a mismatch where you guys have outperformed. To what extent is that just netbooks not being classified in
your PC Group and being classified in third-party data? To what extent is that emerging market strength perhaps
picking up that the third-party data is not sort of capturing?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. Actually I'll start – this is Stacy. I'll start this answer by saying we're – when you take into
account all of the different categories that the third parties are looking at, I'd say we're pretty aligned with how they
view the year. And so you start with the traditional PC segment of the market. We do expect that to be down. We
expect netbooks to be down significantly. You can see that in other IAG results and, in fact, it's getting close to zero. I
think that category is coming to the end of its life.
And then we see some of the new form factors of computing that are growing significantly, and I think Gartner would
call those ultra-mobile devices, so things like ultrabooks, detachables, convertibles. We're seeing robust growth there.
And then we're now participating across a broad range of tablets, between Windows 8 and Android and with Bay Trail
coming out and then Merrifield behind that, we start to participate in a much broader set of screen sizes and price points
than we are today.
And so when you net all of this out and you look broadly at the market for computing, you see some of the traditional
form factors down, you see growth in these new form factors. We get to kind of very slight unit growth for the year and
that's pretty consistent with how the third parties are viewing the year.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Perfect. That's helpful. And then, Stacy, as my follow-on, just the operating profitability of
DCG was down about 500 basis points sequentially and I guess it's the lowest in the data set that I'm looking at. Is that
incremental OpEx as you guys try to broaden out into new areas like networking and storage? Is that a gross margin
problem? Can you help me understand the profitability? And when do we get back to kind of the 50% op margin that
we saw maybe five quarters ago if ever?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, it's combination of two things and you'll notice, John, that it's also impacting PCCG. As
we had said at the beginning of the quarter, we had significant excess capacity charges that hit both PCCG and DCG
and we had a big increase in start-up costs as you'd kind of expect based on where we are in the 14-nanometer ramp,
and those two business units are the ones that really drive both of those, and so that's where those costs hit. So as the
gross margin improves, so we expect that Q1's the bottom, it's up a bit in Q2 and then a back half that's back into the
low-60s, you'll see the operating profit moving back into what you've historically come to expect in DCG.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess my first question is on the foundry business. Paul, you said
the response has been tremendous. You've also in the past said that you probably wouldn't take any business that was
ARM processor/potential competitor to yourself in the PC or the handset arena. Has that stance changed at all?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: No, it hasn't. I mean, I think that the ground rules that we've laid out which are – I have three
that I was looking at. One is that it be value-based pricing to take advantage of our technology. The second is that we
would not enable a chip competitor. And the third, that we have not mentioned on the call yet today, is that it would be
great if we could form a strategic relationship with that customer, so that it went beyond just a single foundry
transaction.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Thanks. And then for my follow-up, as we look at the sequentials for Q1, Q2 this year,
it's pretty similar to last year. I know that none of us want a repeat of the second half of last year. Can you just maybe
compare and contrast, and what gives you confidence that we're not going to see a repeat of last year in the second half
of this year for sales?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, what gives me confidence in the second half of 2013 really comes down to two things.
One, we do expect that the macro environment will improve. That's consistent with what we're seeing from most
economists. Now, you could say that that could be a repeat to what we've thought, we thought last year. I think the
world was expecting a stronger macroeconomic second half of 2012, but it didn't materialize. But that is my belief right
now. That will directly impact our data center business. There's a big portion of that business that really is correlated to
GDP growth when you look at it over a long period of time.
And then secondly, is our product portfolio, and we now participate across a broad range of devices: tablets and
convertibles and detachables and phones, although phones won't really drive the results in the second half. And so, we
can embrace this broad market for computing now. And wherever the demand increases, we can participate in it. And a
year ago, we were in the middle of that transition. And so, as tablets ramped, and in particular as Android tablets
ramped, we really weren't in a position to participate in those segments of the market.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Okay.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: And I'd add a third thing, Chris, which is I think that as the OEMs start looking at new form
factors that they can design around our new chips, Haswell in particular and maybe Bay Trail, and Windows 8 enabling
touch, the explosion in form factors and the competitiveness of that platform is going be substantially different at price
points down into the $300 or $400 range enabling touch. We didn't have that last year. So you go into the prime selling
season with new products, new technologies, new form factors, and new capabilities at, up to now, unapproachable
price points.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. First of all, congratulations to Paul and best of luck with retirement.
And then for my first question, moving onto the DCG side, again, I know you said, Stacy, that you're confident in
double digit growth for the year and that macro is a big part of it. Is there any sort of granularity you can give us to get
us across that bridge from what seemed to be a relatively weak start to the year, whether by the end markets within that
segment or new products? Anything you can help us with would be great.

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, maybe it's useful. I'll just, I'll give you a little bit of color commentary on Q1, just so you
can kind of see what we're seeing in terms of growth rates. We saw the – and if you look at the traditional enterprise
segment of the market on a year-over-year basis, as I said earlier, it's growing a little bit, but think of it as a pretty low
growth rate. And that's compared to the last couple of quarters where we saw that market in decline. So I think you'd
say it's improving, but it's not robust.
And then we continue to see very high rates of growth in things like the cloud and high performance computing. And
when I say high rates of growth, think of things that are in the 20%, 30%, 40% year-on-year unit growth rates in those
segments of the market. I think that second piece is really a secular driver. It's all these devices computing, connecting
to the internet, driving the build out of the cloud. And then the first piece, I think, is improving, and will likely improve
into the second half.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. And then as for my follow up side of things, thinking a little bit about inventory and
then how it plays along into utilization. You guys over the last two quarters have taken the better part of $1 billion out
of your inventory. A year ago at this time you started ramping that back up, and then obviously demand was a problem
and you had to go back to the underutilization side of things. Are you going to be a bit more cautious on the pace of
utilization and inventory build this year, or is some of the things macro-wise and product-wise that are giving you
confidence in the back half demand going to lead you to the same behavior, or just as aggressive as a year ago? Thank
you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think we're on a path where inventory levels end the year, no more than what we have today
and likely less than what we have today. I think we're all learning how to operate more efficiently. Now it may go up a
little bit in the second quarter as the various versions of Haswell qualify, which is part of the story for the Q1 margin
miss. But then we'll continue to manage things very lean. And as I said as an answer to a question earlier, we're now in
a really nice position where we have the capability to flex capacity up if we need to. So that says we don't need to run
with big inventory levels.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: All right, thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Guys, thanks so much for taking the question. First question, the last time PC units were at
this level was Q2 2009 and your quarterly CapEx was less than $1 billion. It was $981 million. The full-year CapEx
guidance implies you're going be spending three times that amount in quarterly CapEx for the rest of this year. Why do
you need that much capacity when units are at the same levels as then?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, let me put CapEx in maybe a broader context. First, if you take out the 450-millimeter,
we're down a couple of billion dollars from where we were last year, a pretty significant reduction. And if you just look
at our capital spending as a percent of revenue, relative to the last several years, we're in the high teens and the last
couple of years we've been in the low-20s. So I think we're kind of in the range. You compare that against some of the
people we compare against, TSMC or Samsung, they're spending some significant multiple of CapEx relative to
revenue to what we are.
So I think we're spending the right amount. I think we're going be responsive if the market ends up a little bit weaker. I
think we have the ability to flex up if the market ends up being stronger. I'm very comfortable with our positioning.
And as I just discussed with Ross, the operational indicators look really good. I think we can – we're at a healthy level
of inventory. We brought it down another $400 million this quarter. We're running healthy utilization and I expect both
of those to continue through the year.

<Q - James V. Covello>: I absolutely appreciate the perspective around the numbers but it still doesn't really answer
why it needs to be 3x higher than when units were at the same level.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Right. I think if you do any quarter compare you can – capital spending tends to be over a long
period of time. So if you look at it on an annual basis, what we're forecasting for this year is kind of down a little bit on
a percent of revenue relative to what we spent in 2010, 2011 and 2012.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Thanks very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome. 2009 is a weird comparison point because you're in the aftermath of the
financial meltdown. And as we disclosed to you at that time, that gave us the ability to roll forward entire factories full
of equipment from one process generation to the next. I think if you choose that particular time period, you're going to
get a weird compare.

understand. That's helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thank you. Just to clarify some of the numbers, you mentioned the 450-millimeter spending.
Is that still assumed to be about $2 billion for this year and therefore, your spending on your core CapEx for this year is
planned to be about $10 billion down from $11 billion last year? Is that the way the numbers work?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay. Great. And the other thing is in your full-year revenue guidance, can you give us any
idea of roughly what percent of full-year sales might be related to tablets and smartphones? What's assumed for that?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, well, so let me take it at a higher level, David, and I'll get to that. But the short answer is
smartphones – it doesn't move the needle for us from a revenue standpoint as we've said. We're in the design win phase
there. Tablets is interesting, but I want to talk about that in the context of the broader market for computing.
So let's start with the data center. It's about 20% of our revenue. We've said we expect it to be double-digit growth. So
if you just do simple manager math that says that just the data center is giving a couple of points, maybe a smidge more
than that, to the company's growth rate that we've said is low, single digit. Just the data center kind of gets us there.
Within the broader market for computing, it's the answer that I gave John earlier, which is we're seeing a decline in
some of the traditional form factors. We're seeing an increase in things like ultrabooks, convertibles, tablets. We're
refreshing our product line there. When you net all that out, you get to some very modest unit growth across all of those
devices. So think of that as being flattish, up a smidge. And then the rest of it is relatively small compared to those two
businesses. That's how you get to low, single digit growth for the company.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.

My first question is so far Windows 8 traction has been well below expectations relative to your last earnings call. So
what specifically in Haswell can help turn it around? And can you give us a sense of how your customers are thinking
about how they will roll out products when Haswell comes around? What will really change in the landscape to
improve PC market traction?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, with Haswell there's a number of things. First of all, the overall performance goes up, the
graphics performance goes up as well as the integer performance. So it's a better punch in the package than we've had
with Ivy Bridge, point one. Point two, the power envelope or the battery life for that level of performance is
exceptionally better than Ivy Bridge. Third, it gets into the form factor innovation and the integration of touch that I
spoke about earlier, which I think is really part of the recipe required for Win 8 adoption.
I've recently converted personally to Windows 8 with touch, and it is a better Windows than Windows 7 in the desktop
mode when you implement the touch and the touch-based applications and operating environment. It's just a lot easier
to use. There is an adoption curve, and once you get over that adoption curve, I don't think you go back- we didn't quite
have that same kind of adoption curve in Windows 7 versus XP before it. This requires a little bit of training, and I
think people are attracted to touch and the touch price points today are still fairly high and they're coming down very
rapidly over the next couple of quarters.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Got it. Thanks, Paul. As my follow up, Stacy, the buyback slowed down to I think about a half a
billion in the last quarter. You were above a billion and plus in prior quarters. How should we think about buy -back
activity for this year? How should we just think about overall use of cash for this year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, in as I think you know, we don't share prospectively what we're planning to do with the
buyback just as a matter of policy. What I can share with you is that our priorities are still the priorities that we've been
talking about: it's invest in our business first, it's dividend second and I've shared with you the expectation that we want
a dividend that's on the order of 40% of free cash flow. And I think that's giving us a pretty good dividend yield today.
And then buy backs we use to – as the other way to return cash to shareholders and to modulate cash balance. And so
what you can take from less buybacks is just that I'm uncomfortable with the cash balances.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Sanford and Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Somebody or you spoke before about your
increased confidence now versus last year. But if I'm just looking over the I guess the last three months we have weaker
results in Q1, which raises the operational bar for the second half on both top line and gross margin, which suggests
you're even more confident in that back half ramp than you were three months ago, even in the wake of what looks to
be pretty challenging market data. You're also taking CapEx down though, which would belie that increased confidence
somewhat. I was wondering can you help me identify I guess the sources of that increased confidence in that back half
ramp versus where you were three months ago as well as help me rationalize that with the CapEx outlook?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. And first of all, just to make sure we're not over-stoking things here, you really just need
seasonal from where we are in order to achieve the low single digit revenue growth. So I don't think we have a hugely
high bar out there and I went through a dissection of where I think the revenue comes from.
In terms of the things that give me confidence that or at least I personally believe it could be better than seasonal is
improving macroeconomic environment. It's the things we talked about, improving macroeconomic environment, it's
the fact that we now are participating across a range of compute devices and so the mix between those don't impact us
nearly as much.
And then third, as Paul said, you have innovative form factors coming out in ultrabooks, in convertibles, in detachables
that are hitting these really compelling mainstream price points that are touch-enabled. And as we get into the

Christmas selling season, I think our expectation is you will see touch-enabled ultrabooks that are $499 and $599 pretty
commonly out there, $599 commonly and $499 as kind of special SKUs.
And then we'll see because of Bay Trail coming into the marketplace, you'll see touch-enabled thin notebooks with
really good performance that are hitting kind of $300 price points. And then with our Android tablets you'll see things
that are significantly – half that. So we're participating across this broad range of compute devices as we get into the
back half of this year.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up I wanted to dig a little bit into the – I guess, the
trajectory of your fab output. It sounds to me like your current plan for loading is similar to what you had last quarter,
which was, I think, full fabs in the second half. It almost sounds like you may be running close to full right now. What
does that mean for I guess your expectations for how much your fab output may grow in 2014 year-over-year given I
would think you anticipate running full in 2014 and we were pretty lean in the first – in the first part of 2013? Would
double-digit upside be the right way to think about that in terms of fab output? And how much of that increase might be
inventory replenishment versus I guess demand upside?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think it's early to talk about 2014 at this point. We have the ability to respond to lots of
different volume scenarios for 2014. If it's large, we can put on more capacity. If it ends up being less robust, we can
play the playbook we've played...
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: We've also got the technology transition to the 14-nanometer.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah.
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: So up to our first order, all of our spending is focused on 14-nanometers which gives us a fairly
significant ramp capability. If demand for older products exceeds what we can build on 14, we can still build 22 for
quite some time. So I don't – I really think – it depends on whatever demand scenario you see out there. In any event,
the most important thing for us is to make that transition to 14 and continue to have the leading edge.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Right.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: And I understand that. Just mathematically, though, if I'm running full in 2014 and I was
pretty empty in first part of 2013, even if you're not adding a tremendous amount of capacity, doesn't that imply a very
significant uptick in your fab output in 2014 versus 2013? 2013's flattish to 2012 and in 2012 we already had too much,
right? I'm just trying mathematically, what does it imply if you're running full in 2014 even if you don't add anything?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: We haven't talked about 2014.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, and I think what your equation misses there is that we roll forward capacity. So we take
capacity offline, and so think of the change in CapEx at a kind of first approximation of we took older generation
technology offline a little faster than we thought and we offset stuff that we were going to buy to make the transition
and to build towards that 14-nanometer peak. We don't actually have to choose the 14-nanometer peak today. We can
continue to refresh capital.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: I understand. I'm just saying if you're running full in 2014 and you're not full for 2013,
how much does – how much would your output go up? I'm forgetting transitions in 14-nanometers in CapEx. Just on a
rough basis, how much are we talking about in terms of an increase?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: If we're running full in 2014, I mean, I'm not sure how to answer that question because I don't
yet know how much capacity I'm going to put in place for 014.
<A - Mark Henninger>: And, Stacy, I think at that point we'll want to move on to the next questioner. I'll be happy to
follow up with you a little bit later.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Freedman of RBC. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Hi, Stacy and Paul. Thanks for taking my question. And, Paul, congrats on the next phase of
your life.
In the past when you looked at Intel, you were successful because your customers were successful. And right now I
think it's general perception that the PC ecosystem is really not in the greatest state of health. What is it that you think
Intel can do to try to make your customers more successful in the marketplace?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: I think continue to give them the tools to innovate. And I wouldn't – I wouldn't paint the entire
customer base with the same brush that you just did, Doug. I mean, certainly if you looked at the last quarter even
inside the PC space, Lenovo outperformed everybody else and actually had a very good year-on-year set of numbers in
a down year. Apple continues to do well. Subsets of customers in different segments are also doing very well in terms
of say those providing products into the Internet data centers.
What I see when we look out is a tremendous amount of innovation, particularly at the ODM and Taiwanese OEM side
where the ability to miniaturize and bring things into extremely thin form factors is really as revolutionary amount of
change as I've seen in my time in this industry. And so I think what we can do is give them the products like Haswell
and Bay Trail to innovate around. We can help them with other feature sets like voice and speech that go around them
and just help them build better products.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: When I look at – as my follow-up to that, when we look at, sort of, what we're seeing Intel do
strategically, that is, investing in things outside of what we call core PC, how do I try to quantify how big an
investment you're willing to make in things such as the set-top box, or in the foundry efforts, or other areas of revenue
that the company is seeking?
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Well, I don't look at things quite that – with that level of granularity. I mean, I think that in the
foundry thing, that the investment is really going to be taking advantage, at least near-term, with the current customer
base of capacity that we're already putting in place. That doesn't mean that at some point we won't have to actually
build extra capacity for a foundry customer or the foundry business. But up to this point, it's certainly within our ability
to absorb. The set-top box spending or the stuff we're doing in Intel Media, in the grand scheme of things, is not a lot of
spending.
So the real issue is inside of our core microprocessor and platform development and we're at the point now where
roughly half of our spending is focused on system-on-chip, inside the microprocessor world. And the system-on-chip
environment is really a lot of the ultra-mobile products. It's the phones, it's the tablets, it's embedded systems, it's
automotive, et cetera, where we have fairly strong growth opportunities.
So it's not the same model, let's say tick-tock model, that we put in place eight years ago.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Operator, we'll go ahead and take two more questions.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you. My question's on the commentary that the pipeline inventory replenishment
will be a driver for a slightly higher than seasonal Q2. Is that – can you put some perspective on that? It seems like you
normally have new products in Q2, you normally have strength in Q3. Is there – is the current inventory level lean, or
just how should we view that inventory replenishment comment?

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, I think inventory levels generally are lean everywhere we look. We saw an inventory burn
in the broader pipeline in Q1, and our inventory levels are down more than I expected when I started the quarter, and
down pretty significantly. So I think inventory levels are lean. And I also want to put it in perspective, you're talking a
minor difference.
Being up 3% quarter-on-quarter is kind of well within Q1-to-Q2 seasonality. I don't think there's any one big driver
there. I do think we'll see people putting in place some Haswell-based systems in anticipation of the second half selling
season, just as they burned inventory on some of the older-generation systems in the first quarter.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then in terms of ultrabook,
last year you had given pretty precise targets on where you wanted that to come out as a percentage of consumer
notebooks. To the extent that you're willing to talk about it, can you give us any kind of qualitative assessment of where
you think those penetration numbers will go this year, and any kind of goals or targets that you may have?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think it's – what's interesting is what we're seeing in that there's a market for ultrabooks. And
it's a sizable market. I mean, even if you look at Gartner data, it's growing robustly. But there's this reinvention going
on just broadly across the notebook. And we're seeing now the percent of thin and light notebooks in the market
relative to the total notebook market, they're kind of in the order of a third of the market, which – and I think that grows
from here as we hit price points.
So I think that the reinvention of the form factor is well underway. Some of those are going to be more premium
ultrabooks with touch, and then new form factors of convertibles and detachables. A big chunk of that's going to be that
wedge of volume behind that, which are thin and light touch-enabled notebooks that aren't categorized as ultrabook. All
of that is good for us.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Joe. And, Sammie, if you would go ahead and introduce our last question.
Operator
Our final question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Tim M. Arcuri>: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the mix between bricks and mortar and any
equipment spending. You had said before, when you had guided core CapEx minus the 450-millimeter spending of $11
billion, flat, you said that the equipment portion would be up pretty sizably year-over-year. So, since you cut $1 billion
out of that, will the equipment portion still be up, or is it now down?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I haven't looked at that math. You're right, the way I characterized it, we spent about 40% of our
CapEx in 2012 on equipment. That percentage came down in 2013. More of the cut to CapEx was equipment than
realignment of space. So I'd have to go back and look at the math and that's something we typically share with you in
the November investor meeting to just kind of give you a sense of where is the CapEx going and then some color
commentary over the next couple years.
<Q - Tim M. Arcuri>: Okay, great. And then just second thing, you just gave some price points for touch-enabled
notebooks that I look back in my notes and you were previously saying $599 to $799 for touch-enabled notebooks. And
now, from what you just said, I think you were saying that you're going to have some at $499 with line of sight down to
$300. That's quite a bit lower, so I'm wondering, did something change? Because at those price points you get a much
different demand...
<A - Paul S. Otellini>: No. He separated ultrabook versus notebook.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: But he said touch-enabled notebooks.

<A - Paul S. Otellini>: Right, I know. So we have a certain spec for ultrabooks and that is the product that Stacy said
is going be centered as low as $599 with some verse SKUs to $499. If you look at touch-enabled Intel based notebooks
that are ultra-thin and light using non-Core processors, those prices are going be down to as low as $200 probably.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'd say the big change over the last 12 months there is that Bay Trail's going be a great
product in that segment of the market. We think it enables stunning performance relative to what the competition can
bring, and it's going to enable these price points. And I'd say a year ago we didn't really have line of sight to hitting that
and today we're cleanly there.
