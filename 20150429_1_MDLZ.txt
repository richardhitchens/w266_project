Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. As you know, 2015 is a year of big change for us and we're off to a solid start. We've
continued to make good progress in a challenging environment by focusing on what we can control. This includes
executing our transformation agenda: prioritizing margin expansion and strong constant currency earnings growth,
while delivering solid revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, driven by pricing actions to
recover currency-driven input cost increases.
We significantly expanded adjusted operating income margin, up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Importantly, adjusted
gross margin contributed more than half of the increase, while lower overheads contributed the rest. Adjusted EPS was
$0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant-currency basis, driven almost entirely by operating gains.
As we discussed at CAGNY, we're executing three transformation priorities that will further leverage our advantaged
portfolio and geographic footprint, while setting us up to deliver top-tier financial performance as global demand
improves. Let me give you a quick update on each of our transformation initiatives: to further focus our portfolio on
snacks, to reduce our supply chain and overhead costs, and to continue investing for growth.
On the portfolio front, we expect our Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee joint venture to close this year, likely in the third
quarter. We're working to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and are awaiting
the results of the Phase II review.
We anticipate closing our acquisition of Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam around mid-year and are looking
forward to leveraging the growth opportunities of this attractive business. With about $175 million in sales, Kinh Do is
one of the largest snack companies in Vietnam with iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and mooncakes.
Going forward, we intend to accelerate its growth by introducing our Power Brands into its distribution network, which
covers 130,000 outlets.
We also welcomed Enjoy Life Foods into our family last quarter. While starting from a relatively small revenue base,
the company provides us with an excellent platform for future growth. We're very excited about the opportunity to
leverage its strong brands and market position and fast-growing better-for-you allergen-free snacks.
Turning to our cost reduction programs, we're continuing to make good progress across our supply chain and in
overheads. Net productivity in the quarter was very strong at more than 3% of cost of goods sold, building on the
record rate of 2.8% we delivered last year. These productivity gains were instrumental in driving our 90 basis point
improvement in adjusted gross margin. We're complementing these supply chain savings by aggressively managing
overheads, leveraging the zero-based budgeting process we began about 18 months ago. This includes reducing indirect
expenses as well as streamlining infrastructure and internal processes.
In fact, we've already begun to migrate some transactional processes to our new global shared service centers. As a
result, we continue to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue. Of course, these savings not only enable us to expand
margins, but they also provide the fuel to invest in growth. As we highlighted at CAGNY, this includes investing in
new advantaged assets as part of our supply chain reinvention. For example, our biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico,
opened on schedule in the fourth quarter. By the end of the first half, we'll have five new lines up and running to
support growth, and repatriate volume that's currently co-manufactured. As you'll recall, each of these new lines gives
us 1,000-point margin increase over existing assets.
We're also bringing on stream advantaged lines of the future at other facilities around the world, in emerging markets
like India and China, as well as in Europe and the U.S. Each of these state-of-the-art lines has operating costs that are
about half as much as our current lines, and runs twice as fast while taking up only a fraction of the floor space. We've
also continued to invest in working media to strengthen our brand equities, backstop our pricing, and support
innovation. Total advertising and consumer spending was essentially flat on a constant currency basis, as we
maintained marketing support particularly on our Power Brands.
That said, as a percent of revenue, A&C was down slightly, as we continued to drive efficiencies in non-working
media, move more advertising to lower cost digital channels, and shifted the timing of certain marketing programs. For

the remainder of the year, we expect A&C to rise modestly as we invest behind new product launches and marketing
programs to drive revenue and improve share.
Let's take a more detailed look at our top line results for the quarter. As you can see on slide five, organic net revenue
grew 3.8% with pricing contributing 6.5 percentage points. Consistent with our strategy, we've raised prices to recover
higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed previously, this protects profits and enables us
to continue to invest in our people and in our key growth drivers, our brands, innovation platforms, sales and
distribution capabilities, and supply chain.
It's important to note that in the first quarter, a significant contributor to the increase in price was the carryover benefit
of pricing actions taken last year. Of course, rising prices, especially when the increases are significant, typically have a
short-term impact on consumer demand. In Q1, vol/mix was down 2.7 percentage points due in part to elasticity. As we
discussed in our earnings call last quarter, we're also experiencing the impact of some strategic decisions to improve
revenue mix. These include discontinuing some low-margin customer-specific product lines especially in Europe,
exiting low-margin products associated with short-term brand licenses from Kraft Foods, and ongoing SKU
simplification. In the quarter, these strategic decisions accounted for about 140 basis points of the decline in vol/mix.
For the full-year, we expect these decisions to be about 100 basis point headwind to our organic growth, and as we've
said before, this has been incorporated into our revenue guidance. Partially offsetting this headwind in Q1 is about a 50
basis point benefit from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter.
Our Power Brands, which represent about two-thirds of our revenue, grew nearly 6% led by Oreo, TUC, Club Social,
and belVita biscuits, Lacta chocolate, Trident gum, Halls candy and Jacobs, Carte Noir and Tassimo coffee. Emerging
markets were up nearly 11% with the BRIC countries up double digits. Developed markets were down 0.5%.
Turning now to our results by region. As you can see on slide six, Latin America and EEMEA, fueled by higher
pricing, drove much of our overall growth. Latin America was up nearly 19% driven by the inflationary economies in
Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up nearly 10%, including a meaningful contribution from vol/mix and solid
growth across all categories.
EEMEA grew 11%, primarily due to pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of those
currencies. Despite this, vol/mix was up in both countries and share performance was solid. Russia grew mid-teens with
strong growth in our two largest categories. Chocolate was up high-teens behind Alpen Gold and coffee was up over
20%.
Asia Pacific grew modestly with solid gains in China and India. China was up high single-digits, driven by strong
performance of both Oreo and Stride gum. We continue to be encouraged by our progress. This is the third consecutive
quarter of high-single digit growth there. Our team is executing well, and we're selectively investing to continue and
hopefully accelerate our momentum. India was up mid-single digits, as Cadbury Dairy Milk share topped 40%, its
highest ever. However, chocolate price increases tempered consumer demand. We expect category and revenue growth
in India to improve as the year progresses, not only as we increase A&C investments, but also as consumers adjust to
the industry-wide price increases implemented last year.
North America revenue declined modestly, largely due to a change in a large customer's in-store strategy that reduced
merchandising and display opportunities. Although this led to a decline in the overall biscuits category and a modest
decrease in our revenue, we grew our share, driven by strength in crackers. To accelerate revenue and category growth
for the remainder of the year, we're stepping up marketing support behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms,
as well as increasing investments behind in-store execution.
Finally, Europe was down 0.6%, in line with our expectations. Frankly, we expect Europe's first half to be soft as the
macro environment continues to be challenging. In addition, the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that I
mentioned earlier tempered Europe's volumes by about 200 basis points, which was only partially offset by a 60 point
benefit due to the Easter shift. We've continued to experience some negative volume elasticity as a result of our
decision to lead pricing to recover higher input costs, especially in chocolate. However, we expect this pressure to ease
in the back half.

Turning now to our categories, for the quarter, snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally, up from the low 3%s as we
exited last year. Of course, the Easter shift helped boost growth rate somewhat. Including beverages, cheese and
grocery, our categories edged closer to 5% growth. Along with overall category growth modestly improving, our share
performance began to stabilize, with 48% of our snacks revenues gaining or holding share in the quarter. That's up from
40% in 2014. In addition, compared to the softening trends we saw in the back half of last year, our share performance
improved across almost all of our snacks categories.
The biscuits category grew about 4%, down from 5% last year. Much of this slower growth came in North America and
Europe. Our biscuits revenue grew in line with the category, as we gained or held share in key markets, fueled by our
Power Brands which grew high single-digits. For example, Oreo was up mid-teens, driven by innovation in China and
distribution gains in Brazil and Europe. TUC/Club Social grew more than 30%, with launches of new flavors and pack
sizes in Brazil. belVita was up high-single digits, with strong growth in the U.S. behind the continued success of the
belVita Bites, and in the U.K. with belVita Tartine and Crunchy.
Turning to chocolate, the category grew 6.5%, aided by the Easter shift. Our sales only increased slightly more than
1%, with only about 35% of our revenue gaining or holding share. The softness was due primarily to our European
business, which accounts for half of our global chocolate sales. We expected this, knowing that a significant portion of
the decline would be due to our decision to discontinue some low-margin product lines, and that we'd continue to
experience some volume elasticity and share losses because we led pricing.
Although we expect continued share pressure in Q2, we're encouraged to see that most of our European competitors
have now begun to raise prices. As a result, we expect our shares to strengthen in the back half of the year. In the
meantime, we're selectively stepping up our marketing and promotional activity to narrow price gaps and regain share.
In emerging markets, chocolate revenue increased mid-single-digits and we gained or held share in our key markets.
For example, in Brazil, our largest chocolate business in emerging markets, sales grew high-single digits and we
increased share by about one point. In India, our second-largest emerging markets chocolate business, although the
category slowed, revenue was up mid-single digits and we held share. And in Russia and South Africa, revenue was up
mid-to-high teens, holding share as well.
Looking ahead, as price gaps narrow and we increase marketing support in the back half of the year, we expect global
chocolate revenue growth in both developed and emerging markets to accelerate and our shares to rebound.
Turning to gum and candy, the category grew about 1.5%, while our revenue was up nearly 6%. For the first time in a
while, I'm pleased to see strong gum growth. Like chocolate, our gum results are a tale of two cities. Developed
markets continued to be down mid-single digits with share losses in France, Japan, and the U.S. But in the emerging
markets, gum was up mid-teens led by strong revenue and share performance in Brazil and China.
To summarize, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth in a
challenging environment and made good progress in stabilizing our shares. We're executing our transformation agenda
well, including aggressively reducing cost to expand margins and to provide the fuel to invest in our franchises to drive
sustainable revenue and earnings growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution,
especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins, and grow earnings per share.
Starting with slide eight, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 38%. Pricing, including the
carryover benefit of actions taken in 2014, more than offset the increase in commodity and currency related cost
inflation. This allowed strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million to fall through.

Adjusted OI margin was up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Adjusted gross margin expansion accounted for more than half
of the increase, the rest was driven by lower overheads as we continued to aggressively reduce expenses by leveraging
our zero-based budgeting approach and other cost saving tools.
Looking at margin performance by region, you can see that North America, Europe, and Latin America drove our
adjusted OI expansion. North America was up 400 basis points. More than half of this improvement was driven by
strong net productivity with the remainder largely due to lower overheads. Europe was up 180 basis points as strong net
productivity positively impacted adjusted gross margins. And Latin America increased 120 basis points, predominantly
driven by overhead leverage.
In contrast, EEMEA declined 240 basis points. The sudden and severe devaluation of Ukrainian and Russian currencies
made it difficult to fully recover input cost inflation in the near-term without sacrificing significant volume declines or
share losses. As we exit the quarter, we're in a much better position with margins in these markets. We expect margin
will improve as the year progresses as we continue to implement additional price increases to cover higher costs. In
Asia Pacific, margin was down 30 basis points. While we improved gross margin and lowered overheads, the phase-out
of the local tax incentive program offset underlying year-over-year operating margin improvement.
Turning to EPS on slide 10. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis.
The year-over-year improvement in our operating income accounted for $0.09 of this increase. Below the operating
line, lower interest expense from our successful debt refinancing added $0.01 and lower outstanding shares added
another $0.02. Also below the line, our effective tax rate was higher, driven mostly by the geographic mix of where our
earnings were generated. The higher tax rates hurt our EPS by $0.02 versus last year. Even after accounting for the
$0.08 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 5%.
On the next page, you'll see that we returned $1.75 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. We
purchased $1.5 billion of stock that represented 41.7 million shares at an average price of just under $36 as we
frontloaded much of our buyback activity given the relatively attractive share price and our liquidity. Consistent with
our outlook, we expect to buy back up to $2 billion of stock through the year. However, this doesn't include additional
share repurchase activity related to the expected cash proceeds from the coffee deal in the second half.
We also paid about $250 million in dividends. As we previously stated, we intend to pay a modest dividend with
shareholder returns largely driven by EPS growth. Nonetheless, we're committed to maintaining a payout ratio of at
least 30%. Today, our payout ratio is about 35%.
Turning to slide 12, in the first quarter, we took advantage of an opportunity to refinance some of our higher cost dollar
debt into lower coupon, euro, sterling, and Swiss franc denominated notes. The weighted average rate for the $2.5
billion of U.S. dollar notes we tendered was about 6.2%. We financed the tender by issuing the equivalent of about $3.5
billion of notes at very attractive rates, securing a weighted average coupon of 1.9%. As a result, we lowered the
weighted average cost of our long-term debt by about 100 basis points to 3.6%. We also extended the average tenure of
our long-term debt by nearly a year from about 7.5 years to 8.5 years. For 2015, this lowers our total interest expense
by $75 million to $100 million depending upon how currency rates evolve for the year.
Now turning to our outlook for the year. Given our solid start, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our
2015 outlook. With that said, we still have much to do as we execute our transformation. So in the near-term, we want
to be prudent and we are simply reaffirming our outlook for the year. We continue to expect organic revenue to grow at
least 2%, including a headwind of about 100 basis points from the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that we
discussed earlier. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on
a constant currency basis. And we expect free cash flow, excluding items, to be approximately $1.2 billion.
While our overall guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS has not changed, the makeup of the below the line items
will be somewhat different. Due to our debt refinancing, our interest expense is likely to be around $750 million rather
than the original guidance of around $825 million. In addition, due to earnings mix and consistent with what we saw in
the first quarter, our effective tax rate is likely to be higher than we originally anticipated. Instead of an estimated tax
rate in the high-teens, we currently expect a rate in the low-20%s. Of course, currency continues to be a significant and

increasing headwind this year given that 80% of our revenue is not tied to the U.S. dollar. Using April 27 spot rates, we
anticipate the currency headwind would be about 12 percentage points for revenue versus our earlier estimate of 11
points. We also anticipate a $0.33 impact to adjusted EPS compared to our initial $0.30 estimate.
While the currency impact is significant, we believe our underlying performance in operations are solid. We remain
confident in our ability to deliver strong constant currency earnings growth and solid organic revenue growth this year.
One last point, since we don't have the necessary regulatory approvals to know the precise closing date for the coffee
JV, our 2015 outlook includes the full-year results for the coffee business. Assuming a closing sometime in the third
quarter, we'll likely update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee transaction when we report our second quarter
results.
So to wrap up, we've had a solid start to the year by focusing on what we can control as we prioritize margin expansion
and strong constant currency earnings growth, while delivering solid revenue growth. We're making good progress on
our transformation agenda. Our initiatives to focus on portfolio are on track including the coffee JV. We're executing
well against our cost reduction programs, and we're continuing to invest in our Power Brands, our supply chain and
sales and distribution capabilities to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long-term.
As we anticipated, our market share performance has begun to stabilize. We expect it improve in the second half, as
price gaps narrow and we continue to selectively increase marketing support and promotional programs. All of these
actions have us well positioned to achieve our 2015 outlook and our 15% to 16% margin target for 2016.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Two questions, if I could. First, Irene, you mentioned most European competitors have now
started to take pricing and following some of your moves and that's a new development and clearly a positive one. But
you also mentioned, I guess, promotional spend, it will be needed to narrow price gaps. So I'm trying to get a sense of
whether the pricing that others have taken are not enough to get the gaps still where you want? Or if it's one player, in
particular, that maybe hasn't yet moved – I'm trying to just connect those two dots.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. Andrew, the way it works is, first of all, we've now seen most of our competitors
announce, as I mentioned, but till it plays through, it takes some time. And in fact, it's one of the reasons I said we
would still expect to see share softness in the second quarter. It'll take probably till the back half. And so, in selected
markets, we want to continue to make sure that we're protecting our market position. So we've been very disciplined in
looking market by market and seeing where we stand, and on that basis, we're making that decision. But I feel quite
confident that we will see our chocolate shares rebound in the back half of the year.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. And then, Brian, initially, I knew you expected margins to get sequentially better as the
year progressed, they obviously expanded quite a bit more in the first quarter than even the full-year target would
suggest. So, I guess, where was the primary source of that upside in the quarter to margins? And do you expect the
expansion therefore to be less pronounced in future quarters on a year-over-year basis? And if so, why would that be?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. Andrew, I think we did see, for probably the first time in a while, pricing is in a good
position to cover inflation that we've seen driven by commodities and currency, which allowed net productivity to
really drop through. So I think that's the big one. As I mentioned in my comments, I think we were a bit ahead in terms
of executing in a couple areas. One is supply chain and some of the reinvention activities helped contribute to that
productivity. I think some of that is timing and executing a bit earlier, which helps. And then on overheads, we slightly
beat our targets for overhead reductions, and that's really, as ZBB is playing out and our visibility and transparency to
spending and moving the culture to more cost-conscious culture, I think, is paying dividends for us.

Page 7 of 15
So those are the things I think that give us a little bit of tailwind in the quarter. And again, as we talked about, I think
the supply chain reinvention is clearly a second half impact that we still expect to see. We may be pulled a little bit of
that into the first part of the year, which is great but there will be more to come in the second half.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. So no – nothing necessarily one-off that we should expect starts to take down the rate of
margin improvement necessarily as we move through the year, even though you're only looking for, I guess, just like
100 basis points on a full-year basis of margin improvement, like you start off the year quite a bit stronger than that?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. I would just say the first quarter – 13.8% in the first quarter is a pretty solid number,
not a lot of one-off items that contributed to that number or hurt in the quarter. It's a pretty clean quarter.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning. A couple questions. First, on gross margins, do you foresee 2015 as being a
year of sequentially improving gross margin trend as you get new production up and running like the one you talked
about at CAGNY in Mexico? And perhaps as you get the pricing in place and past some of these initial transactions
effects you talked about, for instance, in Russia, any color on sequential gross margin trends would be helpful.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, David. It's more of a first half/second half dynamic as we talked about the supply
chain. I think there's clearly some markets where there continues to be volatility and some areas where we're going to
have to continue to work pricing to offset mostly currency-driven pressures. So it's a dynamic environment. We clearly
looked at the second half as being more advantaged given the supply chain dynamic and we feel good about the start.
But I would expect – without getting into quarter-by-quarter trend, I think this is a bit of a first half/second half story
for us.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: What I'd say, David, I do think you can see the algorithm starting to play through and that's
why we feel quite pleased with the quarter. The facts are that we're covering our cost increases through pricing as best
we can. That's starting to play through and then that's allowing our productivity to drop through and you should see that
dynamic continue to play through for the balance of the year.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And just a follow-up on your comment about reinvesting in A&C. I know you don't want to
share too much with your competition, but where have you seen the best ROI on spend? Where should we generally
think about you spending that money? Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, what I'll tell you is we will be spending it where we get the best ROI and where we
have capacity, so I wouldn't know. There's certainly a number of our Power Brands like Oreo and belVita, we've got
strong capacity coming in, in back half and you'll see us spend behind those businesses. In the near-term, though, I
would say in a number of our markets, I'm particularly pleased with the performance in EEMEA, where we had to price
quite aggressively in response to the rapid devaluation, and those are some of the markets where we were able to
continue to make our A&C investments, which then helped to protect our share.
So I think as you see our aggregate share performance around the world, much of that was due to the fact that we
continued to spend and, in some cases, increased our spending behind those franchises. But net-net, we will be
spending where we get the best return and where we have good capacity support.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just had, I guess, just one question just to understand a little bit about what's happened on
the gross margin line this quarter, and I guess, to try to help, sort of, bridge the balance of the year. I think, if I did this
analysis or calculation right, you got about $550 million benefit from pricing on gross margin. You had $175 million of
net productivity gains, you had a $435 million currency headwind just translation, assuming that your pricing covers
your commodity costs, is the gap there in terms of the drag the transaction effect on gross margin?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. I mean, the numbers we would talk about would include the transaction impact of
currency, not translation. That said, the transaction impact is the pressure that we're seeing mostly in the COGS line.
Commodities are still up year-over-year in the quarter, though they've been slightly down in the short-term, so that is
also a headwind. And when you think about the pricing that Irene talked about offsetting, it's really offsetting that
transaction impact on our commodity prices and labor costs and other elements of the P&L.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I guess what I was trying to get at was as we look at gross margins going forward and
assuming that there is not any incremental pricing or maybe even a little bit of promotional activity, how should we
think about how the currencies will affect gross margins over the balance of the year? Is it potentially more of a drag
because currencies are a little bit more adverse? Or is it more neutralized going forward because you've taken some
pricing in some of the markets where the currency has moved a lot?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think that becomes a bit of a market-by-market conversation. It's obviously our intent to
use pricing to keep our margins whole as we see currency move around. So as currency stabilized over the last couple
of months here a bit, we've caught up. And I think that's one of the contributing factors in the quarter. I think we just
have to watch it quarter-by-quarter. There's some markets where we're still having to price, given currencies have
moved recently or we're still playing catch-up given how we can price in those markets. So I can't really answer the
question on a global basis. I think it's market-by-market. And I think we're in a reasonable spot in terms of covering
currency right now. The ones I highlighted, Ukraine, Russia are places where it's taking time to get that through given
the magnitude and the suddenness of those currency moves.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I had a question for you, if I could, first on North America. There was a very strong
margin performance in North America, obviously, a little softer revenue growth. So I just want to get a sense of how
the new plant would be contributing to that. Is that a major contributor in the quarter? It's a little sooner than I expected,
but certainly nice improvement in the quarter.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, actually it's not a contributor yet. As we keep talking about the fact that supply chain
reinvention will have more of a back half impact that -Salinas is one of the prime examples of that. The team has done
an excellent job of cost control and particularly overhead management, and that was the key contributor to their very
strong margin performance.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. I mean, as we're starting up the plant, we're expensing those startup costs without a lot
of volume, without a lot of leverage in those plants. So, it's actually a drag in the first half of the year and that's part of
why we expect improvement in the second half.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That's good color. Thank you. And then, just, I have, sort of, a general question
on the emerging markets and – you've had a much stronger performance this quarter than many of your competitors and
your peers and even in light of some macroeconomic challenges. So I'm just curious, is it your categories that are
performing well? Is it your own internal performance? Just any color you can give on the stronger performance there,
given in light of the challenges in many of those markets.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: We're very pleased with the performance in our emerging markets, particularly given the
significant inflationary pressures. I think our team has executed well, both in terms of jumping on the pricing
opportunity, managing that through very smart price pack architecture, as well as managing the cost line quite actively
so that we could continue to invest behind the franchises. There's no question, though, as we look at markets like
Russia and Brazil, for example, and you see the GDP trends, we're cautious about that. So we've got our eyes very
carefully focused on inventory levels, making sure sell-in and sell-out are perfectly balanced. But there's no question
that our teams have done an excellent job in this first quarter in managing our business in the face of quite a number of
challenges in those markets.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Irene, you talked about a big retailer, I assume Walmart,
offering fewer opportunities for displays and promotions, and I appreciate this retailer has talked about doing this
across the board. But do you think and maybe, maybe not, right, the cookie and cracker categories were hit by
disproportionate amounts? I'm curious if you see risk of, I guess, sort of, further promo de-loading down the road or is
this more of a one-time shift?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think it was a near-term shift, Ken. And I actually think as you look at the impact that
some of those decisions had on categories, it had a pronounced impact on the category and so I do think that the
opportunity to revisit some of those decisions and particularly in our categories which are highly impulse driven, we're
big traffic generator and we contribute to overall growth. So I do think that our teams are working through what the
appropriate merchandising strategy should be and that's an important part of our optimism about the back half.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. Thank you for that. And then one more, if I can. I want to ask you about the
specific media reports. I know you can't address them directly but I'm curious if you can help us understand how
integrated the Philadelphia brand is with the rest of your European grocery business. I'm just curious, I guess, on a
hypothetical basis, how hard would be to disassociate that brand and that brand alone from everything you're doing
over there?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, that's a very hypothetical question. I would say that as we are basically dealing with
the transformation in the European region, we are setting up a standalone cheese and grocery unit because I believe that
is the best way for us to focus uniquely on those assets as distinct from some of our other assets. So as coffee moves
into the joint venture, we'll have a snacking unit and a cheese and grocery unit, and I think that's the best way to
manage those businesses going forward.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hey. Thank you. I guess a couple of questions, Irene. Your results in China for the last
three quarters have been quite strong, up high single-digit. A lot of your peers have experienced significant inventory
de-loading because of retailer slowdowns. Can you tell us about why you're bucking the trend there? Is this an easy
comp from a year ago? Or is there something particular happening to your market share over there? And then the
second question is on coffee, I think the last time we talked about the divestiture, it would be accretive but maybe
dilutive for the first six months. Can you give us any update there? Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Look, I'm very pleased with the performance of our business in China. I think actually
we're not bucking the trend, we actually led that trend. If you recall, about a year-and-a-half ago, we ran into some real
challenges as we saw demands slowing down quite rapidly and our inventories were not keeping pace with that. So as
we talked about it, we implemented a number of management tools and measurement tools to ensure that we had a
good handle on sell-in and sell-out and that's serving us exceptionally well. So I think, in many respects, we were ahead
of that curve and we've now got that behind us.
I'm particularly pleased though with the resurgence of the biscuit business, which is a critically-important business for
us. Oreo had a very strong quarter and it's a strong contributor to the overall biscuit performance and gum just
continues to be on fire. And so net-net, I think our Chinese business – we learned a lot in the early days as we observed
what happens when consumption slows down. I think we've got a much better balance between sell-in and sell-out and
the team is executing well and I'm extremely pleased with their performance. So we're cautiously optimistic but the
continued performance of the biscuit category is important to us.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. On coffee, Rob, we don't really have an update. What we had said was, we expect in
2016 that it will be accretive. We have no reason to believe that's not true at this point and the business has performed
well. They had a very good first quarter for us and we'll wait to see really when we get the approval from the European
Commission and then that will trigger our ability to get in and really do more detailed planning with our partners.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: I guess first, just a specific question, Brian. You kind of mentioned in the Asia Pacific
that a tax incentive helped gross margin, or the phase-out of the tax incentive, I mean, can you – why is a tax incentive,
like, an operating factor?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: It was a hurt in the quarter. We had historically a tax structure in place in China that allowed
us, I mean, it basically showed up in our operating results and reduced our costs. That has been phased out in a decision
by the government. We began to phase-in to that at the end of last year and it had a relatively significant impact in the
quarter on AP's results. I would say, as I said, they did have strong gross margin improvements, they also reduced
overheads. And if you take that out, they had margins up in the quarter.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Okay. All right. And then, just in terms of – and I realize, obviously, currency is a
massive headwind to earnings, but I think, last quarter, maybe you had kind of said that in dollar terms, earnings per
share for the year would be at least at $1.70 and that included $0.30 of, at least, FX headwind but it also included the
coffee still being in the base, but you're also suggesting that between the interest – like the interest expense will be a
benefit by $0.02, currency is worse, your tax rates going now as a slight negative. So can you give us a sense as to what
you're thinking on a dollar earnings basis for the year? Is it basically unchanged also with all those things moving
around?

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: In essence we're not really – we haven't updated the outlook for EPS. What we did highlight
is the fact that interest expense will be down a bit, tax will be up a bit. I think those things would basically offset – the
change relative to currency is about a $0.03 difference from when we last updated you, so $0.30 going to $0.33.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Good morning everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: North America, as you said, seems to be expanding margins before the Salinas plant and I
didn't really understand for sure but it seems like maybe that is going – that margin expansion is actually going ahead
of schedule. Does that mean that you think that of the areas out there that North America has the greatest opportunity to
expand margins on top of where we're going from today? Is that a fair point?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I'm not sure I'd say that. I think we've highlighted the opportunity related to Salinas and how
much margin impact we would have. I mean as we've talked about and Daniel talked about at CAGNY, as we
implement lines of the future, those opportunities exist broadly across the other regions as well. They will be likely one
of the first to feel the benefit of the new supply chain capabilities and the lower cost. The team's done a nice job
managing through productivity, they've done a nice job managing through overheads and I would say they're a bit
ahead in the process.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: And one more thing, Ken, that's one of the areas that we have the greatest return on our
marketing investments and we're going to continue as our capacity comes on stream, as I mentioned a few minutes ago,
as our capacity comes on stream that's an area where we're going to continue to invest as we see the margin
progression.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. And on that point, and I just want to – you also said, in the back half of the year,
you expect to increase your advertising spend behind new product innovation. Can you talk about – I'm assuming
you're not going to tell us what new product innovation, but can you talk about region and categories where would you
see the acceleration of new product innovation?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: You're going to see it around the world. I mean one of our strong suits has been the strong
performance of our innovations and I think, as we continue to move to a region category model, we are finding that
we're able to expand our proven platforms even faster. So as you think about different innovations within our
categories, Oreo Thins in China is performing exceptionally well and you'll start to see that make its way around the
world. I talked about the belVita line extensions that are doing well and that continues to be an area of opportunity.
Within chocolate, we've got continued terrific response, continued terrific response in Bubbly and Marvellous
Creations and you'll see us expanding those.
And gum and candy, we've got a series of innovations. Trident Unwrapped, here in the U.S., is the first slab gum that
you can get in the bottle and it's off to a good start and so that you'll see that one will play an important role as well as,
in China, for example, we're actually going to launch a second line. We've got our Stride brand that has done
exceptionally well. We're now going to be launching Trident in China. So in many cases what we're talking about are
the expansion of proven platforms around the world.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great. Thank you and good morning. Just two detailed questions and then a bigger
picture question for you, Irene. Brian, on the share repurchase, I think your slide said you did $1.75 billion of share
repo in the quarter. I think your target for the year was between $1 billion and $2 billion. So would this mean that
you've done the share repurchase that you wanted to do for the full year or is there any more to go?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, we've done $1.5 billion in the quarter and what we said was we would do up to $2
billion. So I would suspect, we will do up to $2 billion. That's what we said.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Okay. So there's a little bit more to go. Fine. Marketing, Irene, I think you said, on
the quarter, it was flat on a constant currency basis. Does that mean that with FX it was down about 14%?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Directionally. I don't know quite how the currencies flow through the medium money but it
would be – and obviously, particularly in the emerging markets, it would be down a little bit. I think the important point
is that particularly given the aggressive pricing, we have really focused on making sure that we've got adequate
marketing support behind our brands, and particularly our Power Brands, and that's been a key driver of their strong
performance. The aggregate A&C that I referenced that was down slightly, again, that was primarily non-working
spending that we will continue to look for efficiency opportunities. So A&C is a key driver of the strong performance
of our Power Brands which are up about 6% in the quarter and they will continue to be the focus of our investment as
we look out to the balance of the year.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: And then, Irene, just – Kraft tie-ins uncovered a fairly massive cost savings in their
merger announcement. You do have a rather unique position in analyzing kind of what they've done. The question here
is a Mondelez question, though. In thinking about Mondelez, do you see further opportunities for larger cost savings
and higher EBIT margins after you hit the 15% to 16% target?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: David, clearly the Heinz model is something that the entire industry is watching. And we
are watching very closely just to see how that plays out. At the moment, we're quite comfortable with our approach. I
think we've got a good balance between top line and bottom line. I think the margin performance that we're delivering
both in terms of gross margin as well as operating margin is strong and where we had hoped it was going to be. And so,
I'm quite confident that the programs as we have laid them out today leave us well-positioned not only to deliver our
2015 targets, but also to deliver the targets that we've laid out into the future. So we'll keep watching and learning, but
I'm quite confident with the approach and the path that we're on.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, folks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Irene, I want to pick up on a comment you just made in response to last question, a good
balance of top line and bottom line growth. Looking at results over the last year or so, it really felt like the balance was
not really balanced at all, but shifted heavily towards priming the pumps for margin expansion with the top line
faltering as a result of whether it be executional issues, conscious decisions to exit things, et cetera. Do you think that's
a fair characterization, first? And then secondly, do you truly believe that we're getting back into a better balanced
algorithm on a go-forward? And if so, what's the enabler that's allowing you to shift more focus back to driving sales in
conjunction with margin?

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Jason, I think it's a fair characterization. I think we were very clear to say first things first.
We needed to get our gross margins on our key franchises where we wanted them to be. And then we were going to be
in a position to start to spend back, and that's exactly what we're doing. And so certainly, as we've said, there'll be more
opportunity to spend back in the back half as more things kick in on the cost side. But even now, we're already starting
to make some adjustments to our spending and making sure we're focusing it on the target areas that we think we can
get the best return and where we think we need to protect the franchises.
So I think you will see the algorithm play through in a more balanced way this year than perhaps you would have seen
last year, but we were just getting ourselves essentially staged to be able to deliver the cost profiles that we need, so
that we have the fuel to invest in our franchises.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Thank you. That's helpful. One more, then I'll pass it on. As you were going through your
prepared remarks, you listed a lot of things that should get better on a go-forward, your strategic decisions to exit
business, the headwind is more pronounced, it should get easier, you're looking for better category growth in a number
of markets as consumers adjust to price points. You're looking for better market share improvement on a go-forward.
Lots of things you're talking about in terms of anticipation of getting better. I guess my question is do you need it all to
get better to deliver your numbers or is there enough flexibility in the algorithm of go-forward to absorb a few of those
things maybe not going the right way and still hit your numbers?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think we're well-positioned. If you do the math, given our strong start to the year, we feel
quite comfortable with the guidance that we've laid out. It's a solid start. We're executing well, and there are some
things that we believe will go our way in the back half. But we continue to believe that the guidance that we have given
you is quite prudent, and we feel quite confident in the full-year projections.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.

<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Alexia.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: So just a quick question on the Enjoy Life acquisition. If I think back to when you were
still combined with Kraft, there were a number of those sort of health and wellness-oriented brands, like Back to
Nature, that never really seemed to find their place properly in the portfolio. They kind of got lost. As you think about
buying Enjoy Life and trying to figure out how to scale that, what's different this time around? And do you have an
appetite for doing more of those kinds of deals over time? Thank you very much and I'll pass it on.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, Alexia, without a doubt, better-for-you snacking is on trend. It's resonating well with
our consumers around the world, and therefore, it will continue to be an important focus area for us. We've learned a lot
from the Back to Nature experience. And, in fact, we still have an ownership of that business. As we bring Enjoy Life
into the portfolio, we've announced that we're going to keep the management separate. And I think that's an important
enabler to make sure that we get the lessons that we need, we learn the lessons, but at the same time, we're allowing the
team that has been so successful to continue to drive the business. So I think you should expect to continue to see us
building on our better-for-you snacks, both organically and through M&A, and Enjoy Life becomes an important
cornerstone of that effort.

Our final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Thank you very much. Just a bit of a follow-up to the question that Jason had, it seemed like, at
the end of last year, I think your categories were growing. I believe it was like 3.6% and you had said that 2015, it
might be a little bit lower around 3%, and then in Q1, you're putting up 4.8% in global category growth. I think you had
said you even expect to potentially see the chocolate accelerate in the back half of the year. So if we're seeing much
faster growth than you saw in 2014 in Q1 in your categories, and then you're also expecting some of those categories to
accelerate and you expect to gain share as price gaps narrow, then why wait or why not really increase your top line
organic sales growth guidance, especially if comps aren't becoming more difficult? Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Rob, I guess, the first point is over the long-term, there is no question we expect to grow at
or above category rates. As we said, though, in 2015, we are very clearly prioritizing margin expansion over revenue
growth. It reflects the challenging environment and we've got a very significant transformation agenda. And we want to
make sure that in all cases that our managers are able to make the appropriate trade-offs. So we feel good about the
revenue growth in the first quarter. We're very pleased to see that the snacks business, in particular, is up around 4.5%,
which is a trend change from the end of last year, but I think you also need to get underneath the covers a little bit on
that number.
A big driver of that 4.5% improvement was the 6.5% growth in chocolate, which is largely price-driven, as we've said,
also benefited somewhat from the Easter shift. So the good news is we are starting to see pricing coming through and
that's critical to our overall algorithm, as we've said. Our mix is still soft and we're taking some actions in the coming
months and quarters to make sure that we start to see our shares rebound. So net, we're cautiously optimistic about the
improved category growth, but we'd like to see more than the first quarter to feel confident about that.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Great. Fair enough. And then just, kind of, a quick technical question and hopefully I'm
explaining this the right way. But it looks like in the first quarter, you bought back the $1.5 billion in shares. Part of
that, you could argue, was funded by the proceeds that you got from the currency hedges of the coffee divestiture.
Without that, you might be had to raise more debt to buy back the stock or whatever – or not buy back as much. So I'm
just curious, when you announced the coffee JV, the euro was like close to $1.40. Now, current market, it's around
$1.11. So it seemed like – and I think you put this within the footnotes of the release, it seems like the cash proceeds
now you would receive on a dollar basis are less, which could potentially mean that you'd be able to buy back less
stock with those proceeds. But at the same time you're buying back more stock in Q1 off of the benefit of this currency
hedge. So it would seem like – I guess the question is, is it fair to say that maybe some of that accretion just off of the
shift in the euro has already occurred? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I mean, the simple way to think about it is, we locked in the rate last spring, and I think we
locked it in, in the range of $1.37/euro which basically protected our dollar proceeds from the transaction. So what we
did was really take that favorability from a timing standpoint and just basically cashed some of that in during the course
of the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So we locked in our proceeds – our proceeds will not go down given what's
happened to currency. That was the intent of the hedge all along was to lock that in and it locks it in – the value is in the
range of $5.5 billion.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Yeah, you just hopefully get more of a benefit upfront off of just weighted average shares
outstanding. So, it's – okay.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: It's just a source of liquidity in the short-term, yeah.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Fair enough. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
