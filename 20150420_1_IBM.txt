Martin J. Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia.
In the first quarter, we delivered $19.6 billion of revenue, $2.9 billion of operating net income, and operating EPS of
$2.91. That's up 9% from last year. It's quite a good start to the year, and obviously better than the mid-single-digit
growth we discussed 90 days ago. Our revenue was flat year to year excluding the impact of currency and the divested
businesses.
There has been a lot of focus on the implications of a stronger dollar, especially to companies like IBM where, as you
know, two-thirds of our revenue are outside the U.S., so let me address this right up front. In the first quarter, we had an
eight point impact from currency translation. This impact is even greater than 90 days ago and also from the update we
provided at the end of February. As always, we put a chart in the backup that shows the impact of currency translation
to revenue for the first quarter and the full year.
And as we shift our portfolio to higher value and divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, this also
results in an impact to our reported revenue growth. In the first quarter, it was over four points. So together, the impact
of currency and the divested businesses reduced the reported revenue growth by 12 points.
And now for the balance of the presentation, I'll focus on our revenue performance at constant currency and excluding
the impact of the divested businesses. This is the way we look at our business. And again, on that view of our business,
our revenue was flat year to year.
At our investor briefing at the end of February, we spent a lot of time on how we're transforming our business to where
we see the long-term value in enterprise IT. We have a core portfolio that's high value to our clients and high value to
us. Quite frankly, it's essential. While the market for these capabilities isn't necessarily growing, we continue to
reinvent and innovate to deliver that value.
We've also been investing in our strategic imperatives, our solutions that address the opportunities in data, cloud,
social, mobile, and security. These are high-value solutions, and we're able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the
market because our offerings are highly differentiated and because our core businesses provide the industry perspective
and deep insight into how our clients operate.
In February, we showed you the revenue across our strategic imperatives has been up 19% to 20% in each of the last
five years. And now in the first quarter, revenue in our strategic imperatives grew more than 30%, so a good start
toward another strong double-digit year. Analytics was up more than 20%, social more than 40%, and mobile more
than 4X.
Our cloud revenue was up over 75% year to year. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cloud revenue was $7.7 billion.
This is a demonstration of high growth in the higher value cloud opportunities across public, private, and hybrid.
We had a terrific performance in our cloud foundational and as-a-service offerings, and we exited the quarter with an
annual as-a-service run rate of $3.8 billion. That's up $1.5 billion in the last year. The bulk of that growth was organic,
a result of our deep insights into how our clients run their business. We've applied that insight to develop a strong point
of view on cloud; that the value in cloud is hybrid. In February, we announced a program to make hybrid cloud a reality
for the enterprise, extending our clients' control, visibility, security, and governance in a hybrid cloud environment,
similar to what they have in their private cloud and existing IT systems. And to deal with the data sprawl, we're
providing increased data portability across environments.
Now while we're investing and driving growth in our strategic imperatives, we're continuing to reinvent and bring
innovation to our core portfolio. For example, in our hardware business, we've continued to invest and innovate. That's
how we've been able to introduce the z13 mainframe that is built for the mobile economy and roll out POWER8,
optimized for data and cloud.
We've also made some visible divestitures, and we're now starting to see the results of those actions. In March, we
shipped the first z13 system, and our mainframe revenue more than doubled on MIPS shipments that were up 95%.

Power returned to growth, leveraging strong performance in our scale-out systems. All of this is driving our shift to
higher value, resulting in a higher margin and supporting targeted investments. In fact, in 2015 we're shifting billions of
dollars of spending to data, cloud, and engagement to extend our differentiation in the market.
And in the last few weeks, we've announced two initiatives, Internet of Things and Watson Health, that will further
strengthen our position as a high-value innovation company providing solutions at the intersection of business and IT.
So to sum it up, our results this quarter at the IBM level and the segment level reflect the transformation in our
business. We had continued momentum in our strategic imperatives and strong growth in hardware resulting from the
innovation we continue to deliver. The declines in the core portfolio were consistent with the second half of last year.
And our shift to higher value drove margin expansion, and we're continuing to shift investments and rebalance
resources to address the best long-term opportunities in the market.
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter. Our revenue was flat year to year, a two point improvement from our
year-to-year performance in the third and the fourth quarters. At the risk of oversimplifying this quarter's revenue
dynamics, our strategic imperatives were up over 30%, which is 10 points faster than last year. And bear in mind we
have a pretty substantial business in cloud and analytics alone, so it's on a big base. And our core businesses had a
similar trajectory to what we delivered in the second half of last year. So our substantial strategic imperatives growing
10 points faster drove two points of sequential improvement.
Looking at our margins, we had an 80 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by both portfolio actions and
strong growth in System z. To put that 80 basis points into historical context, gross margin of 49.3% is up about 1,400
basis points in the last 15 years, and you'll get that same trend from a margin perspective whether you go back three,
five, or 10 years. In terms of gross profit dollars, we generated $9.5 billion in the quarter, and that's up $2.7 billion
from 15 years ago. So this is clearly the result of our long-term relentless shift to higher value. Our pre-tax and net
margins benefited from this shift as well, but they also reflect a smaller charge for workforce rebalancing this year.
On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $2.91, up 9%. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the
quarter, which is up from last year. And as you know, there's a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much
more so than in our net income. We returned $1.2 billion through share repurchase and nearly the same amount in
dividends, and we ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash on hand, up from year end.
Now turning to the revenue by geography, we had sequential improvement in our year-to-year performance in both the
major markets and the growth markets, led by the U.S., Japan, and Latin America. Revenue in the major markets was
flat year to year. We grew in the U.S., with strong growth across our hardware portfolio and some large software deals,
so we had a good transactional performance in the U.S. Japan growth accelerated on the strength of services and
hardware. We continued to see mixed performance in Europe, with growth in the UK and declines in Germany and
France.
From a brand perspective, we had good growth in Mainframe and Power and continued momentum in outsourcing
signings, as clients look to integrate cloud and mobile capabilities into larger-scale IT environments. Overall, while our
performance in Europe decelerated, it was in line with the market.
In the growth markets, Latin America returned to double-digit growth, with broad-based growth in the region, and we
had growth in the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific growth markets again declined, though we had sequential
improvement in some key countries.
And our year-to-year performance in the BRIC countries improved sequentially, though the total BRIC number is not
reflective of the individual countries' performance. We had growth in Brazil and India and declines in Russia and
China. In China, we again had very strong growth in mainframe, but our services revenue declined as we shift our
focus away from some of the lower margin offerings. Bear in mind we do have a profitable business in China.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was flat and gross margin improved 80 basis points. As always,
I'll go into the revenue drivers in the segment discussions, but I want to spend a minute on margin dynamics. When you
look at the drivers of margin improvement we've talked about in the past, a shift to higher value has been a big

contributor. This quarter we saw the shift coming from portfolio actions and strong System z performance. Over long
periods of time, investment levels can improve margins. But given the market shifts and transformation we're driving,
investments are currently reducing margins.
Similarly, currency is typically neutral over an extended period, though our margin this quarter had a translational
impact of the stronger dollar. With all of that, we drove margin improvement of 80 basis points.
The reported operating expense and other income is down 17%. The reported decline is driven by currency, a lower
level of workforce rebalancing, and the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run
rate. I'll comment on each.
Eight points of decline was driven by currency between the translation of non-dollar spending and the hedging gains
that are reported in expense. Two points of the decline are due to the divestiture of System x. And we're continuing to
rebalance our workforce, and this quarter we took a charge of $280 million, but that's down $580 million year to year,
so with the lower level of workforce rebalancing charges drove another seven points of decline. As we continue the
transformation of our business, I'd expect a similar level of workforce rebalancing next quarter, which will impact our
year-to-year profit performance. I should also mention that last year, we had nearly a $100 million gain from the sale of
our Customer Care business in other income, which obviously wasn't replicated this year.
Within our base expense, we're continuing to shift resources and spending to areas where we see the most opportunity.
In February we talked about shifting $4 billion in spending in 2015. That's across expense, cost, and capital. And in the
first quarter, we've been executing to that plan. We've increased expense in areas like SoftLayer, Watson, and Bluemix,
just to name a few, and we'll see the benefits over the longer term.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. Combined Services revenue was $12.2 billion, which is
down 2% year to year. This quarter we closed 15 deals greater than $100 million, with about half of that for new clients
or new scope with existing clients. This reflects the strength of our offerings and our clients' confidence in our ability to
manage the most critical assets in their business. We ended the quarter with total Services backlog of $121 billion,
which was flat at constant currency and adjusting for the divestiture.
Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue. GTS outsourcing reflects the mix and timing of
contracts from the backlog. As expected, many of the larger contracts signed last year did not contribute to revenue in
the first quarter. We're continuing to see clients sign large infrastructure outsourcing deals, with embedded cloud and
mobile initiatives creating large-scale hybrid IT environments. IBM is the trusted partner for these core business
transformations because of our global capabilities and portfolio breadth. And in fact, the Forrester Research Wave
evaluation cited IBM as far and away the leading supplier in the global infrastructure outsourcing segment.
Within ITS, we had good growth in cloud, security, and business resiliency. But overall performance was impacted by
a shift away from lower value services, such as data center build-outs and OEM hardware deployments.
SoftLayer grew solid double digits this quarter, improving sequentially and building on the expanded data center
capacity. We continued our steady progress with the opening of a few new footprints in Montreal, Sydney, and
Amsterdam. Clients like ShopDirect are choosing SoftLayer as a platform to integrate cloud initiatives with their core
systems into a unified hybrid IT model. This architecture provides them with on-demand burst capability as well as the
ability to plan for and deliver consumer apparel and home goods based on real-time demand. This kind of value is only
unlocked when the emerging technologies like cloud and analytics are integrated with the large sets of customer data
enterprises already have.
Maintenance was up 2%, with the growth driven by our Multi-vendor Support Services, which is our third-party
hardware maintenance offering. The continued growth of maintenance is another demonstration of the strength of our
global reach and capabilities. As organizations expand, they want a partner who has scale and can provide global parts
and support capabilities.
GTS pre-tax margin was driven by a few elements. Currency was the biggest impact to profit year to year, and our
maintenance profit was down due to the System x divestiture. Profit margin performance also reflects the continued

investments in the business to expand our operational capabilities. The SoftLayer data center expansion I just
mentioned is one example. This gives us a highly differentiated offering in hybrid cloud, especially as it relates to data
residency requirements.
We're also increasing our sales hiring in our mobile and security practices and making investments in our resiliency
business. And we're accelerating our transition to a more significant global delivery model, which requires hiring and
training costs ahead of the expected savings. Finally, we had a year-to-year benefit from a smaller workforce
rebalancing charge in the quarter, but we haven't yet realized the bulk of savings from our recent actions.
Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion. We've had solid performance in many markets and solution areas.
In Japan, we've been consistently growing revenue and expanding margins, with solid growth in consulting and
application outsourcing. And in Europe this quarter, we returned to revenue growth.
Across all our geographies, we continued to drive strong growth in the offerings that address our strategic imperatives.
Our cloud solutions more than tripled year to year. Analytics grew double digits, and we had very good growth in
mobile and social. We're helping clients create new business models and opportunities for client engagement.
The challenge for Global Business Services is North America. While we've had solid growth in our strategic
imperatives, we're dealing with a slowdown in some of the more traditional areas. Because the U.S. is our largest
geography, its performance has a significant impact on the overall segment. But again, the U.S. has some very positive
elements in GBS. Let me give you an example of the kind of work we're doing to help clients create opportunities for
client engagement.
In February we announced a strategic partnership with AMB Sports and Entertainment to transform the fan experience
at the new Atlanta stadium. When complete, when you go to the stadium you'll be able to see in real time which
parking lots are available, which are filled, where the shortest concession lines are during the game, and have access to
statistics and information from the bleachers, all because we can combine GTS outsourcing and technology capabilities
with our GBS process and application expertise to provide a complete solution, creating new markets that didn't exist
even a few years ago.
Before wrapping up revenue, let me just remind you that we've integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business,
into GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients and to better leverage our
industry knowledge.
Looking at GBS profit, the pre-tax margin had a mix of drivers. We got some year-to-year benefit from the lower
workforce rebalancing charge and some savings yield from last year's action. We were impacted by the Customer Care
divestiture, both by the loss of operational profit and by not having a gain in this year's results. The balance of the
margin decline was driven by our cost structure and those geographies where we're not growing revenue. We're making
investments and taking actions to make our cost structure more competitive, including rebalancing to more global
delivery, use of alternate labor models, and shifting resources toward higher-value strategic imperative offerings.
Our software revenue of $5.2 billion was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter.
Key branded middleware grew 1%, driven by growth in our software-as-a-service offerings, which were up nearly
50%. Total software growth reflects a one point headwind from operating systems.
We had growth across many solution areas. Our analytics software was up and our mobile software grew at a strong
double-digit rate, led by our MobileFirst offerings. We had solid growth in our commerce solutions, where a large
proportion of the business is software-as-a-service. And our social solutions grew double digits, driven by strong
performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings.
Across software, we're continuing to drive innovation and capture growth areas, importantly building our software into
broader solution capabilities. Just this month we made two major announcements, IOT and Watson Health. These are a
continuation of what we started last year with Watson and earlier this year with analytics, commerce, and security.
There are some common threads throughout. They're all based on a unique point of view around cloud and the value of
hybrid. They all use analytics to leverage data, and they all have an industry dimension. Let me comment briefly on the

two announcements.
At the end of March, we announced the creation of an Internet of Things unit, committing $3 billion of spend over the
next four years. As part of this, we're establishing a cloud-based open platform to help clients and partners build and
deliver vertical industry IOT solutions. We've also created an IOT zone within Bluemix, our platform-as-a-service. And
we're expanding an IOT ecosystem to leverage a growing developer and entrepreneur community. This is similar to
what we've done successfully Watson, where we not only have large partners like SoftBank in Japan, but we have
hundreds of ecosystem partners you may not have heard of yet, like WayBlazer, Fluid, Red Ant, MD Buyline, Elance,
SellPoint, SparkCognition, and LifeLearn, all of whom are building commercial applications on Watson.
And then last week we announced Watson Health, which we believe will transform healthcare by bringing together the
advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson with our vast ecosystem of partners, practitioners, and researchers. There are
several aspects to the Watson Health announcement, from the creation of a Watson Health cloud, to partnerships with
leading companies, to the acquisition of two companies that extend our healthcare analytics capabilities. These are the
two most recent examples where we're partnering in new ways to drive innovation and build an ecosystem to transform
industries.
Turning to our Systems hardware segment, revenue of $1.7 billion was up 30%, as we continue to deliver innovation
across our high-end systems. This quarter System z MIPS were up 95% year to year, resulting in revenue more than
doubling. We started to ship our new z13 in the second week of March, and this was the fastest start in terms of the
number of systems we've shipped in over a decade. We also booked the highest revenue growth in any quarter in more
than a decade. The capabilities of the z13 mainframe around mobile, cloud, and real-time insights and fraud detection
are resonating well with our customers.
Let me give you a real example of what we're talking about. If you were UPS, one of the largest logistics companies in
the world, you have to manage nearly 5 billion deliveries a year, with highly seasonal changes in demand. Your
customers expect their packages to arrive on time, and they expect to schedule, manage, and track shipments anywhere,
anytime, and increasingly through their mobile devices. These mobile transactions can lead to dramatic increases in
overall traffic as customers complete transactions at will. This requires a system that can handle the growth and scale
seamlessly when activity spikes, maintaining a secure system that's always available. That's why UPS chose to upgrade
to the IBM z13 mainframe because it could meet the expanding demands of the mobile economy.
Now moving on to Power, revenue returned to growth. We not only took share in the declining UNIX market, but we're
also expanding beyond UNIX with Linux on Power and our OpenPOWER IP opportunity. We're expanding our
customer base in the entry-level Linux systems as well as with large cloud-based players. The likes of OVH, the largest
Internet hosting company in Europe, with Rackspace, and very recently, Zucchetti, a leading IT provider in Italy, have
all selected Power-based Linux systems to deliver their cloud offerings.
In addition, just over a year ago we launched the OpenPOWER Foundation to open up the power of technology and
build an ecosystem to share intellectual property. The ecosystem partners include large established players, such as
Google, NVIDIA, Mellanox, Samsung, TYAN, and Inspur. But the consortium includes other smaller and emerging
players such as SK Hynix from Korea, Teamsun from China, and Nallatech from Scotland, adding tremendous breadth
and reach. Last month the foundation unveiled more than 10 new hardware innovations that continue to make Power
technology relevant beyond the UNIX market.
And in the first quarter, we closed our first substantial intellectual property deal, a confirmation of our strategy on
Power as an open chip processor. This is an important step for the first OpenPOWER based system for China. As an
example, Zoom Netcom, a data communication and equipment supplier, will launch a system in the market later this
year, which is based on the first derivative of a POWER chip unveiled by Suzhou PowerCore. This clearly shows that
our Power strategy is working and we see momentum in the business.
Our storage hardware revenue was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement. We again saw strong growth in our
flash systems. This growth was offset by the wind-down of our OEM business and continued price weakness in
high-end disk. We see value in the storage market shifting to software. And in the first quarter, we unveiled IBM

Spectrum Storage, new storage software in support of hybrid cloud environments. The portfolio provides greater access
to data, accelerates speed to insights, and improves data economics. Our Systems hardware segment growth is a clear
result of the actions we've taken to position our systems business for the future with good adoption z13 and Power
Systems and launch of the remaining P8-based systems later this quarter, we continue to see good growth in this
business.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $2 billion of cash from operations excluding our global financing
receivables. We spent just under $1 billion in CapEx, which is flat year to year, but includes a shift in spend as we build
out our SoftLayer cloud centers. And so we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, which is up $400 million year to
year. The primary driver was lower tax payments. This was partially offset by the working capital impact associated
with the sale of our System x business and higher payments for performance-based comp which was accrued last year. I
mentioned earlier that our free cash flow generation is skewed to the back end of the year, and we continue to expect to
deliver on our full-year objectives.
Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in
dividends and $1.2 billion to buy back almost 8 million shares. At the end of March, we had 985 million shares
outstanding and $5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. With the flow-through from last year's share
reduction, our first quarter spend, and the remaining authorization, we can achieve the level of share reduction we've
assumed in our model for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, which is up from December but
down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.8 billion, with over $26 billion in support of our financing business. The
leverage in our financing business remains at 7-to-1. Our non-financing debt was $12.6 billion, which is down $3
billion from a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was essentially flat versus December and four points higher than
last year. Remember, our equity was impacted in the latter half of last year by pension, currency, and the
semiconductor manufacturing divestiture. The changes in book equity and the resulting impact on our debt-to-cap ratio
do not adequately reflect the financial flexibility we have to support our business over the long term. In fact, on the
basis of a core debt-to-EBITDA metric, we are well positioned to support our long-term growth objectives.
Finally, I want to mention that as a result of several court rulings in Spain, including one in March, we booked a $230
million pre-tax charge related to litigation involving IBM Spain retirement plans. The court ruling reverses a voluntary
employee program to join a defined contribution plan that was offered more than 20 years ago. This non-operating
charge impacted GAAP earnings and pension liability in the first quarter.
So now let me summarize the quarter and talk about our full-year expectations. We've been very clear that we're
transforming our business, and we continue to see signs that the transformation is working. In the first quarter, you see
it at the IBM level and in our segments. Our revenue trajectory improved, driven by an acceleration in our strategic
imperatives. We had strength in high-end systems as our new products address the most contemporary workloads of
data, cloud, and mobile. This strength together with our overall shift to higher value drove margin expansion for IBM.
All together, our revenue was flat year to year excluding currency and the impact of the divested businesses, and we
had mid-single-digit operating net income growth and high single-digit EPS growth as reported.
At the same time, we've made a number of bold moves that build on the momentum we started in 2014. These include
our hybrid cloud announcement in February, a set of initiatives around Internet of Things in March, and just two weeks
ago the launch of Watson Health. It was a good start to the year.
Looking forward, we'll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives while the transitions in some of
our businesses continue. We'll continue to expand our margin as we shift to higher value, and we'll continue a high
level of investment, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunity. We're deploying capital through different
models, organic R&D, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, and we're building partnerships in ecosystems not only
with the big household names but with hundreds of smaller firms. This leverages our mutual strengths and expands our
reach, all at a high level of return. And of course, we'll continue to return value to shareholders through both share
repurchase and dividends.

For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50. And at that level of profit, we
continue to expect free cash flow to be flat for the year. With these dynamics and level of performance, we'll exit 2015
a higher-value business.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts
at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from
multi-part questions.
Operator, can you please open it up for questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi, Jr.>: Yes, thank you. Martin, I was wondering if you could comment more broadly
about progress in the transformation because if I look at this very narrow-mindedly, hardware grew enormously. And if
I take out hardware, the rest of the company grew at minus 2%, which is what you've been doing the last couple of
quarters. And you commented that your strategic imperatives had actually accelerated in growth. So if we take out
hardware and the strategic imperatives are actually growing faster than before, doesn't that suggest the core businesses
outside of hardware and the strategic initiatives are actually getting worse? And when we look at the gross margin
profile of services and software, which are 90%-plus of your business, they actually got notably worse year over year,
even adjusting for the restructuring.
So I'd like to just maybe push back a little bit on – beyond what we saw in hardware, which I think is probably cyclical,
what is the progress in the transformation? And should we be thinking more like 30% growth rate in the strategic
initiatives and that's sustainable and what drives it? Or perhaps you can just help us think through that.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Toni. Thanks for the question. Boy, there's a lot in that question, so I'll try to address
it at a high level. First, in terms of the strategic imperatives continuing 30%, we're not thinking that this is a 30%
strategic imperative growth every quarter now for the rest of the year. As you know and as we've talked about in
Investor Day, they've been on a very steady 19% – 20% growth rate year to year. Now they're a pretty substantial part
of our business now. And we view that 30% growth, part of it's driven obviously by the mainframe and the Power
cycle. And we're thinking now, when we look at the rest of the year that we're counting on a continued 19% to 20%
growth rate. So our guidance is not requiring 30% growth. In fact, we expect it to return to what we've seen. Still very
strong growth, still ahead of the marketplace and still contributing a fair bit of growth to IBM, but think of it as more of
a 20% growth.
Within the quarter, as we talked about on the call on the prepared remarks, outside the strategic imperatives, we've been
talking about that business in a high single-digit decline, similar to the market that it sits in, and we saw that again in
the first quarter. So the revenue dynamics in the first quarter were really reflective of that acceleration, not a change in
the core underneath that.
A couple of other points I think that you raised, one, progress in the transformation. I think the transformation that is
underway in the marketplace and is underway in our investment levels, is underway in our focus, continues at not only
a very rapid pace, but a pace necessary for us to continue to lead in enterprise IT. So by this time last year, we had
created the Watson unit. We had identified a pretty substantial SoftLayer expansion plan that we rolled out throughout
the year.

As a couple of examples, by this time this year, as you saw in early January, we reformulated some of our business
units to more directly engage with clients the way they consume. So we have IBM Analytics, we have IBM Commerce,
we have IBM Security as examples. And so we got that done. You saw earlier, and I noted this in my prepared remarks,
we created an Internet of Things group, which will build off of what we've done in Smarter Planet and Smarter Cities.
We've gotten – just recently we've created now the IBM Healthcare unit, which will build off a couple of acquisitions
as well as partnerships with some leading names in that space.
So the transformation continues at a very rapid pace. It continues at a pace, again, necessary for us to maintain our
leadership in enterprise IT. But we're not building guidance around, again, that strategic imperative revenue continuing
to grow at 30%. We are still thinking and relying on that 20% growth rate that we've been able to deliver the last five
years.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question, please, Joy.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hi, thanks, just wanted to ask on the services side, how that came in, both in revenue and
margin, versus plan. Seemed like we're mostly done with the heavy workforce rebalancing. I heard a little bit about
China maybe shifting away from the lower-margin stuff and GBS being a little bit weak. But seems like we could
assume maybe better performance starting in 2Q. Can you maybe expand on that, Martin?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Tien-Tsin, thanks, so a couple things. One, we did see a deceleration in GTS in the
first quarter, in Global Technology Services. But keep in mind that when we had these pretty substantial transactions
and new relationships that we signed last year, those will only move into the run phase over the next few quarters,
primarily in the second half. So we would expect those to contribute a bit more, something in fact. They didn't
contribute anything in the first quarter, but they'll start to contribute in the second half in Global Technology Services.
Margins within Global Technology Services will continue to reflect both the currency environment we're in as well as
the investments we're making in order to grow out our SoftLayer platform and to shift the business to these new higher
areas.
As you noted, on our prepared remarks we talked about shifting away from lower-margin offerings in some of our Site
and Facilities business and redeploying that. That will continue. So from a Global Technology Services perspective
between the currency environment we're in and the shift we're making and the investments we're making, we're not
relying on dramatic growth or margin improvement in GTS in our guidance.
On GBS, we've got some very strong results, continued strong results in Japan and in Europe. And we continue to shift
that business as well into these new areas, where we're comfortable that the margin profile there will be consistent with
our guidance also. So two different stories between GTS and GBS. Within our guidance, we're not relying on dramatic
growth here, but we will see some improved performance coming out of the backlog because of the big deals we signed
last year
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial.
<Q - David Michael Grossman>: Thank you. Martin, I wonder if we could just look in a little more detail at the
software business. The compares get much easier in the back half of the year. And based on what you're seeing in the
business today and let's assume no material shift in the economic backdrop, would year-to-year comps be enough to
stabilize the software segment on its own, or is it possible that growth could remain negative given all the different

things you talked about in the back half of the year, even against the negative comps that they'll see versus last year, in
the back half of the year?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, David. Thanks. So software, as we talked about when we provided guidance initially
back in January, we said we still feel this way. The difference in our low end of our guidance and our high end of our
guidance really depends on the trajectory of software. What we saw in the first quarter was a one point improvement in
the trajectory, not back yet to growth, but a one point improvement in our trajectory. Now that's not all year. We
haven't seen it yet all year. But again, the difference between high and low guidance is a trajectory improvement.
Assuming we were at the same level, same trajectory we had last year, we said that's the low end of our guidance.
We do see an environment where that's the trajectory performance that we can rely on, if you will. We continue to sign
ELAs with clients. We signed 200 ELAs again in the first quarter. We continue to have an impact in our growth from
the operating system component of software. But we also saw pretty good uptake in our as-a-service offerings, which
are driving growth, up more than 50%. And at the same time, our clients with their reduced visibility continue to look
for flexibility in our offerings for those who have deployed the most.
So software again represents for us the difference between the low end and the high end of our guidance. We saw that
one quarter sequential improvement in the first, and we'll see how we go for the rest of the year.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Martin, would you be able to share with us the EPS impact from currency?
You gave us revenue, but could you tell us cents per share? And then I was curious on the free cash flow you gave us,
flat for the year. Could you talk a bit about the plus and minus factors that you've got there, CapEx, cash taxes, and so
forth and how those are going to play out?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Of course. And since currency and free cash flows are related, we'll count that as a
one-part question, Steve.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: So first on currency, we did talk. As we mentioned in the call, currency was an impact of
about eight points on the revenue line, so a bit over $1.7 billion in terms of translating the first quarter revenue back to
dollars. And we saw some significant movements not only since January, but also even since we provided an update on
the day of our Investor Day, so a pretty big impact on the revenue line.
From a profit perspective, now this is somewhat of an imprecise calculation. It is not knowable. It's an unknowable
number. We can estimate it, but we think that profit growth was impacted year to year by somewhere between $0.15
and $0.20 in the quarter. That's a pretty big impact. So obviously, that shows up in margin. And that first quarter impact
then, given where the dollar is now, you could just – again, we're working to try to – we will obviously have to manage
our way through this. But if you just took that $0.15 to $0.20 impact at the high end assuming the rates stay here, you
could see an $0.80 year-to-year impact full year on earnings from this, again, without us having done anything. So
obviously it's something we are thinking about and working on pretty hard.
In terms of free cash flow, we said relatively flat year to year in full year. The bridge items are not dissimilar, are not
going to surprise you. First, we do see cash taxes this year being better year to year than they were last year. So that's
probably about $2 billion better year to year, so that will certainly help. Reducing that on a full-year basis will be
increased CapEx investments, which we'll be making. We've talked about that already in January and we mentioned
again at Investor Day.

We also have – while we expect a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, the timing of those, the cash impact of
those is likely to lead to an increase this year relative to last year of about $0.5 billion. And then our
performance-related cash payments this year for prior-year accruals will probably be up $700 million to $800 million
as well. So outside of that, our cash performance will look a lot like our income performance, which is what you would
expect I think.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - William Charles Shope>: Okay, thanks. I have a question on the mainframe cycle. If you were only shipping the
new mainframe for the last few weeks of the quarter and you were able to double revenues, should we assume that we
still have some potential for growth to accelerate from here?
And I guess just looking at the cycle overall, can you talk about whether there are any unique financial dynamics for
this cycle that we should consider relative to the last two cycles? I guess I'm particularly focused on the dynamics
around pricing, where it looks like you actually had an ASP tailwind relative to MIPS growth this quarter, and also and
the pull-through for Software and Services on this new platform. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Bill, a few things on the mainframe. So first, we had a terrific first quarter in the
mainframe, but I think it's important to understand two elements of this. First, this is what we expected our mainframe
performance to be. This was not a surprise to us. And so I don't think that you should take away from either our
prepared remarks or even the questions that we think we did better than we would have. We think this was the
mainframe performance we expected, very clearly.
I think that the elements of the mainframe, though, that are most widely misunderstood by many who follow us are
twofold, and this has to do with the timing of what you're seeing in the quarter. One, I don't think the mainframe is fully
appreciated for the essential nature of the work it does, for the impact that our clients feel from an upgraded mainframe,
and for the kinds of enterprise-class scalable workloads that it drives. So we used the example of UPS on the call, 5
billion packages they have to deliver on time. And again, they can't be down. So one, I think there's an
under-appreciation for the mainframe and its value to our clients.
Two, I think there is a huge difference obviously between how consumer technology works and how enterprise
technology works. And so when you read that we were shipping the mainframe since March, remember, we've been
having the discussions with about 60 of our clients for months and months and months because they help us build and
design this for their needs in those enterprise spaces. But the January announcement is when we start building the value
propositions for our clients. And so the work for the sales teams begin in January.
The fact that it was only shipped in March really only means that our supply chain, our fulfillment teams did a
phenomenal job in a relatively short period of time to fulfill the demand that we saw within the quarter. But from an
enterprise buying cycle, I think you really do have to understand that these are built with our clients. We discussed the
value prop with our clients before that March date. That's not as critical a date as you might think, again, if you're
thinking about it from a consumer side.
From a first quarter perspective, as I mentioned, we were very pleased with how it did, but it didn't surprise us. And as
we've talked about in the past, the second quarter tends to be the largest quarter for mainframe, and we still see that in
this quarter as well. So we had a very good quarter in the first. We would expect that the mainframe will be larger in
the second than it was in the first, but keep in mind, now you're getting to compare issues. So from a dollar perspective,
it will be larger, but we also had a great mainframe quarter second quarter last year. So the growth year to year will
look a lot different than the first quarter, but the absolute number in the second will be higher. We would expect that in
the first half, we'll probably finish at solid 50% growth in the mainframe between the first two quarters, which is very
typical, very traditional in terms of the mainframe.

From a margin perspective, as you noted, with MIPS only going up 95%, I say only with a smirk, with MIPS going up
95% and with revenue up 130% on a constant currency basis, yes, there is obviously a lot of value that our clients see
here and a lot of value for the IBM Corporation. So we are delighted with how well the mainframe did, but it wasn't a
surprise to us. It's a powerful, powerful platform for the world's business.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you, Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Martin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how customers are feeling in the broad
IT spending environment. It seems like financials in the first quarter are actually very strong and a huge FX impact. So
I'm just curious how customers are feeling and how we should think about general seasonality throughout the year.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: For us, Brian, I think a couple things. One, we have not seen a dramatic shift in trajectory
across a lot of our sectors. Financial services sector is obviously one where the mainframe plays a pretty vital role in
how the world's banks run and when you get a new mainframe, particularly one that's so relevant to them shifting their
businesses into mobile, particularly one where counter-fraud is such an important part of what they have to think about
every day. And again, you need scalability, you need reliability, you have to run all the time. That new mainframe has a
particular emphasis within the financial services sector, and therefore we did see an improvement in the trajectory in
financial services.
But across the rest, I would say not a dramatic shift in what we saw in the first quarter. Again, the common thread that
we're seeing is not sector by sector, other than what I pointed out in the financial services. The common thread here is
the relevance of our offerings and the strategic imperatives where the need for mobility, the need for social ways of
engaging either your employee base or your client base, and the need for really powerful scalable systems drove the
day here in the first quarter with 30% growth year to year relative to what had been a 20% growing business.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Brian. Joy, can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, Martin. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to cash flow, if I could.
In your past comments, you've talked about this year being flat but previously called out a number of one-time items,
including pensions. And I was just wondering if you could comment directionally how we should be envisioning cash
flow in 2016 relative to 2015. It seems like some of the items should be one-time in nature, but the tax payments,
restructuring, et cetera, and both directionally and relative to the percent that you normally provide versus net income.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, so a few things, Keith. One, as we said a number of times, cash flow we expect to be
flat in 2015 relative to 2014. And relative to 2014, what we showed in Investor Day were the drivers of our realization
in 2014 were really twofold. One, we had a very high cash tax rate last year relative to net income. And as I mentioned
in a prior answer, we don't see that same level of headwind this year. So on a realization basis, taxes, cash taxes will not
be an impact to 2015. I'll come back to 2016 in a moment.
And then also last year, we had a pretty substantial gain, which obviously showed up as cash in the IBM Corporation,
but it showed up on the investing line, not on the free cash flow line, so that drove realization down about 20 points
from the – say, if we set ourselves a high 90%. So this year, as I mentioned, we don't see cash taxes as a primary
headwind, and we do expect to improve realization this year pretty dramatically. I did talk about a little bit on a
full-year basis about some of the differences in cash flows this year, including performance-related payments and
workforce rebalancing payments and increased CapEx within 2015, but still an improvement in our realization rate in

2015.
Now when we get to 2016, I think a few things happen. One, we again will have I think a cash tax headwind. Now this
is at a planning level, and we're nine months away from the start of the year, which means we're 21 months away from
figuring out the settlement of audits and things, so we've got a long way to go. But right now we would envision a cash
tax headwind again in 2016 that we can see.
From a pension perspective, we're well funded in our pensions, by the way. We have a closed pension, and we've been
moving our asset side of our portfolio to more mimic the liability side, which is we've been moving to more debt
instruments within that and allocating to more interest rate securities. So we don't have as much risk in the portfolio and
our U.S. pension remains very well funded, and our global pensions are in a pretty good funding position. So at this
point we don't see a lot of impact from pensions.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi, thanks, Martin. I was hoping you could walk through your expectations for profitability
as we move through the year. It looks like from a profitability perspective, on a year-over-year basis services and
software declined a bit, but hardware was a bit more profitable. Hoping you could walk us through the rest of the year.
Thanks
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, I'll talk about how we see the rest of the year playing out, first from a full-year
perspective, then I'll bring it back to the near term and what we see coming in the second quarter. So first, as I
mentioned earlier, our low end of guidance assumes essentially that software doesn't improve for the rest of the year.
And as we already saw, the first quarter was just a bit ahead of that. So the high end of guidance assumes that we see a
slight trajectory improvement in our software business, back to essentially flat. In the near term, so that's the difference
between high and low.
The near term, from a profitability perspective we have a fairly typical skew in our pre-tax profit from first to second
quarter. It's fairly typical. Now as we transform our business, as we continue to make investments, as we continue to
see growth in our strategic imperatives business, we will get, as I mentioned, another good quarter out of the
mainframe. But as we transform that business, I would expect to see a fairly typical skew from first to second quarter
on a pre-tax profit basis.
Now on a year-to-year basis, we have dynamics within our workforce rebalancing charges from prior years that drive
the growth rates to look odd. So with essentially roughly the same level of workforce rebalancing from first quarter to
second quarter this year, we take that out of the equation therefore on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But the transformation
of our business and the cycle we're in, in mainframe I think probably gets us to a more typical, if you will, sequential
improvement of about $1 billion of pre-tax profit quarter to quarter. And again, on a full-year basis, we see the
difference in the high end and the low end as being that software trajectory.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Sherri. Let's go to the next question, please.

And can you help us think through how the expense levels will change with FX relative to the revenue levels as we go
through the year? This quarter they were in pretty good alignment, but you also saw pretty strong Americas revenue.
So, was just wondering what the puts and takes there could be?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: I'd say a few things. So we did not see a dramatic – we didn't see any improvement, for
instance, in Asia-Pacific. So we're continuing to see a slow spending environment in A-P, and I think our performance
there mimics what we're seeing in the marketplace in general. Japan spending continues to go quite well and we have
continued to perform, but it's more than just the environment in Japan. The team has done a terrific job of maintaining
growth now well into their third year. And so it's the strength of our offerings that are underpinned by a reasonable
spending environment within Japan.
In other places, as we noted on the call, North America, U.S. did quite well, and we see a spending environment there
that is supportive of the investments we're making and the way we're shifting the business. So in total with some
exceptions where we see weak spending environments in A-P, we see a reasonable environment.
Now from an expense perspective, our focus is obviously on continuing to drive those investment levels. And as we
talked about in the prepared remarks, outside of the translation impact of currency and outside of the divested content,
our expending was essentially flat year to year, and so on an E-to-R basis was about the same. So we will continue to
shift within that our spending toward these strategic imperatives. And so when you look at 30% growth, and again, we
don't expect it to stay at 30%, but when you look at 30% growth, that's supported by a pretty dramatic shift of spending
within IBM. And at the same time that funding, that spending, is coming from those core businesses. So some of what
you're seeing in that core business decline is that engineered shift toward the strategic imperatives.

understand what's going on there. It looks like both GBS and GTS profitability was down year over year. And I know
the signings have a lot of volatility around it, but the rate of $10 billion seems to be at multiyear lows. How should we
think about what's going on in services? Is it mostly the shift to the strategic imperatives and how should we think
about that? Because if it's the shift, we would expect profitability to actually be up year over year, or maybe it's FX.
Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, so a few things. And you're right, FX is obviously playing a role here in how some
of those services profits translate back to U.S. dollars. But in a broader context, signings growth in the first quarter,
which is there plenty of opportunity out there, there certainly is. We see a lot of opportunity for continued growth in
our outsourcing business, double-digit growth in fact across all of our outsourcing businesses and signings. And the
backlog in total was essentially flat year to year. Obviously, there's a currency impact here and a divestiture impact, but
backlog in total was essentially flat.
What we see in services is really a couple of things. One, within Global Technology Services, we continue to invest
pretty heavily, as I noted earlier, in order to drive that SoftLayer platform for instance. We continue to invest to build
out that infrastructure-as-a-service capability, where we're seeing very good growth in our SoftLayer platform and very
good growth across cloud. In the GBS business, we're seeing very good performance in Japan. We got a return to
growth in Europe, which was quite encouraging, and there are some areas of strength in other parts of those emerging
markets. Latin America did quite well, doing well in the Middle East and Africa.
What we're seeing is a slowdown that's driving the revenue line in the U.S. Now some of that is driven by consulting,
but quite frankly now we did grow our signings again in the U.S. So we're building, if you will, a backlog that will turn
into revenue in the future. But right now we're dealing with a slowdown in our U.S. consulting business. The mix of
our business in GBS is pretty consistent around the world. They have a very high mix of the strategic imperatives. And

with within that mix, the growth is very high. So we're comfortable that we're making the shift in GBS. We obviously
have, as I noted, some work to do in our U.S. business, but we do see some pretty good growth and pretty good
performance in other parts of the world in GBS.
Martin J. Schroeter
So I wanted to wrap up the call just with a few points and again to thank you for joining this afternoon. Our first quarter
performance we view as another proof point that the strategy is right. The actions we're taking to reinvent our
businesses, the innovation we're delivering in our hardware business, in our software business, and in our services
businesses is starting to pay off. And the investments and the focus on those solution areas are all contributing to the
very strong growth we saw in the strategic imperatives. So as we move through the year, we'll continue the
transformation, we'll continue to make these investments and to build those ecosystems that we talked about. It
certainly takes some time, but certainly this was a very good start to the year. So thanks for joining.
