Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As our first year as an independent company,
2013 certainly was an important year for AbbVie, one in which we set a strong foundation for the future. We're pleased
with our performance, and as we look back over the year, we believe we exceeded expectations on all the goals we
established for the organization. We completed a seamless transition to operating as an independent company.
We drove continued strong growth of HUMIRA and several other key products in our portfolio. We delivered
operational efficiencies including improvements in gross margin. We made notable progress advancing our pipeline
including our late-stage HCV program, as well as promising assets in our oncology portfolio. We expanded our
pipeline with the addition of several novel assets, and we exceeded our financial commitments to shareholders,
generating strong financial results.
As detailed in our earnings release, we delivered 3% global operational sales growth in 2013 despite losing nearly $1.1
billion in revenue due to generic competition in our lipid franchise. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise, sales in
2013 increased nearly 10% on an operational basis, and we exceeded our original EPS guidance range with full-year
2013 adjusted earnings per share of $3.14, demonstrating the strength of our underlying business.
Our performance was led by HUMIRA where we added more than $1 billion in sales growth again in 2013 with more
than 15% operational growth for the year, and the dynamics are favorable for continued strong growth from HUMIRA
again in 2014. This year, we expect to deliver low double-digit global operational growth for the brand.
We also saw a strong performance from several other products in 2013 including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis and
Duodopa. We expect that each of these products, which hold leadership positions in their respective markets, will
remain important contributors to our performance in the coming year.
As we look forward to the future, one of the biggest priorities we have as a company is restoring our legacy of strong
growth in 2015 and beyond. To position ourselves to achieve this objective, we view 2014 as a year of investment in
our pipeline, our leading brands, and our upcoming product launches. This includes preparation for the launch of our
interferon-free HCV combination, which we now expect to occur in the U.S. in 2014.
From a revenue perspective, as we've said before, 2014 is a year of transition as we absorb the remaining impact from
the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise. We expect growth from our key brands to roughly offset the decline in
lipids, and at this point, we have not included any potential revenue from our U.S. HCV launch in our 2014 revenue
forecast. As a result of all of these dynamics, we expect adjusted 2014 EPS of $3.00 to $3.10. Bill will provide more
specific details regarding our planning assumptions for 2014 during his remarks.
We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity, as we offer both a strong return to shareholders along with
promising pipeline prospects. As you know, our business generates significant cash flow and we remain committed to
returning cash to shareholders. Our primary means to do so will continue to be our strong dividend. We recognize the
importance of a growing dividend to our shareholders despite a flat top-line and investment trends in 2014. As a result,
upon final Board approval, we expect a 5% increase in our quarterly common dividend beginning with the dividend
payable in May 2014.

We've also utilized our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. In 2013,
we added promising assets to our mid-stage pipeline. We view licensing and partnering as an important component of
our R&D strategy and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline in 2014 and in the coming years.
As a bio-pharmaceutical company, pipeline advancement is an important component to our long-term success. We
place a tremendous amount of organizational focus in this area, and over the past year, we've achieved a number of
important development milestones. Certainly one of the more significant and near-term pipeline opportunities is our
interferon-free HCV combination.
AbbVie's multi-national HCV program is the largest all-oral interferon-free clinical program in Genotype 1 patients
conducted to date. Genotype 1 is by far the most prevalent genotype in the developed world, and is roughly evenly
distributed between genotype 1a and genotype 1b in the G7 markets.
Our Phase 3 program includes more than 2300 Genotype 1 patients and clinical sites in more than 25 countries around
the world. The comprehensive program was designed to characterize the performance of AbbVie's therapy across
Genotype 1 populations. And importantly, because we have conducted independent studies in specific patient
populations, we will be able to characterize performance in each patient type with a very high degree of competence
and certainty.
Our goal is to maximum SVR rates across various patient types; from naïve patients to the most difficult to treat, such
as non-responders to interferon-based therapy, or patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. The large body of
data we've collected and presented thus far certainly supports our objective and demonstrates that we have a very
compelling offering for patients and for physicians.
We've now disclosed top-line results from all six of our registrational studies. Late last year, we announced results from
our two placebo-controlled studies, the SAPPHIRE trials, which showed that in both naïve and treatment-experienced
patients our therapy plus ribavirin produced very high SVR rates of 96%.
Our combination produced consistent and virtually identical efficacy results across both naïve and experienced patients
and there were no differences observed between genotype 1a and genotype 1b patients. Additionally, the therapy was
well tolerated with discontinuations due to adverse events reported in only 1% of patients receiving the combination.
This morning, we reported top-line results from the four remaining Phase 3 trials. Our 380-patient TURQUOISE-II
study is the only dedicated trial of an all-oral therapy in the difficult to treat cirrhotic patient population. Results from
the trial showed that 92% of the patients treated with our combination for 12 weeks achieved SVR12, and 96% of the
patients treated for 24 weeks also achieved SVR12. Results from the PEARL-II study showed that 100% of Genotype 1
experienced patients treated with our combination without ribavirin achieved SVR12. Results from the PEARL-III trial
showed that 99% of Genotype 1b naïve patients treated with our combination, with or without ribavirin, achieved
SVR12.
We're particularly pleased with the high level of efficacy demonstrated in the genotype 1b population, which represents
roughly half of the Genotype 1 patients in the G7 markets. The PEARL-IV study showed that even the more difficult to
treat Genotype 1 patients, 97% of patients treated with our therapy and ribavirin, achieved SVR12, and 90% of the
patients in the ribavirin-free arm achieved SVR12. So, these data clearly demonstrate that our interferon-free offering
provides a very high level of efficacy across Genotype 1 patients, with ribavirin providing additional benefit in some
patients.
As we look at the HCV market and we consider which patients will likely be treated in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we
believe the most advanced patients, those with fibrosis, cirrhosis, and patients who have previously failed treatment
will be treated first. Given that these patients tend to be more difficult to treat, we believe most physicians will likely
continue to use ribavirin to optimize the likelihood of cure.
Based on the high levels of efficacy demonstrated by our therapy in these tougher to treat patients, we believe we're
very well positioned for success in this market. And while our initial combination represents a simple therapy, we're
working to further simplify our initial HCV combination with efforts underway to reduce the number of pills through

co-formulation of all the components into a once-daily combination. We've begun the necessary pharmacokinetic
studies and are working to advance this enhancement.
We also continue to make good progress with our HCV program in Japan where we recently started Phase III
development. Japan represents the second-largest HCV market globally and we believe we're well positioned relative to
competitive offerings. Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we've advanced our 12-week two-DAA
ribavirin-free treatment in Japan. As a result, we expect to have a two-pill once-a-day combination for this market.
We'll present data from our Phase II program later this spring and expect to submit our regulatory application in Japan
in 2015.
We believe the HCV market will remain very large and attractive for many, many years to come. To that end we've
recently begun a Phase II study of our next-generation HCV program, which includes a potent protease inhibitor,
ABT-493, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT-530. It's our goal with our next-generation program to bring to market a
ribavirin-free once-daily pan-genotypic combination. In pre-clinical studies, our next-generation assets have shown
pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. They also support once-daily dosing without
ritonavir as well as the ability to co-formulate. We'll present data from these promising assets later this year.
While HCV represents a significant and an important opportunity, our pipeline includes many other promising assets.
As we evaluate our pipeline prospects including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline
is the most robust it has ever been. We're particularly enthused about our late-stage pipeline where we currently have
10 programs in Phase III development or in for registration. And we're on the cusp of transitioning several additional
programs into late-stage trials.
Our late-stage oncology pipeline includes several mid and late-stage assets in development for more than a dozen
different cancer types. Earlier this month, we entered Phase III development for two internally discovered assets in our
oncology pipeline, ABT-199 and ABT-888.
In collaboration with our partner, we recently began a Phase III comparative combination study of ABT-199 in relapsed
refractory CLL patients. We view ABT-199 as an exciting compound within our pipeline and we're working quickly to
advance this asset. In addition to our vanguard indication of CLL, we're exploring ABT-199 in a number of different
hematological malignancies, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and AML.
Following encouraging efficacy results from the I-SPY2 clinical trial, we have recently started a Phase III study of our
PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, for neoadjuvant treatment of triple-negative breast. We'll learn much more about the
efficacy and utility of ABT-888 across a variety of cancer types this year as our ongoing studies complete. We expect
to start registrational studies in other indications in 2014 as well.
Alemtuzumab is currently in Phase III development for multiple myeloma in collaboration with our development
partner. Data to date have shown promising efficacy in terms of tumor responses and delay of disease progression. Two
Phase III studies are ongoing with results expected in early 2015.
Daclizumab is our biologic in development for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Results from the second
registrational study will read out in mid-2014, supporting regulatory submission for daclizumab later this year. Despite
advances in the MS category, there continues to be a significant need for safe high-efficacy agents, and we believe
daclizumab has the potential to deliver the right balance of high efficacy and manageable safety profile and a high level
of patient compliance.
Elagolix is our compound in late-stage development for the treatment of endometriosis. Elagolix has a unique profile
with the potential to provide symptom relief and reduction while avoiding adverse effects that can sometimes be
associated with current treatments. We'll see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis in the
second half of 2014. The Phase IIb study in uterine fibroids, which we initiated last year, also continues to progress
well.
Atrasentan is our internally discovered compound in development for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. In 2013,
we initiated a large global Phase III registrational study. This trial, which will serve as a single global registrational

trial, is expected to complete in 2017.
We also have two new HUMIRA indications currently in late-stage trials and we have Duodopa currently under
regulatory review. And in addition to the late-stage programs I just outlined, we also have numerous promising
mid-stage programs across therapeutic areas in which we focus on including several in immunology where we have
two JAK1 programs and several biologics in development.
We've been pleased with our pipeline progress over the past year and we look forward to a number of important
pipeline milestones in the year ahead. This includes numerous Phase III initiations, data readouts from multiple
programs across our pipeline, the submission of regulatory applications for two major late-stage programs, and
potential product approvals.
So, in closing, we've had a very successful first year. We feel good about the high level of execution on our strategic
priorities; we're focused on continuing to drive with leading performance with our flagship product HUMIRA, as well
as other products in our specialty-focused portfolio; and we continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline,
which includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need.
As we look forward to 2014, we're focusing on maintaining our momentum while investing appropriately to ensure a
successful future. We've set an excellent foundation for the company in order to deliver strong growth in 2015 and
beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the fourth quarter and 2014. Bill?
William J. Chase
Thank you, Rick. This morning, I'll start with an overview of our fourth quarter performance and then I'll provide our
outlook for 2014. We delivered a strong fourth quarter capping off a year of excellent performance. Fourth quarter
adjusted EPS was $0.82 excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items. This exceeded our
outlook for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.70.
Total sales in the fourth quarter exceeded $5.1 billion, ahead of our outlook. Sales decreased 1.1% on an operational
basis, which excludes an unfavorable 0.7% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise due
to loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 7.9% on an operational basis.
Fourth quarter growth was led by HUMIRA, which had global sales of more than $3 billion, up 13.4%. We continue to
see strong growth in the underlying markets and a positive impact from the global launch of the UC indications, which
continues to progress very well. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 18.1%, reflecting continued market expansion as
well as share gains particularly in the gastro segment.
Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 8% on an operational basis. As we forecasted in October, international growth
was somewhat lower in the quarter due to the impact of tender timing, which benefited growth in the third quarter.
International growth is being driven by continued uptake of new indications, share gains, and double-digit in most
countries.
For the full year, international HUMIRA sales increased nearly 12% on an operational basis. Global HUMIRA sales for
2013 were $10.7 billion, up roughly 15% exceeding our original forecast for the year. As Rick mentioned, in 2014, we
expect global HUMIRA sales to grow at a low double-digit pace excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
AndroGel sales were $289 million in the fourth quarter, down versus the prior year, reflecting continued moderation of
market growth and other dynamics. AndroGel remains the testosterone replacement market-leader with more than 60%
market share and achieved share gains during the second half of 2013. In 2014, we expect AndroGel to be flat to
somewhat down as market conditions stabilize and we lap the impacts of rebating actions and account losses in early
2013.
As expected, all of the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. Sales of Niaspan were
$31 million and TriCor/TRILIPIX sales were $29 million, both down significantly versus the fourth quarter of 2012.
As forecasted, the decline in the lipid franchise was most pronounced in the fourth quarter, and in 2014, we expect

these trends to continue.
Global Lupron sales were $209 million in the quarter, roughly flat on an operational basis. For the full-year 2013,
Lupron sales were $785 million. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the
market. In 2014, we expect Lupron sales to be down modestly from 2013.
U.S. sales of Synthroid were $189 million in the quarter, up 12.8% with full-year sales up roughly 13%. Synthroid
maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership, despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. In
2014, we expect to see similar growth trends for Synthroid.
U.S. Creon sales were $115 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.3%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the
pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the majority of new prescription starts. We expect high
single-digit sales growth for Creon in 2014.
Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 5.7% on an operational basis this quarter.
Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. In 2014, we expect continued double-digit
growth for Duodopa, and in the U.S., we expect a regulatory decision on our filing in the first half of this year.
Moving on to our fourth quarter P&L profile, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 77.1%, excluding intangible
amortization and other specified items. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter and reflected operational
efficiencies and product mix across our portfolio, including HUMIRA.
Adjusted SG&A was 26.5% of sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting heightened investment in our growth brands. And
adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, driven by increased funding of our emerging mid and late-stage pipeline and the
continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Net interest expense was $68 million, and the adjusted tax rate
was 22.2% in the fourth quarter.
Now, I'd like to discuss our outlook for 2014 and specifically how we've constructed our plan for the year. As Rick
mentioned, we are now expecting a U.S. approval for our HCV regimen in 2014. As you know, we've seen these types
of products launched quickly, generating significant sales early in the launch.
Since we cannot yet forecast the specific date of our approval, our guidance for 2014 excludes any revenue benefit
associated with the upcoming HCV launch. We have, however, included the appropriate level of investment to launch
the brand, reflected in higher SG&A expense this year. We'll keep you apprised our program status as the year
progresses.
In the meantime, you should model the year as follows. We expect the total company 2014 sales of approximately $19
billion, reflecting growth from our key marketed products, offsetting the remaining decline in lipids from generic
competition.
Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of roughly 1% for the full year. We're
committed to improving our gross margin ratio in 2014 despite the loss of high-margin lipid sales. As a result, we are
forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 79% for the year, reflecting actions we've taken to further
improve our margin profile.
As we've noted, we currently have a record number of Phase III programs in active development and are on the cusp of
transitioning additional programs in 2014. We have a number of exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV and
immunology, and other areas that warrant investment. As a result, we expect R&D expense to be around 16% of sales,
reflecting an increase in R&D spending over the prior year.
We also expect to see an increase in SG&A as we invest in our key brands, including HUMIRA, where we're pursuing
opportunities to further increase penetration rates across syndications and drive both disease and brand awareness. And
as I noted, with our U.S. HCV launch in 2014, we'll be making the appropriate investments this year to maximize the
potential for this important program. Therefore, we expect SG&A expense to approach 28% of sales in 2014, an
increase over the 2013 profile.

We are forecasting net interest expense of about $275 million for the full year and we continue to expect an adjusted
tax rate of approximately 22% in 2014. Given this profile, we are forecasting an adjusted earnings per share guidance
range of $3.00 to $3.10. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the year excludes $0.37 per share primarily
related to noncash amortization expense and ongoing separation costs.
Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.67 to $0.69. This
excludes roughly $0.08 of specified items and non-cash amortization, resulting in a first quarter EPS in the range of
$0.59 to $0.61 on a GAAP basis. Our first quarter outlook reflects a flat top-line including roughly 1% negative
exchange. We expect a gross margin ratio somewhat in line with our full-year guidance, and we expect R&D and
SG&A as a percentage of sales to be higher than our full-year outlook, consistent with historic quarterly trends.
So, as we look back, we are very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first year as an independent company. We
delivered on our commitments and exceeded our original forecast for earnings per share. Looking forward, 2014 will
be an exciting year with numerous data milestones, key product submissions, and continued execution across the
organization. The investments we're making this year are expected to drive meaningful growth in 2015 and beyond.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo
Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Can you all hear me?
<A - Larry Peepo>: We can.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Can you hear me? Okay, great. Rick, congratulations on the end of your first year as an
independent company. Question is regarding the whole hep-C marketplace. I mean, now we've seen all of your data,
we've seen all of Gilead's Phase III data, we've also seen the initial launch of Sovaldi, which is clearly very, very
strong.
And then I'm just wondering if you can sort of opine with us how you see the market shaping up? And just in terms of –
I don't know if you wanted to provide any of your views in terms of market share differences, but how do you see the
market share plane hop between these two very – these two different regimens?
And then secondly, also, if you could also talk about HUMIRA, and if you could confirm some of the pending
long-dated patents on HUMIRA and what that might mean longer term for biosimilar competition? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Well, first, Jami, thank you for the congratulations. Yes, we feel good about the
first year, and so now we're off to the second year and it's what have you done for me lately, right?
<Q - Jami Rubin>: That's right.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: So, we'll have to get off to a good start in 2014, which is exactly what we plan on doing.
As far as the launch that we've seen so far and the ramp in the HCV market with the Gilead product, I think it's going as
we would have expected it. This is a market, as Bill pointed out, that you get very rapid uptake. It'll be important to see
how much of the uptake is in Genotype 2 and 3 patients and how much of it is the impact of the existing PIs that are in
the market today.

And so, it doesn't surprise me at all, but it doesn't take a lot of patients to get that level of sales with these kinds of
products, and it's one of the reasons why, one, we're excited about the market; and two, ultimately, it's one of the
reasons why we chose not to build into our forecast the launch because even a couple of months' difference can have a
substantial impact on the performance of the business.
As far as how we'll compete in the marketplace, you've seen all of our data; you've seen the competitive data. We feel
very good about the data. As we look as this market, as I indicated in my comments, and the dynamics of the patients
that are likely to be treated first, and the other capabilities that you're going to need to have to be successful in this
market from a commercial standpoint, from a market access standpoint around the world, I think we're very well
positioned.
And as I said, if I look at the profile of our therapy, if I just go through each of the category of patients, you look at our
cirrhotic data, it's the only trial that's ever been done in dedicated cirrhotic patients, clearly unprecedented results
compared to standard of care, and I think we're very pleased with what we saw out of that trial for cirrhotic patients.
If you look at our experience data, 96% SVR12s. When I look at that in comparison with the published ION-2 data
with ribavirin, it matches up very nicely against that, at 96.3% or 96.4%. If I look at genotype 1b naïves, 99% without
ribavirin. If I look at genotype 1b experienced, without ribavirin 100%. And 1bs represent 50% of the total population
that we'll be going after, it's hard to beat 99% and 100%, so we obviously feel very good about that. And we look at
genotype 1as, with ribavirin at 97%, highly tolerable therapy, very low adverse event rates.
We feel good about our ability to stack up against anything that we've seen out there and be able to compete very
effectively against that. It's a big market. It's a market I think that very clearly, if you look at payers, if you look at
health systems around the world, if you talk to physicians and patients, they want alternatives, especially alternatives
that perform at this level. And so, I think we'll do very, very well. And what we're focusing on now is getting our
submission in, getting the product approved and launching the product aggressively in the marketplace.
Oh, I'm sorry. So, HUMIRA. As far as the patents are concerned, we haven't disclosed publicly a lot of the patent data.
We've obviously aggressively worked to not only take the existing patent portfolio that we have, which we have a fairly
large patent portfolio around process patents, formulation patents, some method patents, but we have a very large
number of applications, in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred. Many of those will issue. We believe that those
are important patents, and certainly, we will make sure that we enforce any patents that we have in this area. And it's
one of the lines of defense that we have put in place, and I think we feel pretty good about it. But we're not prepared to
give you a lot of specifics on any individual patents at this point.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jami. Next question, please?
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions; I had a couple for you. So, just first off, on the guidance,
assuming obviously you're not including any revenues in the guidance, can we just safely assume, if you do get
revenues that flow through in 2014 that would essentially be upside for the earnings guidance as well?
Secondly, I wonder if you can just help us think about your SG&A phasing through the year. When would you
anticipate that we start to see the load from the hep-C cost phasing in the SG&A? Also, just in terms of a fixed-dose
combination on the current 3D regimen, are you assuming you'll have to do a full Phase III there, or would your
development plan on that just be more like a bridging study? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Maybe I'll take the guidance question and then, Bill, you can talk about the gating
and the SG&A. And we'll talk – Scott, you can talk about the fixed-dose combination. So, maybe – let's walk through
and give you a little perspective on the timing. As I think you know, we have been given breakthrough therapy status

for this product and we expect to get priority review. With priority review, we will have an eight-month PDUFA clock.
And so, we know the outer limits of when approval could occur based on when we're estimating that we'll submit to the
agency. But, as we've looked at priority reviews, we've seen priority reviews that are as short as four-and-a-half months
and we've seen some that have gone all the way out to eight months.
And so, there's this window that we're operating in that's just not clear to us at this point, where we will be in that
window. So, our goal is to get the submission in as rapidly as possible and then start to work with the agency on
answering any questions that they have. As we get closer through that review process, we will begin to get more clarity
as to the timing of that, when we would get that approval. And we're obviously prepared to be able to launch as soon as
we gain approval of the product. So, depending upon where that were to occur, if it was appropriate to adjust a
quarterly guidance, we would go ahead and make that adjustment during that quarter. So, we'll just have to see when
we hit in that window that I just described to you. So, Bill, why don't you cover the SG&A?
<A - William J. Chase>: Yes. Jeff, on SG&A, obviously we're going to be doing everything we can to make sure that
this opportunity – we live up to the opportunity that we have here. We're investing right now, but that said, the
investment will grow over the course of the year and we'll see on a relative basis more investment in the back half of
the year than the first half.
<A - Scott Brun, M.D.>: Jeff, it's Scott Brun. On our fixed-dose combination which takes all three of our direct-acting
antivirals and co-formulate them into a once-daily presentation, we've got a prototype formulation that has been
performing very nicely with our pharmacokinetic assessments in humans, and right now, we're moving forward very
aggressively with the program. We're in discussions with regulatory agencies with regard to exactly what the program
will take, and that's all I want to say about that right now.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks very much, and congratulations.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jeff. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Oh, thank you. I have two questions. Of the 2014 guidance for HUMIRA of low
double-digits, can you dissect that by geography, so what we should be looking for in the U.S. and O.U.S.? And in the
U.S., how much of that might be from price and how much might be from volume? And secondly, for many reasons,
your P&L in 2014 is quite unusual. But [audio gap] (39:47 – 39:52)
<A - Larry Peepo>: I think we lost you, Steve. Why don't we start with Bill? Why don't you go ahead and--
<A - William J. Chase>: I'll cover the HCV – the HUMIRA question. We are obviously guiding a low double-digit for
the entire year on HUMIRA. It will be a little higher growth in the U.S. than ex-U.S. The pricing on this brand, as
you've known, we do see pricing pressures ex-U.S. that mirrors the overall growth ex-U.S. We have had the ability to
take some price over the past couple of years in the U.S. So, in that double-digit guidance, I would expect slightly
higher growth in the U.S. because of that pricing effect, but those markets will be above double-digit growth.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Yeah, we can.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Okay. May I ask my second question?
<A - Larry Peepo>: Yeah. Go ahead, Steve.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Okay. So, for many reasons your P&L in 2014 is quite unusual, but it would appear that
2015 promises standout top-line growth and substantial margin improvement. At this early juncture, would you have
any objection to that thinking?

<A - William J. Chase>: I think it's obviously a little early to be giving 2015 guidance. There certainly is a dynamic
that's going to play out in 2015 as we see the full brunt of HCV kick in. So, that would certainly expect some gross
margin expansion, because we'd expect that to be relatively above our overall corporate mix. Likewise on gross margin,
we will remain committed to driving additional efficiencies. You've seen some of that play out in 2013, and certainly,
we're signing up for some of that in 2014.
On the investment side, I think a lot is going to depend on what we have in our pipeline. We've made it clear today that
we're expecting to have ten programs in Phase III of registration this year. We've got a very robust pipeline, and we've
got things moving into Phase III in the subsequent years. And then, likewise on the SG&A side, what we know is
HUMIRA is promotionally responsive, we've driven very, very nice growth on that brand, we have our HCV launch
kicking into full, full, full gear in 2015, and then, of course, we'll have new products launching in the period right after
2015, and we want to make sure that we provide appropriately for those products and opportunities as well. So, we'll
have to see.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. And I'll add my congratulations as well on your first successful year.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Alex.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: A follow-up to your comment on TURQUOISE-II, to what extent do you think that trial – having
that dedicated Phase III trial in those important patients is a marketing competitive advantage? And then a couple of
follow-ups, if I may. Are we going to see ABT-199 data this year, and could you give us some color on the market
opportunity for elagolix? Thank you very much.
<A - Scott Brun, M.D.>: Alex, hey; it's Scott Brun. I mean, with regard to the TURQUOISE-II, when you consider the
fact that cirrhotic patients have traditionally been the hardest to treat, and certainly, as we see the aging of the HCV
population and the likes of cirrhosis going up, we thought it was extremely important to well characterize the response
in this patient population. And so, absolutely, we feel these data are going to be of critical value to clinicians, to
patients, to payers in really demonstrating the characterization and certainty of response that you can achieve in this
population. And, as Rick said, we're extremely pleased; the results certainly surpassed my initial expectations, they're
unprecedented, and provide considerable benefit over anything that's currently available.
With regard to 199 data flow, we're going to be presenting some initial Phase I combination data with ABT-199 and
RITUXAN this year; remember that's the combination that's being studied in the Phase III trial that's getting underway
that Rick referred to. We'll also be showing some additional data in CLL that will demonstrate the longer-term
durability of our monotherapy, building on the very strong results that we've already showed, where we had a 24%
complete response in CLL with 199 as a single agent in relapsed refractory patients, comparing extremely favorably to
the new agents that are currently being studied there. And we're also hoping to be able to get some AML data out later
this year.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Elagolix. He also asked about in terms of potential and opportunity and our view on the
product.
<A - Scott Brun, M.D.>: Yeah. So, certainly, elagolix, currently in Phase III on endometriosis and Phase IIb in uterine
fibroids. When you consider endometriosis, a condition that affects millions of women worldwide resulting in
considerable symptomatology for which there are really no good therapies right now. Existing ones, while they may be
able to control symptoms, create their own set of problems by really putting women into a menopausal-like state. We
feel there is significant potential for elagolix as a chronic therapy in endometriosis, certainly allowing patients to avoid
more extreme measures such as surgery, which when you consider the population of women here who are of an age

where they're considering childbirth, certainly they don't want to have to take that type of option. So, with regard to its
overall tolerability and efficacy profile, certainly we feel that there is very significant opportunity in endometriosis as
well as fibroids, where again there's no chronic therapy available and all the other limitations that exist in that therapy
that I outlined in endometriosis are also present.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Alex. We'll take our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMC.
<Q - Jessica M. Fye>: Hey, there. It's Jessica Fye on for Chris.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Hey, Jessica.
<Q - Jessica M. Fye>: Hey, I just wanted to follow up on your expectations for the HCV market. Can you talk about
how you're thinking about competition based on price? Is that a lever that you consider to gain share?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: I'll take that; this is Rick. As we've said a number of times, when you look at the
attributes of this product, the performance speaks for itself. This is a highly competitive product against anything that
we've seen out in the marketplace. If you look at our capabilities from a commercial standpoint and a market access
standpoint, I think they speak for themselves as well; you only have to look to HUMIRA, which has a lot more
competitors than this market's going to have. So, I think from that standpoint, we feel good about our ability to be able
to go into the market and compete effectively.
Having said that, I'd also tell you this is a highly competitive market and it's not prudent for us to lay out what our
commercial strategy is going to be, and we're not going to lay out what our commercial strategy is going to be. And
that includes we're not going to lay out where our pricing strategy is as part of that. So, that's probably not the answer
you were looking for, sorry. But certainly, I think if you were sitting in our chair, that would be the prudent way to deal
with this.
<Q - Jessica M. Fye>: Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jessica. Next question, please, Elan.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Hey. This is Colin on behalf of Gregg. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Hep-C in TURQUOISE-II, can you comment either quantitatively or qualitatively on the
rates of anemia seen? I just want to get a sense of the tolerability as you think about the real-world setting. Also on
TURQUOISE-II, could you speak to the relapse and breakthrough rates in the genotype 1a population and/or the
treatment experience? And with regard to AndroGel in the testosterone replacement market, script trends have
indicated a modest decline over the last few months. And I just wanted to get your sense on what you're hearing from
the frontline regarding this and your expectations for the overall market in 2014? Thanks.
<A - Scott Brun, M.D.>: Yeah. Hey, Colin; it's Scott Brun. Regarding TURQUOISE-II, first getting at the tolerability,
when you look at the results in both the 12-week and the 24-week arms, again, we saw very low rates of
discontinuations for adverse events, only on the order of about 2%. Certainly, when you look at rates of anemia, while I

don't want to quote specific numbers, certainly they were not different from what we've seen in the non-cirrhotic
populations within our programs. Again, I don't want to parse the TURQUOISE-II data to any greater extent than we've
released. We're going to be providing more detail on that at EASL, but what I can say is that we anticipate that the
majority of patients will only require 12 weeks of therapy to achieve these very high SVR rates. And certainly, the
24-week therapy will likely only be applicable to a very limited minority subset of patients.
<A - William J. Chase>: And, Colin, on AndroGel, certainly the market has [ph] swollen (49:59) up, particularly
versus what we saw in 2012. That said, we are picking up share and we've seen nice progress on that in the back half of
2013. And frankly, a lot of the pricing pressures are now behind us and pretty stable. So, we're pretty pleased with our
position. That said, we are taking a realistic view of that market and brand in 2014, which is really the logic behind the
guidance that we provided this morning.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Colin. We'll take our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: On the pipeline, one on the ABT-888. Just want to get a sense of how you see that potentially
differentiating itself from other agents in the breast cancer space. This is some interesting data so far, but how you see
that playing out? And then, when will we actually see the data behind that one in breast cancer and in the other
indications that you mentioned?
And then the other one just on 199, do you see any change in your expectations around that being competitive in the
frontline or relapsed CLL setting just given the strength that we're seeing with Pharmacyclics and the new data they've
commented on with the early stop of their study there with the strong data?
<A - Scott Brun, M.D.>: Yeah. Okay, why don't I go ahead? It's Scott Brun. So, with regard to 888 and its ability to
differentiate itself from other agents in breast cancer and certainly, I think it's important to mention other malignancies
as well. Certainly, there's some characteristics of Veliparib 888 relative to other PARP inhibitors that suggest it may
actually be superior. It's able to cross the blood-brain barrier. And perhaps even more importantly, we're able to
combine effectively with other chemotherapies, where some of the other PARP inhibitors have really had challenges
with that.
So, as a consequence, the other PARP inhibitors are really limiting themselves to cancers with genetic susceptibility to
PARP, those with the BRCA mutation, and certainly, also going more into late-stage populations. We feel that again,
particularly with Veliparib's ability to combine with other modalities like platinum chemotherapies and radiations that
also damage DNA, that we're able to have a much broader opportunity with our PARP. Certainly the neoadjuvant study
allows us, again, to take advantage of treating patients with earlier stage triple-negative breast cancer. And going even
beyond breast cancer, we've got ongoing studies with combination therapies in ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and in use
with whole-brain radiation in the case of brain metastases from lung cancer. So, we feel that we're able to fully leverage
the full potential of the PARP platform with Veliparib as a consequence of these characteristics.
With ABT-199, when you look at the exquisite potency of the agent, its ability to drop CLL malignant cell counts in
the blood by 90% within eight hours, we feel that this factor is what's going to allow us to differentiate. Indeed, later in
2014, in collaboration with our partner, we'll be starting a Phase III study in first line CLL in combination with GA101.
And the thought here is that through the potency of 199, we can drive disease state to an extremely low level. I referred
earlier to the very promising complete response rate that we've seen, 24%, with 199 as a single agent in patients who
have cycled through, on average, four prior therapies; when you look at ibrutinib in a similar population, those

complete response numbers as a single-agent are in the low single-digits.
And so, what we're doing is working on study designs to, again, really be able to take advantage of the potential to
drive to very low levels of disease activity, and potentially move away from chronic therapy, which is going to be the
case with ibrutinib and idelalisib and really look at can we achieve disease state – disease-free remissions and possibly
even functional cures.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Vamil. Elan?
Operator
And, sir, I am showing no further questions at this time.
Larry Peepo
Okay. Terrific. Well, thanks, Elan. We'll conclude today's call with some final remarks from Rick before I wrap up the
call today.
Richard A. Gonzalez
All right. Thank you, Larry, and I'd like to thank everyone for joining us. As we indicated when we launched the
company, we had a primary objective for making sure that we set up the organization in a way that we could be
successful in 2013, and I think we accomplished that, and I think we're off to a good start in 2014. We always said
those would be transition years for us and then we were setting ourselves up to be able to return to strong growth in
2015 and beyond, and that is still our intent and I think we're tracking well against that objective.
If you think about 2015, as Bill mentioned to you, it's early to talk about guidance, but although we'll get an impact, a
positive impact on HCV in 2014 as we launch the product, we will get a very significant impact in 2015. And we'll be
in a position to be able to drive that product and see significant margin drop through in the 2015 timeframe from that
product.
In addition, we will have worked our way through the loss of exclusivity of our lipid franchise, which is obviously
creating a significant headwind for us in both 2013 and 2014. That will be gone and we'll see the emergence of strong
HUMIRA growth again driving the bottom line, and we should start to see some efficiencies again in that area as well.
By the same token, we'll be in a position to be able to start to launch some of the new products that we have in our
pipeline. We're particularly excited about our oncology pipeline with 199. And I'll tell you personally I'm excited about
what I've seen about 888 as well. I think it will have significant opportunity for us going forward. Daclizumab will also
be a product that we're excited about that can launch in that 2015 timeframe, and elagolix following that.
So, I think that we have built a robust pipeline that should give us an opportunity to be able to deliver on the
expectation that we have for ourselves and the one that we communicated to you. So, we're looking forward to doing
that.
Larry Peepo
