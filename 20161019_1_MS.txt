MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Sharon Yeshaya
Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our
earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly, a
difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The major
strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction.
Wealth Management's pre-tax margin hit the lower end of our 23% to 25% range for next year. Fixed Income is on
course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter, and Project Streamline's progress is
evident in our 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% ROE target for next year remains our focus.
Traditional businesses of strength, namely, Equities and Investment Banking, remain solid. Additionally, Investment
Management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago, though more progress needs to be made.

We are comfortable with our strategy and competitive positioning, but by no means are we complacent. We have much
more work to do. On the business side, the expense management program has to run its full course. Fixed Income needs
to evidence continued consistency, and our Wealth Management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes such as
DOL and digital innovation.
On the regulatory front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that include resubmitting our capital plan and
addressing shortcomings in our recovery and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we are prosecuting our
business optimally, given the proposed inclusion of the G-SIB buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes. The
firm is well-positioned to move past these challenges and then focus on growth opportunities.
Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core
values. Putting our clients first and doing the right thing is central to our culture. If we embrace these simple objectives
every day at work and every time we face a decision, I am confident that the inevitable outcome of these efforts will be
achieving our financial goals.
Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and geopolitical uncertainty, but our job is to
remain nimble as circumstances warrant and mitigate risk when called upon. Our senior team is battle-hardened, loyal
and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they're leading our employees through these ever-changing
times, and I have every confidence they'll continue to do so.
I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail.
Jonathan Pruzan
Thank you, James. Good morning. The third quarter results demonstrated progress against the strategic objectives we
outlined earlier this year. While slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our business
mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm revenues of $8.9 billion, unchanged versus the second
quarter. PBT was $2.4 billion and EPS was $0.81, a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded an 8.7% ROE.
Before discussing the businesses performance, I want to touch briefly on the progress we have made on Project
Streamline. We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat
revenues. Year-to-date, non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million, or 10% versus the
same period last year. While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense
initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017.
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired more than 650 employees in lower cost
locations. The vast majority of these hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the head count in our core
locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 employees in our centers of excellence through 2017.
We have begun to recognize savings from shutting down the two North American data centers and are on target to
close the remaining two next years. Further, last year's restructuring of Fixed Income sales and trading continues to be a
tailwind for the overall non-compensation expense base. In addition to the meaningful divisional head count reduction,
we have also realized savings in operations and other support services.
In addition to support service efficiencies, our Streamline targets were predicated on compensation savings and lower
litigation spend. Year-to-date, our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over the same
period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also decreased year-over-year. Our targets continue to
assume that we will not see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties.
Our CCAR resubmission, as well as potential future costs associated with Brexit, will serve as headwinds to
Streamline. The CCAR resubmission has demanded resources, both people and money, and will remain a medium-term
expense.
Despite these crosscurrents, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction in expenses by year-end 2017.

Now to the businesses; our Institutional Securities franchise performed well in the third quarter. We showed leadership
in our businesses of traditional strength, equity sales and trading, advisory and IPOs, while continuing to make progress
in fixed income sales and trading. ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion, essentially unchanged on a sequential basis.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis but down
versus the prior year.
Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion. And year-to-date, our ISG comp ratio was 36%. We remain disciplined on
compensation and are committed to our target ratio of less than or equal to 37%.
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenue, in line with our Q2 results. Year-to-date, we were number
one globally in IPOs and number two on announced M&A, completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings.
Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive, but, as one would expect, the timing and pace of future
deals will be a function of the market backdrop, issuer confidence and investor appetite.
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 1% versus 2Q 2016. M&A announced volumes are running
approximately 35% below last year's heightened levels, as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny have
weighed on activity. However, the pipelines remain healthy and clients are engaged and interested in discussing
strategic transactions.
Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt underwriting revenues were $364
million, up 6% sequentially. Equity underwriting activity remains well below historical levels. We saw a slight pickup
in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter, and we will have to see if that trend continues.
In equities, we expect to be number one globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, representing our best third quarter in
recent history, with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus a strong second quarter, impacted by
a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the
summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives, as performance was aided by a number of
meaningful corporate transactions, underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank. Results
were offset by a sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues, driven by
seasonality.
Fixed Income sales and trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A
more constructive backdrop in the last two quarters resulted in an improved trading environment. The benign credit
environment with tightening spreads broadly, and in Europe, in particular, following the Brexit vote, yielded stronger
sequential performance in corporate credit. SPG also benefited from a favorable credit environment, and increased
volumes in agency tradings further benefited our micro businesses.
In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client engagement in rates, largely attributable to divergent expectations
around central bank policy.
Fixed Income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at September 30. Fixed Income revenues
year-to-date are $3.6 billion. We remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint we had
over the last few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process and we remain focused on supporting our clients and
delivering results.
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter, primarily driven by gains on a relationship and event held for sale
loans as a result of an improved credit environment.
Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million
last year. The derisking of our balance sheet as we continue to adjust the composition of our inventory contributed to
the reduction in VaR.
Wealth Management performed very well and continued to provide stability in the third quarter. Net revenues were up
2% to $3.9 billion, which is a record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail investors remaining

cautious, we have good momentum in this business.
Total client assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee-based assets increased 4% to $855
billion, which is a new high both in absolute terms and as a percent of total client assets. The increase included $13.5
billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017.
Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices.
Net interest income was up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The sequential increase was attributable to both
loan growth and lower amortization, driven by a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds. Bank lending balances
were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year, on track to meet our lending
goals.
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2, but down sequentially when
excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans as client engagement remains
subdued.
Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non-comp expense were down 3%, reflecting continued execution
of our expense initiatives, notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and enhancements to our
infrastructure to ensure compliance with DOL.
Investment Management saw stable asset management fees and less volatility in the investments line. Total net
revenues were $552 million, down 5% quarter-over-quarter.
AUM grew to $417 billion due to market appreciation and positive flows, primarily in our liquidity products as a result
of money market reform. Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million, essentially unchanged versus 2Q
2015.
Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million, essentially unchanged versus last quarter, reflecting a more stable
investing environment. Overall expenses were down slightly, 2% quarter- over-quarter, driven by lower
non-compensation expenses.
We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to
the Volcker Rule across the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of
these investments, we continue to consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the rule, including sales,
redemptions and liquidations, where the amounts we ultimately realize on these investments may be less than their
current carrying values.
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $814 billion on September 30, down from $829 billion on June 30. The
spot decrease was primarily due to a redesign of our wealth management client cash sweep program in light of money
market reform and a decrease in firm liquidity following Brexit. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs
are expected to be approximately $368 billion, essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in
Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%.
Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis points to 6.2%. During the
third quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 41 million shares, and our board
declared a $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%. And going forward, we continue to
estimate a tax rate of 32%.
We have good momentum in our business and have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 11% ROE
target. That said, we have more work to do. We must continue to execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the
year, including the implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management. We also continue to invest
in our businesses through digital offerings, electronic trading capabilities, preparation for DOL and additional
regulatory conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control, and we feel confident that our ROE
target is achievable.

Currently, markets are constructive, but both markets and investor sentiment will be impacted by some major events on
the near-term horizon, including the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action and the Italian
referendum, to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be an important factor for investor conviction
and corporate confidence.
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One, I guess starting out on FICC,
really, really encouraging to see the solid back-to-back results here this quarter and last. Can you help us understand
whether or not there maybe might have been some changes to risk management that has gone along with the new
leadership team? And maybe could you have any stats you could share behind it, maybe inventory loss stats or
something along those lines to support maybe a higher baseline result or at least less volatility?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. I'll take a try. I think when we set out on this restructuring, what we said is we wanted
have a credible and critically sized business that was relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist within
our ISG franchise, for example, leverage finance with our M&A business. We also said we wanted to maintain the
revenue footprint while reducing the balance sheet to capital, the expenses and the head count in this business. We're
three quarters into it, Brennan. We've generated $3.6 billion of revenue year-to-date, so that puts us on track to
maintain our revenue footprint that we saw over the last couple years. I think the success that we've had has boosted
confidence and the team continues to gel, but it is early.
This is good results for the quarter, but we need to do this over multiple years, not multiple quarters. I think the
leadership has started to gel and bring the sales and trading businesses together, consolidating, as you said, the risk
management and some of the infrastructure support behind that. And we've seen some real learnings from that
experience, and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective.
But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop, particularly for our businesses around the credit and SPG line
items. We saw tightening spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distressed trading volumes,
better volumes in SPG, so a good backdrop and good performance against that.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: That's helpful. Thanks, Jon. Can you give us a sense – it is impossible to give a
sense about how much you guys might guess the positive environment helped results this quarter or is that just too
difficult to try to tease out?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Any question where you ask if you want me to guess, I'm going to have to say, no, thank
you.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: All right. And then, shifting gears onto the Wealth Management business, can you
share any plans that you might have around Fiduciary Rule compliance? A very large competitor of yours has
confirmed their direction, which is to not use the BIC, and so curious about what insights you can give into your
approach there and whether or not you see potentially divergent policies as a business opportunity here as we move
forward?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Why don't I touch on that? Firstly, the team is going to be coming out making some
announcement over the next couple of weeks. So, Brennan, I won't get ahead of them, but I think it's fair to say our firm
view is that optimizing choice for our clients, giving them a choice of how they deal with the firm, services they access,
how they pay for those services, is critical to how we operate as a firm. At the same token, obviously, we're operating
under whatever the regulatory constraints are, but choice has been a fundamental sort of guiding light for the firm, and

that is unlikely to change.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. That's very clear. That's very clear. Thanks, James. And then, I guess one
more question I would have is on also on Wealth Management. We saw the deposits drop quarter-over-quarter. And
isn't it that 2Q is sort of a soft base to build off of, given the taxes? So can you help us understand what drove the
change in deposits this quarter versus last within Wealth Management? Is there any shift happening there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: From a fundamental perspective, there is no real shift in sort of client behavior, as I
mentioned, Brennan, in my prepared remarks that we did change our client cash management sweep program because
of money market reform. We had clients that were in prime funds that were going to go to a floating NAV and with the
gates and so forth, we did make a change in sort of how we sweep deposits based on thresholds and client preference,
first into BDP and then into government funds, so that had a slight decrease overall. But it did actually improve the
liquidity of those deposits as uninsured went down and insured went up. But the BDP number is relatively flat
quarter-over-quarter, so we haven't really seen any major change in behavior. And, as I said before, it's still pretty
subdued in terms of the investor sentiment.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, terrific. Thanks for clarifying that, much appreciated.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Thank you. Jon, two quick follow-ups from some of the comments you made earlier. One, I
appreciate all the color you had on Project Streamline. I just want to make sure, can you give us the number of what of
the $1 billion is in the current run rate or what's left? And then, on your comments around as we approach the July 17
deadline on Volcker compliance, I appreciate the potential filing extension, but what is the size and type of funds that
we're talking about? I'm assuming it's some of the real estate funds that we've built with Asia, but size and type of
funds, and are they above or below cost base right now? Thanks.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So, I'm going to go back to the first question first, which I've now actually forgotten.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Project Streamline; what's in the...
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Streamline, thank you. So again, there are a couple of different components to it. I think what
I would say is that we feel very confident about the $1 billion. We've shown good progress on the controllable expenses
around – as I said, if you look not quarter-over-quarter, but year-over-year, around occupancy, around T&E, around
some of the professional services, that $800 million, I'm not going to go line-by-line. There is some benefit from the
fact that revenues are down a bit, but we feel confident that we're going to hit the $1 billion target, which obviously
includes compensation savings.
On Volcker, it's $2.3 billion, which is why we highlighted that number. There's been some confusion around it. And
our intent is to file for extensions for the overwhelming majority of that. We have options for the other funds as it
relates to the July deadline. And then to your question, I mean, obviously, currently, the funds are at NAV now. They
are basically, historically, whether it be real estate or private equity, but it's a mix of the businesses and asset classes
that we've been in historically.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right, cool. I appreciate that. Last follow up or just a question for maybe James. RWA is
down a lot. It's like down 16%. You got 15.9% CET1. You had a great result in capital return, but capital's building so
it's this high-class problem you have. I think you'd be at the high end of your ROE target range now if you had a similar
capital ratio to the peers and you're above 10% on a tangible. So can you talk about how you address that in terms of
just keep doing what you're do and try to get more out? It's a give-and-take, but it's a ton of capital.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yeah, it is. I mean, Glenn, this is not a sprint. It's obviously a marathon. We're trying
to build a firm that's resilient for all time, so we're trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are. That
has been, as you and everybody else know, is a moving piece. We have the G-SIB buffer coming into play. Obviously,

there's going to be some netting against that, if I read the speeches right, around the shape of the balance sheet growth
and around whether one is held to buyback commitments for the nine quarters. So we need to see the G-SIB buffers.
We took our buyback from zero to $500 million to $1 billion to $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in the last several years. We
took our dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So, pretty significant progress. But you're right, we
have a high-class problem. I mean, I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking about ROE
and how different it is from pre-crisis. And, you know, I wanted to yell at the screen, yeah, well, that might have a little
bit to do with the capital being a little different pre-crisis. We had $30 billion of capital pre-crisis. Our ROEs would be
comfortably above 20% now if we were operating the business like that. But clearly that would not be a good or
appropriate operating model.
So we're approaching, I think we were at or near the top of the large banks in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember
exactly, but I think it was in the high 80%s or even 90% ratio. This year, we're continuing to accrete at a pretty sporty
number, as you point out, but we've got some wood to chop in-between times. We've got a resubmission on CCAR.
Successful resubmission would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that has all of our
attention. And then the 2017 CCAR program is just around the corner, in April I think the submission is. So if you've
got to have a problem in terms of returns in this business, I'd much rather it be because you've got too much capital.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair enough.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: That, I would argue, is our problem. Achieving 100% payout ratio is obviously a
terrific position for us to target. And that's what we're targeting. And then, we'll sort of take it from there. But this has
been a multi-year restructuring. I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital regimes, given that
all of the rules have not been fully baked in. As Jon just said, we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that'll happen
and whatever extensions we get from June 17, but obviously we've got some dispositions going. We've got the G-SIB
buffer in action. The resolution plans are still working their way through. All the banks are resubmitting those. So
there's still a lot of moving parts.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair enough. Thanks, James.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: As a shareholder, frankly, I, as a shareholder, take comfort from the fact that we have
the capital that we have.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. Another question on fixed income, and I hope you can appreciate some concern about fixed
income given the record over the last 10 to 15 years, but it was certainly much better than expected. To what degree are
the FICC results the result of taking more risk? Page six of the supplement shows VaR is down for rates and FX and
commodities, but up in the credit portfolio. And to what degree are the better results in FICC the result of taking share,
say, from European banks and if you can address prime brokerage, too?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'm going to just start on that, Mike, and I'll let Jon get into it. But, listen, we're not and
did not in the second quarter run any victory lap around fixed income. We said we were targeting $1 billion a quarter
on an annualized basis. We said there'd be volatility around that by the very aspect of the markets. We're obviously did
much better than probably anybody thought this quarter, and part of that is a function of the mix of our Fixed Income
business, with a more credit-dependent business.
But, that said, we have made real changes to this business. We did bring down the RWAs from $390 billion to about
$125 billion now. We did take out 25% of the total head count cost and people in December of last year, and we are
currently on track for the $1 billion run rate; in fact, a little above it. But again, we're not too focused on the
quarter-to-quarter moves. And I think if the question underlying it is did the team do something on the risk front which
was sort of further standard of deviations out from what we've typically been doing the last couple of years, I think the

answer is clearly no.
And Jon will take you through some more details if there's more to add to it, but this is a business which, as you know
and if you look at the Street's numbers, I think all of the banks [ph] are priced (29:40) on the upside, right? It was a
better macro environment. There was more volatility post-Brexit. There was more volatility around rates because of the
Fed, multiple talking voices of the Fed. And the credit markets firmed up. So if you're in the fixed income business,
you were going to have a better quarter. We're in it and we had a better quarter. What I'm pleased about is we did it
with 25% less people. Jon, do you want to add anything?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No. Mike, were there other parts of the question that James didn't address that you'd like me
to tackle?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Well, at least, I guess, the flipside is the market share gains. I mean, to the extent that you have the
potential to use your balance sheet more than some global banks that are restructuring, how much of that is a factor in
FICC or trading or capital markets generally?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, listen, I think what we've generally said is that we feel very comfortable with our
competitive position. You can see our rankings. Quarter-to-quarter share is sort of hard to look at because, as James
mentioned, these businesses move around. But certainly over the medium to long-term, we have a very strong position.
We've got a nice global footprint. We've got a defined strategy. Not all of our peers could probably say that. So I think
over the medium to long-term, we think our competitive position will bode well for us.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Maybe just a clarification on Project Streamline, just so I'm clear. You've done $800 million in
expenses so far versus the $1 billion target. Does that imply $200 million to go by 2017 or am I not...?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No. Well, there's a couple things. One is Project Streamline is a total expense number, so that
would include comp and non-comp. The $800 million is a non-comp number. That's number one. Number two, the
premise around Streamline was $1 billion expenses, assuming a flat revenue environment. So if you look at
year-to-date, although we've shown nice progress in the second and third quarter, if you recall, the January and
February market environment, but also the first quarter, was quite soft. So we're actually running year-to-date below
our revenue from 2015.
And so, therefore, the apples-to-apples comparison is a little more challenging, so I don't think you can do the math that
you just did. The one thing I will say is that we are confident, even with the incremental CCAR and Brexit planning
expenses that are probably in the budget at this point, we are confident that we'll be able to get $1 billion of expenses
out of that total $27 billion expense line from last year in 2017.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then just on sales practices, wondering if you can
comment on the Massachusetts Securities officers' enforcement action around your sales practices. Do you have to
change anything? Does that impact your kind of efforts to increase lending penetration?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: No, it doesn't. We are not changing things. We put out a public statement relating to
Massachusetts. We're not going to comment on that. We run our business consistent with the values of doing
everything we can to support our clients, and we'll continue to do that.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to have a couple of follow-up questions on equities
and FICC. In equities, you had mid-single digits revenue growth year-over-year. And of the five global dealers
reporting so far, there's once again a big separation between the three firms that have sizable prime brokerage activities,
yourselves and the other two, and the other players who have really fallen behind. Can you talk about that? Is this sort
of a coincidence or can you see real evidence that because of the strength of that business, maybe ability to reprice or
concentrate share of flows, that you were really able to break out?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'll try, Guy. Listen, we are number one in the world in this business. And I think we're
seeing the benefit of being able to provide clients with value across the globe. As I mentioned, the third quarter was our
strongest in equities since the crisis, so we are seeing the benefit of being the number one in the world. And I think
you're going to see, just like in many other financial services products, a concentration of market share among the top
players, and that's what you're seeing in equities.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And in FICC, can you give us a sense for the degree to which maybe alongside strong flow
activity that you commented on, that that revenue might've been supplemented by positive marks on legacy, elongated
derivatives or other positions?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Listen, Guy, certainly, some of our fixed income businesses, we carry inventories in those
businesses, particularly in our credit and SPG areas, and tightening spreads around the world, we benefit from that. But
I won't comment on, I think, your derivative, but it was a good constructive backdrop for this business.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just as a follow-up to the follow-up on that one, those types of positions, are they still
absorbing meaningful amounts of capital driving the significant part of the RWA that persists, and when we get back to
the whole idea of long-term capital return potential, should we be looking over the next three to five years for a
significant free-up of capital from positions of that type that don't generally generate very much revenue?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: The way I would think about it is we have $125 billion of FICC RWAs today. We are not
meaningfully above our both 2017 target, which was $120 billion, and our long-term target. So we continue to move
towards those goals. Where positions are running off over time, as we've talked about, given the liquidity we saw, I
made a comment that we have been working on our composition of our inventory. We saw opportunities to come out of
some of the illiquid positions. We've seen a trend towards our clients wanting to trade in more liquid products, given
their view of the world. So we're going to continue to manage that business. We're going to continue to run those down
over time. And I think we're pretty close to the ultimate targets on the balance sheet perspective, as it is today.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Yeah, thanks, good morning. On GWM, maybe bigger picture, it still seems disconnected from
history here, that retail engagement is so subdued against a backdrop where risk assets have performed well, investable
assets are growing. So I'm just wondering is there any data or anecdotes that you'd point to that would suggest that this
isn't a secular change or a change around products or demographics?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No, I think, listen, there's just been a lot more headlines. There's been a lot more volatility.
Yes, markets have been trading up over the course, certainly, of this quarter and we're seeing indices at reasonably high
levels. But on the flipside, transaction revenues have historically been driven by underwriting calendar, where we've
seen a very slow 2016. I think the geopolitical risks and some of this political risk, and some of these risks that are
much harder for retail, or actually any investor, to probability wait can get their hands around and probably push people
to the sidelines, I don't know if it's secular or cyclical at this point, but certainly it's at very low levels.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think it's having watched this business over two or three decades, I don't think I've
seen transaction levels lower than this, and juxtaposed against that that the business had record revenues is a testament
to the managed money side of it, the banking side of it, the deposit side of it, things that, frankly, 15 years ago really
didn't exist, to a highly dependent upon transaction activity. And the world has changed. Investors have changed, but
we're sitting on $2.1 trillion of assets, and their behavior has changed. Whether the transaction stuff picks up, I don't
know, post the election, post the Fed moving, it remains to be seen.
My guess is over time, it does. I feel just intuitively it feels like a low, but can it go lower? I guess it could go lower,
but probably there's a bias to moving up rather than moving down over the next couple of years. That said, more and
more money is going to fee-based accounts.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Got it. Great, that's very helpful. And then, you guys have $27 billion of debt maturing over the
next 12 months. How should we think about the delta between those rates relative to the current market rates, to try and
get a sense of orders of magnitude of impact, assuming you replace that?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, I think a ways back, we said that we had a good funding tailwind as the maturing debt
was much more expensive than what we were putting on. I think at this point, that has run its course in terms of our
new issuance is generally in line with what's been rolling off. So I think there is still some benefit of sort of
annualization and things of that nature, but we've come to probably the material end to sort of the funding arbitrage that
was going on.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Good morning. My question was about net interest income in Wealth Management. Could
you talk more about margins? They do seem to be pretty strong in the third quarter, but if you adjust for the
prepayment, which I don't think we really knew how much that impacted Q2, but you can help us on the trends in
margins in Wealth Management. Thank you.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, at 23.2%, it's obviously at the low end of our range. What we saw in the second
quarter and if you recall in June, rates were coming down, so then prepayment speeds were accelerating, so we had a
negative impact from that. We had, obviously, the opposite this quarter, as generally rates have been rising throughout
the quarter, was not a significant contributor to the margin. We feel good about the progress that we've made. And at
the low-end of the range of 23.2%, you should also recognize some seasonality in this business in terms of the expenses
in the fourth quarter. But again, as James said and as I said in my prepared remarks, given the flows of managed
money, given the lending progress that we've made, we feel good about the margins and sort of the progress that we've
made here.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: And can I just check on the net interest income margin specifically, that there's no funny,
that that's a good base from which to forecast going forward? It's just so much higher as a percentage of assets than it's
been for a while.

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, no, that's a good base. There's going to be some nominal volatility because of
prepayment speeds as our mortgage book grows, but that's a good base.

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: All right. Thanks, guys. I guess either for Jon or James, just on the DOL, James, you
mentioned providing customers with options, just wanted to get your sense on how to manage that versus, say, like the
legal side or the legal risk. And then, I think in the past, you guys mentioned that you didn't expect any significant
impact on revenue or expense, meaning like the margin. So I just wanted you to confirm that as we get more
information and you guys continue to work on the strategy.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Mike, as I said, I think the team is going to be saying something over the next couple
of weeks. So really, to be fair to them, I don't want to get ahead of it. They'll give you a lot of details. I don't think that
giving clients choice heightens one's legal exposure. In fact, that just seems a little counterintuitive. We run a large,
complicated business and we do it in full compliance with the regulatory rules, and we try and optimize what's always
in the best interests of our clients. That's the basic principles.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: And, Mike, on the second half of your question, obviously, there were drafts of the DOL rule
out last year, so we were informed when we gave you the 23% to 25% margin target. What we've said about this is that
we think this is going to be manageable, both from our clients' perspective and from a results perspective, and we're
going to work with our clients to make sure that we're providing compliant solutions.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay, got it. And then, just as a follow-up, Jon, on the buyback, it looks like the pace
is just ahead of, I guess, what you did in the last CCAR versus what you can do in this cycle. And so I just wanted to
get a sense on do you have more flexibility in terms of front-loading it?
And then, when I think about – I think Glenn had the question on just where the capital ratio is in the ROE. James,
having too much capital definitely in this environment is a good spot to be when you look at the global firms. But on
the other hand, it does weigh on the ROE and on the multiple. So when you look at what you guys are doing
strategically in terms of focusing on Wealth Management, taking down some of the risk on the balance sheet, is that
starting to resonate with the regulators? And so do you have the potential to get that CET1 ratio back, I guess, around
the industry average versus at these elevated levels?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Is it resonating with the regulators? I mean, you've got to look at the track record.
We've increased the dividend four years in a row and we've increased the buyback four or five years in a row. We
operate in a world which has been an evolving world from a regulatory front and we've tried to stay ahead of it. And I
think we, frankly, have done that in terms of where our capital is.
I'm not going to repeat what I said, I think it was earlier to Glenn or somebody, on what our plans are, but we try and
optimize within the rules but at the same time be appropriately conservative until we see where all the rules flesh out.
We'll get a much better sense when the G-SIB stuff is finally written down, and then we'll know pretty much where we
stand.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, and then on the first part of your question, as you highlighted, we did buy back $1.25
billion in the third quarter. We have a $3.5 billion authorization, so we do have $2.25 billion left to do over the next
three quarters.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi there. Good morning. I've just got a follow-up question on capital, following Dan Tarullo's
remarks on the stress capital buffer. Obviously, you've got a very strong CET1 ratio, but presumably you've also got a
very high stress capital buffer, so your minimum requirement will be quite high. And I'm just making that implication
there from the impact on your CET1 ratio under the 2016 CCAR process. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are
there as to what you think your SCB should be, what your minimum capital requirements could be – I know the rules
aren't ratified yet – and how you would stack up versus your peers.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Let me try to take a crack at this. So I would say a couple of things. One, I think it's a little
too early to start estimating SCBs and sort of impact. This is obviously going into effect in the 2018 CCAR. So for
2017, what James has said and what we said at the beginning of the year, is that we were capital sufficient and we
would like to try to return capital above the current levels that we have and we're going to continue to do that, follow
that strategy in 2017.
And then in 2018, as the NPR becomes rule and we have a better sense of what the ins and outs and the takes are, we'll
be in a better position to tell you what we think the capital outlook looks like then.
The one point which is reasonably clear from Governor Tarullo's speech is the integration of sort of stress testing into
the baseline capital ratios in business as usual, and that's a trend that we've seen for a while. So I think broadly
speaking, although there were some lack of some of the details, the speech was sort of broadly in line with our
expectations.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Right. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up question, just looking at the 2016 CCAR and
the comments people have been making about [ph] effectiveness (48:28), obviously, you've got quite a big impact there
on the 2016 CCAR versus the severely adverse scenario. And I was just wondering how you tied that up with the
make-up of your business. Why would that be the case? And especially given that you're relatively light on FICC
versus some other peers. Is it the case that maybe that's a reflection of maybe higher risk that you might be having in
FICC and the way you run that?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'm not sure I fully understand the question. I would say that I think of the large banks, we
were the only bank that had their stress losses go down year-over-year. I think that is a reflection of the actions that
we've been taking around the overall risk in our balance sheet. We continue to look at inventories and manage those
businesses and try to shrink where we can. I mentioned that in my comments. So again, I'm not sure I understand what
you're driving at, but I think we are and I think our absolute stress losses relative to the other big banks are also below
those levels. So I think we are starting to see the benefit of the risk reduction that we've taken, and I think that will
continue to persist.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Right. But the absolute delta in your starting CET1 ratio and then where it moves to under the
severely adverse scenario, that's relatively quite large versus other U.S. banks. And I was just wondering why you think
that would be the case.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, again, I think the way I would look at it is we've been able to increase our capital
return quite dramatically over the last several years. And our ratios in CCAR last year ended up higher than the year
before. So I think there is recognition of the risk reduction and the transformation that we've taken, both on the revenue
and the risk side.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Jon, I'm sorry if I missed this, but in the Institutional Securities, what
drove the non-comp component up sequentially?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: In the...
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: It was up about 5% in the quarter-on-quarter.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, I mean, listen, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it's going to bump around. As I
highlighted, year-to-date for the firm, non-comps are down dramatically. So to be honest, these things are not straight
lines, but we feel confident that we've got good expense management in place.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. I mean, I guess I was wondering if it was just a function of the business mix, given
that some of the markets' revenues have more volume-related components.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No. I mean, I think that was not really a driving force. You do know we have a CCAR
resubmission in December of this year, so there was some incremental expenses that we didn't expect to have from that
perspective. But again, these things are going to bounce around quarter-over-quarter, and we feel very good about the
$1 billion target we set for next year.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And if I can just maybe follow-up on the capital questions, as we think about the
longer-term target, can you just help us frame whether that target contemplates – or what it contemplates I guess is
really the question – in terms of capital levels? Like in other words, like does getting to the high end assume stable or
lower levels or does it continue to reflect an expected amount of capital accretion?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'm sorry, the high end?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: So if you look at the 9% to 11% target, right, like what is the equity assumption underlying
that relative to where we are today? Is it continued capital accretion and net income is just expanding ahead of that
accretion or is it some expectation of reduction?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, again, I think when we laid out the 9% to 11% for 2017 in the beginning of the year,
we said we had sufficient capital. And therefore, we wanted to try to maintain that capital level. You've seen that we've
accreted a bit because, obviously, the payout ratio is based off of net income. And we do issue equity to our employees
as part of compensation. So we are accruing a little bit of equity. It was predicated on that sort of general math that it
would creep up, but nothing dramatic. And what we said in January, which I think is actually even more consistent now
with some of the comments around Governor Tarullo's speech about actually implementing those changes in 2018, is
that that's our current thinking for 2016 and 2017. And then we'll obviously analyze the new rules as part of 2018
CCAR, see where the progress that we've made on the balance sheet and the fixed income restructuring and then make
another assessment at that point.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. Maybe a quick follow-up on the ROE targets, the 9% to 11% next year,
you're sticking with it, but if we look at the presentation from January, it was sort of under the expectation that revenue
growth would be 3% to 5% annually. Obviously, year-to-date, we haven't hit those numbers. So what gives you the
confidence or what's changed in terms of your ability to still hit the 9% to 11%? Is it just greater expense confidence?
How do we think about that in the context of clearly, consensus with implying an ROE below 8% doesn't clearly
believe you can get there?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Listen, I think we've shown some really good progress against the goals. As you do mention,
the revenues are down 2016 versus 2015 year-to-date, but the target was for 2017. We think we can continue to make
more progress on the margin in Wealth, as I mentioned, some of the flows and where we are in terms of our assets
under management and our lending progress helps position that business for 2017. Continued leadership in equities and
IBD, where we like our positions and our global footprint, so we'd like to continue to press our advantage there and we
have more Streamline to go. So first quarter very challenging, but we put up 8.3% in the second, 8.7% in the third and
we're a lot closer that 9% to 11%. We clearly need constructive markets, but I think that's what our confidence is being
driven by. We're closer to the number and we still have some of the initiatives in flight and we expect to realize them in
2017.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, that's fair. And then maybe on the capital side, I think CET1 clearly very strong, but the
SLR, I guess, is where if we look at your progress to-date, it's been not as rapid as on the RWA side in Fixed Income.
What's driving the slower progress on the SLR and do you still feel confident you can get to the targets?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes, to the last question. Obviously, the SLR is just a bigger denominator. And therefore, the
changes that we've been making accrues more slowly to that number, but at 6.2% relative to what the minimums are
and what our expectation is on CCAR, is a strong number as well.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes.
