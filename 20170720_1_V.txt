Jack, thank you. Good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We had another strong quarter of
business results. Much like the first half of our fiscal year, we saw consistently solid trends in our operating metrics
with very good growth in payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border revenue.
Our global business benefited from an overall healthy economy as payments volume grew in every major region. In the
United States, we saw strong consumer confidence continued to drive spending growth. After three quarters here at
Visa, I'm quite pleased with our business progress and our high level of execution. It's a real testament to our talented
and dedicated employees around the world. We're creating a strong culture focused on leadership development,
operational excellence and driving results.
As I move to the highlights of the quarter, I do want to thank everybody for joining us at our recent Investor Day both
in person and via the webcast. As a leadership team, we enjoyed the opportunity to meet and spend time with our
shareholders and the financial community. We hope that you found the information and discussions to be useful. We
were pleased to have received quite positive and helpful feedback from the event. Given the fact that we did provide a
significant amount of information just a couple weeks ago, my prepared remarks today will be relatively brief.
In Q3, our business continued to perform well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. We
saw healthy growth in our key metrics for payments, volume and processed transactions.
Payment volume was solid across all five regions. Growth was particularly strong in India, the United States, Russia,
Mexico and Australia. China payments volume growth remained low in the quarter, driven by the dual currency,
dual-badged card runoff, but I should note that China's cross-border volumes growth continued to be strong. This was
reflective of the overall trend as cross-border growth was robust around the globe. In addition to China, Latin America,
the U.S., Japan, Russia and parts of Europe were among the areas of real strength.
Looking closer at processed transactions, growth was driven by Asia Pacific, Europe and the North America regions.
Client incentives came in lower than expected, primarily driven by timing delays and variances relative to our
European clients. This translated to financial performance ahead of our expectations for the quarter as we grew both net
revenue and EPS by 26% versus last year's comparable results. Vasant will go into greater financial detail and cover
some of the normalized comparisons to last year.
As we mentioned during Investor Day, the integration of our European business is progressing well and is on track.
More specific to the technology side of the integration, we're focused on migrating the European systems to our global
authorization, clearing and settlement systems as well as deploying our global data platform and other corporate
systems into Europe. We are well underway in that effort and we have just completed the upgrade of our UK
datacenters on schedule. We expect that client migrations to new systems will begin by the end of full-year 2018.
Moving our European clients to VisaNet, we can drive enhanced network capabilities, greater scale, resilience and
additional levels of cyber security that will benefit our clients and certainly be more efficient in the long term.
We're also making significant progress in strengthening our partnerships and building digital capabilities to drive
growth. Earlier this week, we extended our partnership with PayPal to include Europe. We were already collaborating
with them in the United States and Asia Pacific to provide a better online experience and this now extends the benefits
to European consumers and businesses.
Additionally, they're joining the Visa network of client financial institutions and will be able to offer Visa accounts in
Europe, enabling consumers and businesses to use their PayPal funds to spend wherever Visa is accepted. The
partnership makes it easier for financial institutions to offer their Visa accountholders the ability to check out anywhere

PayPal is accepted online by offering greater consumer choice.
We also announced a strategic investment and planned partnership with Klarna, one of Europe's leading payment
providers. Our planned investment is part of a global strategy to open up our ecosystem and support a broad range of
new partners who are helping to redefine and enhance the purchase experience for consumers online and in mobile
environments. Klarna develops products that address changing consumer preferences giving them the flexibility and
seamless experience that they expect and hope for when shopping online.
In June, we signed 13 new partners to participate in our token service provider program in all major regions. With the
expected increase in digital payments embedded in a growing number of devices, we continue to build out a global
network of partners to offer secure digital payment token services in creating a more secure commerce platform.
We launched the Visa Ready Program for Business Solutions. This is a strategic framework and certification program
to help technology companies that integrate with our B2B payment services to ensure that they meet standards and are
market-ready. Five initial partners in the U.S. have become Visa Ready as this program will help accelerate growth and
enable new use cases for B2B payments.
Turning to the international markets, let me first make a couple of comments on China. Yesterday, we filed an
application with the People's Bank of China in order to participate in the China domestic market as a Bank Card
Clearing Institution. China is one of the world's fastest-growing payments markets and is leading the way in payments
innovation.
Our commitment to this market is long term. We look forward to bringing our capabilities to the industry by stepping
up our engagement with all the ecosystem partners through open and constructive collaboration, aiming to create added
value and introduce innovative products as well as reliable and safe payment experiences for Chinese consumers. We
expect that the PBOC will consider our application in line with the publicly-released measures and guidelines for BCCI
applicants.
India represents a large opportunity and we provided some thoughts during Investor Day on how we're approaching the
market. We are seeing steady progress with digital payments despite the recent re-monetization of cash. Currency in
circulation is stabilizing as re-monetization comes to an end. The transition to the digital economy has been
broad-based across several categories, including everyday spend and suggests wide societal participation.
This past quarter, we saw payments volume increase over 80% and processed transactions more than double versus last
year. In a couple weeks, I'll be in India for the first time since joining Visa and I look forward to seeing firsthand the
opportunity that we have in meeting with local partners, officials and our teammates in India.
Once again, we delivered on our commitment to drive value for our shareholders in the quarter in maintaining a prudent
capital allocation plan. We invested in support of the growth in our core business through capital spending and
expenses.
In fiscal Q3, we returned approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders, consisting of $1.7 billion of share
repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset
the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction.
In closing, we continue to see strong momentum in the business and we're excited about the long-term growth
prospects for Visa. As we highlighted during Investor Day, there is a significant opportunity to displace cash and check
of $17 trillion in front of us. We will continue to focus on partnering strategically and driving digital innovation to
substantially grow our business into the future.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Vasant for some more on the financials.

Thank you, Al. Business momentum stayed strong globally through our third quarter. Net revenue and EPS once again
exceeded our expectations. Fiscal third quarter net revenue of $4.6 million was up 26%. Net income for the quarter was
$2.1 billion or $0.86 per share. Adjusting last year's results for several special items related to the acquisition of Visa
Europe, both net income and EPS were up 26%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net
revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS by approximately 2 percentage points.
A few points to note. Global growth rates and payment volumes, processed transactions and cross-border volumes
remained strong and stable. Exchange rate headwinds moderated though currency volatilities remained below the
long-term mean. Timing of client incentives added almost $0.02 to third-quarter results due to delays primarily in
Europe; more on this later.
We bought back 17.8 million shares of class A common stock for $1.7 billion in the third quarter at an average price of
$93.82. Year-to-date in fiscal 2017, we bought back 59.2 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of
$86.82 per share.
A quick review of our key business drivers in the third quarter. U.S. payment volumes grew 12% with credit growing
19% and debit 5%. The slowdown in credit growth from the prior quarter reflects the start of Costco and USAA credit
conversion in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding Interlink, debit grew 9%. Declining gas prices negatively
impacted payment volumes by 0.5 points. Adjusted for conversions and gas prices, underlying credit and debit growth
rates have been stable all year.
As reported, international payment volumes grew 72% in constant dollars. On a comparable and normalized basis,
robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Asia sustained double-digit growth rates, excluding China.
Domestic payment volume growth in China was impacted by the decline in active dual-branded cards. Strong growth
was sustained across EMEA and Latin America. Brazil ticked up modestly. In Europe, excluding co-badge payment
volumes, growth was 9% with strength across most markets.
On a constant-dollar basis, cross-border volumes grew 147%, driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to
prior-year results, constant-dollar cross-border growth was up over 11%. Through the quarter, the dollar weakened and
the pound strengthened moderately. Despite these shifts, outbound commerce from the U.S. and inbound commerce
into the UK remained very strong. U.S. cross-border growth accelerated in the third quarter, largely driven by outbound
commerce.
Across international markets, particularly strong corridors were inbound into Canada, Japan and Australia and
outbound from Latin America, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia. Reported cross-border volume growth rates
were negatively impacted by over 3 percentage points by an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK
cardholder volumes to the UK from another EU location. While this shift impacted our reported cross-border growth
rates, it has a minor effect on revenues since this is an intra-EU move the platform made to optimize the European
business.
As reported, processed transactions grew 44% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis,
which includes Europe and prior-year results, global processed transactions grew 13%. U.S. growth rates were stable,
international growth rates were helped by India and some new business in Europe. India processed transaction growth
stayed above 100%. Through July 14, U.S. payment volumes are up 10%, global constant-dollar cross-border volumes
grew 12%, processed transaction growth was 14%.
A brief review of fiscal third-quarter financial results. With strong momentum in the key business drivers and helped
by some moderation in exchange rate headwinds, growth rates on all key revenue lines stepped up in Q3. Service
revenues grew 19%, data processing revenues grew 29%, international revenues grew 45% even as currency volatilities
stayed below the long-term mean.
As I mentioned earlier, client incentives came in lower than expected and added almost $0.02 to the third-quarter EPS.
This was primarily due to delays in Europe. We're making good progress in resetting our commercial terms for key
clients post removal of rebates. We're pushing hard to get most of the deals we wanted done before the end of this fiscal
year.

Our current expectation is we will get 75% to 80% of the way there by September. At this point, we expect the
remaining 20% to 25% to shift into fiscal 2018, largely due to client preferences and timetables. This shift in Europe is
the primary reason why we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to come in below the low-end of
our original outlook range of 20.5% to 21.5%.
After adjusting for various special items in last year's results, expenses grew 31%. As expected, expense growth
ramped up from the first half levels as we stepped up technology as well as Europe integration spending. Our tax rate
was 29.3%, driven by the geographic mix of our global earnings and the benefits of the legal entity reorganization we
completed last quarter.
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, it's important to remind you of three events that occurred in June 2016, which
will significantly impact our reported growth rates on key metrics going forward. First and foremost and the most
important is the closing of the Visa Europe transaction. Starting with the fourth quarter, reported growth rates will
include Visa Europe in all prior-year numbers. Second is the Costco conversion. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2017, our U.S. credit growth rates will include Costco in prior-year numbers.
In addition, the USAA credit conversion was completed in September and the debit conversion was finished by
October last year. Third is the 2016 Brexit vote followed by sharp declines in the pound and later the euro. This will
reduce the exchange rate drag we have experienced so far this year. This also drove the sharp increase of cross-border
commerce into the UK. Also of note, the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2016 was the first time cross-border growth rates
globally hit double digits in almost three years. Starting in the fourth quarter, we will begin to lap the global
cross-border recovery.
We have factored all this into our updated outlook for the year. We're raising nominal net revenue growth expectations
for the year to approximately 20%. This is the result of the strong growth we have reported to-date, lower client
incentives at 20% to 20.5% of gross revenues and moderation in the exchange rate drag to approximately 2 percentage
points. With higher revenue growth, we're also raising our nominal adjusted EPS growth outlook to approximately 20%
with a 2.5 percentage point exchange rate drag. Included in this outlook is the reduction in European integration cost of
$60 million. Margin and tax rate expectations remain unchanged.
Finally, a couple of updates on cash and debt. We returned more cash to the U.S. in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we
have returned approximately $4 billion back to the U.S. As you know, in December 2016 (sic) [2015], we issued $16
billion of debt. The first tranche of this debt, $1.7 billion, matures in December this year. Between Labor Day and
December, we plan to access debt markets to refinance maturing debt and an additional amount to fund the completion
of stock buybacks that neutralize the impact of stock issued in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition.
Before I finish, I have one more topic. A couple of weeks back, Jack informed me of his intention to retire at the end of
this year. On behalf of Visa's management, I want to thank Jack for his decade of contributions to Visa. As most of you
know, Jack was Visa's first IR leader as a public company. Jack built our Investor Relations department from the
ground-up, establishing and nurturing relationships with all of you over the years and he has been a key advocate for
Visa. We all wish Jack the best in his future endeavors, which he tells may include running the Town Chair Lift in Park
City next winter. Not surprisingly, he's picked November 30 as his last day. I guess he does not want to miss a single
day of skiing.
With that, let me turn this back to Jack.
Jack Carsky
Thanks, Vasant. And before we start the Q&A, let me just add to Vasant's very nice comments there. It's been a real
honor and privilege working for this organization and the people in it for the last 10 years, but it's always good to go
out on top. I've known a lot of you for – you as 10 years and some of you for as many as 20. And it's been a great ride
and I have really enjoyed the interactions with each and every one of you.

And so, with that, Jenny, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line's open.
<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: And good afternoon. Jack, I know that Visa's stock has gone up too much and you're too
rich. So, it's not a big surprise here. So, I hope to take the ski lift that you'll be running.
<A - Jack Carsky>: And I'll let you on it. He doesn't need to tip.
<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: No, it's great. Congratulations.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Thanks.
<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: Just I guess – I mean the numbers have been very good, obviously it's your Investor Day, I
think the company seemed pretty upbeat. I just wondered if there is a way that – as you look at your numbers if you can
split out the growth and tell, has there been an acceleration in the secular shift away from cash and checks to electronic
payments? I know there's a lot going on with market share in Costco and different things, but I just wondered if you
look at that, if there's a way, if you think there's been an – some acceleration in secular trends.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah. I think, as I said my comments, if you take out the conversions and adjust for gas
prices and volatile things like that, the underlying trend of credit growth in the U.S. for the last three quarters has been
very steady and stable in the high-single digits and debit growth has also been very steady and stable.
If you look at our payment volumes through the first three quarters of this year, again strong and stable. We've been
converting cash to digital at a pretty hefty clip for the past five years and I would say there's really no change in that
trend. Global economies recovering have clearly helped us this year. So, if you remember on Investor Day, we talked
about PCE penetration and PCE growth. The PCE growth component certainly has been helpful. And then the last
thing, of course, is the recovery on the cross-border side.
And, Al, I don't know if you want to add?
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: I think the other aspect, all of what Vasant said is obviously correct, I think that while we've
seen a real adoption of digital, we're still in the early innings. And I think that as we pointed out on Investor Day, when
we get into E&M commerce, we neutralize our largest competitor, which is cash, and I think that's going to continue to
be a real engine of growth for us as we look ahead.
<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Thanks, Bob.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Your line's open.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Hey, thanks. So, another quarter of very strong results internationally. It seems that Visa Europe
has been exceeding at least our expectations almost every quarter since the transaction kind of took place. Is there any
way to kind of get us some color in terms of where you seeing the upside coming from versus original expectations?
And then, on top of that, I think you've indicated that the yield from renewing some of that book of business has been
better than expected. Maybe some more color on that as well. Thank you.

<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Well, I think we've been very pleased with Europe on any number of fronts, especially given
the fact that there has been a fair amount of disruption for the people who work in that business between the integration
as well as the regulatory requirement to split scheme and processing in the marketplace. Our employees have remained
incredibly resilient and I think, in general, the European economy has been frankly better than we thought. As you
know, our largest presence by quite a large measure is in the UK and the UK has held up well and, as Vasant said in his
remarks, has benefited from the lower value of the pound driving lots of inbound traffic into the UK. That certainly has
helped.
And when we look around the rest of Europe, our largest presences are in France and Spain, which have also held up
well. And then, we're seeing countries like the Nordics continue to do well. In terms of the yield side of it, we're still
working our way through redoing of these contracts. As both of us alluded to in our remarks, it's just a bit more of a
slog to get there than we might have thought or hoped in the first place, but we are making good progress. I think we'll
continue to make good progress as we proceed through into the fourth quarter. And to the degree that we've got good
incentives built in place and we're getting good volume growth, all boats rise, which is a good thing for everybody.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: And Vasant indicated – pointed to some new business in Europe. Is there anything substantial
there?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: No, I had said that on the processed transaction side, yes, we've been saying for a couple of
quarters that we had some gains in Europe on the processed transaction side, but overall, as Al said, I mean we're very
pleased with the way the – the vast majority of our business in Europe is under contract and we have been, for a certain
portion of that, working with clients to reset commercial terms once rebates went away and that's gone well, longer
than we would have liked, but it's going well.
So, on all fronts, Europe has done, as we've said before, equal to or better than we expected and from an accretion
standpoint certainly has been performing better than we expected. And we'll give you a little more about that once
we're through with the year and can give you a full sense of the year.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Thanks, Moshe.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Your line's open.
<Q - James Schneider>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and good luck to you, Jack, in your future
endeavors. I guess my question really comes down to the cross-border. Obviously, the volume is holding in there, but at
least by our calculations, it looks like the cross-border yield improved somewhat. So, can you maybe give us a sense of
whether that's correct and if so, what drove it, was it regional mix, was there some pricing impact or was it one of the
wins you just referred to?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: No, I don't think you should conclude that there was an improvement in yield necessarily. I
mean, clearly, from quarter-to-quarter, there are some changes in mix and so on. Some of it could be. As you see, the
exchange rate headwinds moderating a bit. Certainly, that helps our reported cross-border dollar numbers, but there was
nothing, there was no real change that would drive a big change in yields in the cross-border business.
<Q - James Schneider>: Maybe you could also just kind of address the incentive levels and you talked about being
almost 80% of the way there by the time you finish this fiscal year. Can you maybe just address directionally where
those incentive levels would go in terms of normalizing as we head into 2018?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, we'll talk about that when we talk about 2018. I mean, if your question was what's
the likely range of incentives as a percent of gross revenues and all that next year, I think we can get into all of that
when we talk about 2018. So, it's a little too early to talk about all that right now. I think all we were signaling was that
there is going to be some shift in Europe of incentives from what we thought we would get done this year into next

Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line's open.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Thank you. Jack, congrats, my friend. It's been fun.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: I guess, a question I wanted to ask – trying to think which one to ask. Okay, so maybe just a
change in guidance, can you just walk us through the change in guidance? How much of it is incentives versus some
other factors? And the change to the incentive outlook, is that all timing or do you anticipate paying a little bit less than
what you previously forecast?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: So, there's a little bit of, let's call it, better-than-expected execution, a little bit of it in
Europe, but you should think of it as almost all timing and almost all Europe; all Europe. So, that's one contributor. The
three factors that went into sort of the change in the outlook is the performance we've had to-date; some moderation in
the exchange rate headwind; some reduction in the original expectations on incentives. And on the EPS side, it reflects
the benefits we're getting from the tax rate we now have, which we talked about last quarter, as well as the revenue
being stronger than we had thought at the beginning of the year. So, there's nothing unusual other than the actual results
and the trends we're seeing.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Got it. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line's open.
<Q - Ramsey El-Assal>: Hi, guys, and congratulations, Jack. We're going to miss your special sense of humor.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Thank you.
<Q - Ramsey El-Assal>: I had a follow-up question also on incentives, kind of building on Tien-Tsin's question, which
is simply that as we sort of – as incentives, the expected levels kind of get pushed out, does it increase the chance of
sort of incremental volatility in that line? Will there be a quarter coming up where we get sort of a snapback there and it
catches folks by surprise or does this sort of push-out imply kind of a gradual slope?
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Again, I'd just remind everybody that there are at least three factors that go into this that make
this somewhat difficult to predict and I think we've shown how difficult it is to predict, because we haven't hit the
number in the last couple of quarters. But it's the – when is the deal going to actually come to pass? What are going to
be the terms of the deal as you actually get into the last bits of negotiation? And then, what actually volumes are you
going to get against those negotiated terms?
So, the reality is, in this particular case, it's just that the period of time to get through over 100 client contracts is just
taking longer than we thought. I don't think we want to get into predicting business or forecasting business or what it
would look like quarter-by-quarter, but I think this is just simply a matter of a process that we have to get through. And,
as Vasant said, we're hoping get through about 80% of it by the end of the fiscal year.

<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yes. And as we've told you before, I mean it's not something we think should be focused on
to the extent it is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And as you know, we explicitly don't try to get deals done based on
quarterly timetables and so on. So, the short answer to your question is, is there a snapback kind of thing? No. But is
there likely to be a quarter where incentives run higher than we might have expected? Of course. I mean, just as they've
run lower than we expected in some quarters, in some quarters, they could run higher than we expected, but there isn't
any snapback kind of reason that you should expect. We typically look ahead and give you our best sense of what
might get done in the quarter, quarter coming up.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line's open.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Thanks, guys. First of all, Jack, congrats again. We'll catch up soon, but we're going to miss you
obviously.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Thank you.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Just on a higher level now, if you can just touch again, I mean, on the pricing environment a bit
more, again, you've commented on yields coming in better in Europe since the deal and we've seen a number of years
where obviously incentives and rebates have been higher both as a percentage of gross revenues on a year-over-year
basis. It feels like at some point on the gross yield side, it's going higher, but the rebate side is keeping up pace to some
extent. You would see a bit of a divergence between the two. I mean, is there anything you can comment on
conceptually in what you're seeing in your conversations with clients? Has there been more of a realization that the
value-add you guys provide has reached a level where pricing is at a point where we don't need to keep providing
higher and higher incentives and rebates, this is about the right point? So, just a little more color on that would be great.
And then, just a quick comment on Q4. I know you're saying some of the European stuff is pushed and there's been a
lot of questions on incentives, but it looks like calculating what you're guiding would be about a $200 million
sequential increase in your incentive rebate line, which is kind of a lot. I mean, it's just hard to envision why they would
all be in one quarter, unless there's, I think, someone else has other things going on. So that's really just the thought of
the question. Thanks, guys.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: On the first question, Darrin, when you look at the overall numbers, it's a result of hundreds of
deals around the world and they all take on different flavors. I think, in general, many of our clients and a testament to
that is the longevity of many of our relationships that are very deep and have lasted decades that people value plenty of
aspects of what Visa brings to the table from our global scale to our risk and fraud prevention tools to our brand, et
cetera. That said, while that stuff is valued when it comes to negotiations, people negotiate hard as do we and you end
up – everybody ends up compromising and you end up in a certain place. But, I think, I haven't seen nor as I have
talked to clients around the world any view that the value that we're bringing to the table is any less than it's been.
In fact, I think, as we move into a digital world and we continue to try to be a leader in terms of thinking about the
digital tools and solutions that I think that many issuers, particularly when you get beyond the very top issuers, who
also have the funds and wherewithal, the investing in some of these kinds of capabilities that are what we bring to the
table is very valued.
Vasant, you want to add to that?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: The only thing was that there's a specific question on why client incentives, if you derive
the fourth quarter, might look the way they do. I would say a couple of things. There is the fiscal fourth quarter effect to

some degree in that, we have been talking to people, especially in Europe, for several months now and it's back and
forth on finalizing agreements and the documentation and so on. And there's a fair amount of that, that is happening in
the fourth quarter. And as we get it done in the fourth quarter, since these discussions have been underway for a few
months, as happens in many cases, the incentives you pay reflect when the deal was either agreed to or initially
discussed. So, there's an element of retro activeness to it, all of which is captured in the incentives you would probably
recognize in the fourth quarter.
So, some elements of all that, that flow into it. And then, as Al said, I mean, we have a fairly rigorous process and we
do the best we can to give you the best sense, but in the end, we won't sign a deal because a quarterly deadline is
approaching, but we'll do our very best to get done everything we are setting out to do right now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line's open.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Yes. Hi. Jack, it's been a pleasure over the part of 15 years. Hopefully, we can meet up in
Tahoe one day. Regarding the business, can you first comment on what your success rate has been in Asia, in China
specifically, in converting dual-brand cards into a single-brand companion card for cross-border? And secondly, was
there any benefit in service fees from the restructuring of contracts around the breakup of scheme and processing in
Europe? Thanks.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: On service fees in Europe, really sort of it's the breakup of scheme and processing. We'll
see over time what the impact is, but in the short run, it really has no impact on the fee structure that was in place, but it
will evolve over time I'm sure. In China...
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: I'll take it. In China, I think, we have 55 banks and 42 of them only issue the single-branded
card. The remaining 14 – 13 do the dual branded. We've had some success, frankly, not as good as we would like it to
be, as it's going to continue to be a real focus of ours and something that given the importance of the cross-border
volume from China, something that we're working closely with the banks on. I plan on being in – I'm going to be in
India and China in three weeks and it's definitely something that I will be talking to both our team there as well as our
Chinese clients.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, just in terms of the trend in that business over the last couple of quarters, we
highlighted the issue last quarter, wanted you to know, as we said earlier, that if you adjust for China, Asia was
growing double-digits. The domestic dual-banded card volumes in China were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter. So,
we didn't see a sequential decline. And the cross-border business coming out of China, as Al said in his comments, has
been strong and stable. How it all plays out in the next few months, we'll have to wait and see.

Our next question comes from line of Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is open.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you and congratulations, Jack. It's bittersweet. I guess I have another question on
incentives and specific to Europe, sort of the commercialization of the contracts there. Understanding there's some – the
timing-related impacts that are causing the lower incentives this year, are there any specific pricing impacts as well that
happen in conjunction with the commercialization of those contracts or should we expect those to sort of happen at the
same time? Thanks.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Well, we've made – in the year that we have owned Visa Europe we have made a few pricing
changes and there are a number of pricing changes that we're continuing to look at in addition to obviously the

commercialization, as you said, of the contracts to do away with rebates and put incentives in place.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: But do those happen at the same time? At points like when you renew them and put in new
incentive agreements, does that come with a revised price schedule?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: No. The price schedule, as you know, we have our price schedule and then the incentives
then are tailored by clients. So, when we make price adjustments, we make them for the system as a whole typically
and then, the commercialization of some of these contracts is something we do client by client. And just to emphasize, I
mean, the vast majority of our business in Europe has been and remains under contract. This is something we're doing
ourselves proactively to adjust some of the terms in the contracts to make them more commercial in a world where
rebates no longer existed, but the pricing itself, that's related to our normal, of course, what we call our rack rates or list
prices or whatever you want to call it.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Okay.

Operator
Yes, our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line's open.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: Thanks. And, Jack, I can only say one thing, jealous, but congratulations; well deserved, I'm sure.
A lot was said at the Analyst Day around Visa Direct and I wanted to just kind hone in on the partnership you have now
with PayPal, this collaboration you guys are doing. I guess one is, are those cards – the debit cards you're going to be
issuing, are you going to actually route those through Visa Direct? And then, secondly, do you think that, that
partnership will help insulate you guys from some of the risk associated with PSD2? Thanks.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Well, first of all, we're very pleased to extend the deals that we have with PayPal in North
America and Asia into Europe. And particularly the fact that we're offering full consumer choice and obviously as part
of the deal is the ability to use Visa Direct to push a PayPal account balance to bank accounts. And it's a fairly
extensive deal, because there's also an enablement of Visa Checkout relative to the Braintree gateway. And in Europe
in particular, given the fact that PayPal has a banking license, we're obviously licensing them as a full-fledged issuer
where they'll issue PayPal debit cards in Europe.
So, it's a extensive agreement that absolutely covers Visa Direct, but it also covers the very important aspects of the
prior deals centered around full consumer choice as well as them working closely with us in enabling Visa Checkout as
well.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: And do you think that helps in that partnership to protect you guys from PSD2 as that regulation
rolls in 2018?
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: I think that everywhere that we can further embed a Visa card into the payment stream and
build the loyalty of the consumer certainly helps us. I mean I think that at the end of the day, PSD2 is going to generate
a requirement that everybody focuses really hard on consumers and try and make sure that they're providing the best
possible consumer value propositions and the best possible consumer experiences.
So t, the degree that we can help further solidify the relationship that our issuers have with their customers, all that can
only go to help fortify the issuers against PSD2 and the competition that can come from their accounts having to be
opened.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: Thank you.

Thanks. Our next question comes from line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche. Your line is open.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask, what percentage of the European contracts are done today? I
know you said 75% to 80% is the goal for the end of the year, but just looking for a mark for today. And then,
secondly, at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition, I think the deal was to be EPS accretive in low-single digits for
fiscal-year 2017 and then high-single digit percentage points range by fiscal-year 2020. There's been a lot of moving
pieces here. I'm just looking for an update now on if those goals all stand.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Well, to the question number one, Bryan, and let Vasant answer question number two, we don't
want to get into a daily tally sheet on this. Again, so we're not probably going to disappoint you by not quantifying
exactly where we are, but I think you can assume that we're somewhere below 80%, but above a fairly decent number
such that we're confident in being able to say we think we can get to 80% by the end of the fourth quarter, but we don't
really want to get into setting a precedent of providing that kind of update.
Vasant, in terms of accretion?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, in terms of accretion, as you all know, European economies have been stronger than
we expected. So, our volumes, as you've seen, have been running better than we might have expected at the beginning
of the year or when we did the acquisition model that valued Visa Europe.
Certainly, the weak pound and the weak euro have helped the cross-border business. Frankly, the weak pound has
caused a massive amount of cross-border into the UK. In addition to that, you know that we have taken some pricing
and our yields have run a little better than we expected. And so far, things are going well in terms of renewals and
retaining contracts and business and so on.
So, when you put it all together, clearly Visa Europe is doing better than we expected this year and accretion is running
ahead of the low-single digits we had told you, but the year isn't over yet. So, we'll wait till the end of the year and give
you an update in October as to where that accretion was in the first year and whether we have a different perspective on
the longer-term outlook on accretion, but it's early days and things are going well.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Thanks, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: All right. Thanks. Yes. Hey. Congrats, Jack, as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Your line's open.
<Q - Vasu Govil>: Hi. This is Vasu Govil in for James. Thanks for taking my question. And, Jack, congratulations.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Thank you.
<Q - Vasu Govil>: Just quick question. First one to Vasant. You talked about – you sort of mentioned that cross-border
volumes would kind of lap the double-digit growth rate next quarter. So, just want to get a sense for what's baked into
guidance. Are we assuming that this double-digit growth rate is sustainable or do you think that it could decelerate back
into the sort of high-single-digit range?
And then, a question for Al on India, Visa is clearly benefiting from the government push towards non-cash form of
payments there, but there're also local mobile wallet players that seem to be making a big push and they're fast gaining
traction. So, can you just talk about the competitive dynamic and potential for the Indian market to kind of leapfrog
card payments and go straight to mobile? And how is Visa positioned on the ground to sort of preserve and grow their
share within electronic payments in India?

<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: So, on the cross-border growth rate, real quick, we like what we see on the cross-border
trends. We've seen the pound strengthen a bit, but that didn't change the strength of the cross-border business into the
UK. We saw the dollar weaken a bit, but that didn't seem to change the trend so far of cross-border business outside
leaving the U.S. So, overall, the cross-border business seems to have pretty good momentum. And, yes, the
comparisons get tougher, but we feel pretty optimistic about it. So, we'll wait and see how it goes. When you lap big
increases, of course, you have to – it's a little harder to forecast, but we like what we see a lot.
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: In terms of India, it's such an exciting market and there's a lot going on, obviously, because it's
an exciting market and a lot is going on, there's a number of players trying to get into the market. We've been there for
a long time. We believe that, as we think about growing our network and in particular merchant acceptance, that we
have to have different plans in a emerging market versus a developed market.
And in the case of India, we clearly have to have a way that's low cost, low hassle, low friction to enable merchants to
sign up. And that is why we initially went with the QR code and now have worked closely with some of our network
colleagues on an interoperable QR code that works with our mVisa application and allows quick and easy and low
hassle setup for merchants and a relatively easy experience for the India consumer.
It is very, very early in the payments maturation curve for India. There is years to still play out here and we're going to
do everything we can to take advantage of our heritage and tradition, our brand, our different product sets, our security,
the globality of our network as well as our digital tools to make sure that we're winning at least our fair share, if not
more, of the business in India as it grows, recognizing clearly that we've got competitors that go beyond just the
traditional players that we've competed with over the last number of decades.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Paulo Ribeiro from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Paulo E. Ribeiro>: Thank you. Good evening. When you talk about the impact on expenses from tech investing,
could you give us some color on where you're investing? I assume part of it is China. And where else in terms of either
geography or product have you guys focused your dollars on?
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: I'm sorry, you are talking about technology.
<Q - Paulo E. Ribeiro>: Yes. Your technology, because you guys mentioned that it's what's driving expenses,
technology and Visa Europe integration. What is in technology? Where are you spending the money in terms of...
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Well, I'll start and Vasant can add to what I have to say. Clearly, China is one where we've
stated a number of times that we're investing ahead of the process of being able to actually operate there, not knowing
exactly when that will be. I would say the other categories that come immediately to mind are Open VisaNet. We
talked a bit about that at Investor Day that we're looking – we've begun the process of building a more open
architecture and a more modularized version of VisaNet to meet the needs that we have going forward and allow us that
the flexibility to actually, where necessary put processing right in a country without it being a big deal where a
datacenter could be in a small closet as opposed to a large facility that has to have all of the accompanying electronics
and cooling and et cetera.
Clearly, digital and all of the digital tools that we're building is an area that we're spending a lot of time and effort on.
Research, we opened up a – I think we talked about this at some point in the past, that in February, we opened up a new
facility in Palo Alto focused on research. And we're doing a whole number of things around looking at applications of
blockchain and artificial intelligence and different other ways to build our data and our analytics capabilities.

And, I guess, the fifth category, I would say, would be security and cyber security. Given how important security and
trust in the payments ecosystem is, we continue to look at every possible offering that's out there related to physical and
cyber security and make sure that we're being leading edge and investing appropriately to make sure that, given the role
that we play in the ecosystem, that we're doing everything we possibly can to help make sure that transactions, as
they're flowing through the systems and transactions when they're at rest are all protected to the maximum degree
possible. So, those would be the things I would say.
Would you add anything, Vasant?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, I think the other things – Al went through, I think, a very comprehensive list. I mean
a few other things just to highlight would be continued investment in the Visa Developer platform, investments and
now rolling out Visa Checkout and Visa Token Service and mVisa around the world, a big push on mVisa in places
like India and parts of Africa; investments in our innovation centers, you've heard about the London Innovation Center
and how significant it's become; investments in core development around our innovation centers with our clients. So,
there's a lot of areas where the things we've developed are now in the process of being deployed.
<Q - Paulo E. Ribeiro>: Great. Just a quick clarification. PayPal, the rollout of the PayPal partnerships around the
world, they are not a big investment, they are not in that number, then, in those spending?
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: There's a little bit of work there, but the essence is those agreements are not a major workload
for us. It's more a matter of, actually, more change, actually, on the part of PayPal than it is on the part of us.
<Q - Paulo E. Ribeiro>: Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Your line's open.
<Q - Lisa Dejong Ellis>: Hey, guys. And, Jack, you'll be missed. One final congrats from me. Visa Checkout related
question for me. One, given the updated steps to give us on Visa Checkout, and then little bit of a more of a strategic
question, you continued to kind of fight head-to-head with Visa Checkout with these more staged wallets around the
world, whether that's with PayPal or with Alipay or now, some of the models inside of Amazon. Would you
contemplate adding more of that capability within Visa Checkout, meaning via prepaid vehicle, the ability to keep a
store balance or Visa Direct, using Visa Direct to be able to enable P2P? And why or why not?
<A - Alfred F. Kelly>: Hi, Lisa. An answer to your first question, we're nearing 23 million users who have signed,
actually signed up for Visa Checkout. I think we've talked a little bit about this. The whole wallet thing is a bit of a
mixed bag of activity around the industry and I think not necessarily the most user-friendly thing for consumers,
because there are so many options. We think of Visa Checkout more as a platform than we necessarily think about it as
a wallet.
But that said, strategically, I think anything that supports the four-party model that makes sense in terms of integration
or capability, we're going to be open to look at as we go forward, because ultimately we want to be part of the solution
of coming up with a smaller number of easy, convenient and wallet that have the type of functionality that consumers
would want and expect and help bring some of what I think is a bit of confusion around wallets and checkout in the
e-commerce world, bring a bit more order to it over time.
