Harvey Mitchell Schwartz
Thanks, Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results and
I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced
settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know, we took the total net provision for litigation and regulatory
matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter was the most significant outstanding
piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following the settlement, there's been a significant decline in
our recently possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter
levels of $5.3 billion.
Now, turning to the fourth quarter. Net revenues were $7.3 billion. Net earnings were $765 million and earnings per
diluted share were $1.27.
With respect to our annual results, we had firm wide net revenues of $33.8 billion, net earnings of $6.1 billion, earnings
per diluted share of $12.14 and the return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last
year, and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and
regulatory matters.
Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%. The growth, combined with our risk reduction efforts,
strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group,
our 2015 return on common equity would have been 380 basis points higher.
2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year as
concerns about global growth intensified. This is reflected in public equity markets with the MSCI World down 5.7%
over the last six months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the
non-investment-grade space, and most acutely, within the commodity sector.
For example, U.S. high-yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015,
the trailing 12-month default rate for U.S. non-investment grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year climbing to
4.3%.
These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunities set for our clients and as a consequence for the firm. To
varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within Investment
Banking and our investing and lending activities.
However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients
decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. Announced M&A volumes for the industry
increased by 47% in 2015. The firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share.
Our global equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the
integration of our various services: electronic, cash, derivatives and prime brokerage, as well as our global footprint.
Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths.
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a
record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25
trillion and robust net inflows which totaled $94 billion.
Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long-standing operating principle. There is tremendous value to having a diversified set
of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts.

Now, let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced
net revenues of $1.5 billion slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in
underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014, on the
back of a 40% increase in financial advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting
revenues.
Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended
the year ranked first in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately
$350 billion higher than our next closest competitor, a record gap since we've been a public company. We're also
ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for 2015.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $879 million. A
9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in the number of completed M&A transactions. We
advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including SunGard's $9.1 billion
sales to Fidelity National Information Services, General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its
transportation finance business to BMO Financial Group, and HCC Insurance Holdings' $7.5 billion sale to Tokio
Marine Holdings.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter including:
DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals; Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion
acquisition of Jarden Corporation; and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital.
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $668 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% sequentially, as debt
issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter, as IPOs
increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million, due to a
decline in leveraged finance activity.
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion
investment-grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment-grade offering,
and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and
finished at its second highest level.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were
$2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net
revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth
quarter, down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10%
quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making
conditions.
Credit decreased significantly as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads in the U.S. and low
levels of liquidity. Interest rate and currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continued
to be challenged, as spreads widen and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low.
Commodities was essentially unchanged, as client activity was muted and energy prices remained under pressure.
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year. More challenging
market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger
client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies.
In Equities, which includes Equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the
fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially, and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution
revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7%
relative to the third quarter, as global client volumes declined. Security services generated net revenues of $430 million,
up 13% sequentially.

For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year. 2015 we benefited from
several factors: a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment from security services.
Turning to risk. Average daily VAR in the fourth quarter was $71 million, down from $74 million in the third quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion
in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific
events including financings, sales, and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans
were $299 million, which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, investing and lending generated
net revenues of $5.4 billion, driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues
from debt securities and loans.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third
quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees, largely from alternative asset products. Management and
other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a
record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014 on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues.
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net
inflows into liquidity products. On a full year basis, we had long-term fixed income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows
of $23 billion and alternative inflows of $7 billion.
Moving to our performance, 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year and a
five-year basis.
Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated
into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%.
Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory
expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable
fund.
For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory
matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-compensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year.
Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year end was approximately
36,800, up 8% from year end 2014. This is a significant increase, so let's break down the drivers. Of the 2,800 of
incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other
Federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives,
particularly within Investment Management.
Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our
balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion.
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced approach. It was 13.6% using the
standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%.
With respect to our method two GSIB surcharge, we currently estimate that we are at or near the lower bucket given a
decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year.
And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we
repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately 15 million.
In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately
$1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.
Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry.
2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation

charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong
relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative
results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement to the strength of our global client franchise,
the caliber of our people, and our culture of teamwork and adaptability.
Over the past four years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in
capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares, or 14%. And most importantly, we
have been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses,
transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in
our future, and positioning the firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves.
There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges which significantly impacted market
sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events, and we maintain a healthy
respect for them. We certainly don't control the opportunity set. However, we do control several things: how we build
our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our
risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future.
We believe our firm's commitment to excellence in these areas has been and will continue to be what drives
outperformance over the long-term.
Thank you again for dialing in. I'm happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Good morning. So I guess you're in a better position than most to ask this impossible
question, but from your vantage point, everything you see, are we on the cusp of a tougher credit cycle, balance sheet
recession? Are we looking at the wrong things? Meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be
asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks, like, I'm just curious your thoughts on where
we are besides the market going down.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So look, obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a
market perspective, and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has
been disruptive to the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously, that sector of prices remain where they are is
going to be under stress. That's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting
some of the benefits of the decline in commodity prices. We'll have to see how the market evolves.
Look, these things are never going to be a straight line, and so, it's not surprising to some extent that the market is
responding to China reduced activity, volatility, and markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they
haven't moved materials since early calls. Across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn, funded and unfunded, we had just
north of $10 billion of exposure, but to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to non-investment grade entities in that
sector was $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter.
So from our perspective, we feel well-positioned, and in this kind of market environment, it's the type of market
environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them and that's what we're doing.

<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: A glass half-full question of this increase of volatility across some of the asset classes,
usually never good when clients are losing money, but is there any case to be made that FICC revenue pie can bottom
and actually grow a little bit over the next, say, two years given the changing monetary landscape, things like that,
monetary policy landscape?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: We don't generally run the businesses, as you know. You know us pretty well. We
don't run the businesses for the bull case, I mean, but there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity, the
stable to improving global growth and we're seeing that in the U.S. and we're seeing that across Europe, certainly, could
be a tailwind, diverging monetary policy could be a tailwind.
Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle, it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such
strength and contraction, but even right now, you're seeing the market, which has been under stress, be thoughtfully
selective about those transactions and there's been a lot of appetite for some parts of the market.
So I think when you look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive
environment, all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you construct a pretty aggressive bull
case for fixed income. Again, it's not the way we generally run the business, as we'll react to that as we see it. But there
certainly is an upside case.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. I appreciate that. Last one, it takes two seconds, is – did you say that you're at or
near the 250 bucket? Was that your comment about the GSIB, at or near the lower bucket? Is that what you meant by
that?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, that's correct. I mean that's our estimation. That's obviously not confirmed by
the regulators, but that's where we believe we stood at the end of the year.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you, Glenn.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Morning.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: So on investment lending, could you remind us how much of the equity portfolio you need to
divest before the 2017 Volcker deadline? And then just given the current choppy markets, what's your level of
confidence that the firm can divest those assets by 2017 and also remind us what the process for getting an extension
from the Fed is if you can't meet the 2017 deadline? Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks. So roughly, now, we're under $5 billion of capital that is sitting in funds
alongside our clients. These are obviously legacy funds. The exact number is roughly right around $4.7 billion. And
look, our expectation, given these are legacy funds, is that we'll continue to monetize those assets, and we'll see how
that progresses. There's a lot of runway between here and the compliance date in 2017. We haven't, at this stage,
contemplated seeking any additional extensions and I don't believe the industry has at this stage.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the
model. I mean the firm has been very disciplined on expenses despite effectively four years of no top-line growth. Just
curious how much more you can pull the expense lever to drive margin expansion? Or do you need some revenue
growth here going forward?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So obviously, we've done a lot of work on expenses. We were very early to
expense reduction initiatives, as you know, we started several years ago and those have continued for those businesses

that have faced headwinds and we've been investing in those businesses and we feel we've had tailwinds.
As I pointed out, head count is up 8% this year, and compensation and benefits were flat. So I think we've done a pretty
good job at this stage. We'll continue to monitor it, but at this particular – given all the work we've done, we will
always look to be more efficient, but I think we've chopped a lot of wood here.
Now, we have really, we believe, well-positioned the firm for an uptick in revenues, and even though it feels like a long
time ago now, you saw that in the first quarter of last year where on a modest upbeat in revenues year-over-year, we
produced nearly a 15% ROE. So we feel very comfortable about the upside leverage.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hi. Just on the GSIB surcharge, I think you mentioned part of that was exiting some
Level 3 assets. I don't know if there's any granularity or clarity on what that was or what you got out of, but just curious
on any color around that.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year, there was a
change to the FASB accounting, which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds, and the other
driver, obviously, relates back to Christian's question, which is as we monetize things, they become public equities. As
you know, the public equity has been hovering between $3.5 billion and $4 billion also, and that's part of the
monetization process. And obviously, once it's a public equity, you have complete transparency on pricing.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. Got it. And then, just on the expenses, I think you guys – as you mentioned, you
guys have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment. But just want to get your sense
when you think about what you're focused on, on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where
if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front? And so, whether it's
on the non-comp side, although it seems like that's running pretty low, ex the legal stuff, or on the comp side?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so I think, look, from a compensation perspective, compensation is always
going to be driven by performance, most importantly, at the firm-wide level, and then, obviously, bottoms up from
individuals through businesses and through divisions. And so, that's where I think you'll see it related to specific
performance.
We will always continue to look to be efficient. At this stage, obviously, we're making very significant investments in
regulatory compliance. We think it's critically important. We actually think it's a competitive advantage, to be
best-in-class, and so, you'll see us continually invest in tech and businesses, and over the long term, we think it's a
contributor to our performance.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. All right. And then lastly, just on I&L, given that portfolio and just given maybe
the market backdrop, if you can just remind us what portion, I guess mostly on the equity side, would be public that
you're going to see more like mark-to-market versus the portion that might be on the private side that might be more
driven by models of economic growth that's not going to swing around as much?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so coming into the end of the year, the public equity portion of the I&L
balance sheet was $4 billion notional.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Mike. How are you?
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: It's actually Matt. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sorry, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: That's okay. We used to work together, so I have no worries. If you look at the size
of the balance sheet came down by about $20 billion versus the end of the third quarter, just thinking going forward,
how do you think the size of the balance sheet trends, and then, also with respect to SLR exposure?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, so obviously, all of our capital ratios give us a great deal of flexibility to
respond to client demand. So we feel like we're well-positioned. Now, we talked about this a lot in the past, we went
through a pretty significant early shift in shrinking the balance sheet and that was really about a repricing effort. And
so, we're going to be very sensitive to marginal deployment of capital, ensuring that it's accretive in the long run. And
so, you're going to see us be pretty sensitive to the balance sheet growth, but obviously, given the strength of our
capital ratios, we have a lot of capacity.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just following up on the SLR exposure specifically, you're
obviously in excess of 5% needed pre-CCAR, but for CCAR, if you needed more, is there the availability to bring
down some of the SLR exposure with only a modest impact to revenue?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's interesting the way you asked the question, I think you're basically saying,
listen, could we reprice the balance sheet in an accretive way? If we could, we should, so we're doing that work today.
I think if the world became more constrained, then by definition, repricing would be necessary. And so, a lot of it'll be
driven by constraints, but if we found ourselves constrained in any particular category, we would make a long-term
decision about how we wanted to address that. For us, as you know, CCAR, the stress test had been the constraints.
And you saw us react to that a bit ago when we shrunk the balance sheet so dramatically.
Are you there?
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Okay. Thank you.

wondering if you can give us some color on how much of the split between FICC and equity was on a realized base
versus a marked base?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yes. So as you know, Betsy, we talk about it in the context of event-driven and
non-event-driven and that's what I talked about at the conference in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yeah.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So looking at I&L, as I said, during the quarter, net interest income was really bulk
of the driver of the debt line. And in terms of I&L relating to event and non-event-driven, most of the activity was
really event-driven or public marks, so things like refinancings, companies going public, and then the subsequent
public marks.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then, a question regarding the stress test, kind of why people are thinking
out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you
given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: We have no transparency into that level of detail with respect to the Federal
Reserve, but they're pretty comprehensive in their analysis. So one would assume everyone gets credit for their hedges.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. In your own analysis you're running, obviously, you give yourself credit for
hedges?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, in a stress scenario, they would perform, so we give ourselves credit for
them, yes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. Of course. Just want to make sure.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: But I'm not saying in like a bank holding company scenario. Or in our own
submissions.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Correct. In both.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, of course. Of course, it's just like we would model the firm under any stress
scenario.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you
could talk through a little bit on how you're positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as you know, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise, and
obviously, we have a very strong banking franchise. And so, look, this is a part of the cycle and I would say broadly
across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they're going to need capital market solutions,
they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they fit in the cost structure scheme of things.
And so, I think in a lot of respects, when you marry those two strengths together with our research and our analytic
tools, I think we feel very well-positioned to provide our clients with advice and value and solutions.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Do you see yourself taking share in this environment?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: In commodities, let's just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in
my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year. I mean as
soon as you saw the big uptick in M&A, you saw a big outperformance by our team.
In terms of the FICC activity, it's harder to see it when activity is low, but certainly, when we've gone through periods
in commodities where activity has been high, it feels to us we picked up significant share. But that's probably not
surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses, or at least they've said
they have, over the last couple of years globally.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. I guess I'll go to energy, and how big a deal is this oil price decline to you guys? I mean you've
mentioned you only have $1.5 billion in funded non-investment grade exposure, but your total exposure is over $10
billion. Where could you potentially otherwise get hurt from the decline in oil prices other than that funded
non-investment grade exposure? And where could the industry otherwise get hurt where you might have to pay
attention to some of the counterparties that you have?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, well, from a counterparty exposure, our counterparty risk we feel good about
right now. I think I mentioned on an earlier call, if you take, for example, the commodity trade houses, our exposure to
those is less than $200 million, as we sit here today. And when I talk about the $10.6 billion that I brought out earlier,
$6.4 billion of that – again, this is funded and unfunded. It's not funded. $6.4 billion of that is investment grade, so the
maximum potential exposure we get in non-investment grade companies would be $4.2 billion. And that's the absolute
exposure. That's not recoveries or anything like that, Mike.
So in terms of our capital position, I think we're relatively well-positioned. I haven't dug through all the peer banks like
you have, but, look, for us, while we're very focused about it and we're certainly not being complacent about it, we feel
pretty front-footed, even on a relative basis, we have smaller exposures.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: What sort of reserves...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think, Mike, for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today, but
you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on long-term economic activity or
economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question – and it's just an opinion. Lots of folks will be on
either side of this discussion. When we talk to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is
focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long-term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost
across the globe. But that's how the market is reacting to it now, so there may be information content in that too.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: What sort of reserves do you have against that $10 billion exposure? I guess some of it's
mark-to-market, but some of it's not.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, of the $10 billion, obviously, we're being thoughtful about our exposure. I can
tell you, for example, on the non-investment grade side, those reserves run in high single-digit percentages for that part
of the portfolio.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. So, lastly, just are you able to hedge some of that exposure? Are you helping your clients to
hedge? Are you getting additional business activity due to this? And if you could just elaborate on the benefit to
consumers, because certainly, people aren't paying much attention to that if that's there?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, I can't quantify the benefit of consumers to you, but obviously, over time,
this translates into more purchasing power, because obviously, it's a good thing that people are paying less at the pump.
The obvious offset to that, and it may be more acute in the U.S., is obviously, there's a lot of pain in the sector and
that'll lead to increased unemployment specifically in the sector and it has infrastructure spend impact.
In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case-by-case basis. It really depends specifically under the underlying and
where we can and we think we should, obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this
move, because it came down so quickly, is it really did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the

downside. Obviously, in these low price levels across commodities, you'd expect to see a pickup in the consumer side
of hedging activity and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic, and usually, what
happens when they're this sudden is there's a bit of stepping back. But certainly, we're well-positioned to provide
hedges across the broad commodity space.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hey. So I wanted to broaden out the sort of market share of activity question that came up
before with respect to commodities, more broadly, with respect to FICC globally. We've seen so much retrenchment,
including a big domestic player recently. So any signs yet that the retrenchment of competitors in the area is helping
market share or helping pricing? And to what extent is what you're seeing there or the expectation of what you'll see
there really driving some of that invest in the business that you were talking about?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, we've certainly seen it across parts of the businesses. It's been somewhat
episodic. Obviously, we talked about it before. We've seen it in security services and prime brokerage, a bit of a
retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to
that business.
We've seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now, last year, year-and-a-half, and then, in fixed
income, one of the things that shouldn't get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our firm is that while it
was a difficult market for the micro products, for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest
rates, for currencies, and while commodities was improved, it came up with very strong year prior, I think that we're
seeing it when activity picks up.
Now, in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising
that you need to have a couple of or several tough years and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think we
may see this over the next couple of years, now that we've been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and
where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these
things, all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018-2019
compliance periods.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sorry. That was a long answer, but – it was a big question, but it was a long
answer.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: No it's a helpful answer. So I mean it sounds like you are – you've lost none of your
confidence in the opportunity there. It just takes a while.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, in terms of the competitive set, I think that's our read today. Look, in terms of
monitoring the businesses, we're always monitoring the businesses. I think one of the things that – one of the things that
we haven't talked a lot about or we haven't talked directly about is our philosophy on how we manage cyclical
businesses. Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry. And one of the things that we've
been very thoughtful about is not over-investing at the top of the market, so you didn't see us do that in 2009 when
FICC had a record year, and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle.

Now, we were early to the cost cutting, because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we
manage through the cycle, and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We
cut thousands of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s, but right now, given all the work we've done on the
cost side, we don't feel like we need to catch up. So we'll see how the year goes if the trends in fixed income continue,
we'll continue to manage the business as efficiently as possible.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's real helpful. And then, just the follow-up question since no one asked it, I'll ask,
I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been god-awful, but how would you
characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's only two weeks, so I'm not going to really extrapolate it. We generally don't
root for the S&P 500 to be down 8% in the first two weeks of the year though.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, fair enough.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Maybe we just talk a little bit about M&A with the volatility that we've
seen in the market, I think some have been concerned, I guess, about the impact on M&A, I guess, both in the
near-term and what it means for the cycle. Just maybe your broad thoughts on where we are in that cycle and what
you're seeing in the conversation levels today.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So again, obviously, we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last
year, and Goldman Sachs' market share grew dramatically with that. I think you have to take a step back and you have
to ask yourself what are the factors that drove the M&A environment or call it over the past 18 months, and are they
still in place, and those core factors are – was really limited organic growth, companies were struggling to find top-line
growth, you had positive but modest economic growth in major economies and companies have done quite a bit of
work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle and there was a high level of CEO and board confidence. Those
were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity.
As we sit here today after a couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly
diminished. We saw a very volatile August, and yet, in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our
backlog higher than last year. And so, I think that we'll have to see, obviously, if markets stand distressed and you get
into questions about financeability and other headwinds and then it leads to a loss of confidence, but we wouldn't say
that two weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&A trend, but we'll see how these markets keep
going.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Fair enough. Then maybe just a follow-up, in asset management, you had $48 billion
of flows in liquidity products in the fourth quarter. That seemed pretty high. Can you – what were the drivers there? Is
it sort of a seasonal thing or are you seeing some market share gains there, and as profitability improves with higher
rates, do you see that as an opportunity?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: When you look across multiple quarters in asset management for us and you look at
the flows, and you look at them versus the competitors', I think you'd say we were gaining share. Obviously, it's been a
strategic focus for us to grow that business. In that quarter, in particular, I think it was a combination of volatile
markets and increasing rates which brought money, and obviously, we're a leader in the money market business. And
so, it was a catalyst for inflows.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Just a quick question on energy follow-up here, I think you said $10 billion of
total exposure, roughly two-thirds in investment grade. Is it right for us then to apply that sort of two-to-one investment
grade to below investment grade to your funded book as well and sort of back into about $3 billion funded IG
exposure?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so why don't I just give you the – I'll just give you the numbers, so you have
all the detail. So $10.6 billion is what I would call total potential exposure, funded is $1.8 billion, unfunded $8.8
billion. And of the funded, non-investment grade is $1.5 billion and you could get an incremental $2.7 billion funded
on that side, but that's the total exposure.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So Basel published the updated guidance for the market risk calculations last week. I
recognized the document and some of the calculations are pretty – the documents then, calculations are involved. I
didn't know if you had done any preliminary analysis on the impact this might have on your pro forma market risk
assets?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So you're talking about the fundamental review of the trading book that
came out last week.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Yeah, precisely.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so as you said, it's a pretty big document. It's – I think it was over 90 pages.
We've had the team going through it. I don't have any specific quantification for you. It think it'd be too early for me to
put that out there, and we still haven't even seen an NPR from the Federal Reserve. So we'll have to see how this
evolves.
I would say the high level read is that from the early documents and the early discussion, it seems like the regulators
and the industry made continual progress in terms of trying to find the right balance. But at this stage, for us, I don't see
it being a significant impact, but we'll give you more detail.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. And I suppose over the last few quarters, it does look like market risk assets have
been steadily declining. I didn't know if that reduction was in anticipation of what might be tougher rules, or are there
other factors that are really driving that decline?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. Definitely – certainly not anticipation of this, I mean just to be clear, we'll
approach this rule like we've approached all the other rules. We don't want to try adjust our business, potentially have a
negative impact to our clients. The one good thing – regulators have been very thoughtful about the runway to rule
adoption, and this is something that we have till 2019. So the industry is going to have time to make adjustments, and I
think that's in everyone's best interest, because it actually will be less disruptive to markets to the extent to which a rule
is significant.
And we've seen that in all the rules. And so you'll see us approach this rule the way we've approached all the other
rules, but we haven't even seen, as I said, a Fed NPR, so we'll see how that goes. But any reduction in market
risk-weighted assets is really a reflection of client activity.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Got it. Okay. And just one quick follow up. I did see that the advance core Tier 1 did, in
fact, decline quarter-on-quarter. I assume that's a function of the increase in operational risk tied to the settlement, but
didn't know if it was attributable to something else.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, that's correct. So the settlement added $21 billion to operational risk assets and
had a corresponding decline in the ratio of roughly 40 basis points.

<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Matt. How are you?
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: I'm good. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. I guess starting on M&A, we've heard
across both you and, to a lesser extent, some of your competitors about the potential for market share gains as some
non-U.S. participants back away. But I think that's mostly focused – those comments are mostly focused on the trading
side of things. Given your market share gains in M&A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with
Investment Banking, and specifically M&A transactions?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the league tables, but – and I may not
have this perfectly accurate, but the last time I spoke to our team about this, I think it was really there's a segment of
banks which lost share to some of the boutiques, and then there's firms like ourselves which obviously gained market
share broadly across the board. And we took share from everyone else.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then, just on FICC and trading, you've given us some helpful commentary,
and I realize it's early days in the year and the quarter, but I guess I'm curious sort of what the level of rate positioning
within your client base has been. Did that change dramatically late in the fourth quarter with the Fed's action, and has it
changed much so far this year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Not a significant factor. Really nothing to comment on that. Obviously, the Federal
Reserve did a very good job of communicating to the marketplace the first rate increase in December, and I think, to a
great extent, that ended up being a non-event, which is a good thing. And so, early in the quarter, it was influencing
client activity, but by the time the event occurred, obviously, it wasn't significant.

Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. How are you, Harvey? I've obviously heard everything that you've said this morning,
and I recognize, of course, that you don't run the business to any particular metric or ratio, but to the extent that revenue
conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and, call it, around that $34 billion level, is there a path
to generate incremental positive operating leverage for you?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's an interesting question. I'm going to modify it a little bit because of the way I
heard it. Maybe I'm not modifying, because this is the way I heard it. I think you're saying if I knew over the next
couple of years, let's just say we had a crystal ball and with certainty, I knew that the firm is going to produce $34
billion over the next couple of years.
Well, I guess what you're saying is the things that we've elected to invest in, we shouldn't be investing in. And so, I
think we wouldn't invest for growth, because you're telling me it wouldn't be there, but that's not our expectation. We
see growth in parts of our businesses. And so, where we see growth and where we think we can take share of, we're
going to invest. And again, we run the firm for multiple years. And so – but that's the way I would think about
answering the question, but we see opportunities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And what conditions would arise or what would be the signals to you that, in fact, it is
appropriate to retrench on some of the growth opportunities?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, we always evaluate and in the end of the day, it's really about the dialogue
with the clients. The dialogue with the clients, so let's take M&A. We just talked about – these things are interesting,
because now the current concern is that M&A may slow down. Five years ago, you'll remember the dialogue was M&A
is never coming back.
And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client
dialogue told us there were factors that were influencing decisions, that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn't
tell us that no one would ever do mergers again.
And so, when we see – when we listen to the client, and we know, for example, that our clients in fixed income still
value the services, there just may be lower volumes, that's how we'll inform our strategy over the long run. But
obviously, we're not being complacent. You've seen all the things we've done. We've returned significant capital. We've
cut costs. We were early to all those things. We reduced risk, improved our ratio. So we're certainly not sitting still
here.

Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years, but there's a lot going on.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And so, it sounds as if then the indication is at this stage there is no change in client
dialogue or demands or expectations.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Certainly not, after the first couple of weeks of the year, no.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Morning.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Harvey, building on what you were just talking about, what are the things as the pipeline keeps
building quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, that the customers are saying are delaying? So what factors do you need to see
some of that pent-up demand begin to get released and accelerate some of the activities you've seen even at the levels
last year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think, look, again, at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth.
And what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic
growth. It might be isolated to specific markets, but really that's what was driving activity levels.
I think more than anything else, client conviction. And I mean that in all spaces, whether we're managing a client's
money, their conviction, their confidence, whether we're advising on a merger transaction, the CEO and the board and
the CFOs, their confidence levels. The same thing exists in the capital markets businesses and fixed income and
equities. Now what leads to that? Confidence and economic growth, reduced uncertainty, and so, those are the factors
that fuel activity.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: I'll ask you, I'll say, a more esoteric kind of question, but I think it has some pertinence to what's
going on. Given the rules that limited your ability and all the market maker's ability to take on any risk turning you
basically into a conduit of transactions, when we see these types of disruptions in the marketplace, what are your
traders saying in a sense of, how activities and clearing levels and new equilibriums get reached when there isn't really
any buffer still left in the market? So we're seeing some of the ramifications of Volcker now in distressed markets
which can have, I think, some very unfavorable effects just on trading levels to get to a new clearing equilibrium.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Look, I don't know if you and I are going to solve that heated debate on a lot of
different sides around the benefits of regulation which are, obviously, numerous versus some of the unintended
consequences, potentially around liquidity. I would say listen, we feel like we have more than adequate capital and
liquidity to be there for our clients, and that's how we're positioning ourselves.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: I guess I'll just – do you feel like the answers at certain times get to be overblown one way or
another because of that unintended consequence?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think that there's a very complicated question, which is very difficult for anyone
to answer, which is my own view, there's not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across
industries. I think something that's very difficult for anyone to quantify is what is the economic impact of the collection
of rules that have been put in place since the financial crisis that impact capital liquidity, derivatives, all sorts of things.
I just think that it's very hard to anticipate the combined effect of all that. But for us, we're just focused on the clients,
Marty.

<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then, do you think the market is evolving to adapt to all of that? And how far along in that
process are we? And that's the last piece of that question. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think firms are in different places. We've obviously invested tremendously in risk
reduction change, technology tools, educating our people. I think we feel pretty far along the curve, you see it in our
capital ratios, and in the firm's balance sheet and how much it's changed over the last couple of years, but I think it
varies across the industry, and so, I really can't speak to everybody else.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: All right. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Hi. Thanks. Just a quick question on Investment Management. I mean you benefited from a
couple acquisitions there over the last year. Do you actually budget for growth from acquisitions as you look forward
and what's the investment in that area expected to be?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So you've seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions. The one I think you're
referring to this year was Pacific Global Advisors which was $18 billion in assets and they're focused on the pension
and retirement space. We don't budget for acquisitions at all; we do it on a case-by-case basis. And acquisitions,
generally, I'll just simplify it, they either give us the capability that we don't have today and we think it's better for us to
bolt it on versus build it organically, or they actually fit a current strength where we can add scale. That's kind of the
extreme end of the spectrum in terms of how we think about them. But it's 100% case-by-case.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the Basel III, I'm sorry if I missed it, but did
you give the RWA for the fully phased-in ratios?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, I didn't. For the – you want the fully phased-in?
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Correct, yeah.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, for fully phased-in, we are at – sorry, $430 billion of credit risk and $104
billion of market risk, sorry about that. I was looking at – that's standardized and under advanced, $587 billion that's
$103 billion in operational, $353 billion in credit risk, $103 billion in market risk. Sorry about that.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: That's okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks. So Harvey, just on that same topic, it looks like your standardized RWA
sequentially came down 10%. And I just wanted to know, first, what's the driving force behind that and just given the
magnitude of the decline, and also, just to clarify, that's the number that matters for the CCAR submission, if I
remember correctly, is that right?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: That's correct. So the standardized is the ratio used in CCAR and the driver – the
bulk of the driver was really in derivative notionals.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Excellent. I appreciate you accommodating the follow-up.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No problem.
