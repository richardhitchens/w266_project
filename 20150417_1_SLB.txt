First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44
sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of
pre-tax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the head count reduction of 11,000 as well as an
incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties
of the current environment.
In Venezuela during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 to the U.S. dollar was eliminated and
replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF 192 as of the end of the
quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. After this charge, the U.S.
dollar value of our bolívar-denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the bolívar
will not have a significant impact on our results.
Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially while pre-tax operating margin decreased 255
basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the
absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced last quarter. The
remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines. Despite the very challenging environment, pre-tax
operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially, which resulted in decremental margins of only 33%. This is a
result of prompt and proactive cost management across the organization.
It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this
phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pre-tax operating income. This reflects the benefits of our local
cost structure which largely serves as a natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line.
Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased
21% sequentially, while margins decreased 447 basis points to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally
lower multiclient and software sales and the fall in the higher margin exploration activity. Drilling Group revenue of $4
billion decreased 15% sequentially, while margins only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven
by the severe rig count drop in North America. Production Group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially,
and margins fell by year 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressures in North
America land.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first
quarter compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter. This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of
our pre-tax income in North America during Q1.
As we call this throughout the year, the ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We
generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter to
$5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is
driven by the annual associated bonus employee compensation as well as the payment of $245 million in severance
during the quarter.
Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is
because during the downturn, we continue to reduce our investment in CapEx, and working capital requirements will
also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings.
During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares at an average price of $82.98. We spent
$606 million on CapEx. Full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is now expected to be
approximately $2.5 billion.
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.

Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated
pricing pressure. International activity was lower as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and
was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies
against the U.S. dollar. In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact in our pre-tax
operating margins to through prompt and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation
program.
This is reflected in our first quarter international margins, which are essentially flat sequentially and are up
year-over-year. We have also delivered better decrementals than in any previous downturn with sequential decremental
margins as low as 33%, with North America and the international areas achieving 39% and 25% respectively.
The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly in North America, have been almost unprecedented, and
we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. And while we thought we had adequate plans in place
going into the quarter, activity declined even faster than expected, which required us to revise our plans accordingly.
This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000
employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15% compared to the peak of the third quarter of
2014.
Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow before
restructuring payments during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash even in
these market conditions, and we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or
more of our net income into free cash flow.
By geography, our North American revenues decreased 25% sequentially, which was significantly lower than the 32%
drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially to 12.9%. In spite
of the severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39%, as we remained fully focused
on flawless execution and proactive cost management.
In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins while activity also dropped significantly in
Canada, where the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early spring breakup. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,
deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we are seeing a steady change in service mix from
exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts for most of our customers.
On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services, although some of this impact
was mitigated through increased new technology uptake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and
Infinity completions products. In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached
unsustainable levels. However, we are being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the
avoidance of loss-making contracts.
We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion costs by focusing on the savings that
new workflows and technologies can bring. We are doing this through our technology integration groups that house the
full range of shale expertise, spanning formation evaluation, drilling, stimulation, and completions. The experts making
up these integration groups are located in the various shale basins in North America land, and have both the scientific
understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology
offering, which they combine to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well.
The track record we have established over the past five years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of
new business models to our customers, where we initially absorb the incremental costs linked to our workflows and
technologies in return for an upside based on the actual production results.
One example of our unique shale technologies is HiWAY, which helps customers increase production and ultimate
recovery while using less water and proppant. In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with the HiWAY
technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the best three months of production compared to wells
stimulated with conventional treatments.

HiWAY technology also helps save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of
proppant n more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complemented and extended by
the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence, which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers
in both new well completions and in refracturing of old wells.
In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effects,
and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in
revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pre-tax operating margins, which was essentially flat with the
previous quarter at 24.1%. This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource
management, and the acceleration of our transformation program, which together were able to offset the margin impact
from both reduced activity and the pricing pressure we were seeing from all customer groups.
In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by
carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins, and by always aiming to trade
any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms.
Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially, while pre-tax operating
margin improved by 30 basis points to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue
in the Asia-Pacific region and by lower product and software sales, but was partially offset by robust activity in the
GCC region. Year-on-year revenue decreased 5% and margins grew by 230 basis points.
In Middle East region, our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter, and
we expect solid drilling activity going forward together with more fracturing and rigless work. In the United Arab
Emirates, development activity on the North Island of the SARB project has now started, with more rig additions
planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded a five-year contract for the supply
of integrated well construction services, with further details provided in our earnings press release.
Activity in the rest of the GCC countries was also strong in the first quarter. While in Iraq, revenues in the north remain
muted at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014 and activity in the south of the country was steady around the
levels seen in the fourth quarter. In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter, but
activity also declined in the rest of the regions as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented.
In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margin improved 59 basis points to
21.5%. Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, as customer budgets were cut
and also by the fall in value of the Venezuelan bolívar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity
increases in Venezuela, Argentina, and Ecuador.
Year-on-year revenue decreased 6% and margins grew by 39 basis points. In Venezuela, activity continued to improve
with PDVSA and with several of the joint ventures in the Faja, while activity is also wrapping up in Trinidad. In
Mexico, revenue increased significantly on the combination of customer budget cuts as well as seasonal weather affects
that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected land development activity, although some
expiration work was also delayed.
Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak with the deepwater slow down continuing as
Petrobras announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remained resilient in the first quarter,
driven by simulation work and continued new technology uptake in the Vaca Muerta, and with new project startups
offsetting the completion of others.
In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenues fell 17% sequentially, with margins declining by 133 basis points to 21%.
Year-on-year revenue decreased 12%, and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to
continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia.
In the UK North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history as customer spending decelerated,
while rig count in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In sub-Saharan Africa, both development
and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Nigeria, activity was flat sequentially, while work

in Libya was limited to offshore locations with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter.
Looking at the industry as a whole, the current financial challenges will not disappear even if oil prices were to recover
to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is therefore forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs
and create more project value. And we've seen a much closer collaboration between operators and large service
companies as a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives.
At Schlumberger we are ready to enter into these types of collaborations, and based on our technical and financial
strength, we are also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models where we are compensated based on the
solutions we have designed as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently
being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions.
Turning to the 2015 outlook, visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest drop in E&P investments
to occur in North America where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. We further believe that a
recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as
the refracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short
of reaching previous levels and extending the period of weak pricing.
In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15%, which will create challenges in terms of
both activity and pricing levels but considerably less than the headwind seen in North America. The reduction in
international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels but also with some pricing impact for basic
technologies, and with the continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more
development activity.
In terms of geography, we expect the GCC states of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015 as the core part of
OPEC prepares to recoup market share as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. Elsewhere, we expect
to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America, led by Mexico and Brazil; in Europe and
Africa, led by the North Sea and sub-Sahara Africa; and in Asia, led by China, Malaysia, and Australia. In Russia,
conventional land activity in Russia and Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from
Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate.
While the global fall in activity level is severe, we remain focused on things we can control, which are our cost and
resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise, and the quality and integrity of the products
and services we provide. We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings based on
our favorable international leverage, our peer technology leadership in North America shale, and the acceleration of our
transformation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue
market share, slow earnings per share reductions than our peers in the coming quarters, and continue to reduce working
capital and CapEx intensity while delivering unmatched levels of free cash flow.
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Ole Slorer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah, thanks a lot, and congrats with some pretty magnificent effects on these efficiency
initiatives that you're implementing. But my opening question would be, Paal, if you could just update us on your kind
of macro thoughts, same way as you did on the previous two quarters? And your comments that the markets might be
tightening in the second half of the year, particularly with respect to how you see sort of non-OPEC, non-U.S., that sort
of 50 million barrel a day bracket be affected by the lack of investment that we've seen over the past couple of years?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, sure. Thank you, Ole. So our view of the macro hasn't really changed compared to what
we said both on the October and January call. First of all, the 2015 oil demand remains strong and was actually revised
upwards in the latest IEA report to now be about 1.1 million barrels per day. While in the supply side, we continue to
see the market share battle playing out globally.
Now the key question as we discussed before is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up
in the supply numbers, and the latest production data for March is now showing the first signs of a tightening in supply.
And we are basically looking at three main indicators. The first one is the core OPEC spare capacity, which was down
by 400,000 barrels in March to 2.5 million barrels.
The other one is the one you allude to, which is the non-NAM, non-OPEC production, which showed a slight
weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend
internationally, we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year. And the third one, which everyone is
looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production, which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on
this, as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year, so really
no major change to our view on the macro.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay, good to hear. And the follow-up question would just be on where you think you stand on
your goals that you outlined at the analyst day last summer. I think you mentioned that you expected to be in the sixth
or seventh inning or something like that by 2017, but it looks as if things are going a lot faster. So just in terms of just
understanding the kind of momentum and how much more there is to – juice there is to squeeze out of this lemon,
could you give us some your latest view on that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Sure. So if you look at how we are driving business performance today, which I know that the
focus is around managing decrementals, there's really three components that are part of driving this performance. First
is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization where we have in the past couple of years taken
teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new level. So this allows us now to plan and
execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, right. And this is a process that's been going on for a number of
years and I think it really demonstrated our capabilities coming from this transformation in the first quarter.
And the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management. And this includes both our internal cost
structures as well as the third-party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area as well, these
efforts are going to continue into the second quarter. And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to,
which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here we said we would be in the sixth to
seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today we are probably in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball
terminology.
It's a multi-year program. It's going to bring a steady contribution to our performance. And we are today actively
looking to accelerate the pace of this implementation and it's a great pull from the entire organization now to accelerate
this and I'm very pleased with the overall progress in terms of how we're doing.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thanks for clarifying. I'll hand it back.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you, Ole.
Operator
Thank you. The next question from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to actually reference your presentation of a few weeks
ago, which I thought was one of the better efforts not only from Schlumberger but just from any industry participant in
some time. So first of all, with regard to a question regarding business model, you've referenced this in your earnings
release. You've also referenced it several times, being prepared to move to more risk-based business models and
specifically the significant opportunity associated with the refracking of older wells. So what kind of uptake are you

seeing with regard to the refracking opportunity? And when you describe this as a significant opportunity, can you
quantify what that means in terms of how large it is?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at the work we've done so far and we posted some of the recent results in the
earnings press release this quarter, a lot of the refrac focus so far has been around being able to identify the candidates,
and that's based on our understanding of the existing completions and the potential that these still hold. And then the
other part is around how do you effectively do the refracturing while minimizing the costs. So we have through our
engineer completion, shale formation evaluation capabilities as well as BroadBand Sequence, now established that
broad technology offering.
So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for
refracturing, and this is both shale liquids and shale gas. In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions
in terms of revenue opportunities over an extended period of time, but this is quite a significant market opportunity.
And I think the key here is that we are so confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the
refracturing work that we are prepared to take significant risk in terms of how we go about doing this work. We are in
many cases, if we can select the candidates, prepared to foot the entire bill for the refracturing work and then get paid
back in production.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And then second question is more of a macro question. You had, again, referencing
back to this presentation that you did a couple weeks ago, the global drilling intensity slide in which you juxtaposed the
2014 production numbers from the big three liquids producers, roughly the same at about 11 million barrels per day,
but significantly different levels of drilling activity to generate that output, 36,000 wells U.S., 8,700 wells for Russia,
and 399 wells for Saudi Arabia. And you also mentioned a host of markets that you didn't identify but significantly
lower than the U.S. with regard to drilling intensity.
So you stated that basically required level of drilling intensity for many of these markets to keep production flat. But
the question that I have is not only to keep production flat but the production – the flexibility and the wherewithal to
increase production with increased drilling intensity, can you speak to that please?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What we're saying with our slide is that over time as basins mature, in order to firstly maintain
production and subsequently increase production, which I think in many of the land basins we would be looking to do
that in the coming years, you will have to increase drilling intensity. That's the basic message. So I think you're seeing
that increase in drilling intensity happening in many basins around the world today.
The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we are seeing today in North America land, but that's
basically because in many – in most of the other basins, we are still working within the conventional resource base.
And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in
drilling intensity from that. But I would say even in the conventional basins, there is a growing drilling intensity, which
we are then looking to capitalize on both through the subsurface integration of the bottom hole assembly as well as now
going forward with our focus on establishing our Rig of the Future.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thank you, sir.

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay, I'm on. Thanks. Relative to Bill's question I guess, I find the most fascinating thing
about the call today is you're willing to propose a range of different business models, take some incremental technology
risk, and you talk about a new way of working together. So we're not just talking refrac market in the U.S. You're
sounding like a whole new business model of how service companies and oil companies will operate in the future. I
don't mean to sound too Star Trek-y, but you're proposing something other than – I mean in the past, companies have
been willing to take participation or risk at the bottom of the cycle, but you're talking about a structural change in the
industry it sounds like.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I do, yes, and I think it's going to be very important for the overall performance of the industry
that all the players that have something to contribute, not only to the implementation and execution part of the work we
do, but also to how we design the solutions of what we are looking to build and develop; that they're all invited to the
table. And I would say, still remaining humble, I think we from the Schlumberger side, we have a lot to contribute
when it comes to supporting the design decisions that many of our customers take for major drilling and completions
developments.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: There is no question that you have more expertise than most any other oil company, but
having worked for both oil companies and service companies, if a service company comes to meet an oil company and
says let me show you a better way to do stuff, the first reaction is I got engineers that know how to do it. So this is
pretty much a change in psychology, if you would, or how the industry operates. You're talking about this isn't a quick
implementation, I would think, but over time?
<A - Simon Ayat>: No, it's not a quick implementation, and it's not something that we can do by ourselves. And
further, let me be very clear. We're not saying that we can do the work our customers are doing better. But I think given
the capabilities that we have, I think we are underutilized today, and we have a lot more to contribute even into the
design elements of the work that is related to our expertise. And I think by being invited to the table to contribute,
complementing what they are doing, I think we can achieve improvements in design and engineer costs out of the
system before we go to implementation. And by factoring in our implementation, our execution capabilities in the
design, I think we can also simplify and streamline the execution part of the work as well.
So this is something that we are going to offer, Jim. Some of our customers might take us up on it and some of the
others might not. And for the ones that are not, we will continue to work the way we're currently doing. But I think this
is something that we believe can bring significant value and something that we are prepared to take on and also put
some more skin in the game.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: I think that's fabulous, congratulations. Thanks and good quarter, guys. Thanks.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Thank you. David Anderson with Barclays, your line is open.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Thanks. It's a related question to what Jim was asking. I was just wondering more
specifically around offshore development and exploration. Obviously, with lower oil prices, it's a really challenging
market right now. Some would even say the IOC business model is broken. It looks to us like maybe a couple years this
could be in a slowdown here. So I'm just wondering; this is a pretty big part of your business. Schlumberger's oil – the
services part in the scheme of things isn't a huge part. Can you just help us – give us a bit of a roadmap for how you
think some of the IOCs are going to navigate through the deepwater and exploration and how you see this progressing
in order to get this fixed?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think if you look at deepwater first, this represents a huge resource base for the industry. Now
given the level of development cost today as well as given the level of recovery factors that we're seeing today, the cost
per barrel for these type of developments is challenged. So there has to be a change overall in how deep developments
are done. We have to get the cost down and we also have to drive recovery up. And if you can do both, I think a large

part of the reserve base and the discovery base that we have established over the past decade in deepwater can and will
be developed. So I think this is a challenge that the industry has, and we are prepared to contribute towards finding the
right solutions. And I think when the industry really puts their mind to something, we will find a solution and it will be
sorted out.
As to deepwater exploration, I think the playbook we're seeing now is the normal one. Exploration is the first thing that
can be cut, which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production. Looking at the current levels
of exploration spend today it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved anytime soon, at
least not in 2015. But it is very clear that this level of exploration spend is not going to continue for many years.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay. And I've got a separate topic talking about North America. You've talked about how
the rig count won't go back to peak levels, and I think we can all agree upon that. Now you talked a lot about the
commentary around refracking opportunities and clearly you see that as a big opportunity going forward. But what are
some of the other structural trends that you think are influencing that view? What are the other kind of components that
as you think about North America and how – I'm not sure if you can give us an idea of where you think that rig count
can be, kind of a normalized rig count, if you will, but can you talk about some of the other factors structurally that are
impacting that view?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think if you look at what's taken place over the past three years, four years in shale liquids in
North America, there has been a significant growth in activity and there's been a growing free cash flow deficit for the
E&P industry. So that's clearly not a sustainable way of the whole industry to operate there. Now with that said I think
there is a core part of the North America shale liquids that is viable even at the current oil prices, and this will continue
to be developed. Now as we go forward, as the industry continues to improve, I would say both on the cost side,
although a lot has already been done, but even more so on the production per well, I think there can be a growing part
of the, I would say, Tier 2 and Tier 3 acreage that can be developed.
But as of now I think we are limited more to the Tier 1 acreage at these type of world prices. And that's why we're
saying that given the cash flow constraints, we don't expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous
levels around 2,000. It's going to come back to somewhere in between the current levels and where it was. And for the
service industry, that means that the pricing concessions that are currently being given, we unfortunately are going to
have to live with for a while because there's going to be a pretty significant overcapacity for all sorts of services given
the lower activity level that we're going to recover to.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Great. Thank you, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Thank you. Next question's from Jim Crandell with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Thank you. Great performance, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: My question has to do with overall trend in international revenues and margins for here. If we
look back at past cycles, often the international business trends materially lag that of North America. I understand some
things are different this time but might we be looking at generally a deteriorating overall level of E&P spend and
maybe even Schlumberger revenue over the next 12 months?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at our view on total E&P spend globally, splitting it into North America and
international, we are saying that the reduction in spend internationally is going to be significantly lower than what you
see in North America. North America's going to be well above 30% while we are saying around 16% for international.
So I think the key beyond what the spend reduction is and you're already seeing that spend reduction and by the way,
international spend was more or less flat already in 2014.

I think the key from our side is the underestimated, I would say, resilience in our international business performance. I
mean if you look at how we've been managing to keep margins and also to continue to protect our overall earnings
capacity in the international business, we are doing a pretty good job. And I think even with a 15% reduction in E&P
spend, our revenue year-over-year was down 8% in the first quarter and our operating income was down 3%. So the
key here is our ability to continue to generate earnings even in very challenging market conditions.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Well, do you think that given your comments, have you seen your overall bottom in
international revenues or do you think your overall international revenues will probably trend lower from the first
quarter levels?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: At this stage, we see both North America and international revenue coming down further in
Q2. That's fair, but I would say more so in North America than in international.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: And do you think that, that will represent the bottom or do you think there could be further
slippage in revenues, particularly internationally in the second half of the year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I would say that the revenue reductions in Q2 are slowing in pace, I'm not ready to say that it's
the bottom yet.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay, good. Thank you very much.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Thanks, Paal. If I could follow up quickly on the refrac opportunity, I'm curious as to
what the suite of services are and how they're different from a conventional primary frac job. I imagine it's a lot more
analysis involved. Can you just sort of walk us through what the workflow looks like and the level of intellectual
capital that's employed in the process?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Sure. The overall workflow starts with us basically getting the well file and the well data from
the operator. Our team of experts is then reviewing hundreds of candidate wells and we are picking the ones that we
believe have the highest potential for increasing production after refracking treatment. So they're looking at the
completion, they're looking at whatever formation evaluation data we have, and then coming up with our candidate
selection.
Now in terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is pull the pump out of
the well and then prepare the well but beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment and we basically pump a
normal fracturing job, but with a BroadBand Sequence pills spaced into the job, generally then plugging off the existing
perforations that have already been fracked to be able to elevate the pressure in the well to fracture the additional
perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed. So the key enablers here are the ability of
our subsurface experts to identify the right well candidate. And in addition to that, the BroadBand Sequence technology
where we can actually divert fracturing fluid into the perforations that haven't properly been fractured in the first place.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: And is there any limitation in terms of the initial completion, the hardware, the
construction of that well? Any physical limitation?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Great. If I could ask a follow-up for Simon real quick, just on the working capital
numbers. The receivable turns looked pretty good but the working capital use in the first quarter was still pretty high. Is
that inventory? Can you delve into that a little bit, Simon?

<A - Simon Ayat>: Hi, Michael. Yeah. Normally, we have a seasonality to working capital and the first quarter is a
quarter where we consume working capital. And this year around, actually, receivables was a positive. Inventory stayed
flattish but the biggest consumption was on the accounts payable and employee payable. The first quarter, we basically
meet all the requirement of the incentives, the bonuses of the previous year. And as we highlighted, we also had the
payment associated with the restructuring of $245 million. So the main impact on the working capital came from the
other elements that I highlighted. And it was over $1 billion, by the way, Michael.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Yeah, that $245 million was in that then as well?
<A - Simon Ayat>: $245 million was the restructuring costs with Venezuela. Obviously, it's not a cash element.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Yeah. Right. Right. Okay.
<A - Simon Ayat>: The biggest issue is, as I mentioned, the accounts payable and employee payable. It was more than
$1 billion of deterioration.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: And then, Simon, Paal mentioned 75%-plus free cash flow conversion as a target. The
free cash flow deployment in the repurchase program was also impressively high. Is there a target there that we can
apply going forward?
<A - Simon Ayat>: So as we always said, Michael, the number for – or the amount that we will spend on a buyback is
always a balancing number. Our priorities to invest in the business, whether it's CapEx or future revenue stream, SPM,
multi-client, and then the dividend obviously we will continue to meet our commitment and revise it every year and the
balancing period will always be the buyback. And during the downturn, the conversion rate is always helping.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Higher, yeah.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Yes.

Thank you. The next question's from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: It's great to see when everything – the whole plan comes into fruition and everything you
outlined last year at your June energy investor day, so congrats on that performance.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: You're welcome. The follow-up question I've been having and we had an opportunity to canvas a
number of different investors last night, and it still seems the primary question on everybody's mind from this point
forward is how sustainable is this relative performance on decrementals. I think you addressed it broadly in your
commentary about the execution and transformation and so on.
And I think the million-dollar question out there is, are the decremental margins going to moderate into the second
quarter and then second half of the year from where they are in the first quarter? And in conjunction with that, how
much of this decremental margin performance has really been "one-off", or how much of this decremental performance

is truly structural in nature?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Basically focusing our discussion on the decrementals around the international business, right,
where our decrementals sequentially in Q1 was 25%. I think this performance is, first of all, nothing one-off in that
performance and secondly, that performance is not just one quarter either. I think the overall resilience in our well
balanced international business is largely underestimated. Actually, if you look at the performance going back to 2012,
we posted 35% incrementals in 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014. So the fact that we have very good handle of
running the international business, in an environment where we've been growing headwinds throughout this period,
both in exploration, in deepwater, in seismic and also the significant IOC spend cuts even starting in 2014, I think these
incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we're posting in Q1 is just a continuation of a multiyear run of
improving business performance.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. Now the follow-up I would have is you talk about – you kind of outlined the view
that the U.S. recovery will not kind of match prior activity levels and a period of pricing pressure could be upon us for
a period of time. Now in the context of refrac, I'm trying to connect the dots, because if there's a significant amount of
refrac that's going to happen, I would have personally thought that that would lead to a more rapid capacity absorption
period and potentially a faster recovery period in terms of pricing because we won't get to all this backlog or refrac. So
I might be a little bit slow. Can you help me connect the dots on how refracking won't lead to an acceleration in
capacity absorption? And get your thoughts on that'd be great.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think for the refrac, this work scope I think is going to be limited to the companies that can
do the two things that I stated earlier: firstly, help the customers identify the right candidates; and secondly, have
technologies that make the cost base of the refracturing feasible and economical. And based on the work we've done in
terms of identifying candidates, doing trial refracs for a range of customers already, the economics based on the
BroadBand Sequence technology is actually quite attractive in between refracking an old well or drilling a new well. So
I think it would be limited to the companies that have that capability.
Now even if there were a range of companies that could do it, I still think that this market overall in terms of absorbing
capacity isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the oil activity that we had last year, where we had about 2,000
rigs operating, we're down now below 1,000 rigs. If you take a pick anywhere in between the two numbers of where the
recovery is going to come back, no matter what number you pick, I think it's very clear there's going to be significant
overcapacity in the market. And that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve
in that situation.
So refrac is an opportunity for the companies that have the right technology to do it. I don't think it's going to have a big
enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land, but it will be I think a very good avenue of
growth for the companies that can identify the right candidates and also have the technology to effectively refrac while
keeping costs low enough to make it economical.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right, that's great. I appreciate that color. Thanks, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go to Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Hi, thanks. So, Paal, you typically gain market share in a downturn, and you're looking for E&P
spend internationally down 15%. So should we take that and suggest that Schlumberger is going to – revenues will
decline something less than 15% this year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think we have some good opportunities this year to gain market share. We talked about
having the January call. I think this whole discussion around what we perceive to be the glass ceiling in the
international market will potentially open up more market share opportunities for us. I think also given the fact that we

are able to run a very good and very effective business internationally will also allow us opportunities to leverage that
capability to further gain market share as well. So we are not going to be obsessed about market share other than we're
going to look for the opportunities, and we're going to continue to navigate the commercial landscape by balancing
both market share with continuous margin performance.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: So that's what I would expect too. And then if you do the algebra, it implies sequential growth
internationally in the back half of this year. But my question really comes down to international margins because last
cycle we saw international margins bleed lower even as revenue started increasing. What's your thought process or how
do you think this cycle plays out? Are we in a different position, where as revenue increases we could actually have
slightly higher margins, or is the negative pricing impact going to bleed through again?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We are already seeing challenges both in activity and pricing in international markets.
Obviously, with these significant spend reductions, that's always going to be there. I think the difference we are seeing
at this stage is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to
continuously drive performance to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations, and
also have a steady contribution from the transformation, that is what is allowing us to hold margins up the way they are.
We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous two, three years, and this has nothing
to do with pricing. We win every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world.
The only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we are able to translate this revenue into higher
margins basically based on how we run the company. So we are always winning any bid on the lowest price, and we
always have to be commercially competitive, but the key here is the internal guts of the company and how we run and
execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past three or four years and that's why we hope that
we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better this time around in the international market
than what we've done in previous cycles.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Terrific. So in other words, as revenue increases you hope to at a minimum maintain your
margin level at that point?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We are continuing to try to do better than what we did in previous cycles, yes.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: All right.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of James West with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey, good morning, Paal, and great execution this quarter in a tough market.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: I wanted to ask about BroadBand Sequence, and I spent a lot of time with your
technology guys last month in Houston. How much of that business now is a push model being you going to your
clients and talking about the attributes of that versus a pull model where the clients are actually coming to you and
saying we need this technology?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I still think there's a mix. With any new technology in North America land, the uptake takes
some time. But what we did differently this time around with BroadBand in general versus what we did with HiWAY
is that in the third quarter last year, myself and a few of my chiefs, we went around to a range of North American E&P
companies and presented the concepts of this technology and also for trial runs to try this out. And that's why the
general uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly faster than what HiWAY was, which was always
actually quite good as well in 2011. But the rate of uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly higher than
what HiWAY was.

<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay, got it, and then just an unrelated follow-up. If we think about the international
markets, and I know you touched a lot on the U.S. market and production there, but internationally, you've got pretty
heavy decline rates as well, a lack of investment in international markets. What do you see is the potential for a
significant drop in supply from the international side? And on that topic, is it possible not to be bullish on at least Brent
prices going forward?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think you're right. I think there is – we believe that there is a weakness in the non-NAM,
non-OPEC supply base. It was basically flat Q1 year-over-year. But given the reductions we are seeing in spend and
the weakness in several of the key basins, we expect that weakness to continue and potentially increase as the year
progresses, and I think that's why we believe that there will be some recovery in Brent. The question is to what extent
OPEC wants or is willing to put more barrels on the market to stabilize prices at some level below $100.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Got you. Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.
Operator
Thank you. I'll turn it back to our speakers.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you. So before we close, I would like to thank all of you for participating in today's call. As your questions have
indicated, you're all concerned that this market is quite challenging at the moment and I think it's useful to summarize
the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the past quarter has been challenging to
manage. But by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered
significantly better decremental margins compared to previous cycles, and our international leverage and the
acceleration of our transformation program are together creating a strong platform for financial outperformance also
going forward.
Second, we believe that the industry needs to think differently in order to reduce project costs and increase project
value, and we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving
this goal. And this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models, which we are
fully prepared to enter into.
And last, while we continue to actively manage costs and resources throughout this downturn by streamlining overhead
structures and reducing field capacity, we can quickly add that capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work,
through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training
machine which is fully intact.
That concludes the call for today. Thank you.
