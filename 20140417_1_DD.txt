MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is John and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would now like to
welcome everyone to the DuPont Quarterly Investor Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background
noise.
After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time
management requests that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. And please pick up your
handset to allow optimal sound quality. If you have any additional questions you may re-enter the queue.
And it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl,
you may begin.
Carl J. Lukach
Good morning everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's first quarter 2014 performance.
Joining me today are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim
Borel, Executive Vice President, Agriculture and Nutrition. The slides for today's presentation and corresponding
segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release.
During the course of this conference call we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to Slide 2 for our
disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a
number of risk and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors

that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you
review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided by and with our earnings news release and today's slides
posted on our website.
For today's agenda Nick will review our first quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. Jim will then provide
insight into our Agriculture segment. And we'll conclude with Ellen's comments, after which we will be happy to take
your questions.
With that introduction it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick.
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Carl, and good morning everyone. On Slide 3 you can see our summary results for the quarter. Operator
earnings per share were $1.58 up 1% from last year. Consolidated net sales were $10.1 billion, which was down 3%.
However to understand our company's performance in the quarter you have to look deeper. We saw positive steady
growth in industrial market demand for DuPont products and strong earnings growth in most of our segments similar to
what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact we saw volume growth in each of our industrial related segments
during the first quarter.
This growth however was offset by the negative price variance in our Performance Chemicals segment, principally due
to refrigerants, and differences in year-on-year timing of sales and planted area in our Ag segment. In addition segment
results were affected by an unfavorable currency impact that was steeper than anticipated. We'll go over in more detail
the source and impact of the conditions that offset otherwise clear momentum in most of our businesses, including the
adverse winter weather we discussed in our March 10 8-K filing.
Moving to Slide 4. You can see the highlights of our segment operating earnings variance. Jim will provide details
about our Ag segment performance, but first I'll cover the other segments.
Safety & Protection had modest top line growth, but earnings growth was up 27%. Margins improved year over year
resulting from continued cost productivity actions.
Electronics & Communications segment operating earnings were up 53% over last year on strong PV volumes versus a
weak quarter last year. Metal prices in the first quarter were lower than the prior year, which reduced our sales.
Nutrition & Health sales were 1% lower as price gains were more than offset by unfavorable currency. However
segment operating earnings were up 22% due to enhanced product mix, lower raw material costs, and productivity
gains.
Industrial Biosciences revenues were up 4%, and segment operating earnings were up 37% on higher demand for
enzymes for U.S. ethanol production.
Performance Materials had a 2% segment operating earnings growth, as strong auto volumes and performance
polymers were largely offset by weather impacts and higher ethane costs in packaging and industrial polymers.
Segment results in North America were also constrained, as we prepared for a second quarter scheduled ethylene
outage. The extended cold weather temporarily impacted our manufacturing supply chain and operating costs at several
plant locations.
In Performance Chemicals segment TiO2 volumes increased 7% in the quarter. Our Performance Chemicals segment
earnings were down 20% however, due primarily to lower prices in fluoro products, principally refrigerants. Higher
raw material and energy costs as a result of the adverse weather and lower TiO2 prices were also contributors.
Segment volumes are recovering, but margins are generally lower due to year-over-year price variances. The second
quarter typically represents peak seasonal demand in North American markets for both TiO2 and refrigerants. While
we anticipate TiO2 industry fundamentals will continue to improve, we believe it will be at a measured pace.

Overall our company managed well through severe weather conditions, which mostly impacted Performance Materials
and Performance Chemicals. In total we estimate that our segment operating earnings were about $0.07 lower in the
quarter due to missed sales and higher costs associated with weather related plant disruptions and higher raw material
costs.
Turning now to Slide 5. I'd like to cover our regional results. Most of the impact from adverse weather and
year-on-year shifts in Ag occurred in the Americas. As you can see on this slide U.S. and Canada sales were down 8%
and Latin America sales were down 10%.
We had strong volume growth in Europe. Sales in developed EMEA grew 9%, and our sales in developing EMEA
grew 8%. We see a recovery underway in Europe for DuPont products led by our Agriculture, Electronics, Performance
Chemicals, Performance Materials, and Safety & Protection segments. Improved pricing of our products particularly in
Agriculture and positive currency variances contributed favorably to these regional results.
In Asia-Pacific we had solid growth in developing Asia with sales volumes up, partially offset by lower price and
negative currency impact. Within this developing region China sales volumes were up, led by higher Performance
Materials sales into the auto markets. Electronics volume grew in China primarily in photovoltaics, which was more
than offset by the declines in metals pricing for silver.
Lastly in India, strong volume growth was overshadowed by negative currency impact. In developed Asia-Pacific sales
were down about 6% due primarily to currency and lower metals pass-through pricing in Electronics &
Communications.
Turning now to Slide 6. We have summarized the changes in our operating EPS in more detail here. As you can see EG
and L [Exchange Gains and Losses] and tax largely offset each other. With regard to currency the devaluations in
Argentina and the Ukraine contributed to the variance. In total exchange losses resulted in a hurt to earnings of about
$0.05 per share.
Our base tax rate was 20.5%, 2.9 points lower than last year's first quarter rate of 23.4%. This provided a year-on-year
benefit of $0.06 per share. We still expect the full year base tax rate to be about 22%.
Corporate expenses of $201 million in the quarter were down slightly, reflecting further progress with our ongoing
productivity initiatives. We are on track and expect to achieve our targets of $450 million from our 2012 restructuring
program.
Turning now to slide seven. In the first quarter's operating earnings you will notice that we excluded transaction related
costs for the planned Performance Chemicals separation. While these costs were relatively small, only one penny in the
first quarter, our best estimate at this time is that the full year we will spend about $170 million pre-tax for separation
costs or about $0.13 per share. These costs will mostly be incurred to prepare audited financial statements, build the
necessary standalone information technology systems, and create separate legal structures around the world. We will
continue to report these costs as significant items and exclude them from our operating earnings. And we'll provide at a
later date an estimate of the separation costs we expect to occur in 2015.
Many of you have asked where we are in our Performance Chemicals separation activities. I'm pleased to say that we
remain on track for a mid-2015 spinoff and our work is progressing well. Specifically site separation plans are well
underway, and day one operating plans are defined. Also we are creating new legal structures around the world to
house the separated businesses and are actively completing standalone financial statements for the new company.
We expect to make our regulatory filings in the fourth quarter of this year. In the interim our Performance Chemical
leaders will continue to be focused on serving our customers while advancing the plans for separation.
Turning now to slide eight. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Our negative free cash
flow of $2.7 billion, slightly better than last year, reflects our typical seasonal agricultural cash outflow in the quarter
and lower cash payments for taxes.

In the first quarter we began the share repurchase program we announced in January with open market purchases and a
$1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. Under the ASR we retired 12.5 million shares in February and
expect to finalize the ASR in the second quarter of this year. With this ASR we are more than halfway towards meeting
our commitment of $2 billion of repurchases in the year.
Net debt has increased in the quarter over last year and over our ending 2013 balance, which reflects our normal
seasonal shifts. In addition to repurchasing about $1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter, we used existing cash
balances to fund our seasonal agricultural requirements and other working capital needs. We also used existing cash to
retire $1.2 billion of maturing long-term debt in the quarter.
In summary despite the challenges we face from weather and the difficult year-on-year comparisons in Ag, our
businesses delivered a solid quarter largely in line with our expectations.
Looking ahead for the remainder of the year we are reaffirming our full-year outlook of $4.20 to $4.45 operating
earnings per share. In light of quarter one results we expect 70% of our full-year operating earnings per share to occur
in the first half of this year.
We are encouraged by the signs we-re seeing of continued modest year-on-year global growth in industrial production
and the gradual sequential improvement in demand for our products. And we're confident of our growth and our
strength in Agriculture.
Now with that let me turn it over to Jim. Jim?
James C. Borel
Thank you, Nick. As we anticipated in early March, sales in our Agriculture segment ended at $4.4 billion, which was
below last year's record first quarter. Volumes were 7% lower while price, which was negatively impacted by exchange
rates, increased 1%. Operating earnings declined 5% to $1.4 billion on lower seed sales as a result of shifts in both
timing and planted area. Higher volumes and a stronger mix in crop protection as well as lower seed input costs
partially offset the decline in seed sales.
We continue to grow our Insect Control business in Latin America led by Rynaxypyr and delivered pricing gains in
seeds in line with our plan for the season. However, first quarter Agriculture segment sales were negatively impacted
by several factors, including lower planted hybrid corn area in Brazil's safrinha season, expectations that farmers will
plant less corn this spring in North America, delayed farmer decision making in North America, and reductions in
herbicide sales primarily in North America.
Also as we discussed in January the earlier timing of seed shipments caused about $100 million of operating earnings
to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2013 rather than first quarter this year.
In seeds first-quarter sales declined 9% to $3.3 billion due to shifts in timing and planted area. Driven by less favorable
corn economics, farmers in Brazil planted fewer hectares of hybrid corn in the safrinha season than last year. With
growers in North America continuing to demand our newest hybrids and varieties with innovative trait technologies,
we grew price and remain on track for modest price growth in the region.
Optimum AcreMax products are expected to be about two-thirds of our corn volume, and our innovative Optimum
AQUAmax hybrids are expected to be planted on over 10 million acres. In addition we're excited about our newest
soybean varieties, as we transition our lineup to Pioneer brand T Series soybeans and launch soybeans with the Genuity
Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait.
North American growers recently signaled to the USDA they intend to plant less than 92 million corn acres or about 4
million acres below last year. And commodity prices continue to favor soybeans with growers signaling intentions to
increase soybean acres. As a result we're seeing some farmers delaying crop decisions until closer to planting. And as
usual weather will be a final deciding factor for them.

Because our first quarter ends in the middle of the season, delayed decisions by farmers will mean that some sales will
shift from our first quarter to the second. This is unlike the accelerated pace of sales we saw in first quarter last year.
I'd like to move now to talking about innovation at DuPont Pioneer. As you may know in February we launched
Encirca Services, our next generation decision agriculture offering. The response from growers has been very positive.
Encirca Services offers growers tailored, brand neutral, whole farm solutions. Encirca Services leverages Pioneer's
advantaged route to market, working directly with the growers to analyze their data and provide recommendations
based on individual needs and priorities.
As a result of our strong competitive position, we expect to approach 500,000 acres of fee-based, variable-rate seeding
prescriptions in 2014. In preparation for the 2015 season we're piloting advanced services for nitrogen, fertility, and
irrigation with wider availability of our Encirca Yield Service beginning in the third quarter.
Turning to Eastern Europe we have a long history and a strong market position in Ukraine. And while Ukraine
represents a few percent of our sales in Agriculture, it's an important element of our growth plan. Given our uncertain
political situation there and the tightened credit markets, we're seeing seed buying decisions being reduced or deferred.
Even though first quarter Ukraine seed sales were below our expectations, Europe delivered low double-digit sales
growth in the first quarter. And all of Eastern Europe remains a high growth priority for us.
Switching gears we continued our growth in Crop Protection in the first quarter. Sales were 3% higher at $1.1 billion.
Regionally we had strong Crop Protection growth across Latin America with sales up robustly at 60%. Insect pressure
was intense in corn and soybeans, which created strong demand for our Rynaxypyr, Avatar, and Lannate Insect Control
solutions.
In North America the cold wet weather and higher than normal herbicide channel inventories resulted in lower first
quarter herbicide sales. This follows last year's strong first quarter in North America herbicides.
Our Crop Protection business continues to be strengthened by innovation. And we're launching several novel products
into new markets to meet the needs of farmers. This includes Lumigen seed treatments, Cyazypyr for Insect Control,
and our Picoxystrobin and Penthiopyrad, it's expanded Disease Control portfolio.
As we look to the second quarter for the Agriculture segment, we expect modest sales growth and significant growth in
operating earnings as Crop Protection continues to grow and delayed seed sales shift into the second quarter from first
quarter. So for the first half which represents the majority of the Northern Hemisphere season, we expect flat sales.
However earnings should be up slightly despite the earlier seed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Also we expect to improve operating margins due to both price gains and lower seed input costs, recovering the 1 point
margin decline in last year's first half. However our first half 2014 outlook is now lower than our view was in January,
as volumes will be further impacted by lower than expected corn plantings in Brazil, North America, and Ukraine.
Despite the variability we're seeing as agriculture markets transition from last year's peak, we remain enthusiastic about
long-term growth, which will be driven by our innovative products and services, strong global positions, and the
ongoing need to sustainably increase ag productivity to meet worldwide demand.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Thank you, Jim. On Slide 10 I'd like to share my perspective on the quarter in the context of progress we are making
against our overall growth strategy.
We entered 2014 with solid momentum. We delivered strong earnings growth and margin improvement in the majority
of our segments, and we are well positioned for future growth in key markets.

The value of our diverse portfolio and superior execution were highly visible this quarter, as we delivered near record
operating earnings per share despite short-term headwinds from the weather and a year-on-year shift in ag markets that
Jim described. The positive trends we saw in the market this quarter and our results indicate the strength of our strategy
and our team's ability to execute.
Directionally we see a compelling outlook for 2014 across our portfolio. We expect steady year-on-year growth in
demand from key regions and markets. For example demand in Europe continues to recover, which will benefit our
Performance Materials, Safety & Protection, and Performance Chemicals segments.
In China we continue to expect stable growth across most of our businesses. In the U.S. we continue to expect gradual
sequential improvement in demand from industrial, housing, and automotive markets.
By segment in Agriculture we're excited about our newest seed and Crop Protection products and are extending our
successful Insect Control franchise into seed treatments.
We have launched Lumiderm in Canada for canola and are in the pre-launch phase with Dermacor for soybeans in
Brazil. We will continue to invest in and advance projects in both our seed and Crop Protection pipelines and leverage
these across global production agriculture markets.
In Nutrition & Health we expect strong full-year operating earnings and margin growth this year, as we continue to
enhance our product offering, increase our cost productivity, and pursue growth in higher value market opportunities
like probiotics and cultures.
In Industrial Bioscience we're making excellent progress against our strategy, while at the same time delivering strong
earnings growth. Since we acquired Genencor as part of Danisco two years ago, we made investments in research and
development in promising new enzyme spaces. And we're drawing healthy dividends from that decision today. For
example our Axtra PHY animal nutrition, our cold water detergent enzymes, and new ethanol offerings have positioned
us well for future market share gain and growth.
In parallel we expanded our global reach. And now our broad market coverage is coupled with a fundamentally
stronger portfolio. We are also planning to finish construction of our new cellulosic ethanol plant at the end of this year.
In Advanced Materials Electronics & Communications delivered 53% and 116% earnings growth the past two quarters
versus prior year, largely from recovery of photovoltaic module production in China. We continue to see the solar
photovoltaic market as an excellent long-term value creation opportunity for us. Our latest Solamet paste products and
enhanced Tedlar backsheets are vital materials that increase convergent efficiency while extending the life of the
modules, both critical elements of our value proposition.
In the short-term we learned in 2012 that this market can shift quickly. So we will continue to stay close to our large
industry-leading customers to accurately gauge future demand.
Also in Advanced Materials we launched over 30 new product applications in the first quarter in our Safety &
Protection businesses, reflecting our strategy to strengthen our leading position in differentiated high-value materials.
We introduced a new platform of Nomex electrical insulation products for high-voltage applications in transformers
and electrical motors. We're increasing our penetration with Nomex into hybrid electric vehicle motors.
We're bringing to the mining industry a new lightweight Kevlar for conveyor belts. And we added just last week a new
generation of multi-threat and water resistant solutions made with DuPont Kevlar that will extend our range of
protective solutions for the military, police, and security markets.
And lastly in our Performance Materials segment, we introduced new non-halogenated flame retardant nylon resins,
which offer best-in-class high heat resistance with the advantages of being more environmentally friendly and safer to
handle.
And we're seeing an increase in acceptance of renewably sourced resins in automotive fluid management systems. This
application underlines our strategy to develop products with lower cost, higher performance, and improved carbon

footprint versus petrochemical alternatives.
Moving then to Slide 11 and our operational priorities. Let me describe how our operational priorities are driving
disciplined execution.
First, innovation. We're committed to strong pipeline management, disciplined execution, and increasing our return on
research and development. There is no better result of this effort than delivering innovative science-based solutions that
are first or best-in-class and catalyze revenue growth and margin improvement.
One example emerged from our DuPont Innovation Center in Troy, Michigan, where our Performance Polymers team
collaborated with Illinois Tool Works and Ford to develop a new automotive component. The result was a new coolant
crossover part with DuPont Zytel high temperature nylon that lower cost and improved fuel efficiency by displacing
metal. The new part design was named a finalist in the Society of Plastic Engineers' Most Innovative Use of Plastics
Award.
Another Innovation Center example is our exciting collaboration with Nike on materials that will enhance their
footwear and golf ball products' performance. DuPont science is at the core of Nike Golf's next generation RZN golf
ball. Most Nike Golf athletes have put the new ball into play in 2014. And to date five Nike athletes including Rory
McIlroy have won with the new RZN technology on the professional tours around the globe.
Finally in March, DuPont and Procter & Gamble were the joint winners of the 2014 Sustainable Bio Award for
bio-based product innovation of the year. The two companies were recognized for their pioneering effort to achieve the
previously impossible, providing the cleaning power of warm water while washing clothes at cold water temperatures.
The new product delivers unprecedented environmental benefits to the detergent industry and appeals to consumers'
interest in energy efficiency.
These are just three examples from the quarter of the way DuPont translates our scientific capability into solutions that
our customers deeply value.
The second operational priority is to leverage our global reach in both developed markets and in fast-growing areas like
China, ASEAN, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. In developed markets we continue to invest in applications
development for strategic accounts those customers who are global industry leaders as a way to increase our market
penetration rates.
In fast-growing developing markets we continue to invest in people and facilities to extend our reach. As Nick reported
we saw strong volume growth in the quarter in European and Asian developing markets as we capitalized on the
continued rise of the middle class and demand for higher value products.
When new markets open we capitalize by entering first with our Agriculture products and then follow with our
Advanced Materials products. For example earlier this year we opened our first office in Myanmar and look forward to
future growth in that country.
Our third operational priority, execution. This includes productivity, optimizing resource allocation, and returning cash
to shareholders. Last quarter I mentioned we're taking the opportunity in 2014 to review our total business support costs
across the company as we approach the Performance Chemicals separation. We are currently evaluating our corporate
core costs. And we are assessing how our businesses are deployed regionally and functionally to determine the most
efficient structure. We're making good progress in our efforts to identify the right structure to optimize resource
allocation and increase returns on capital. We will keep you updated on our actions.
In closing we are executing well and advancing against our strategic and operational priorities. We expect our plan to
deliver attractive growth in value for our shareholders, as it has done over the past five years, and strongly position
DuPont to deliver the next generation of innovations.
And with that I will turn it back to Carl.

Thank you, Ellen. Now we'll turn back to you, John, and accept questions from our callers.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from
Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. You indicated an EPS impact of $0.07 in the quarter from inclement
weather. Can you speak to how much of that is gone forever, versus how much you might be able to recover in the
second quarter? And to the extent you can recover, perhaps you can speak to impact on individual businesses there
sequentially.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Kevin, thanks for the question. Most of it was cost base with increased energy and
increased logistics costs to be able to move materials, and that cost base is probably going to take us the rest of the year
to recover it through additional productivity actions.
I don't know, Nick. is there anything you'd like to add with more specifics?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: No. I think you covered it. I mean if you look at the areas where they're most
impacted, it was in our Performance Materials and our Performance Chemicals segment. And Ellen characterized the
types of expenses that we incurred, so you can get a sense of the amount that would be coming back and the amount
that was one time.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: And just as a follow-up sticking with weather, some other companies in the space have
indicated an early spring in Europe. Did you observe any benefits across your portfolio in that region?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, I just got back from Europe last week, and I can confirm that it was a heck of a
lot warmer and more buds on the trees than there is here. And I think Europe represented a more normal – well,
actually it was great volume, because we're seeing improvements there. But we didn't have the impact on weather and
things like that.
I don't know, Jim, maybe you can comment on the Ag side in Europe.
<A - James C. Borel>: For the most part we're seeing little impact from weather, particularly on the seed side. Of
course we're moving into a time of the year when weather will pay a bigger role in terms of what actually gets planted
and when it happens, but fairly small impact to date.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning. I think your U.S. dollar price change in Agriculture was plus 1% year
over year. What would it be in local currency?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, price was up 2.6%, I think is the right number. Jim, you'll correct me if I'm
wrong. Currency was negative 1.5%.
<A - James C. Borel>: Yes, that's about right. So we had modest price increases across the Ag segment.

<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. Great. And then can you talk a little bit about your Electronics segment? Did you see
a recovery at all in the Consumer Electronics side of the business? Or was it really all in solar? And how do you see the
global electronics markets as it touches DuPont, both on the solar side and on the non-solar side?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Electronic & Communications had a good quarter. We saw nice growth, most of that
was due to PV. And Consumer Electronics I would characterize it as expected that it's improving, but it's not a standout
from that standpoint.
We had a good quarter in PV, Tedlar both and Solamet paste. We're anticipating that the market is going to grow 15%
this year. But you have to remember last year in Electronics, I mean it was a weak comparative. So we still see this
market as being lumpy or bumpy or whichever way we want to talk about it.
We're seeing that China is probably the wildcard in future quarters, around whether they meet their 10 gigawatts of
installed. The metal impact you saw on the top line, so that kind of mutes the top line growth. But they had great
earnings progress for the year.
So we're positive in terms of what we've seen in Electronics. But as you know based on what happened in 2012, PV is
something we watch very, very carefully.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. Thank you very much.

And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, just on the business support costs review, do you think you'll be in
position this quarter to complete that review? And in terms of sizing the opportunity, could be as much as $0.5 billion
of costs to be taken out over a period of time?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well we're not going to size it right now for you, Dave. Sorry about that. But we're
really – because we're really right now in the process. So if you think about the fact that we sold Coatings last year, that
were spinning Chemicals next year, that's a good portion of the company that won't exist in the second half of 2015.
So I'm looking at it as a fresh start. If we were to recast how we go about supporting our businesses and enabling them
to achieve consistent sustainable growth, would we structure very differently? We're going to be a very different
company in the second half of 2015. The average size of our manufacturing plant is going to be smaller. The allocation
of our business both globally and by sector is going to be very different.
And so we're actively engaged in those meetings and hard discussions right now. The good part about this is since we
really control the timing of the spin, that we are geared to have real work completed and discussions externally this
year, because we want to enter 2015 with momentum. And so when we're done and we're ready and we got the [ph]
cooks, (39:24) then we'll be bringing it out to you guys. But I think you'll be pleased overall with what you're going to
see.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Understood. And just on the cost side also SG&A was down 6% in the quarter before this
whole cost action. What's around the reduction right now in Q1? And for full year what do you expect SG&A to be flat
or down or up?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well what's driving the reduction is the productivity work that we continue to have
across the company. And we're doing that in SG&A as well.
And this is while at the same time investing in a lot of areas for growth in that same respect. So in Ag for example the
programs we have, the expanding of the channel, continuing to drive that channel access, all of those things growing in
certain areas. But the productivity gains that we have are really what's driving some of those reductions.

And our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes. Ellen, I wanted to follow up on the review of the business support costs. And when you've
had stranded costs in the past, the roughly $200 million with Coatings, $100 million with Performance Chemicals, what
is the nature of those stranded costs? And does that suggest where you're looking to – an area where you're looking to
take the most costs out?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes. I think if you think about it, Don, let's take an example. We file tax returns in
every country where we operate. Just because we're spinning Performance Chemicals doesn't mean we have to file any
less tax returns.
But at the same time when you allocate the cost or understand the costs of those tax returns across the entire company
[audio skip] (41:13) smaller revenue base. So on a per-dollar revenue it goes up.
So the question is can we think about tax differently? Is our structure, our legal entity structure such that it helps our
businesses succeed? Or again do we have too many? And should we consolidate down and really then limit the amount
of work that has to be done there?
I mean and that's just a small example versus many in terms of how we support the businesses regionally, how we
support them functionally. I mean and that's same thing. You can talk about whether it's paying bills, or collecting cash,
or sourcing. We just need to think about are we leveraging standardizing the most common of the work and really
putting our differential resources towards where they can really help the business. So, Nick, you've been right in the
midst of this big time. So...
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. I think, Ellen, you characterized it really well just a second ago when you
talked about fresh start. Looking at how we're going to be structured as a company with about 20% of our revenue now
being gone between the spins and divestitures.
And looking at that in a very clean slate sort of way, and how we're going to do a buildup of the infrastructure within
the functions, where we could simplify things, where we can change things, so that we can operate more effectively in
a more standardized, digitized sort of way.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And just a follow up on your guidance. You've maintained your EPS guidance. But you're more
cautious on the Ag outlook. So I'm just wondering where do you make up that shortfall that you now see in Ag versus
your original expectations?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. So I think if you look to the full year we're seeing stability in TiO2 from a
market demand standpoint. Volume growth in the Performance Chemicals segment, it looks like it's going to be, as the
refrigerant comes into its season and things like that. And a really good sign in TiO2 is the fact that on a sequential
basis price did not go down. Now year-over-year it went down, but on a sequential basis it was a little positive. So
that's a big uncertainty that's becoming a little more certain as we go forward.
If you think about what we saw in Europe and the continued gradual improvement in demand in European markets, and
you saw in the quarter that was really positive for Performance Materials. It was good for Performance Chemicals and
Safety & Protection.
The third area I'd point to is a stable China. There's a lot of noise about China out there. But you saw in our results that
the automotive industry clearly there is leading it. But we saw positives there from again Performance Materials,
Performance Chemicals, Electronics & Communications, and Safety & Performance.
So Industrial Production is certainly enabling a lot of this. In the U.S. industrial housing and automotive markets are
allowing us to continue our penetration and moving our new products and new materials in there. I gave you some

examples of those in [ph] F&T (44:22) in my talk.
In Ag overall I think as we go through the entire year and it unfolds, I think we have first-quarter shifts. I think we're
still well-positioned there with good pipeline of products going forward. So are we putting a little more pressure on our
sourcing guys to claw back that higher natural gas cost in the first quarter? Absolutely. And we think we can bring it in
where we have it reaffirmed.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - John J. Hirt>: Yes. Good morning. This is John Hirt sitting in for P.J. today. In seed you've got pretty good
momentum down in Brazil particularly in corn, where I think you've gained three points of share last year both in the
summer and the safrinha seasons. Do you have any early indications as to how your share progression might have been
this year?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Jim, I think that's a great question for you.
<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah absolutely. First of all it's a little too early to start talking about share, because the
safrinha market is just finishing. We'll be able to talk share after we've had a chance to evaluate the entire season.
But we're certainly confident about our competitiveness. You're right. We've had great momentum down there so we're
continuing to drive ahead. Obviously the reduced acres is unfortunate but understandable given the commodity prices
at the moment.
You mentioned seed, but we also have some great momentum around the world but particularly in Brazil with our Crop
Protection portfolio with some 60% growth down there. Rynaxypyr particularly had a strong quarter with Helicoverpa
pressure that they were seeing. We're getting ready to launch Dermacor as a seed treatment in soybeans. We're doing
the work and seeing really great early results in corn also. So we do have a lot of momentum and gives us confidence
for the future.
<Q - John J. Hirt>: Okay. Thank you. And with $1 billion of share repurchases completed in the first quarter with that
accelerated buyback and only $1 billion left to complete your $2 billion target for the year, would you consider tapping
into the additional $3 billion that you have authorized at some point this year?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. Now right now we're on track, proceeding very well to complete as you say the
$2 billion this year. We actually will complete the first half of that or a little more than the first half of that by the end
of the second quarter. Although by the end of the first quarter we had already retired about 13 million shares. So
significant amount was done in the first quarter.
But the total first half or a little more than the first half won't be complete until the end of the second quarter. And then
we'll look to put in place for the second half of the year our steps to complete the last $1 billion and fulfill our
commitment of the $2 billion in the year.
<Q - John J. Hirt>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

<Q - Neal P. Sangani>: Good morning. This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. In Safety & Protection you said
some softness in the public sector. A number of companies have called for some recovery with greater infrastructure
and non-residential spending in the back half. Are you seeing something similar?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: On the public sector it's one that I tell you every time I try to call it, I call it wrong.
But what we're doing there is with new applications and new functionality to help with that. Right? Because the public
sector needs a reason to change or to replace or to expand and certainly additional protection and things like that.
Now we're seeing a slowness in the U.S. Europe is still going very well, especially on thermal protection and it's things
like that. So we're seeing very different markets around the world. And we're expecting improvement. Like as we take a
look at garments, we're seeing second quarter is going to be stronger. And so I think we're seeing that. But I'm always a
little hesitant to declare victory in the public market, because you just never know what's going to happen.
<Q - Neal P. Sangani>: And then on the ethylene cracker outage, are you seeing an opportunity there to maybe
squeeze out more capacity or work on some key bottlenecks during the maintenance?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Man, we're squeezing just about everything we can out of this turnaround. And our
focus right now is more on getting it back up and running, because coming out of these turnarounds is never for the
faint of heart. And if we can bring it up a day early or three days early, that's real volume that we can use this year.
So we've got them focused on time, because it has been closer to seven years than six years on this turnaround. And we
just got to get it opened up. The planning, the guys' doing a great job as far as the front end loading of this turnaround.
And our goal -- I've got that team under a lot of incentive to overachieve on the time thing, I think would have the
biggest benefit to us this year.
<Q - Neal P. Sangani>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Two quick ones. In developed Europe what was your growth excluding
the Ag segment? If you can just give us a sense for what you're seeing in those markets.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, Ag grew in Europe and so, Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, developed Europe in total was about 9% growth year-over-year from a revenue
perspective.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. And so what we saw was growth in Europe in Ag, along with I think most of
our segments grew in Europe. I'm trying to think, well, maybe Electronics didn't because there's not much business
there. It...
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah but Ag was up about the same as the overall region was.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: I would say that if you exclude that it doesn't really change the number in the region.
It's still going to be about that 9% sort of number.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. I mean the biggest drivers in Europe were automotive and our Performance
Materials business. And TiO2 had a strong quarter in our Performance Chemicals segment.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: And then on the enzyme side, you had some announcements during the quarter in the
detergents area. Do you expect to be gaining a significant amount of share in that business over the next couple of
years? Or how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think that's one where share is hard, because the market's growing and changing.
Because for instance the new products that are coming out are allowing us to expand the footprint. Right? So we're
really well-positioned for growth. Our focus is on making sure we have the right capacity in the right places in the
world to be able to deliver against it. And I think the team has done a great job there.
But we're looking at our applications to really expand utilization of enzymes, as opposed to just kind of fight over the

And our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on Performance Materials. You said that you're
expecting the second quarter to be down modestly given the turnaround. But I would have thought that with the new
Nike Golf ball that would more than offset that. I mean it's very exciting news.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, Frank, I want to know whether you've tried the golf ball or not yet?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Frank, not everyone uses as many golf balls in a round as we might.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: True; true. Well, look, I know weather demand hurt the quarter, but it certainly hurt my golf
game as well. So I'm looking forward to trying it out. Absolutely.
Hey, just on that turnaround, do you have an order of magnitude as to how much you expect that that's going to impact
the quarter? Like what sort of order of magnitude that would be?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. So if you look at it from a top line basis, the ethylene outage reduces our
segment sales a few percent in the second quarter. And that's in our guidance, so that's already put into our forecast
going forward.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right. Great. And obviously the balance sheet is very strong. You talked about how
different the company is going to look in the second half of 2015. Might the company look a little bit different driven
by M&A? And how would you characterize the M&A environment and opportunities and your willingness to
participate at the present time?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Hey, Nick, why don't you take that question?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Sure. So, Frank, we're always looking at M&A opportunities in the company. We're
very selective about where we look, though, as you know. We want to look at things that reinforce the strategic
priorities, the directions we're going in.
We'll continue to be looking for M&A opportunities that will enhance our technology position, our market access,
those types of things. And we have very rigorous and -- hurdles that we have from a financial performance perspective
that we're going to require of acquisition opportunities.
But it's something that we've always look at and we'll continue to look at. The strength of the balance sheet is certainly
a positive on that. But the balance sheet has always been in a place and for quite some years now as you know where
we have and enjoy this single A rating. And even during the Danisco acquisition we were able to maintain that single A
rating during that time period after $7 billion.
So I wouldn't characterize it as the deciding factor on M&A is just going to be balance sheet and the strength of it. It's
something we're looking at all the time, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right. So you can maintain this position of being under-levered for the foreseeable future.
In addition I mean obviously you've got the share buyback as a use of cash and your dividends and so forth. But we

could see this condition continue for the foreseeable future of your being under-levered.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. Well, you say under-levered. And so obviously you have to dial in. If you're
looking at just the debt EBITDA sort of thing, you might come to a conclusion of under-levered. When you adjust the
debt and you add in that pension unfunded piece, I feel we're in the right place from a leverage standpoint. That pension
liability can change. As you saw it changed last year by about $5 billion. That can change with the discount rate
changes.
So we'll continue to evaluate those situations. And we'll take the appropriate actions, depending upon what external
forces and how they're impacting us.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. And Frank, and since it's Nick's birthday today, I think that you should make
sure you should reinforce his point of view on that.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Well that's fantastic, Nick. I will send you a sleeve of Nike Golf balls in honor of your
birthday.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you. Just wanted to ask a bit about your kind of acreage expectations, I get that corn
acres going down in Brazil is a headwind, because the soy offset isn't that much.
But as we think about if there are going to be issues in the Ukraine, and I'd love to get sort of a greater characterization
of what you think is going to go on there in terms of what they'll plant and how they'll get financed and if you can
participate in that. But if they do indeed do fewer corn acres there, is your expectation that they're going to get made up
in the U.S. or other parts of Europe? Or do you think those get lost this year, and there's no sale opportunity?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Great. Jim?
<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah. Well several pieces to that. So first of all in the Ukraine, it's very difficult to predict
what's going to end up happening there, but because of the political situation. But we're seeing some reduction in corn
because of credit issues, but also some delays and possible reductions just because of uncertainty among farmers.
So and Ukraine last year was only a few percent of our global sales, but it was a really important growth opportunity.
We opened the plant in Stasi early last year. We're set up well for growth there. So certainly it's our hope that stability
returns. And we expect that to be a good market over time.
The reductions in corn acres or hectares in Latin America and also what in we're expecting will happen in North
America, are likely gone for now. We'll see what happens in the second half, both in terms of corn prices, what that
does to re-stimulate demand, et cetera. But it's really way too early to know what the South America production will
look like in the second half of the year until we get through the North America season.

<Q - John E. Roberts>: Good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. And Nick, I hate to ask you a tax question on
your birthday. But you said you're taking a fresh start look. And I think your approach to integrating global taxes and
hedging exchange gains and losses is kind of unique. I think it came in actually with the Conoco acquisition year ago.
Is this a good time to take a fresh start look at that approach?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. John, we're going to look at a fresh start on a lot of different things. We're
going to look at currency, local functional currency versus U.S. dollar function. We're going to have a lot of things that
we're going to explore as we make the spin here and look at the company as it stands in the future.
So yeah. You're touching on an area, but trust me there are many areas that we're going to be exploring to drive
simplification across the company, which will help drive out some of the costs and put us in an extremely competitive
position.
