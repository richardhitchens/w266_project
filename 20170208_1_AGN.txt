Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Allergan fourth quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will have time for a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call to Lisa DeFrancesco to begin. Please go ahead.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan fourth quarter and full-year
2016 earnings conference call.
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing operations for the quarter
and full year ended December 31, 2016. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are
available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com.

In the press release table, you'll notice we're using the term performance net income per share, which is the equivalent
to what we used to call adjusted non-GAAP net income per share. This is a change in nomenclature only. There's no
change to the calculation of this or any other Allergan reported metric.
We are conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be available on our website after its conclusion.
Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's
express written consent.
Turning to slide 2 and our cautionary statements related to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial
measures, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make projections or other
forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to
note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business
trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ from current expectations and projections
depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these
forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law.
Turning to slide 3 and our agenda for this morning, with us on today's call are: Brent Saunders, our Chairman and
CEO, who will provide an overview of our fourth quarter business highlights; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial
Officer, who will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D
Officer, who will provide highlights from our pipeline achievements in 2016 and upcoming milestones. And Tessa
Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss the Allergan fourth quarter continuing operations results in more
detail. Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stuart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our
Chief Legal Officer.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.
Brenton L. Saunders
Great, thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone.
In 2016, Allergan completed many bold actions to transform our company into a branded growth pharma leader. It
wasn't an easy journey; divestments never are. It took a long time to complete the generics sale to Teva. It was
challenging to follow the changes in our financial, and it was difficult to cut ties to legacy people, systems, and
processes while harmonizing to newer streamlined systems.
But I'm very proud of the resilience of our team. Together, we remain focus on driving the four key value drivers for
shareholder return, growth, margins, pipeline, and capital allocation. Thanks to their focus, we have a good report card
for 2016 and a positive outlook for 2017 and beyond.
Turning to slide 5, let me walk you through how we did on each one of these four value drivers. First, we had
commercial success across our therapeutic areas. We drove double-digit growth in key brands like Botox, Restasis,
Juvéderm, Lo Loestrin [LoLo], and Linzess, and we showed yet again that our team is excellent at product launches.
Second, our model and our attention to cost helped us create a branded growth pharma leader with leading gross
margins and operating margins.
Third, David will discuss key milestones in the R&D pipeline, but I wanted to highlight what a productive R&D team
Allergan has. They were on a roll with 21 major approvals, 18 major submissions, and they added new programs to
expand our therapeutic areas into new adjacencies like NASH and Crohn's disease.
Fourth, on the capital allocation front, we took aggressive, opportunistic, and strategic action in deploying the proceeds
we received from Teva. We executed a $15 billion buyback, including a $10 billion ASR. We paid down $10 billion in
debt. We announced our first-ever dividend, and we also added 12 new steppingstone deals into our pipeline, including
an accretive deal with LifeCell. Let me touch on that now, turning to slide 6.

We just closed the LifeCell deal last week, and I got to spend last Friday morning with our new colleagues. They are
proud, energetic, entrepreneurial, and eager to be part of a world-class aesthetic MedDerm and regenerative medicine
company like Allergan. They understand that the strategic fit is strong, since the lifestyle product line is very
complementary to the Allergan plastic surgery line, and we call on many of the same customers. Given our portfolio,
customer relationships, and global infrastructure, they also see a clear advantage of having these businesses under
Allergan's ownership. With 2016 sales of approximately $450 million, LifeCell is a durable business with strong
margins that will be immediately accretive to our 2017 earnings and beyond.
Turning to slide 7, now let me turn to the financial performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. Non-GAAP
revenue from continuing operations was up 7% in the fourth quarter and 15% full-year 2016 to $14.6 billion. On the
same basis, performance net income per share, what we previously called non-GAAP EPS, was up 16% in the fourth
quarter and 2% in the full year to $13.51. And we generated $6.3 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations.
The report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond. Tessa will review the
performance of our segments and the detailed outlook for 2017 in just a few minutes.
You can see on slide 8, growth was strong across our seven therapeutic areas in 2016. Excluding exchange, most are
growing double digits. Bill will dig into products more in just a moment, but let me highlight the following: Eye Care
up 10%; Aesthetics/Dermatology up 11%; GI up 11%; Women's Health up 19%; Urology up 9%; and Anti-Infectives
up 19%. Even CNS was up 8% in 2016 excluding Namenda IR and foreign exchange. This is a top-tier growth story. It
would be hard to find a company in our industry that can match that kind of performance across so many different
therapeutic areas in 2016.
Overall, our business is very healthy and it's a great picture to have so many products growing. Our company is built on
growth products in each of these therapeutic areas, which is why I'm so confident in our future.
Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to address the macro environment in the United States. With the new President, a
new pending head of Health and Human Services, and hopefully the rapid announcement of a new FDA head, we are
optimistic that the new administration is pro-growth, pro-innovation, and against overregulation that can stifle
investment in growth.
We are pleased to see a number of our peers are following our lead and have become more vocal about the actions they
are taking to price their products responsibly. For us, our social contract means balancing investment and innovation
with pricing and access as well as quality and education. It's Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to
find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs because it is the right thing to do and because we have such
strong confidence in our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth.
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer.
William J. Meury
Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.
Brent talked about our growth in 2016. Even in a year of never before seen transformation, we produced strong results.
Growth came from every reporting segment. It came from all of our product lines. It came from every region, both the
U.S. and internationally. And our growth was balanced between volume and price, for our key products even more so
on volume and demand than price.
Here are a few highlights. We launched over 10 new products this past year, including, Vraylar, Viberzi, Kybella, and
Namzaric. We had double-digit sales growth in Aesthetics, Botox Therapeutics, Linzess, and others. I'll show you how
they all did in the fourth quarter in a moment. The Restasis sales stream remains durable with a double-digit sales
increase over prior year despite the entry of an alternative treatment to the market. And lastly, we kicked off our GI
business internationally with Constella. 2016 was full of great accomplishments, and I think the outlook for 2017 is just
as bright.

Turning to slide 11, this slide tells a good story about the quarter. Linzess is the fastest growing product in the
company, up 36% this quarter. Also, we're very pleased with the performance of Viberzi. It looks and feels just like
Linzess. We'll talk more about Viberzi in a moment.
Excluding FX, Botox is up 14%. This number reflects a combination of the cosmetic and therapeutic businesses.
Migraine had a particularly strong contribution. Both sides of the business are doing very well.
Within the Aesthetics business, the Juvéderm line of fillers continues to grow globally and this quarter is up 29%. Our
Eye Care franchise is powered by the durability of Restasis, which was up 13%. Ozurdex also had a great quarter, up
24%. Growth was partially offset by declines in Asacol HD and Namenda XR, as anticipated. Sales for the products in
the All Other products line was relatively stable.
Turning now to slide 12 and our key new product launches, after approximately one year of promotion these four
products are annualizing at $450 million in sales at the end of 2016. The table is set for 2017. Generally speaking,
awareness levels are high and demand is strong. Formulary coverage for the pharmaceutical products is well developed.
Each one of these products is in a strong position as we head into the new year. I'll touch on each one now.
2016 was foundational in terms of training and education for Kybella. We focus on training injectors on how to use the
product, identifying patients, and managing expectations. For 2017, we've taken several steps to shore up this business,
including: expanding our Masters training program; launching several new promotions; and ramping up our DTC
advertising to an even higher level.
It's important to keep in mind that the adoption cycle for a facial injectable is very different than that of an oral
pharmaceutical. We're building a market and educating an injector base. That work is done and our goal in 2017 is to
drive utilization with the approximately 10,000 injectors that we trained in 2016.
Vraylar and Viberzi were at or above expectations in 2016. Both products have strong demand with a broad and deep
prescriber base. They both have excellent formulary coverage, and we expect to demonstrate robust growth in 2017.
With Namzaric, demand has more than doubled since the launch of the full indication. Formulary coverage is exactly
where we need it to be, with coverage in eight of the top nine plans. Our focus now is on execution. We like what we
see with Namzaric.
To summarize, these four products will represent a much more meaningful portion of our sales and growth in 2017 and
beyond.
On slide 13, you can see we expect to have nine additional new launches upcoming across four therapeutic areas where
we have received approval already or approval is imminent. As you can see from the slide, we have a nice balance of
new product launches and product improvements. Some are U.S. based; some are international. All these will
strengthen our existing franchises and maintain our focus on unmet needs.
Here are a few highlights. Most notably, we're launching three new products in Eye Care, two for dry eye and one for
glaucoma. For dry eye, Restasis MDPF has been approved and will launch in mid-March. For True Tear, we're
expecting approval soon. In glaucoma, the XEN Gel Stent already launched internationally and is now approved in the
United States and was launched earlier this week.
Rhofade is a vasoconstrictor for rosacea. This is a dermatological condition that has a significant impact on quality of
life and for which there are very few treatment options for the 13 million patients with the condition. We expect
Rhofade to be very well received by the dermatology community and could be a sleeper in our product line, with
multi-hundred million dollar sales potential.
The Linzess 72-microgram launch gives physicians more dosing options to tailor therapy and will continue to drive
conversion of the over-the-counter market. Linzess will be the only product in the market that has two indications, a
demonstrated effect on constipation and pain, offers three doses, and has widespread formulary coverage. In 2007 (sic)
[2017], we'll focus on our leadership both inside the United States and internationally on driving volume and market

So with that, I'll turn the call over to David. Thank you.
C. David Nicholson
Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 15.
Before I discuss R&D deliverables in the fourth quarter and full year 2016, I would like to touch on one of the
cornerstones of open science, building the pipeline. This defines our approach to identifying, acquiring, and developing
the best game-changing ideas and innovation in our therapeutic areas. We added 12 game-changing programs to our
pipeline. These programs could change the way diseases with significant unmet need are treated.
In CNS, along with our pipeline Heptares, we are developing novel muscarinic agonists for the treatment of
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. And we recently entered into an option agreement with LTI for a
potential breakthrough treatment to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease.
In Eye Care, we acquired a peri-ocular ring technology for the treatment of glaucoma and other eye conditions and a
novel gene therapy candidate to alleviate sight loss associated with retinitis pigmentosa.
In Medical Aesthetics and Dermatology, this year we added a number of programs, including ROR Gamma-T, a
first-in-class compound for psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune disorders.
In GI, we established a leadership position in NASH with cenicriviroc, or CVC, evogliptin, an FXR agonist. We also
added a selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we entered into a
licensing agreement with Assembly Biosciences for microbiome programs for IBD and IBS.
When you look across these programs, you see highly differentiated, innovative medicines for unmet medical needs
that strengthen and build depth across our therapeutic areas.
Turning to slide 16 and discussing delivering the pipeline, during 2016 and early 2017, our R&D team truly delivered.
As Brent mentioned, we have achieved outstanding results. Amongst over 100 global submissions, we achieved 21
total major pharma and device approvals, including our XEN Gel Stent for glaucoma, Rhofade for rosacea, Restasis
multi-dose, and Linzess 72-microgram. Amongst more than 100 submissions globally, we made 18 major regulatory
submissions, including our submission for True Tear in the U.S. and submissions for Botox in the U.S. and the EU for
the treatment of forehead lines.
We have made excellent progress in our pipeline of more than 70 programs. I'm going to focus today on six
first-in-class or best-in-class compounds, which we are calling our six stars. We have advanced or are in the process of
advancing these programs into Phase 3 development.
In Women's Health, we announced positive results from the second Phase 3 trial of Esmya in uterine fibroids. I will
discuss these results in a few moments. In CNS, we initiated our Phase 3 program for ubrogepant in acute migraine
treatment and initiated our Phase 2b program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis. Remember, if successful, these
will be the first oral CGRPs approved for the treatment of migraine. We also initiated our Phase 3 program for
rapastinel, a potentially game-changing treatment for MDD, a condition that desperately needs innovation.
In Eye Care, we have met clinical trial enrollment targets in our AMD abicipar program and plan to complete
enrollment this year.
And in GI, we are preparing to begin Phase 3 development for relamorelin, our ghrelin agonist for diabetic
gastroparesis, and CVC, our first-in-class once-daily oral immuno-modulator for NASH.
These outstanding results and progress on key programs are being delivered by a team of more than 2,000 talented
scientists and R&D professionals, who are focused on delivering important new treatments for patients.

Turning to slide 17, we recently announced positive data from the second of two Phase 3 studies for Esmya. When
approved, this will be the first non-invasive oral treatment for uterine fibroids approved in the United States. I'd like to
take a moment to briefly review the data from the Phase 3 program.
As a reminder, in May 2016 Allergan and Gedeon Richter announced positive results from the VENUS I trial, on the
left-hand side of this slide. The study met all the co-primary and secondary endpoints for both ulipristal treatment arms.
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were percentage of patients with absence of uterine bleeding and timed absence of
bleeding.
In the second study, Venus II, shown on the right-hand side of this slide, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of
ulipristal over two treatment cycles. Again, ulipristal met all the co-primary and secondary endpoints. Significantly
more patients in both the 10-milligram and the 5-milligram groups achieved absence of bleeding compared to placebo.
Additionally and importantly, in both VENUS studies we saw very significant quality of life improvements in
ulipristal-treated groups in comparison to placebo. When approved, this breakthrough treatment could have a profound
positive impact on the lives of women suffering from this condition, where current treatment options are limited.
As I've outlined, we have made real progress both in building and delivering our pipeline. Of course, we have many
more milestone deliverables in 2017 and beyond. Our continued excellence in identifying the best science matched
with our strong results in advancing innovation validates our open science approach.
As always, I thank our global Allergan R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation,
delivering results, and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve.
Now, I will turn the call over to Tessa.
Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide 19, in the fourth quarter we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Non-GAAP continuing
operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.86 billion, a 7% increase versus prior year,
primarily impacted by double-digit growth in key brands, including Botox, fillers, Linzess, Restasis, and LoLo, as well
as new product launches. The growth was partially offset by Asacol HD loss of exclusivity, which occurred in August
of 2016, and a decline in Namenda XR due to lower demand and the shift of our promotional efforts to Namzaric.
Non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter were strong at 87%. The decline versus prior year was primarily
attributed to the accounting treatment of sales that went through our Anda Distribution business. Non-GAAP operating
margin was 48.4% in the fourth quarter, a decline of 3.4%, as a result of higher R&D expenses, with products
advancing into Phase 3 clinical studies, including rapastinel, oral CGRPs, and abicipar, as well as increased sales and
marketing investments to continue to support new launches, such as Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, offset partially by
lower G&A expenses.
G&A expenses increased sequentially, primarily as a result of favorable transactional foreign exchange, which
benefited the third quarter of 2016. Excluding this impact, G&A increased 5% sequentially.
Performance net income per share of $3.90 reflects growth of 16% versus the prior year, largely driven by share count
reduction. Excluding the impact of the share buyback, performance net income per share in the fourth quarter grew 5%
versus the prior year.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10.4% in the quarter.
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was negative $60 million. Excluding taxes paid on the gain on sale of
the generics and Anda Distribution business, R&D asset acquisitions, and restructuring payments, adjusted cash flow
from operations remained strong at $1.5 billion. Our GAAP financial metrics and reconciliation from non-GAAP to

GAAP can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.
Turning now to our fourth quarter revenue performance by segment on slide 20, U.S. specialized therapeutics were
$1.57 billion for the quarter, continuing double-digit growth of 10.6% versus the prior-year period, driven by strong
growth across Facial and Aesthetics of 23%, Eye Care of 7%, Botox Therapeutic of 14%. Key products performed
well, with Botox fillers, Restasis, Ozurdex, and the recent launch of Kybella contributing to the strong performance.
Our U.S. General Medicines business fourth quarter revenues were $1.53 billion, remaining stable versus prior year,
driven by strength in our key products, including Linzess, LoLo, and other Women's Health products, along with new
product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar, offset by the losses of exclusivity of Asacol HD, Namenda IR and Enablex, as
well as lower Namenda XR revenues.
International fourth quarter revenues were $753 million versus $691 million in the prior-year period. Excluding foreign
exchange of approximately $15 million, international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 11% versus prior year, driven
mainly by continued strong growth of Botox Therapeutic and Botox Cosmetic at 12%, [indiscernible] (26:00) at 34%,
and Ozurdex at 27%.
Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Canada, and Western Europe continued to be the largest growth contributors versus prior
year, while Turkey, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific were the fastest growing regions versus prior year.
Turning to slide 21, we ended the year in a favorable capital position with total debt of $32.8 billion and net debt to
adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times. We expect to continue to repay our contractual maturities, which will reduce debt
by $2.7 billion by the end of 2017 at an average coupon rate of 1.8%.
Turning now to slide 22 and our 2017 forecast, we are beginning 2017 in a strong position and we are focused on
growth. Our forecast is based on diversified revenue growth from key products and new launches with manageable
losses of exclusivity. We are also committed to managing operating expenses below our sales growth. As a result, we
will continue to generate industry-leading margins and strong cash flows. We expect full-year 2017 branded revenue to
be between $15.5 billion to $16.8 billion, which reflects mid-single-digit growth of our standalone business and now
the addition of LifeCell as of February 1. This also reflects the potential negative foreign exchange impact on revenue
of approximately $100 million.
Our gross margins are expected to finish the year between 86% and 87%, consistent with our expectations that gross
margins will be impacted by: one, product mix as partnered products such as Linzess and Vraylar experience strong
growth; the loss of exclusivity in March of Minastrin, which is a high-margin product; and lastly, lower than our
average gross margins with the addition of LifeCell.
Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion reflects continued strong investments in our key
products and product launches and the addition of LifeCell. Note that we expect minimal synergy capture for LifeCell
this year as we focus on expanding our footprint in plastics and regenerative medicine.
Non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.450 billion to $1.550 billion reflect support for our 2017 projects,
including important advancements of our six stars, which are all either in or entering into Phase 3 clinical studies. We
expect R&D to be fairly evenly spread throughout the year.
We are committed to having operating expenses grow less than sales in 2017, and we will continue to manage expenses
prudently.
Net interest expense/other is forecast to be approximately $1.075 billion and will be back-half weighted as other
income in the first two quarters of the year includes dividend income from Teva.
Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 13.5%. Average 2017 share count is forecasted to be
approximately 356 million shares, and assumes a third quarter settlement on the ASR. Our share count will be higher in
the first half of the year at 357 million to 358 million shares. Our guidance reflects our best estimate considering the
current progress of the ASR settlement, and we don't expect any material adjustments.

As a result, we expect full-year 2017 non-GAAP adjusted performance net income per share to be in the range of
$15.80 to $16.30, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the range of 17% to 21%.
We also wanted to provide you with some framework for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter, we expect total
reported revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, which will be the lowest revenue quarter for the year. This reflects our
normal seasonality, the addition of two months of LifeCell, and the impact of an anticipated change in U.S. wholesale
buying patterns. We expect the fourth quarter to be the highest quarter of the year, with the second and third quarters
relatively stable sequentially.
We have set the stage for a very strong 2017. Given our confidence in the growth and profitability of the business as
previously announced, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $0.70 this quarter to be paid on March 28, 2017 for
shareholders of record as of February 28. We expect to grow this dividend annually.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss his 2017 priorities.
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Tessa.
In closing, in 2016 Allergan has been on a journey of transformation. That work is behind us, and now our future is
bright. We will remain focused on fourth key drivers of shareholder value: revenue and earnings growth; advancing our
R&D pipeline; maintaining industry-leading margins; and capital allocation to drive growth and strong shareholder
returns.
At this point, operator, I'd like to open the call for Q&A.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yes, thank you. First of all, Brent, as an Irish domiciled company, do you have a seat at the
table with the new administration? And could you foresee any tax reforms on the horizon that could be anything other
than a net positive for the company?
And as a quick follow-up, I was hoping, Tessa, you could discuss your outlook for cash flow for the year and comment
on why half of a year for income from Teva, dividend income. Is that because you plan to sell at midyear? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Great question, Gregg. Yes, absolutely, we are engaged with the new administration and
certainly the key folks within Congress and the administrative agencies that regulate us. And I have personally spent
the appropriate amount of time doing that engagement, but I do try to spend most of my time operating the business.
I think with respect to tax reform, we are plugged in. I think there's a lot of discussion, yet there's no real plan yet for
what tax reform will look like nor when it will appear. But I do think most of the proposals we see would be beneficial
to a company like Allergan or situated like Allergan. Now that certainly could change because details do really matter
in tax reform. Something that could be detrimental or have a negative effect could be a border adjustment, although
minimal, and certainly we aren't any differently situated than any of our peer group. But certainly that's something we
keep an eye on.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: And your second question, Gregg, as you know, the lockup expires in August. And for
planning purposes, we just assumed dividends for the first two quarters. But in August we will evaluate whether we
would sell the Teva stock. But obviously, as we've said in the past, we are not long-term holders of that stock.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: And cash flow outlook for the year overall, Tessa?

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great, thanks very much. First one just on Restasis, can you elaborate on the assumptions
for flat sales in 2017? And you showed solid growth in 4Q and you took a price increase earlier this year. so just how
are you thinking about dynamics here, including price versus volume?
And then a quick follow-up related to tax. When I look at Allergan, you currently have a structural tax advantage
relative to your U.S. peers. You've got full access to your cash flow. But some of those advantages could lessen or
disappear with U.S. corporate tax reform as you look out to 2018 or whenever reform happens. I know tax and cash
access alone aren't drivers of the transaction, but does this prospect of tax reform change in any way how you're
thinking about capital deployment in 2017? Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So let me quickly answer the tax question, and then I'll turn the Restasis question over to
Bill. Look, I think we look at deals, particularly accretive deals, through a very strong strategic screen first, and then
secondarily and equally importantly is the financial metrics. Clearly, having any kind of financial advantage makes that
second analysis easier or potentially stronger, but I don't worry about losing that advantage because of good U.S. tax
reform.
I think to be fair, the benefits or the pros for Allergan, which still has a very large U.S. business and is a U.S. taxpayer,
is good. I think the more vibrant the U.S. business place is because of smart, good tax reform, the better for Allergan as
well. So I don't give that much thought. But as long as we have an advantage, we'll certainly use it as best we can but
never in a way that would violate our commitment to doing strategically sound deals.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: And if I could add relative to your specific question, I don't think it changes our view on
capital deployment specifically for 2017.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I don't think we'll see tax reform in 2017 at this point. And I think with Restasis, I'll turn
it over to Bill. But obviously, we're still in the early innings of a competitive launch, and so we're watching the
situation carefully. But, Bill, do you want to expand on that?
<A - William J. Meury>: Chris, the big story here has been the market is up, as you know, roughly 30% since the
introduction of Xiidra. Pure demand for Restasis in the fourth quarter was very reassuring when I think about the 2017
outlook. We had a 3% to 4% increase in volume despite the introduction of a major competitor.
I think the target that we set for 2017 is a realistic one. Could we beat it? Perhaps, as Brent said, though, it's still very
early. I think we're going to find out over the next six months what the market is going to look like. I do think it's going
to be a stable situation between two products. I firmly believe that we're going to maintain majority market share. We're
focused on the launch of the multi-dose preservative-free product in March, and then True Tear, which is an
electroceutical, in really the second half of the year primarily.
In terms of price/volume, we could have some volume erosion in the low single digits with some modest price
appreciation, or frankly it could be the reverse depending on what we do with health plans on the formulary front. But I
will tell you the formulary coverage is not an unpredictable factor in this story. It's going to be strong in 2017. We have
a real advantage in Medicare Part D, where 40% of our sales are, and I expect that to be the case for 2018. And so, like
I said, realistic, perhaps we can exceed it, but as you know, competitive launches are unpredictable and so we just have
to stay focused on it.

Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman of UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Bill, if you could just – Restasis in the quarter, just specifically, just tell us, was there any
inventory changes at all? Was there anything strange? It was an unusually large quarter. Or was there just better pricing
because rebates got – in the previous quarter it was just baked in?
And then maybe you could just talk about a couple of the other markets that are competitive, how you're viewing
Linzess versus this new product from Synergy, and what's happening, Viberzi versus its competitors in the GI space.
Just talk about a couple of those dynamic markets. Thanks.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, sure, Marc. Listen, on the Restasis front, there were no surprises, no major swings in
wholesaler buying patterns. We had a solid mix of volume and price. Like I said, volume was in the 3% to 4% range,
and we got a little bit more in price. If there was a day or two of inventory swing, that's just normal fluctuations, but no
real surprise.
As it relates to the writer number, which is something you have to watch for in these launches, it's been stable at 25,000
writers on a weekly basis. That usually can be an early warning signal of whether there's going to be disruption in your
business, and we're not really seeing anything.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: The other thing I would just quickly add on Restasis, remember, in the fourth quarter we
do do some programs to bridge people through their co-pay in the first quarter, and so we do see a little bit of increased
demand in the fourth quarter and then the seasonality hits back in the first quarter because we've bridged them through
with a 90-day supply.
<A - William J. Meury>: That's right. As it relates to Linzess and plecanatide, the first thing I would say is there are 1
million patients on Linzess and there are roughly 30 million people that suffer from CIC and IBS-C. There's a lot of
market here.
In terms of how the products compare, cross-study comparisons, as you know, Marc, are virtually impossible. I would
simply say that we have two indications. I said it in the opening remarks. We have two indications, a demonstrated
effect on constipation and pain. We're going to have three doses. Formulary coverage is solid. And the promotional
hurdle in this market is very high, and we have right now enormous marketing reach. We have over 200,000 writers.
We cover almost 100,000 of them directly. And my expectation is that Linzess is going to be, again, the
fastest-growing – one of the fastest-growing products in the company. I think that's going to be the case for the next
several years.
The 72-microgram launch couldn't come at a better time. We developed it specifically to accelerate conversion of that
mild, moderate, intermittent patient that generally is taking over-the-counter medication. I think the business is in a
good position. My sense is if plecanatide is introduced, it's going to be used in Linzess failures and second, and that's
not going to disrupt our growth rate.

Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen of Guggenheim.
<Q - Louise Chen>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question on Esmya. You highlighted that as one of your
top-star products. I'm just curious why your product is better than others that are in development. And do you think
your product can be used as an alternative to surgery? And in the EU and other areas of the world where Esmya is
approved, how long have patients actually been on drug? Thanks.

<A - William J. Meury>: I can talk about it a little bit. Listen, I'll go back to the cross-study comparison point. That's
very hard to draw comparisons. But what I will say is my view is that the benefit/risk ratio of Esmya relative to elagolix
or next-generation elagolix or Bayer's compound is pretty well established, and I think David can speak to that. My
sense is that Esmya has the potential to be a first-line option and used in a broad population of patients relative to a
GnRH agonist, which [ph] might potentially (43:12) be used later in therapy and in a more narrow population of
patients. When you look at the bleeding control data, the impact on tumor size in our Phase 3 studies, whether you look
at the ones done internationally or in the U.S., it's profound and it's significant.
The other key advantage that I think we're going to have is we'll be first mover for uterine fibroids, and that's important
when you're introducing a completely new concept and a non-surgical option. I'll turn it over to David to add any more.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Maybe just a little bit more color, Esmya has a selective progesterone receptor modulator,
has little effect on circulating estrogen levels, has a very low propensity to induce hot flashes, which distinguishes it
from some of the other compounds being developed for this indication.
You asked about surgery. What we really anticipate with Esmya is at the very least there's a substantial delay before
surgery is necessary. And of course, it is a big advantage if we can delay surgery in women suffering from uterine
fibroids because when you go in with surgery and macerate the fibroids, you are spraying potentially malignant cells
around the uterus. So we do anticipate an advantage there.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Next question, operator.

Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Brent, perhaps you can comment on your thoughts on capital allocation at the
moment given where the share price is now versus where it was towards the end of last year, how you're thinking about
buybacks versus transactions, M&A transactions. And then to the extent that you're interested in M&A, how you're
thinking about accretive versus R&D deals.
And then on R&D deals, just given the number of these that you've executed on over the past several months, to what
extent are you able to integrate and follow up on and execute on R&D transactions within the R&D organization at this
point? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, sure, great question. Look, I think with respect to capital allocation in 2017, we're
not really looking to add another buyback. And I still think our stock is undervalued, but we have to complete and settle
the ASR that we have in place. Having spent about $15 billion on stock repurchase since the Teva deal closed, I think
we have done the right thing for our shareholders, but the remaining focus will really be on deploying our capital for
both accretive transactions and pipeline building transactions.
If you look at 2016, we spent round numbers about $5 billion on transactions, of which about $3 billion was LifeCell,
so certainly weighted towards an accretive transaction in 2016. I suspect you'll see that be the case in 2017. Obviously,
we are opportunistic. If great science or something profound came through, that could be subject to change, but we are
focused on having more weight towards accretive transactions that are strategically sound and growth oriented in 2017
while still continuing to invest in science and building out our pipeline.
With respect to integrations, it is a core competency of Allergan. Rob Stewart leads the integration group. We do have
this down to a science. And considering the types of integrations or pre-integrations we did last year, whether it be
Pfizer or the Teva divestiture, the things that we've been doing on the steppingstone on a relative basis seem simple.
Yet we do treat each one very seriously. We've really tried to integrate the cultures and learnings from what made the
smaller company successful, and we try to treat people as fairly and as appropriately as possible. And I think our track
record speaks for itself. Our colleagues are generally eager to join the company.

A great example in R&D, for example, is Tobira, where we went into NASH, an adjacency. The Tobira team, led by
Laurent Fischer, stayed and is now our liver and NASH R&D group inside of the R&D organization, staying in their
same office in South San Francisco and continuing to think even bigger about how to solve the disease than they were
as a standalone. So we do really try to do these thoughtfully. Next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna.
<Q - Andrew Finkelstein>: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit
more about the buying patterns you referenced in 1Q. I take it it's more of an industry-wide phenomenon. But also to
what extent does that reflect the increasing impact of deductible resets on patients? How do you evaluate some of the
early year-to-date prescription trends? To what extent are we seeing that, and if we make year-on-year comparisons for
products in the first quarter? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Maybe, Tessa, why don't you take the first part on the inventory, and then we'll talk
about prescription trends in the first few.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So sequentially Q4 to Q1, you see the normal seasonality that occurs in Eye Care and
other reimbursed products in anticipation of larger co-pay and deductibles. But in Q1 in particular in 2017, we expect
wholesalers to reduce up to potentially one week of inventory, and we incorporated that in our forecast. Given our
announcement that we would do price increases on January 1, we believe they took that into consideration and will
probably trend towards lower inventory levels. Usually, it's three to four weeks. We anticipate them to be at the lower
end, but that's incorporated in the forecast.
<A - William J. Meury>: As it relates to quarterly sales momentum or flow, typically as you know, the first quarter
across most businesses is lighter, and then there's a recovery in the second quarter. Depending on the business, you can
see a little bit of an adjustment in the third quarter, and usually your fourth quarter is the strongest. That's generally the
cadence. Not a new trend, it's perhaps a little bit more pronounced today than it was several years ago because of what
you mentioned. Coverage gaps or coverage shifts, high-deductible plans, co-insurance can impact prescription fill rates.
We don't see it across the entire product line. You'll see, for example, in Aesthetics the growth rates can be pretty
strong in the quarter. Restasis typically has a lower first quarter, but it's really nothing new, and I don't think we're
going to see any surprises in the first quarter. We take various steps to – at least on the commercial side of the business
as opposed to the government reimbursed side, we take several steps on the commercial side to maintain patient access
to medications, whether it's various co-pay assistance programs. And they can be effective but they're not perfect, and I
think that's why you can see some adjustments to sales levels as you end one year and start the next.
<Q - Andrew Finkelstein>: And do you expect Aesthetics to have the same quarterly patterns throughout the year as
in the past?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, that's exactly right. I would expect – what you saw in 2016, you'll see again in 2017.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So you'll see seasonality for Aesthetics in Q1 and Q3, which is the typical seasonality.
<Q - Andrew Finkelstein>: Thanks very much.

<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Hi, thanks. Brent, I'm just wondering with the LifeCell acquisition and the launch of XEN
implant, just your appetite for more devices versus traditional pharmaceuticals as you think about business
development.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, it's a good question, Ken. We tend to try to focus on leadership in our therapeutic
areas is how we talk about it with you guys and the investment community. How we tend to talk about it internally is
our customer. And we try to look at how do we best service the customer, whether that be a plastic surgeon, a
dermatologist, an ophthalmologist or optometrist. And so as we get more experience in surround-sound service and
innovation for the customer, we become exceedingly more comfortable with different types of products.
So this year we'll do XEN. We'll do the electroceutical True Tear. Obviously, we're going deeper into plastic surgery.
We already had a very large robust business in plastic surgery with implants. And so I think we're doing it in a way that
allows the organization to best service the customer but also learn and get smarter. And so there's high innovation and
the strategy is sound and the financials work. We become a little less focused on whether it's a drug, a device, a
combination of the two, or capital equipment or the like. We just look at the strategic and financial rationale of how to
best service the customer.

Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal of Bernstein.
<Q - Aaron Gal, Ph.D.>: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions, quickly if I can, two. Botox MDD I
noticed that the trial closed. It's not clear; you've got two different dates when you're going to report that trial. Is this
coming up, and roughly what's the timing for that?
And secondly, you haven't mentioned Estrace. There's the potential for a generic in 2017. How are you guys dealing
with this with your guidance?
And as long as we're with Tessa, Tessa, assuming the stock does not run up, you're going to get $2 billion back from
the buyback process. Are those $2 billion dedicated to further buyback, or are those going back to general purposes?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So, David, do you want to take MDD? Then maybe Rob Stewart can talk about Estrace
and then Tessa can answer the last part.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: So just quickly on MDD, the trial is completed. We're in the process of locking the
database and making certain that everything is tidied up. We should have the results over that sometime in March.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: On Estrace, Ronny, at this point we're still watching to see whether or not that there would
be a launch. We would be prepared to launch an authorized generic in the event that that happens, but we're not
assuming any near-term Estrace launch.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: And, Ronny, just on MDD, of course we will be looking at the data in its entirety,
including all the IIT [Investigator Initiated Trial] data before we make any decisions about moving forward or not.
<Q - Aaron Gal, Ph.D.>: That's a bit scary, but thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Well, you know depression studies are difficult, particularly a high consumer rate. I have
no idea what this study is. I'm not forecasting or reading any tea leaves. But anytime you do a depression study, we
have a lot of experience doing them. You've got to be very, very patient.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So your question, Ronny, about the ASR, we are committed to completing the $10
billion ASR. The share count average that we provided for 2017 of 357 million shares reflects that. Remember that we
have to settle the borrow, which the borrow was delivered to us in November, and that was actually done at the price
which we disclosed of about $187 per share. The stock has run up obviously, which is a good thing, but we're also

Operator
Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, just a couple if I may. First, Brent, for you on the operating margin, if I look at your
guidance for 2017 and take the midpoint, it does reflect a slight decline from 2016. And obviously having a 50%
operating margin is unusual and a positive, but I think the real question is where directionally should we think about
that margin. Where is it going? Your SG&A as a percentage of sales at the midpoint would be around 27.8% of sales,
which is high relative to the industry average. So help us to think about where those margins are going. Is there upside
to gross margins going forward? Is there downside to SG&A as a percentage of sales? And I presume R&D is really
dependent upon success of Phase 3 assets, so we'll just have to wait. But if you could generally talk about where the
operating margin is going, that would be helpful.
And then secondly for you, Tessa, a question on GAAP versus non-GAAP cash flow from operations, there's still a
very wide gap between the two, with the fourth quarter reporting negative cash flow from operations versus $1.5 billion
in adjusted cash flow from operations, and I see your guidance this year is for negative cash flow on a GAAP basis.
Obviously, the company is very busy with deals et cetera, et cetera. When are we going to start to see GAAP and
non-GAAP from a cash flow perspective start to narrow? Thanks very much.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So let me address the gross margin question. For 201,7 it really reflects to a large extent
the variances. It's product mix with partner products such as Vraylar and Linzess that pay royalties. Remember also,
Jami, that Minastrin we lose in March, which is a high-margin product. And then LifeCell was also dilutive to the gross
margins. When you also compare 2016 to 2017, half of that variance is explained by the Anda accounting treatment,
and probably that issue is best discussed offline. We actually provided a table on table 6 that explains that phenomenon
and why there's a variance there. On a go-forward basis, I think gross margin to a large extent is really going to be
affected by product mix. That was the biggest driver from 2016 to 2017. And as I explained, there are different puts and
takes there.
On operating margin, you're absolutely right. The midpoint is roughly 27.8% for 2017. We are committed to growing
expenses lower than sales. I do think there is room there on a go-forward basis. This year is unusual in the sense that
with the addition of LifeCell and minimal synergies, given the fact that we want to expand that platform, that's where
we're comfortable. But on a go-forward basis, I think SG&A as a percentage of revenue is one where there is absolutely
room.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I would just add one comment. I agree with Tessa. I think that you have to look at
Allergan with that margin structure with arguably that we do the most primary care details United States. We spend the
second most on DTC. And so we really do invest in our products and promotion with strong return on investment
analysis on each one of those dollars spent. And so the leverage really comes from sales growth. And where we can see
margin improvement is as some of these six stars advance and become potential blockbusters, a bunch of them we own
outright, some have some modest royalties, and some have some mix royalties, but product mix will continue to be a
focus.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Then on cash flow, Jami, this quarter there are a couple of things that drove that. One
was the taxes paid on the gain on sale of Teva, which was roughly $700 million. That obviously won't be recurring.
There may be further adjustments as we true up taxes, but I think that's probably the last large payment. And then
secondly, there were restructuring charges, including additional compensation for Foresight, Vitae, and Tobira. And so
obviously to the extent that we don't do any other acquisitions that impact cash flow related to this, then that will also

go away. So I think you would get GAAP to non-GAAP closer, but there are always additional adjustments to that
number.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Next question, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Maris of Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - David Maris>: Good morning, a few. Brent and Bill, fillers continue to grow exceptionally well in both the U.S.
and internationally. Are the things that are driving the growth different in the U.S. and internationally, and can you give
us a little bit of color on what's driving that?
Secondly on Kybella, it's a small product, but it seems to still be struggling a little bit. So with 7,000 injectors and $12
million of sales, it's about $1,700 per doctor. So can you tell us a little bit about or give us some insight into is it an
80:20 rule, or is it very concentrated? What's the difference between maybe the top quartile writer and the average
writer?
And then lastly, Tessa, the dividend was an added benefit this past year. Do you have a target payout ratio for the next
five years, or do you think in five years it will be about where it is now? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So maybe the easiest one to answer is the dividend. We don't have a payout ratio. I'm
answering for Tessa because it's an easy one, but we do expect to increase the dividend over time. And so we'll see how
that goes. We are committed to it, and we're committed to increasing it appropriately over time.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: I think it's a balance on the level of flexibility we want to have. We are a very focused
growth company obviously. So for us, establishing a firm payout ratio today is an antithesis to growth. However, we
are committed to increasing that dividend annually.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: With respect to fillers, and maybe Bill can take Kybella or add to my filler comment. I
think with respect to differences between the U.S. and international, I would say that outside the U.S. they're regulated
as devices. And so we tend to see the products first available in Europe and outside the U.S. and then come to the U.S.
a few years later. So the injector base outside the U.S. has more experience, they're more creative, and they do more
interesting things. And they teach us a lot about how to launch in the U.S., where generally we're going the other way
with many other products.
The difference between fillers and Botox is fillers really shape the face. And I think as we continue to expand the
product line and the different types of fillers for different indications, we're giving the medical aesthetic practitioner
more optionality to do less invasive facelifts or face reshaping. And that's something I think that the medical
community has really embraced is this non-invasive, fast-recovery shape re-facing through fillers. I don't know Bill, if
you would add anything to that.
<A - William J. Meury>: No, I think that's right. I think a lot of aesthetic physicians think about fillers in terms of
utility. And they can smooth, they can soften lines, they can volumize, and they can shape the face. And if you talk to
an aesthetic physician, that's where this market is going. It's a next step past Botox. And they have a lot more
experience internationally for all the reasons that Brent mentioned. And there's just more demand overall, David, across
all age cohorts and across the world, regardless of where you go.
As it relates to Kybella, I would just make a couple comments. First, fat reduction, whether you're talking about the
face or the body, we're of course involved with the face, is the place to be. Demand for these procedures is very high. I
think it's going to continue to get higher. My sense is that this part of the market is where the facial injectable market
was 10 years ago.

The problem that we're solving for right now, you mentioned it, is we are an inch deep and a mile wide. We spent the
year, we trained 10,000 injectors. There's a great deal of awareness, and what we have to focus right now on is moving
this market from awareness and trial to adoption. We need to have more expert injectors. We have revised the
economics around Kybella. And we're selling two treatments so that there's follow-up, which is important to a positive
aesthetic outcome. And then the direct-to-consumer advertising levels will be maintained on high. And we're going to
see how this plays out over the next 6 to 12 months.
This is an important year. I've mentioned before that if you went back a decade and looked at year two sales for the
fillers, namely Juvéderm and Botox, it was roughly 20% of where they are today. And if we can push this thing to $100
million or near $100 million, then we're going to have a very serious product in the United States. We just launched it
internationally, which will provide incremental sales in 2017, 2018, and 2019. And that's how we're looking at it.
Brent?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And then you keep building it by adding new indications. And so if this indication can
deliver that kind of result and David's team continues to expand the label like we've done with the fillers and Botox and
everything else, the formula is there. So we've got to really focus on adoption in 2017, as Bill said.
<Q - David Maris>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. Next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, maybe first with David. David, what are you seeing on a
blinded basis for the liver tox profile of the ongoing Phase 3 oral CGRP? And I understand you have a few months of
patient experience now.
And then perhaps a second one for Brent and Tessa, I just wanted to get more color on the change in accounting
nomenclature to the performance net income. And I was just curious why the change if metrics are identical and
whether SEC had feedback on the accounting for upfronts for R&D payments or something else. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So, David, do you want to take the CGRP?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yes, sure, I'm happy to. Hi, Umer. We're very happy with the way enrollment is going in
the Phase 3 studies with ubrogepant and the Phase 2b study with aptogepant. Clearly on the ubrogepant studies, we're
actually recruiting ahead of schedule. Obviously, everything is blinded, but so far in a blinded fashion we haven't seen
anything of concern in terms of liver toxicity. Everything is still blinded, but nothing of any concern seen to date.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So our discussions with the SEC really have been limited towards the change on
nomenclature and additional disclosures. There was no other conversation, and so therefore there was no change in the
calculation methodology.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Got it. Tessa, so why change it then from non-GAAP net income?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: We could debate this, if you want, for hours.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: I think the simple answer is we wanted to provide clarity that in fact this is a
performance measure and this is the measure that we use as a management team. If you look at the industry, there
really isn't any one standard in our conversations with them. We wanted to comply with a change in the name, so it was
easy.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Got it. And by the way, David, thank you for that answer. Thank you very much.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Great, yes.

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. How is the company thinking about
managing the potential loss of exclusivity on Restasis? And you mentioned Rhofade could be a sleeper hit. Could you
give us a sense of the ramp there to the potential hundreds of millions of dollars?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So look, I think with Restasis, we feel very strongly in our intellectual property position.
We have five or six – I'm sorry, off the top of my head, six Orange Book-listed patents to 2024, and we think we are in
a very strong position with respect to Restasis. Obviously, we also think about all of our products in terms of
innovation and how to continue to expand, and the multi-dose format of the product has patents that go out to 2031, I
believe.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: 2032.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: 2032. See, I keep getting corrected by Lisa. So I think we've got a lot of durability in that
franchise, and we'll continue to look to add novel and new ways to treat the disease, whether it be True Tear or new
molecules or new ways of delivering drugs to the eye.
<A - William J. Meury>: As it relates to Rhofade, listen, there's a big unmet need right now in the dermatology
community. I think every dermatologist is going to try this product. And if it performs, you'll see fairly rapid adoption.
I would think about it as a gentler Mirvaso, which was a very potent and effective product. Sales ramp, think about a 3
to 5-year picture, which is pretty typical. Maybe a little bit faster, but I would think about it in terms of 3 to 5 years.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, guys. I wanted to go back to migraine. You're going to have the refile of
Semprana in the back half of this year. That should put you on market for an important acute launch in the first half of
2018. How should we think about the ramp alongside of Botox for chronic and really the growth trajectory of both of
those through 2018 and beyond as we see some of the see CGRPs start to come to market?
And then the add-on to that is are you currently happy with your migraine footprint, or is there a desire to add more
assets in that area? Thanks.
<A - William J. Meury>: As it relates to our migraine footprint, we could have the broadest and deepest product line
in the industry with Semprana, which is an inhaler, Botox, which is an injectable, and of course we have the oral
CGRPs. I like the way it looks, and we cover both acute and chronic.
I'll start with Botox. And I've said this before, it is the growth driver for Botox Therapeutic. It's as effective in chronic
migraine as any product in development. There are less than 200,000. As successful as we've been with Botox, less
than 200,000 people receive it, and there are anywhere from 3 million to 5 million who actually could benefit from it.
So even with the introduction of CGRPs, I believe that there is a place for Botox, and it's going to continue to be a
growth driver. It's as effective. The benefit/risk ratio is at least as good and certainly better understood than anything
that's in development, and it's highly economical. It's one of the best bargains in the industry on the therapeutic side,
and so I think it's always going to have a place.

The CGRPs I think are going to take from all this off-label use. It's one of the largest off-label markets in the industry.
Opioids, NSAIDs, PCAs, anti-depressants, anti-epileptics are all being used because there is nothing.
As it relates to Semprana, it could be a faster acting alternative to triptans. And at least in the Phase 3 trials, there
wasn't a great deal of rebound headache, which can be a problem with triptans. You don't have some of the
triptan-related side effects with dihydroergotamine that you may with an Imitrex or one of the others. And I think the
category has the potential to really, really develop on the chronic side. And on the acute side of course, there's no
alternative right now to the triptan class. And I think that's what Semprana will be, and then of course ubrogepant.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Should we think about Semprana in a similar way that we think about Viberzi and
Linzess? You're adding a product. There's not much incremental spend, and we could see some synergistic benefits
given that you're adding an acute to an existing product. And again, so you're playing in a very underpenetrated market.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, the thing I like about it is we're set up in neurology. We have plenty of capacity to take
care of all these products. I also like the fact that neurologists and primary care physicians, and we can cover that
segment too, have had no alternative for triptans for a long time, and I think they want and need one. The failure rate in
migraine isn't quite what it is in the antidepressant market, but managing pain is tough and they need more alternatives.
If we can get it across the finish line, it will be a nice add-on to our Neurology business.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great, thanks.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of David
Amsellem of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. So, Brent, you had alluded to a view that the shares are not fully valued. So I
guess the question here is give the dynamics around the cash pay/consumer/medical aesthetics business, which are
fairly strong, would you consider potentially a split-up of the company into a consumer cash-pay piece and a
prescription-strength piece as a means of unlocking value? And is that something that would be on the table down the
road? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So it's not on the table. Look, we just went through a transformational 2016. I think we're
looking at our company today and the business we have with great enthusiasm and opportunity for continued leverage
and development across our therapeutic areas. And so it's not something that we're discussing or debating. In the future,
I always say nothing is off the table because we don't know what the future will bring. But I wouldn't want to
encourage any speculation or discussion around us breaking the company apart. That's not on our agenda and it's not
something our board is discussing.
Brenton L. Saunders
So with that, operator, I just want to quickly thank everyone for joining us. We're very proud of what we achieved in
2016. We're looking forward to continuing to focus on execution in 2017 and keeping you updated as we go. Thank
you for joining us.
