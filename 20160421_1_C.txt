MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach; and
Treasurer, James von Moltke. Today's call will be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. We
ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given
instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you
have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Mr. Kapp, you may begin.
Peter Kapp
Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CFO, John Gerspach, who
will speak first. Then James von Moltke, our Treasurer, will take you through the fixed income investor presentation
which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a number of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC
filings, including without limitation the Risk Factor section of our 2015 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over John.

Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this
quarter, and I'd like to begin by highlighting some key points from our first quarter 2016 results. After that, I'll turn the
call over to our Treasurer, James von Moltke, who will provide an update on our balance sheet and issuance plans.
Then we'll be happy to take your questions.
Last week we reported net income of $3.5 billion or $1.10 per share. These results reflected a more challenging macro
environment than we anticipated at the start of the year. In our institutional businesses, market sensitive products
primarily markets and investment banking, suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. However, our
accrual and transaction services businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth in constant dollars, consistent with recent
quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now represent almost half of our institutional revenues.
Investor sentiment also had impacted our consumer businesses, especially wealth management, particularly in Asia. We
took a number of actions this quarter to ensure Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment,
including a significant repositioning charge as a result. We expect these actions to allow us to reduce capacity in those
areas where revenues are likely to remain muted while preserving our client-facing capabilities.
Despite the environmental headwinds, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our
core businesses, continued to utilize deferred tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced
our expenses. Our investments in U.S. branded cards are driving growth in loans and purchase sales, and we announced
that we will no longer report Citi Holdings as a separate segment after 2016. Citi Holdings assets now represent just 4%
of the total and will continue to decline with signed agreements to sell an additional $10 billion.
We further strengthened our balance sheet and we held our net interest margin flat, fully offsetting the impact of the
sale of higher-yielding assets in OneMain during the fourth quarter of 2015. Credit quality remained favorable overall
outside of energy, and consumer credit demonstrated stable to improving NCLs and delinquencies in every region. We
maintained a diversified funding profile. Our deposit quality remained strong. We continue to execute against our debt
and preferred stock issuance plans, and we reduced our estimated TLAC shortfall, and our capital, leverage and
liquidity ratios remain robust.
On slide three, we show total Citigroup results. As I noted a moment ago, in the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion.
Revenues of $17.6 billion were down 11% from last year on a reported basis, mostly driven by lower industry-wide
activity in markets and investment banking, and continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX
translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9% year-over-year, including a 6% decline in Citicorp. Expenses
declined 3% driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and a benefit from FX translation partially
offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses were 12% lower
than the prior year, offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year.
And now let me turn the call over to James.
James von Moltke
Thank you, John. Beginning on slide four, we show balance sheet trends over the past five quarters. On a reported
basis, total assets decreased by just over $30 billion in the past year but increased $70 billion from year end. To better
reflect underlying business trends, we presented this slide and several others in today's presentation on a constant dollar
basis. On this basis, our balance sheet decreased by $23 billion from the prior year period, slightly more than 1%. Cash
and investments, which are predominantly high quality liquid assets, increased to 28% of total assets, and we've
maintained a strong liquidity position.
Citicorp loans and total Citigroup deposits each grew 5%, reflecting the strength of our core customer franchises.
Reverse repos and trading assets decreased 8% as did repos and trading liabilities, reflecting lower client activity and
our continued focus on efficient balance sheet use. Sequentially, assets increased $55 billion from a low point at year
end 2015, while average assets were flat to the fourth quarter, reflecting the decline in assets during the fourth quarter
to year end and the ramp back up over the course [indiscernible] (6:28). Along with market activity levels, trading

assets and liabilities, including repo and reverse repo, increased from unusually low levels at year end, and long-term
debt increased following the extensive redemption activity in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Slide five presents trends in our loan portfolio in constant dollars. Total Citigroup loans increased 1% year-over-year
despite continued reductions in Citi Holdings. We grew Citicorp loans 5% as we continue to serve our high credit
quality target clients in both the consumer and institutional businesses. Consumer loans grew 2% year-over-year driven
by 4% growth in North America, including a 2% increase in branded cards. International consumer loan growth overall
was flat as a reduction in mortgages was offset by continued growth in personal loans and cards.
On the institutional side, loans grew 7% year-over-year in total. Our corporate lending portfolio increased 10% based
on new business and funding of transaction related commitments to target market clients. TTS loans declined 1%, and
markets and private bank loans grew 11% during the year, and we saw continued opportunities to support client
activity. Citi Holdings loans decreased 32% year-over-year driven by $18 billion of reductions in North America
mortgages, including transfers to held for sale. Nearly 80% of Holdings remaining loans are North America mortgages.
On slide six, we show credit quality trends in our consumer loan portfolio. Consumer credit performance remained
broadly favorable this quarter with stable to improving NCLs, delinquency rates and reserve coverage.
Turning to slide seven, Commercial Banking is reported as part of our global consumer banking segment and accounted
for roughly $80 million of cost of credit in the first quarter driven by reserve builds related to the energy sector in North
America. This slide provides additional details on these energy exposures. On a global basis, we have energy exposure
of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion of this amount funded, representing roughly 4% of total
commercial loans. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments, are predominantly
non-investment grade and are concentrated in North America. And our funded reserve ratio on these loans is roughly
9%.
Turning to slide eight, let me discuss our corporate credit performance. As John noted earlier, outside of the energy
sector, credit has remained broadly stable. During the first quarter, ICG cost of credit of $390 million was down from
the fourth quarter but up significantly from last year. Energy drove $375 million of this amount, including $150 million
of NCLs and $260 million of net loan loss reserve builds. Non-accrual loans increased 47% from fourth quarter levels
to 76 basis points of loans.
Corporate non-accrual loans increased by $730 million sequentially, with roughly $500 million related to energy and
$90 million related to metals and mining. The increase in non-accrual loans in metals and mining as well as other
sectors outside of energy did not result in material cost of credit as we had collateral against many of these loans. The
ratio of LLR to corporate non-accrual loans was 1.3 times as of the end of the first quarter.
Turning to slide nine, we provide more detail on our energy exposures in ICG. Total exposure, including funded and
unfunded loans, was $57 billion at the end of the first quarter, down somewhat from December. The portfolio remains
largely high-grade with 73% of total exposure rated investment grade, down from roughly 80% at year end. We did see
ratings downgrades during the quarter of about $3.8 billion of total exposure migrating from investment grade to
non-investment grade due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. However, we also
saw improvement in the underlying portfolio as roughly $2 billion of non-investment grade exposure was cancelled or
repaid during the quarter and replaced with new credits that reflect the current environment.
Funded loans increased this quarter from $20.5 billion to $22.3 billion. We did not see material drawdowns against our
RBL facility this quarter, and the small amount that did occur was offset by pay downs. The increase in funded loans
principally resulted from new business underwritten to the current environment as well as drawdowns on non-RBL
facilities partially offset by some pay downs and loan sales. Our funded reserve ratio increased to 4.2%, including over
10% on the non-investment grade portion.
On slide 10, we provide some additional insight into our $35 billion of unfunded exposures to the energy sector. Of this
amount, $11 billion relates to fronting risk and letters of credit. These exposures are generally highly rated, roughly
70% is single-A rated or better, reflecting structural protections. Revolving credit facilities comprised the remaining
$24 billion. Of this amount, nearly $9 billion is single-A rated or better, an example being commercial paper back-stop

facility to a multinational client. And another $6 billion is already rated non-investment grade, so we would typically
have maintenance covenants to protect us. Additionally 25% of this $6 billion is secured. This leaves us with $9.5
billion of BBB rated revolving credit facilities where there is the greatest risk of migration to non-investment grade.
So of our $35 billion of unfunded exposure, roughly 60% is comprised of exposure where we generally benefit from
some combination of structural support, collateral, or high investment grade ratings. These include fronting risk, letters
of credit, highly rated revolving credit facilities and secured non-investment grade exposure totaling roughly $21
billion. The remaining $14 billion is comprised of BBB rated facilities and unsecured non-investment grade exposures.
And while this $14 billion is where we see the greatest potential risk, it is important to note that roughly half of this
exposure or $7 billion is in lower risk sub sectors, including energy process industries and integrated oil and gas.
Turning to slide 11, we show the composition of our deposits which fund over 50% of our assets. Total deposits
increased 5% from last year's first quarter despite reductions in Citi Holdings. Citicorp grew deposits by 6% in constant
dollars with continued high quality deposit flows across our franchise. The LCR liquidity value of our deposits remain
stable. Consumer deposits increased 2%, including 4% growth in international markets. Corporate deposits increased
7% year-over-year as TTS captured additional operating flows from new and existing clients.
On slide 12, we update our regulatory liquidity metrics. This quarter, we disclosed our LCR on an average basis in
anticipation of proposed regulatory disclosure requirements expected later this year. Our average LCR was 120% in the
first quarter, higher than the levels we have maintained over the past year, reflecting both an increase in average HQLA
to roughly $400 billion as well as lower net outflows. The increase in HQLA reflected an increase in cash and
investments as the balance sheet grew from the relatively low levels at year end and deposit growth outstripped loan
growth in the quarter. Outflows declined mainly due to a lengthening in maturity of both deposits and repos. These
changes helped us to manage our liquidity across our legal entity structure, consistent with our resolution planning
work. We are working to deploy the additional liquidity efficiently and expect to bring our average LCR back closer to
recent levels over time, though it will remain elevated for several quarters.
As for the Net Stable Funding Ration, or NSFR, we continue to expect the U.S. regulators to propose a version of these
rules in the first half of 2016. We currently estimate that our NSFR under the international version of the rules is in
excess of the 100% minimum requirement.
On slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and net interest margin. Our NIM was 292 basis points in the first
quarter, flat to the fourth quarter, as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM
remains high and stable, reflecting our focus on the productivity of our balance sheet despite the impact of de-risking
and holding elevated levels of liquidity.
Funding costs continue to support our NIM stability as deposit costs decreased year-over-year and increased by 1 basis
point sequentially. And long-term debt costs declined despite the increase in policy rates. Our estimate of the net
interest revenue benefit from a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel rate shift declined to just under $2 billion, and the
portion attributable to U.S. rates remain stable at approximately $1.4 billion. We remain conservatively positioned for
interest rates consistent with market expectations for further rate moves.
On slide 14, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the quarter, our total long-term debt
increased to $208 billion. Parent company debt increased by $10 billion for the year end to $156 billion. Benchmark
debt increased during the quarter as I will cover in a moment. Customer-related debt increased by $2 billion but
remained in a normal range. While this debt will not likely qualify as TLAC, it is part of an attractive customer
franchise for us. As the TLAC rules are finalized, we intend to optimize this program relative to our TLAC needs. Bank
level debt increased by $3 billion as securitization maturities were not replaced with new issuance.
Credit card securitizations remain a cost effective option to optimize our overall liquidity position, and we expect to
issue in this market during 2016 though issuance will likely remain below maturities this year. The weighted average
maturity of our long-term debt increased slightly to seven years. Over the course of 2016, we continue to expect our
weighted average maturity to increase as we extend the tenure of our new issuance, so we expect to end the year
somewhat longer than seven years. And our preferred stock outstanding has reached $19 billion, including the issuance

earlier this week.
Turning to slide 15, let me cover our issuance and redemption expectations. In 2016, we continue to expect gross
issuance of roughly $25 billion of senior and subordinated debt of which we issued $7 billion in the first quarter,
slightly ahead of pace for the year. This included $700 million of foreign currency issuance under U.S. law and $1.5
billion of subordinated debt and had a weighted average maturity of 7.6 years. $4 billion of debt matured during the
quarter out of a total of $15 billion expected for the full year. We expect buybacks in the range of $4 billion of
benchmark debt in 2016 though we were not active buying back debt this past quarter.
This combination of new issuance, maturities and redemptions will result in net issuance of benchmark debt of
approximately $8 billion in 2016 as we build towards TLAC compliance. Our total Tier 2 capital currently represents
roughly 190 basis points of risk weighted assets. We expect to issue subordinated debt to target roughly 200 basis
points over the course of the next several years as well as to offset amortization of capital credit and to replace
redemptions of subordinated debt.
And finally, including the $1.5 billion preferred offering we announced earlier this week, our preferred issuance for the
year totals $2.5 billion. Since late 2012, we have issued a total of $19 billion of preferred stock with a weighted average
coupon of 6.1%. This issuance brings our additional Tier 1 capital to slightly more than our targeted level of 150 basis
points of risk weighted assets.
On slide 16, we update our estimates of our total loss absorbing capacity based on the Federal Reserve's October 2015
proposed rule. During the comment period, numerous industry participants contributed feedback on many elements of
the proposal, including the calibration of the requirements and the various debt eligibility criteria. We remain hopeful
that the final rule will reflect many of these comments through changes to the rule, the addition of grandfathering
provisions and clarifications of many of the technical details. We expect the final rule to be released in the next several
quarters which will allow us to refine our issuance plans to achieve compliance.
Based on the assumptions set forth on the slide, we currently estimate that we meet our expected requirement under the
total loss absorbing capacity definition as we show in the middle column on this slide. Accordingly, we expect our
estimated long-term debt requirement of 9% to remain our binding constraint under the TLAC rules. Our estimate of
this measure is shown in the right-most column. We've reached a ratio of 8.1% of our risk weighted assets as of the end
of the first quarter, equating to a long-term debt shortfall of $11 billion. The $4 billion improvement from last quarter
reflects the growth in our benchmark debt outstanding partially offset by growth in our risk weighted assets.
We can reduce our issuance needs by extending the maturity profile of our issuances. As maturities extend, the share of
our benchmark debt rendered ineligible due to remaining times of maturity will decrease. So overall, we expect to
increase our long-term debt outstanding by approximately $8 billion from today's level over the 11 quarters remaining
before the rule takes effect.
As we note on the slide, this estimate excludes the impact of non-U.S. law debt, which could add approximately $10
billion to our needs if the final rule is consistent with the proposal in excluding this debt. Our current estimates of
long-term debt include $22 billion of non-U.S. law debt, $12 billion of which will roll off between now and 2019. Of
course, our estimates are necessarily subject to the final rules once adopted.
To summarize, let me emphasize three points. First, based on our current analysis, we believe the proposal's impact on
our issuance plans and earnings is manageable. We expect our total incremental benchmark debt to be roughly $8
billion as a result of the TLAC rules. Consequently, our efforts remain more concentrated on the form of our debt rather
than the amount of it. We expect the rule to be finalized later this year allowing us to further refine our plans. And
importantly, we expect to use the time available to us to build our eligible debt outstanding in a gradual and
economically rational way, pursuing our regular issuance plans while extending our maturity profile and reducing
ineligible liabilities.
Turning to slide 17, let me summarize our capital position which remains among the strongest in the industry. During
the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio improved to 12.3% driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6
billion of DTA utilization even as we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of common share

buybacks and dividends. Our total capital ratio increased 40 basis points to 15.7% driven by growth in CET1 as well as
our issuance of preferred stock and subordinated debt. And our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4% while
Citibank's SLR improved 20 basis points to 6.9%.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four key points. First, despite a challenging environment, we earned $3.5
billion of net income and took a number of actions to improve our returns while investing in the core franchises. We
utilized $1.6 billion of DTA, and we continued to make progress in winding down Citi Holdings, which we will no
longer report separately after 2016. Second, we have maintained total assets of $1.8 trillion while serving clients by
growing deposits and loans in our core Citicorp businesses. Despite stresses in our energy portfolio, asset quality has
remained broadly stable, including in the emerging markets.
Third, we have continued to prepare our business and balance sheet for the ongoing evolution of the regulatory
landscape from a position of significant strength. We reported a CET1 capital ratio of 12.3%, an SLR of 7.4% and an
average LCR of 120%. And finally, our funding base remains a key strength. Our deposit base is stable and high
quality, and our long-term debt issuance plans are on track.
With that, John and I will be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Knutson with Legal & General. Please go
ahead.
<Q - David L. Knutson>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks, again, for doing a fixed income call.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Our pleasure.
<Q - David L. Knutson>: A couple quick questions, one in regards to oil and gas. Is there anything about this cycle or
your exposures that would significantly change the recovery expectations on non-performing debt or debt that
ultimately has to be charged off?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Compared to what?
<Q - David L. Knutson>: Compared to the last cycle, compared to average expectations, maybe if 40% of notional is
what's expected generally on a recovery. Is that going to be significantly wrong this time around, or is it too early to
tell?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's too early to tell. I'm not prepared to go into the expectations of what we're going
to recover. We're in the process, as we said, of establishing what we believe will be appropriate reserves. You
understand that we've got a history of setting up reserves and then having NCLs actually fall far below the level of
reserves that we set up. Let's hope that that's what happens again this cycle. And then we'll see about of those NCLs
what level of recovery that we ultimately would get. But I think it's a bit early to go into any sort of detail in that.
<Q - David L. Knutson>: Okay. Two other real quick ones. The drawdown in the first quarter of 2016, would you
characterize that as kind of chunky or diverse among your borrowers? Was it just a few folks taking down the rest of
their line, or was it broadly spread out across borrowers in sub-sectors?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd characterize it as being more broadly based than chunky.
<Q - David L. Knutson>: Got it. And then the last question, with TLAC coming out as you said over the next few
quarters or later this year, will the indenture you're issuing debt under be significantly different from the one that you're
issuing debt under today?

<A - James von Moltke>: We do expect, obviously, changes to reflect the regulatory guidance that's embodied in the
draft rule for the proposal, but I'd have to say I can't predict what those changes would be and therefore how extensive
they would represent for our indentures. I think market practice will evolve. And as it evolves, we'll obviously follow
that market practice. And all of that awaits the final rule that we expect in the coming quarters.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Good morning, John and James.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Good morning.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: In terms of the preferred stock outstanding, do you need to run your balance at 1.5% of RWAs for
reported capital basis – purposes? Or do you need to have a slightly higher amount given CCAR and the potential for
expanded RWAs?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't think we look at the 150 basis points as a required level or something that we have to
manage to with precision. And frankly, where we run at higher levels of Common Equity Tier 1, obviously we can
afford to have AT1 levels slightly below 150 basis points if risk weighted assets essentially outgrow the preferred
already outstanding. So in short, we'd expect it to evolve over time, but we're not going to adhere to a 150 basis point
level as a minimum that would drive additional issuance, given balance sheet growth.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: And is the constraint CCAR, or is it the reported levels?
<A - James von Moltke>: It features in the overall capital ratios that we calculate as part of CCAR. I mean frankly, it
hasn't been our constraining ratio. So we look at it as a natural part of the capital structure. The regulation suggests 150
basis points is a sensible level, and so more or less, we intend to heed to that. But it isn't specifically CCAR driven.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: And then kind of changing gears for a second, in terms of oil and gas, the contagion effect, is that –
are you seeing any effects of contagion going from direct into indirect, or has the oil patch being such a great market
given a bit higher employment and now it's kind of getting back to a normal run rate?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I wouldn't characterize anything as normal run rate or anything like that. But as of yet,
absolutes always give me a problem. So I don't want to say that we haven't seen any contagion. But we certainly
haven't seen anything that we would consider to be, oh, yeah, here comes the contagion impact of that. So there doesn't
seem to be that contagion effect at this point in time. And we'll see how that develops. You know, again, there are a lot
of benefits from lower oil prices.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Yup. And my last question, in terms of TLAC and given the corrective actions, how do you think
over time a bank should look at TLAC, they should look at the same as the risk-based capital levels? Should you have a
higher buffer particularly since we have a long-term debt requirement that we haven't had before? How should we look
at that?
<A - James von Moltke>: So, I guess, first of all, I'd say we'll wait for the final rule before determining what a
proposed buffer would look like. Among other things, we need to see how hard the floor is and what the sanctions are
and whether there are cure periods or other things that emerge in the final rule. But ultimately, I'd also point out that the
way the rule is written, essentially there's a year and a half period of time given the haircuts in the one and two years to
maturity buckets that represent in and of themselves a buffer. And so how much buffer one would want to hold above
that is something that we'll have to determine once we see the final rule.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kehoe with GSAM [Goldman Sachs Asset Management]. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the call. I had just two questions on regulation.
Earlier this month, it sounds like the Treasury and the IRS issued details around earnings strip and the effect of foreign
entities, various entities making investments overseas. Does that impact your ability or your willingness to issue foreign
law debt?
<A - James von Moltke>: The Treasury will – not foreign law debt, no. Foreign law debt is something we're going to
give thought to based on the TLAC rule. So there is an implication in TLAC of how much foreign law debt we would
issue. But as it relates to the Treasury guidance that was issued a few weeks ago, it's obviously something we're
examining. But it affects the intercompany flows rather than third-party debt.
<A - James von Moltke>: Correct.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So it's an intercompany rather than third-party issue.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: So how does that interplay with TLAC? Does it have any adverse consequences for
you or how you would fund your operations in the U.K., for example?
<A - James von Moltke>: No. I view the two as basically totally separate.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Great. Thank you. And then the second question really is just to understand whether
there will be any implications of the re-proposed single counterparty limit role and whether that would have any
material impacts on your business exposure to other bank holding companies. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Thank you for the question. So we are looking obviously at the re-proposal that was issued.
We see some significant benefits in that re-proposal versus the prior iterations. But obviously we're continuing to assess
whether there are implications in our business against our counterparty exposures as they exist today, and where there
are exceptions, what the mitigation actions might be. Overall, we look at it as not imposing significant new constraints
on our business. But as I say, it remains something that we're looking at carefully and evaluating.
<Q - Mark Wadding Kehoe>: Great. Thanks.

<Q>: I always well appreciate it. So just looking at your commentary about extending the average maturity of your
liabilities and was the $4 billion of expected liability management this year, could you address one part of your curve
which seems to be particularly out of whack with its peers and within its own curve, particularly the 10-year senior
bucket? How are you thinking about this given the amount of debt outstanding at that particular point in the curve and
looking to address that?

<A - James von Moltke>: Thanks, [ph] Scott (34:42). What I'd say is whenever we issue and as we look at our
issuance plans, we're obviously looking carefully at the market environment where secondary levels are and also our
maturity in tenor stack. So those are considerations that we take into account whenever we issue. I don't want to talk to
our specific plans in terms of tenors that we'll issue in the near term. What we have said as I noted in the prepared
remarks is given the overall desire to extend maturities, we are issuing with a view to TLAC compliance. And that
obviously features into our thinking. That's really all I'll say on that, [ph] Scott (35:25).
<Q>: Okay. And two other things, I do appreciate your commentary today. But earlier on the call, I think most people
in the investor community, as we get more details on the TLAC and the final ruling, will look to work with you and
others on a new indenture and what language would be appropriate given the new constraints. And lastly I just wanted
to say congratulations on your living will results. I think that was unexpected by most but very well appreciated. Good
job.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Thank you, [ph] Scott (35:54).
<Q>: Thank you very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And as it relates to the indentures, we obviously also appreciate the work that the
investment community has given to providing feedback to the agencies on the indenture subject. So thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Hima Inguva with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Thanks again for doing the call. Very helpful.
<A - James von Moltke>: Our pleasure.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Two questions. Great. So as you had some time to review the fundamental review of the
trading book, are you able to give us an idea on its effects? And then I would like to know how you're thinking about it.
One of your peers has quantified some impacts.
<A - James von Moltke>: I'd say, first of all, it's too early for us to really quantify an impact with precision. We
obviously looked carefully at FRTB when it was released earlier this year. Noted some improvements in some areas
where the improvements were less than the industry had expected and hoped. Whenever these new rules are issued, we
have to put a lot of work into our expected litigation actions. And so estimating the ultimate RWA potential increases
that would come from it really requires that we understand the full effect of those mitigation actions and I'd say that's
where we are today.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then making sure I understood this correctly, so sub-issuance
should be slim the rest of the year considering where you were at and then there should be no more preferred issuance
in the remainder of the year? Is that accurate?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think broadly accurate. Obviously I never want to say never on issuance. And I think that
the first or second question on preferred I think captured our view there that we're basically at our target level, and so
we'll assess from here. As it relates to sub-debt, I think what we want to indicate is that we are slowly, over the course
of this year and next migrating or transitioning from a bill mode to get up to the 200 basis points sort of target level to
more of a sustained mode, where our issuance would really address amortization and – of a capital benefit than
maturities. How quickly we make that transition will depend on the market environment overall and our issuance plans
as well as potential redemption actions. So it's hard to give you precise guidance on what that issuance counter looks
like.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Great. And also my congrats on living will. That was pretty neatly done. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Arnold Kakuda with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Please go ahead
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Great. Thanks for holding the call, guys, and taking my call. So I'm looking at the debt
buyback plan for the year, and it seems like it went down from $8 billion in 4Q to $4 billion now. And also the fact that
you guys didn't do debt buybacks in 1Q and spreads kind of blew out. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on why did
the – why no buybacks in 1Q and then did you actually take down your debt buyback plans for 2016
<A - James von Moltke>: So one clarification to offer on that slide is that our presentation moved from including
structured debt in the buyback expectations to capturing only the benchmark component of potential future
redemptions. So part of the gap that you're noticing reflects really the population of debt that we're talking about. I'd
say secondly the redemption actions as we've said before from time to time as was the case in the fourth quarter reflect
more strategic balance sheet positioning. But on a BAU basis are more about managing the efficiency of our funding
curves in the secondary market and so they are – I'd characterize them as more opportunistic. In the first quarter, we
just didn't see the right conditions to engage in significant redemption activity. And so it was really market dependent,
our decision-making in the first quarter.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Okay. Great. And then so your deposits continue to grow and your LCR is really robust at
120%. So it seems like you're pretty well set up for any kind of use using that to I guess, potentially buy back some
more equity. I think you mentioned kind of the stronger ask in CCAR this year. But also potentially can you manage
down that LCR if let's say the Fed would raise rates two times this year and then we might see deposit outflows? Will
that also kind of bring down your LCR levels?
<A - James von Moltke>: What I would say is we do see the 120% average level from the first quarter as elevated,
and as I mentioned, it reflected a number of factors that existed in the first quarter but also have been building over
time. We would like to manage it down more into a 110% to 115% level which we think is consistent with our
resolution planning work, generally where we want to hold cash and investments. But that takes some time in terms of
optimizing the balance sheet and to some extent is also market dependent in terms of opportunities to grow loan assets
and other liquid assets. But it is something that we focus on and we'll seek to optimize in the coming quarters.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Okay. Great. And then, for James again, so you've had a few quarters in the new rule under
your belt, and I'm curious to hear about your impressions. So what has been the most surprising thing about being the
Treasurer? And then also what has been the biggest gap between what analysts and investors focus on versus what you
think is really important about Citigroup
<A - James von Moltke>: That's a very broad question. I guess the first thing that I would say – and this isn't a
surprise, but the focus of our work for a number of years has been to position and evolve the balance sheet to optimize
it under a series of new regulations. We've been I think an early adopter in terms of moving the balance sheet to LCR
compliance and introducing a number of other elements into our liquidity and capital structure thinking. And I guess
the short answer is, there is continued work ahead, and that is the focus, perhaps not a surprise but certainly a focus that
I and the team have as we move forward.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - James von Moltke>: Thank you.

<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Hi, guys. On the TLAC requirements, can you explain again how you expect to fill the $11
billion deficit? Did I hear that most of that will kind of evolve naturally as you extend out the duration of your liability
structure?
<A - James von Moltke>: Yeah, well, let me comment. One thing to understand about the $11 billion is that that can
move around from time to time based on the profile if you like our decay, the decay that over time takes place in terms
of instruments moving either from beyond two years into one to two years or from two years into the one year and in
bucket. So what matters to that long-term debt shortfall estimate is not even the absolute amount of debt outstanding,
but at the margin, the amount that's coming in to a decay window. So that's the first thing. The second thing is that, that
number doesn't really accurately represent the shortfall, at least not on a forward-looking basis. And what we are
building is issuance plans through to the 1/1/19 effective date of the rule. And so it's managing a much longer sort of
arch of a shortfall than the quarter to quarter arch that we will – or quarter to quarter positions that we'll be reporting to
each quarter. Does that make sense? Is that helpful?
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Right. Because each quarter you're going to have a certain amount of debt that falls into the
decay bucket?
<A - James von Moltke>: Exactly. But the $8 billion represents a longer term glide path that's influenced by, among
other things, the percentage of the total benchmark debt that is eligible. And that is driven, as we've mentioned, by the
overall weighted average maturity of our issued debt.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: So your planning – your longer term planning is based on the $8 billion and then that number
shouldn't really change all that much?
<A - James von Moltke>: Exactly that's the way we were summarizing. We steadily look to bring that $8 billion down
to zero over the remaining 11 quarters of the period. Thank you.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Right, right. Okay. On the energy exposure, can you tell us what portion of that is criticized
and what the change was from your end?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't have the criticized numbers in front of me. I'm sorry.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But you can see some of the movement obviously in the non-accrual loans. We talked about
that when we did the earnings call that of the 730 million of increase, the million of increase that we had, the
non-accrual loans, about 500 million or so of that was energy related. So you can see it there in the non-accrual loans.
And, again, a large portion of those non-accrual loans are still performing. I think we cited a reference of something
close to or around two-thirds of those loans are still performing.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: And given – I'm not sure how far you are through the redetermination -spring redetermination.
Can you kind of quantify what portion of the borrowing base has been declined or has been taken down?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. I mean we're still going through the spring determinations and our redeterminations as
we said before. But what we did comment on and what we did offer as commentary last week was that our expectation
is that across our CCB RBL exposure as well as the ICG RBL exposure that our expectations are coming out of the
spring redeterminations is that we could see as much as a $500 million reduction in the borrowing capacity, so in our
exposure.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: That's just on the RBL.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's just on RBL.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Right, that $4 billion. Okay. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - James von Moltke>: Hi, Robert.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi. Thanks for doing the call as well as the industry-leading disclosure on energy. It's greatly
appreciated. A couple of questions on energy, couple on the living will. On the energy side, concern is that some of the
borrowers that are stressed will, for lack of a better term, make a run at the bank in that draw down revolvers, quickly
try and get their hands on as much funding as they can before they might file. Can you talk about how your efforts to
secure revolvers before they're drawn or put in other covenants there so you avoid that kind of situation where stress
borrowers are kind of creating their own dip before they file?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, let me start. One, we haven't seen that behavior at all, all right? So there has been
nothing to date to suggest that. Having said that, it's not that we don't watch that. We watch that very closely. And
again, we went through – I think James did an excellent job of going through the nature of the unfunded exposure that
we have. And so you can see that as we work our way down through that unfunded exposure, there's actually a very
small portion of our unfunded exposure that we really believe to be truly at risk with a big R. And we work with the
companies very, very closely to make sure we got the right covenants. We watch their performance. So it's something
that we monitor quite, quite closely. Can we prevent it 100%? No.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - James von Moltke>: No. But we haven't seen that type of behavior as yet.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. Thank you for that. Just an information point, Pemex exposure and PDVSA, where are
they captured, in GCB or ICG? Could you give me a little guidance around that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, we don't go into individual names, but to the extent that we've got exposure there,
Pemex would be part of our Latin America exposure. So if you take a look at slide whatever it was, slide nine...
<A - James von Moltke>: Seven and nine, yeah.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's, it would be – well, you asked that is it CCB or is it ICG? Anything to do with,
virtually almost anything to do with Pemex would be in the ICG.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. And PDVSA?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's a Venezuela name. If we had any exposure to PDVSA then it would be part of Latin
America.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right. And you've written that down as well as everything else in Venezuela, I'm assuming.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, no, no. What we wrote off in Venezuela, I just want to be very clear about this...
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Venezuela, we took a write off of $180 million against our capital that we have in
Venezuela strictly because of the change in exchange rates.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So that was exchange rate driven. That was not a credit related or anything else. However,
what that results in is the fact that we now have $4 million worth of capital left in Venezuela expressed in dollar terms.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. That makes sense. On living wills, could you share with us anything that was cited as
reasons, more exemplary type of parts of the plan that the regulators focused in on and said this is what they're really

looking for with the plan overall?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think that the letter that was published by the Fed and the FDIC pretty much captures their
view as to where they saw shortcomings, and where they saw that we had made improvements over prior submissions.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right. And I have brought this up in the past on this call about your relationship with the
regulators. Can we look at this as getting right-footed in the relationship there, and that this should translate more
broadly across regulatory spectrums as well going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think that we've had a very good relationship and very good and fruitful dialogue with our
regulatory brethren, and both the Fed, the FDIC, the OCC, everyone. I don't want to leave out any names, so
everybody. So, no names were meant to be left out. And I think that when it comes to things like the living will, like
CCAR, like DFAST, all the agencies have been very open to and very willing to extend time to engage us in dialogue
where we had questions, where we sought clarification. And I've been very happy with the relationship that we have.
And I think that, again, it's up to us is to demonstrate that we are making progress. And I think that we can state that.
We have made significant progress.

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Rob Hashdeck (53:41) with U.S. Bancorp Asset Management. Please
go ahead.
<Q>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's [ph] Hyduke (53:45) by the way. But anyway, in terms of your
commercial energy exposure, what's the distinction between that and what's included in the ICG?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's just basically size, size of company. So in other words, as we take a look at from a
commercial company type of exposure, the larger companies will be banked within the ICG. Our ICG strategy is really
to serve, well for the most part, large multinational companies and their subsidiaries based around the world. So that
seems to be much...
<Q>: So where would you draw the line for the commercial versus the ICG type loans or exposures?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It has to do with more of a revenue base and the type of relationships. So there's a general
line, but I don't want to call it an absolute line of demarcation. But what you would anticipate to be the smaller
companies, those would be more in the CCB business in that commercial business. And then the larger companies
would be who gets banked by the ICG.
<Q>: Okay. And is there a difference in maybe the underwriting process for the two different exposures? Or are they...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's the same rigor, different credit teams obviously. I mean, we've got credit teams that are
focused on the ICG, and then we've got a credit team focused on CCB. CCB would be perhaps just a bit more hands-on
from time to time because again you're dealing with smaller level, smaller types of companies.
<Q>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But same intense process.
<Q>: All right. And what about the redetermination process?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's standard.

<Q>: Okay. So just I'm looking at your total exposure is about $2 billion, roughly. Do you have any guidance on once
you're through this process, how much of that you might take down? I thought you mentioned something earlier in the
call, but I didn't catch it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, what we said was that, again, our rough estimate would be that when we get finished
with the spring redeterminations, that across both ICG and consumer, the RBL exposure could come down by say $500
million. And if I was looking to split it, it would be, you know, $350 million, $150 million – $350 million in the ICG,
$150 million in consumer, something like that.

<Q - Michael Rogers>: I just wanted to talk – how are you?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Good.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Good. I just wanted to ask you a little bit, the rating agencies have certainly been active with
respect to your ratings in the last few years, and we're in a fairly quiet period right now. Could you talk a little bit about
where you may see them focusing of late, and either sources of concern or sources of items that could benefit your
ratings in the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - James von Moltke>: I don't want to comment on specific potential dialogue or future actions with the agencies. I
will say they – and similar to my answer about my own focus since I've taken the job, the agencies have been quite
focused on the impact of regulations on the bank balance sheet. So looking at TLAC, looking at the evolution of,
among other things, living wills or resolution planning that has been a focus for them. Other than that, I would say it's
more of a BAU focus and dialogue.
<Q - Michael Rogers>: Okay. In your seats, what are your chief worries right now as you look out 12 to 18 months?
<A - James von Moltke>: I think the next 12 to 18 months we'll be looking to see some level of growth coming back
into the economy or if there isn't then what does that future hold. I think we're all focused on that right now more than
anything else. We'd like to see the economies improve and regain some sense of that sense of growth. Maybe it will

discussion about the international credit card business. And I was wondering if you could give some growth
parameters, where do you think you can move that operation?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, when you take a look at our international cards business, it's hard to paint it with one
large brush. You really need to take a look at it a little bit on a country by country basis. So we gave some broad
commentary certainly around the Asia cards business when we did the call last week. And that commentary is that
we've been going through a period of working our way through some regulatory headwinds. Headwinds meaning that
just as the U.S. adopted things like the CARD Act, almost every country in Asia over the last year, two years or so, has
introduced some level of debt caps and income restrictions. So we're working our way through that. We believe that
that regulatory pressure now is beginning to abate. And we do believe that our Asia cards book now should be able to
exhibit revenue growth sometime in the second half of 2016.
When you take a look we've been able to grow accounts there, so we think it's got good growth prospects or aspects. It's
a matter of working our way through those regulatory implications and we think we're on our way to do that. And in
similar fashion with Mexico, we're in the process now of looking at what we want to do with the Mexico cards
business. One of the things with Mexico cards is we do very little acquisition of new cards through digital channels. We
basically are almost solely reliant on our branch structure in order to attract new card accounts, to gain new card
accounts. That has worked in the past but we think that there's actually, some good growth to be had if we can replicate
some of the success now that we've had in the U.S. with expanding into digital channels.
As of now, we get just a little over half of our new accounts in the U.S. – new card accounts through digital channels,
and we're in the low single digits in Mexico right now. So we're making the investments to be able to, again, take
advantage of digital channel acquisition in Mexico, and that should have some impact on the growth prospects in
Mexico, but it's likely going to be a 2017 impact as opposed to something that you'll see this year.
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Great. Just one last question: The Asian credit card business, I totally understand there's been
regulatory hurdles. Did that restrict your ability to market? And why would revenue speed up?
<A - James von Moltke>: No, it hasn't restricted our ability to market. But what it has done, it's meant that various
consumers would have found out that they were at the limit, so we haven't seen growth out of some segments of the
portfolio. And so even though you're growing other segments to the extent that you've got a larger amount of your
client base that perhaps are now facing credit restrictions, it's just taken a while for consumers to adapt to the new rules.
<Q - Kevin Maloney>: Understand. Thanks a lot.
<A - James von Moltke>: Not a problem. Our pleasure.
