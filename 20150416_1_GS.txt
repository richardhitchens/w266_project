Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the first quarter results, and I'm happy to
answer any questions.
Net revenues were $10.6 billion; net earnings $2.8 billion; earnings per diluted share were $5.94; and our annualized
return on common equity was 14.7%. The first quarter was dominated by one primary theme, Central Bank policies. In
the United States, the market heavily debated whether 2015 would be the year that the Federal Reserve raises rates. On
the other hand, the European Central Bank announced the creation of a €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program that
kicked off in March.
The prospect of two of the world's largest economies implementing divergent monetary policies had a significant
impact. Market participants reassessed the implications for both global economic growth and, as a consequence, the
performance of various financial assets. Regarding the economic outlook, on the one hand, low rates are viewed as
providing an important economic stimulus to the United States. On the other hand, a return to normalized rates would
be consistent with a strong underlying economy.
Looking at the bigger picture, the degree of conviction around a slow but stable U.S. recovery continued to gain
support for most of the quarter. The weaker recent jobs report in the U.S. has sparked some debate around the timing
and magnitude of potential rate hikes. However, the long-term expectation of slow but steady growth and higher rates
remains intact.
Across the Atlantic, the announcement of quantitative easing in Europe provided some stability and the basis for
greater economic growth in the region. The launch of a €60 billion per month purchasing program provided greater
confidence to market participants on the Eurozone outlook. The impact was immediately felt across European financial
markets. If you take the European government bond market, for example, more than one-quarter of the bonds are
trading with negative yields today. The equity markets in Europe rallied as demonstrated by the 18% increase in the
EURO STOXX 50 Index during the quarter. And the euro reached its lowest level versus the dollar in 12 years. As a
result, there was greater activity as clients responded to heightened market volatility.
Given the scope, complexity, and significance of these two different monetary policies, it isn't surprising that there
continues to be a robust discussion around the potential impacts. For our firm, the focus continues to be on our clients
and serving their needs. Our clients are placing a greater premium on both intellectual and financial capital, given
market dynamics and an evolving competitive landscape. We are committed to providing our clients with superior
advice, investment performance, content, market liquidity and certainty of execution. We believe that our extensive
capabilities favorably position us to meet a variety of client needs in what is certainly a dynamic market environment.
Now I'll discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter revenues of $1.9 billion, up 32%
from the fourth quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but it's still up
significantly relative to a year ago. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, advisory
revenues were $961 million, the highest since 2007. The 39% increase relative to the fourth quarter reflects both the
increase in completed M&A and the strength of our leading global franchise.
In the quarter, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of
significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Allergan's $71 billion sale to Actavis. RWE's €5.1
billion sale of RW Dea to LetterOne Group, and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company's $5.7 billion acquisition of

Protective Life Corporation.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter. These include
MeadWestvaco's merger with Rock-Tenn for a combined enterprise value of $20 billion, Charter Communications
$10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks and Dow Chemical's $5 billion separation of its Chlor-Alkali and
Downstream businesses to Olin Corporation.
Moving to underwriting, revenues were $944 million in the first quarter, up 26% sequentially as equity issuance
improved. During the quarter, we ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings. Equity
underwriting revenues of $533 million rose 56% compared to the fourth quarter largely due to an increase in secondary
offerings, yet underwriting revenues were essentially unchanged at $411 million.
During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, leading Santander's €7.5 billion follow-on
equity offering, Chevron's AUD 4.7 billion sale of its stake in Caltex Australia and Berkshire Hathaway's €3 billion
investment-grade issuance.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were
$5.5 billion in the first quarter, up significantly compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues
were $3.1 billion in the first quarter and included $32 million of DVA losses. Net revenues were up more than
two-and-a-half times sequentially as client activity increased in a number of our businesses in response to higher
volatility and improved market conditions.
Interest rates and currencies were both significantly higher sequentially as client activity improved amid diverging
Central Bank policies. Credit increased significantly from a more challenging fourth quarter as credit spreads generally
tightened during the first quarter. Mortgages also rose versus the fourth quarter; although, volatility and client activity
remained generally low. Given continued trends in the energy markets, commodities improved sequentially with higher
levels of client activity.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services, net revenues for the
first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 20% sequentially and included $12 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution
net revenues increased 50% sequentially to $1.1 billion due to a favorable market making backdrop with higher levels
of client activity, particularly in derivatives. Commissions and fees were $808 million, down 3% relative to the fourth
quarter. Securities services generated net revenues of $393 million, up 12% sequentially, reflecting higher customer
balances.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $81 million, up from $63 million in the fourth quarter. The
move up was primarily due to increased market volatility across all categories.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in
the first quarter. Following the sale of our investment in Metro International in the fourth quarter, we made a decision
that the remaining revenue related to consolidated investments from the other line was not significant in the context of
the I&L segment. As a result, we're now reporting the other I&L revenues within the equity and debt lines.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and
company-specific events in private equity as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and
loans were $509 million, with roughly $200 million in net interest income and the balance coming from net gains.
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, essentially unchanged versus the
fourth quarter. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision
remained flat at $1.18 trillion. $7 billion of long-term net inflows, driven by fixed income and equity products, and net
market appreciation of $6 billion were offset by net outflows of $14 billion in liquidity products.
Moving to performance, across the global platform, 82% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the
top two quartiles on a three-year basis and 73% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.

Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards and other items, such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%.
This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first
quarter of 2014. Our lower accrual rate reflects our strong 14% year-over-year net revenue growth and the positive
operating leverage embedded in our firm.
First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the fourth quarter and slightly lower than
the first quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on
consolidated investment entities.
Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,400, up 1%
from year-end 2014. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.7%. That is down from the 2014 rate, primarily
due to changes in geographic earnings mix.
Our global core liquid assets ended at $175 billion. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.4% using the Standardized
approach; it was 12.6% under the Advanced approach. Starting this quarter, the lower of these two ratios is our binding
regulatory constraints. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.3%, 30 basis points above the minimum
requirement that begins in 2018. And finally, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion in
the first quarter. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2014 capital plan.
As previously announced, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our revised 2015 capital plan, which includes
share repurchases, dividends and other capital actions. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced an increase in
our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share beginning in the second quarter. As it relates to our share repurchase capacity,
one point I want to highlight is that any potential share repurchases over the next five quarters will be heavily back-end
weighted.
As you all know, we do not publicly disclose the approved size of our repurchase capacity. Again, we take this
approach for a very specific and practical reason. We don't want our shareholders to view the approved buyback
amount as a commitment to return that capital. For us, capital allocation is a dynamic process. If we see opportunities
to deploy the capital attractively to support client activity, we want the flexibility to do it. And conversely, if our clients
are less active, we will certainly look to return it. Our track record on this front is well-established.
Now, before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. The first quarter has served as a strong start to
2015. The year-over-year increase in net revenues reflects not only the strength of our franchise, but also our ability to
provide high-quality advice and certainty of execution for our clients.
Our performance this quarter, while just a quarter, reflects numerous efforts over the last several years to adjust our
business. We sold several businesses due to regulatory capital implications. We transformed our financial profile,
significantly improving our risk-based capital. We revamped our capital allocation processes, improving our
decision-making and efficiency. We took a hard look at our operating costs, fundamentally changing our expense
structure by eliminating costs, reallocating resources and leveraging technology. We made all these changes while at
the same time continuing to invest in our global client franchise.
We know that our success in many ways begins and ends with our clients. It's the trust they place in us and our ability
to execute on their behalf that drives our franchise, and we believe that our steady commitment, particularly through
these more difficult years, has been critical to creating stronger client relationships.
And there is one important thing that we didn't change; our focus on creating shareholder value. Our efforts are
ultimately a reflection of our commitment to you, our owners. We understand that to create shareholder value, we need
to have strong financial footings, be an efficient allocator of capital and have a world-class client franchise. Ultimately,
our efforts over the past several years have meant that a 14% increase in year-over-year revenues can contribute to a
40% increase in net earnings, a 48% increase in earnings per share, a 380-basis point improvement in ROE, and finally,
9% growth in book value per share over the past year.
Thank you again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Good morning. Let's start with – Investing & Lending was pretty darn good. I'm curious on
the equity side how much of it was actually realized in asset sales because it's a pretty active quarter. And then maybe
related to that, if you could give the portfolio breakdown in terms of equity, debt and lending assets.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So let's just start with the balance sheet. You know that the balance sheet at the end of the
quarter for the fourth quarter was $79.5 billion, and in terms of debt, that's basically – north of $50 billion of that is in
the debt line. So that's the bulk of the balance sheet. In terms of equity, as you know we had $4 billion of public equity
and $18 billion of private equity.
Now in terms of the performance in the equity line, in terms of the quarter, we don't think of it as much as asset sales,
because when we make asset sales often there is a period we're restricted. That's why we're careful to give you the
public equity numbers. But basically, when you break it down, give or take 40% of the performance came from those
assets that are already public, 40% came from basically company improvements, and the balance would come from
things like pending IPOs and things like that. That's how I'd break it down for you.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: And what's the disallowed portion or what's the best way to ask how much Goldman still
has in the funds that you would need to eventually liquidate?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think – I'm going to rephrase your question and make sure I understand it. I think
you were saying that in terms of under regulatory guidelines, under the local compliance, that number is approximately
$8 billion, and so a bit of a high-class problem, as we've been harvesting, that number's obviously been going up
because there's been good performance.
Now remember of course, one of the reasons we were focusing on that with you over the last couple of years is because
the original deadline on that was July of this year. Of course the regulators have granted an industry-wide extension on
that to 2017. So we continue to focus on it.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Great. Last one is on FICC. I mean, the macro products are great, but credit and mortgage
wasn't, so not exactly hitting on all cylinders as a whole, but it certainly seems like maybe some of the reduced capacity
in the industry is helping you, and so your long-term strategy that we all beat you up for, for the last five years might be
working. Could you talk towards what you're seeing in terms of capacity? And now that you've seen a pickup in
volatility, what it means?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So on FICC, I think you're right to say that one of the things that we have benefited from
certainly is the diversity of the businesses. That's not just FICC, it's across equities as well because, as you said, even in
a quarter like this where you're seeing improved FICC performance sequentially and year-over-year, you're really
seeing it in the macro side of the business and, as you said, not all cylinders are firing.
Look, in terms of us through this part of the cycle, while you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time
focused on the clients and staying very, very committed to the businesses and we're seeing it translate through. I don't
have perfect visibility into our competitors obviously, but you've seen the announcements. Some things more stark, like
commodities, but certainly we're hearing it from clients and now we're starting to see a bit of it, I would say,
geographically, certainly in Europe. I know you asked about FICC. Maybe take the equity business for example, we've
seen a trend in derivatives, and then certainly in a quarter like this, it was pretty significant.

<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks so much.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Christian.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: So to start on maybe CCAR, the firm has proven very adaptable in managing the regulatory
environment. As you think about, obviously, your CCAR results, I'm just curious as to what levers you have yet to
improve your relative positioning?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry, I didn't hear the very beginning of your question. I apologize, Christian, could you
just repeat it?
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Yeah, so my question basically is just on your new CCAR ratios. I'm just curious what levers
you have to improve your positioning?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. Okay. I understand. So as you know, we get very little transparency by design in
terms of how the regulators have constructed CCAR going into the test. One thing, of course, is we get transparency on
our results coming out of the test. And so last year you saw us digest that information among other regulatory
constraints and we took very immediate action around the balance sheet and as you saw on the second quarter, reduced
the balance sheet by $50 billion.
Every year's test, you learn a little bit more in terms of the results. This year's test, in terms of the constraints, again this
is all public, had to deal with total capital and so we're again digesting the results and we'll look at that in terms of how
we think about deploying our balance sheet, our capacity and our capital structure. And again, we'll go through a
process. I'm not saying the process will yield the same results in terms of last year's balance sheet actions, but we're
going through that same diagnostic process now with our teams in the businesses.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. And have you mentioned – your clients are placing a greater premium on kind of
financial capital and certainty of execution. Curious to how this has been expressed? Are you seeing wider bid-ask
spreads in the market? Are they giving you more of their business? Or something else?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as I mentioned, we're seeing it in certain parts. I guess one of the areas I'd point to is if
you just look at the capital we committed to block transactions during the course of the quarter, obviously there were
some significant capital commitments we made to clients during the course of the quarter, the largest block transactions
that were done, and so we felt very well positioned to connect those sellers or issuers of equity with buyers on the other
side.
I'd say more broadly, the process of repricing has been may be slower than folks would have expected, we're certainly
seeing in parts of the business. And when you start to see it is when the market picks up. So again, I highlight the
derivatives activity which was a solid driver in our equities client execution line this quarter, but we've also talked
about it in commodities, for example. So in the com markets you don't see it as much, but when activity picks up you
start to see it.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Any more color you can give us in terms of the strength within equity derivatives
from a regional point of view? Should we assume that it was in Europe from QE and some of the movement in prices
there? Just trying to piece that line item together a little bit more.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so within equities, you know the performance was really broad-based in what we
saw this quarter. We talked for a long time with you about, to really be a significant player in this, you need to have
scale and you need to, for example, be in all the business lines, whether it's prime brokerage, derivatives, ability to
commit capital, which I just spoke about. You need to have strong electronic capabilities, and you need to be
geographically diverse.
And this was a quarter where we really saw a strong contribution across the entire business, and I highlight derivatives
in Europe because it was a driver, and we hadn't seen it recently, but that's really the sum of it. But it was really
broad-based. And it really leaned into the strength of our business. Again, also, of course, we had a weaker Q1 last
year, but it was a solid performance.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, in terms of the comp to revenue ratio coming
down. I mean I feel like symbolically it's important that the ratio came down the first quarter, which it hasn't for several
years. Just how are you thinking about what the target is in terms of operating leverage? You said a focus on generating
operating leverage, but I think it was more than two times the one. So you had a lot of margin there to, say, play with.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the 42% at this stage is our best estimate. We did reduce the compensation expense
last year from 44% to 43%, and then this is 42%. And again, we've always talked about the fact that the compensation
is going to be driven by performance, and this year with the 14% year-over-year increase in revenues, that's our best
estimate.
Now in terms of the operating leverage, this has been years of hard work in terms of managing expenses, really
thinking about how to most efficiently use the resources. And so when you have that in place and you get the revenue
uptick, obviously, you can more easily translate that into the bottom-line, and that's what you're seeing this quarter.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, Harvey. Hi. Just a follow up on the equity strength. It sounds like you mentioned
the derivatives, you mentioned blocks. I just wanted to make sure on the block side, was there anything that was way
outside when you look at whether it's maybe quarter-over-quarter because year-over-year, you had a weak comp.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. As I said, prime brokerage balances were up. There were a number of drivers,
volume and activity, but it's really client driven. So there were indexed rebalance transactions that we do this quarter,
we're able to facilitate large volumes for clients, it came together nicely.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then I think it was the last quarter, but you guys gave some of the repositioning
that has taken place over the past couple of the years, in the revenues that were lost. And then you guys have also
mentioned a lot of the investment that you're making on the technology side to position for a lot of these two roles.

When you think about what is expected of the industry at this point going forward, do you feel like most of that's in
place?
And I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you're already positioned for that, then from the client or the market share
standpoint, maybe that's one of the things that's driving it, as a lot of other firms are still trying to figure things out. I
just wanted to get a sense of where you guys think you are given all these conflicting regulations and how well you can
manage them at this point given what you know?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So let me start with technology, because obviously technology has been a critical driver
and part of our operating infrastructure as a firm for as long as you've been covering us and well before. And that
investment is not something, obviously, you can do in a short period of time. So this reflects decades of investment in
technology platform, as you know. We have talked about this in the past, Mike. We have one risk management
platform, SecDB, which certainly gives us some efficiencies in scale, because as we adapt, if we need to build things
for our equity business or if we need to build things in different parts of the world, it's obviously – goes without saying
that you can be more efficient as you replicate those things.
So it's that constant re-investing in the business that gives us that flexibility, but that's not new. The regulatory
component, obviously, as we get into the finalization of rules and the implementation of rules, that will continue to be
an ongoing process. When we think about technology away from the narrow subset of regulatory compliance, which
has played, obviously, an immensely critical role, the other way we think about it is really how do we deliver to clients?
And that, again, we continue to invest in; and then, other than being efficient, are there ways we can grow revenues
through technology? And so, we're constantly monitoring that.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I'm just going to ask a real basic question. Now how sustainable were your results in each of
the four business lines? You already said the Investment Banking backlog is a little bit less than at year-end. So as you
look at it compared to the prior quarter, should we expect this higher level of performance or is this just the usual first
quarter bump and then we're going back down to a lower level?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So let's just take Investment Banking, Mike. So you'll remember at the end of last year
we talked about the fact that we had $1 trillion in announced transactions, and there was a $200 billion gap between us
and the next closest competitor. And so, in the first quarter, obviously, you would expect to see certain of those
transactions coming through. I would point out that the backlog's up significantly from last year. And so, in terms of the
backlog in the quarter, it was down a little bit in Investment Banking, and then it was up across equity underwriting and
it was up across debt underwriting.
We [ph] think (31:05) less about the backlog in the way that you described it, but, for example, if you ask the question
slightly different and you said, listen, the trend in banking, does it feel like it's still in place? The short answer to that is,
yes. When we talk to CEOs and boards, CEO and board confidence continues to be high; and you've even seen in the
last couple of weeks in announced transactions, there is a fair bit of activity out there. And we feel very well placed for
it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And on the trading side?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So on the trading side, I'd say the same thing in terms of trends. This discussion around
diverging monetary policies, which is a catalyst, that trend feels like it's in place in the client dialog, and in terms of our
communication we're very focused. But in terms of you extrapolating that, in terms of the quarter, it's very early in the
quarter. And so, all these things, as you know, are going to be driven by the environment and, ultimately, how our

clients respond to that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. And then, one follow-up question, the PSUs are new, with an 11% hurdle for ROE,
and this quarter you had a 14.7% ROE. So is that PSU hurdle high enough? How did you come to that? Do you
consider that kind of a target for the firm?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I'm glad you asked that question, because we've had this discussion around target. And as
we said before, a call wouldn't be complete unless we talked about something about a target with you, Mike. So it's
really important. The PSUs, as you mentioned, which I'm sure you saw in the proxy, that is not a target for the firm.
And that's an important distinction for everyone to understand. The reason we don't have a published ROE target is
because it's just not how we manage the firm.
If you recall all the time we spent in the fourth quarter talking about our ROAE framework in terms of how we think
about capital management, that's a much better way to understand how the firm thinks about most efficiently deploying
its capital. So in terms of the PSUs, as per the proxy, our board engaged with shareholders actively, as they always do,
and they took that feedback in, along with other constituents, and they felt like adding those metrics to certain
executives in the firm made sense from a shareholder perspective.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: The other thing, Mike, I'd say on ROE target, it's interesting, if we had had an ROE target
out there, and again, because you and I have gone through this so many times, if we had had a target out there, we had
an 11.2% return last year. If we had a target out there of 13% and we had our 14.7%, I don't know how you would
digest that. We really view 14.7%, it's a good, solid performance for the quarter. It's close – we're really in mid-teens
territory now. But our aspirations to deliver for our shareholders are higher. And so, again, that's why we don't have a
specific target. We really think about how to drive value over the long run.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hey. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Betsy. Hey.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hey. Good morning. Hey, a couple questions. One is just on the fundamental review of the
trading book that Basel is currently engaged in, and wanted to get your thoughts on how you see that going and if it
goes into places it's currently outlined, how you deal with that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we've obviously been actively involved with the regulators, as has the industry
broadly, on the trading book review. I think it's too early to extrapolate anything from the QIS in terms of any final
rule. Our discussion and what we think is important, it's really about calibration in terms of how folks want to actually
think about the next round of a rule set. But as you've seen us do in the past, whenever we get a final rule, we'll work
within that rule set. I think that as we think about these rules that impacts businesses we require to have inventory,
again, we got to think about calibration, because we need to think about market liquidity and the industry's ability to
provide that. So that's been the discussion for us.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Right. Just because it feels like the hedging is a little bit clunky, not really treating risk as you
would want to manage it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I would say let's give regulators time on this. I don't want to prejudge anything.
There's still a lot of work to do.

<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. And then just separately, maybe you could speak a little bit to how you're thinking about
the commodities business. We have had some recent headlines from some of regulators on that, and I know that you are
very committed to a client oriented business, but could you just identify how much of what your commodities business
generates today is client-facing?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the driver – I mean, our commodity business is all about the clients. As you know,
we've sold certain assets, and that's really the driver, and when we talk about commodities within our fixed income
business, that's what it is. I think, look, it's an interesting time to be having this discussion around commodities and
regulation, because as we've seen really since the first quarter of last year when we started to see volatile natural gas
markets then followed by this huge decline in the energy markets over the last six-plus months, I think it really
reinforces the need for firms like Goldman Sachs to be in a position to provide our clients with liquidity, with financing
capacity, and so for us, as you know, we've been in the commodity business forever. We know how valuable it is to our
clients. We're hugely committed to it.
In terms of regulation, we'll see how the regulation evolves and again, we'll stay in an active dialogue with the
regulators, but I think at this stage, everybody sees how critical it is and how important it is to clients. Yeah, that's what
I would say.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Question for you, first of all, on the buyback comment you made and the idea of back-end
loading. And I was wondering, in the context of the last couple of years where it's tended to be more consistent, what
prompted the rethink? Is it something to do with CCAR, reinvestment opportunities that you're seeing? Just a little
color on that would be helpful.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so as you know, year-to-year, the CCAR test changes. Obviously, I can't speak to
anything that's supervisory level detail, but there were aspects, nuances of this year's test that to the extent to which we
use our capacity that we would use our capacity later in the year.
Now this is public, of course. The Federal Reserve gives you capacity on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so I was just
letting you know that due to nuances of this year's test, largely driven by the fact that we're a mark-to-market firm and
we mark-to-market our balance sheet, that to the extent which we use it, it'll be more back-end weighted.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. So it has more to do with that than the idea that with the business levels picking up,
you're seeing more opportunities to deploy capital in the business?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I was specifically speaking in a CCAR context with respect to capacity. Of course, as
you know, when you look at our long history as a firm, for the vast majority of our history, we've reinvested capital into
the business, and so to the extent to which we continue to see growth in client demand, obviously that's our preference.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Let me ask you a litigation question. You set aside $190 million in the quarter. Can
you give us a sense for how much of that is a reserve build versus just incurred costs?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we don't break it down specifically at that level. But I will tell you, it's the same
process. We continue to evaluate any outstanding litigation in the course of the quarter, and we accrue accordingly.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And how should we think about the fact that in the most recent quarter, one of your major
competitors said that they were in negotiations with the Department of Justice on private label mortgage
securitizations? And really at this point, if we assume that they do what they are in negotiation to do, the only major
U.S. dealer that won't have done one of those settlements is Goldman. Should we be thinking that there is probably
going to be something coming down the line in the next few quarters? Are you in negotiations?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, to the extent to which on any specific cases, we're not going to comment. I'm
sure you understand that. I would really encourage you to look at the most recent 10-K and our Q disclosure where
we're very explicit about all these matters.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. And then the final question I had for you is just on the tax rate. You
talked about geography and obviously we've seen tax rates similar to that that you had this quarter in the past. Would it
be appropriate for us to sort of factor that in together with the norm – for the first quarter together with the normal kind
of low-30%s and be thinking in terms of something along the lines of 30% for the full year? Or would you expect this
tax rate to continue?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a good question. So just for everyone who may have not had a chance to get
through or heard the beginning of the call. Effective tax rate for last year was 31.4% and for the quarter it was 27.7%.
And as you pointed out, Guy, that was mostly driven by geographic earnings mix.
What I would say is, all factors being equal in terms of the full-year rate, and the way you should think about it given
that we're starting from such a low level, I think it's reasonable to assume that we come in below last year's rate. But
we'll see how the year evolves.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Just maybe circling back to FICC. FX and rates were very strong, but you obviously
highlighted as did everybody else, credit and mortgages being weak year-over-year. But we had an environment where
I mean I guess if you look at sort of trace volumes being up, credit spreads were pretty stable. What's really I guess
hurting that business? Is it just simply there wasn't enough volatility or just absolute low rates are hurting spreads? Or
is it, clearly inventory levels are down, or is it a combination of all those things. Just trying to think what is a better
environment? Do we just need to see higher rates?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I think this last quarter was really a case of investors evaluating, clients really
evaluating where they stood with respect to their portfolios. There was obviously less refinancing activity during this
quarter versus a year ago. But I would say the key driver is the debate over rates and how people are thinking about
their portfolios. I think we saw a path towards normalized rates. Overtime, I think you could see a pickup.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. So we just kind of need to wait to see. Rates get a more conviction around rates and
predictability. Okay. And just maybe a bigger picture question on the banking cycle and M&A. Clearly, we've seen a
nice pick up and continued in the first quarter. Where do you, in terms of, conversations with clients, do you still think
there is a lot of juice left. Then I think if you look at past cycle, this would imply we still have quite a bit of room to go.
Just want to hear your thoughts on it if you...

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So you're right. In terms if you want to use the benchmark past cycles, certainly there is
room for increased M&A activity. In terms of our discussions with CEOs and Boards, I would say that the momentum
feels still quite good. There is large transactions within the industry tend to be a catalyst for other transactions.
Strategies are very well positioned in terms of driving synergies, the financing markets remain attractive. Again, so
there is room here, and our recent dialogue is quite good. And as you point out, there is room versus sort of historical
benchmarks.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Hi. I just wanted to – good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the equity client
execution, because the result is so discontinuous with – it's roughly double the last, say, eight quarter moving average. I
mean, can you say was it just a unique opportunity set? Was it a couple of big transactions? Was it related to the block
transactions that you were talking about earlier? Or is this more like the new normal?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We'll see how the subsequent quarter goes. I would say that, look, if you looked at last
year's first quarter, it was definitely a more challenging market-making environment. Again, this is really just one
where geographically, from a derivatives perspective, the ability to commit capital. Things just really lined up quite
nicely for our franchise, and again, it was broad-based. So the environment was good everywhere. Doesn't mean it can't
get better and it doesn't mean it can't decline, but it was good everywhere this quarter.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then on a kind of global macro view, back in 2011, I guess, the prospect of a
Greek default set the Eurozone in crisis and we seem closer to it than ever. Is it now, in your view, a non-event, if and
when it happens, that everyone has had enough time and preparation to get ready for it?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a complicated question. I would say, first of all, Greece has been in view for a
long time for folks, so people have had an opportunity to digest it. I think that on the plus side, the environment in
Europe versus 2011 is dramatically different in terms of, if you think about the discussion around other peripheral
countries relative to 2011, and so I think those are all things for the plus side. We're obviously monitoring it very
carefully. I would say on the concerning side, look, it's an experiment that hasn't been run and so we'll have to see what
it has for markets. But it's certainly, if you compare this to 2011, you'd have to assume that the risk is much more
contained given people have had years to focus on this.

through that has during the course of the quarter, but clearly it's been in focus for our clients now, and so we'll see how
much stamina it has. But obviously the commitment to QE is substantial.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Sure. And then – sorry about bringing it back to equities here, but one more. Can
you speak to what sort of impact Asia had on the quarter, particularly given some of the market structure changes we
saw in the region?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So certainly it was a contributor. If I ranked it for you, it was, Europe was a more
significant contributor, but the trend in Asia has been much better, obviously. And as those markets continue to
liberalize, I think the dynamic nature of capital flows will continue to increase. Of course it was helpful in Asia, but
again, this was broad-based across our equity business. Longer-term, we're pretty optimistic about the opportunities
there.

Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hey. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So I just had a question on CCAR and your preferred issuance plans. With total capital
under CCAR specifically now the binding constraint for the firm, even though you're already operating at that
150-basis point preferred target, is it fair to expect that you'll look to close the gap or improve your CCAR position by
issuing more preferreds or more qualifying debt?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So you may have seen or you may not have seen, Steven, but we're actually – we
announced this morning we're out in the market with the preferreds, so that transaction is out in the market now and
we'll be closing later this afternoon.
In terms of how we think about this, this is a great question because, as I said before, a lot of this is about how you
digest the CCAR results and how you think about, again, things like, how you price the balance sheet, how you deploy
your capital and the optimal capital structure. And so you should assume we're going to look at everything in terms of
how we position the firm going forward as it relates to the capital structure, make sure we do – we construct it in a way
that's most efficient for our clients and most efficient for our shareholders.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks. That's really helpful, Harvey. And actually in that same vein, since you mentioned
about capital allocations under CCAR, it might be helpful if you could clarify regarding how you allocate the capital
under your attributable equity framework? Under a CCAR lens, do you use your stressed end of period or your
minimum ratio for determining the level of required capital for assessing the adequacy of the ROEs for various trades?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So some of this obviously we consider proprietary in terms of how we think about
the dynamic nature of capital management. But for the folks who haven't studied, and obviously Steven's a very
thoughtful consumer of the information, in terms of our return on attributed equity framework, what we have discussed
with the marketplace is basically all those factors that contribute to regulatory capital constraints. Basel III Advanced,
Standardized, supplementary leverage ratio, elements of CCAR, we attach weightings to those given their significance,
and we basically have constructed an algorithm that helps guide us, both in executing certain transactions and,
obviously, how we evaluate businesses over the long run. But we haven't discussed the specifics of how we incorporate
those variables.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Just a question for you in terms of what's going on in the capital markets with your businesses,
specifically on the energy side of things. We've heard from a number of more commercially-oriented banks so far this
earnings season about what's going on with their borrowing and capital markets activity within that sector, specifically.
I'm curious, given what's happened in the last two quarters to three quarters in the oil markets, have you seen a
meaningful increase in those companies coming to market, or has that been much more status quo?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I can't comment specifically in terms of the [ph] relative activity levels (51:27). What
I will say is, obviously, given our role in commodities and our role with the energy companies and industrial companies
broadly, the activity level for the past couple of quarters has been extremely high. Often, what you'll see is, given sort
of this really very steep decline in the oil price, is those things won't translate immediately, but over time, obviously,
the industry adjusts that. And then, you begin to see things like merger transactions and capital actions. And so, the
activity level – the dialogue is quite high, but I can't point you to any specific transactions that I would highlight.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then, just switching to Investment Management, you mentioned that there was an
outflow on liquidity products that seemed a little bit larger than what we've seen from a couple of other peers. I guess
I'm curious if you can just give us a little more color on that and does what's happened over the last couple of quarters
with the flows presume a somewhat higher normalized pre-tax margin in that business relative to the high-teens that
you typically put up?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of the flow, as everybody said, there was $13 billion of combined net inflows
and market appreciation, offset by $14 billion in liquidity outflows. Those flows can move around as clients reallocate
assets and move back and forth. I think if you look at the historical movement around those predominantly mutual fund
assets, you'll see flows like this historically. So I wouldn't point to it as any meaningful indicator.
In terms of the margin in the business, obviously, this business remains strategically a very high priority for us. We've
been investing in it for years and we continue to see progress, and over time we expect that you'll see margin
expansion.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just finally from me, was there any material change this quarter versus the
fourth quarter in the benefit to your Basel III ratios from the significant financial institution deduction that you said was
about $5 billion last quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, that's not the key driver in this quarter. It really is the growth in equity. It's the
numerator that's driving it this quarter.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Page 15 of 18
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. So fully phased-in is 11.8% and 10.6%. Now, again, we just got a question on the
significant financial institutions deduction, and so when you look at that, that between the transitional, I would say the
best way to think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming all other factors being equal, you should assume that
the fully phased-in versus transitional would roughly be around the midpoint of that, because we get the benefit of the
significant financial institutions deduction as we move money out of funds. In terms of RWAs on the quarter: for
Advanced, $565 billion, and Standardized, $626 billion.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. For the SLR, now that you're at 5.3% and the kind of the constraining ratio for
CCAR has moved out to total capital, do you have a sense of what the buffer is that you would run the SLR at now?
Could you get away with a 50-basis point buffer since total seems to be constraining?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We haven't finalized a buffer in terms of how we're thinking about that. And so, we'll
have to see how that evolves in terms of how we want to think about it. But, obviously, there's been significant progress

Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: One of the dominant themes from Goldman last year was the very significant reduction in
its balance sheet size, and so I'm wondering how – if we should be thinking about that differently at all at this stage
given what you're talking about with respect to client interests and demands, but relative to the capital constraints that
were highlighted under this year's CCAR, and I'm assuming were the genesis for today's preferred offering. How
should we think about all those dynamics with respect to balance sheet size?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So the balance sheet reduction we went through last year, it's a great – I'm glad
you brought it up. That was about repricing the balance sheet and all about this framework we talked about in terms of
how we deploy our marginal capital. And so, if you think, again, about last year's test, you could grow equity, you
could grow capital, but the reality is you obviously have – you want to do that in a way that delivers marginal returns.
And so, that was all about repricing. And so, as we went through that exercise last year, that was a repricing exercise.
If we – again, our preferred operating position would be to grow the capital base, grow the balance sheet accretively
and deploy that capital to clients. But obviously, we're going to be very sensitive to returns on that and how that
marginal balance sheet gets priced.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: But it sounds like from your repricing commentary, you do see that at least on the margin
occurring?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Correct. Well, we certainly have seen some in terms of pricing, and then last year we felt
the discipline of the process we went through went quite well. As we talked about, there was very little disruption to
client activity.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Devin.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Good morning. So just on the ROE outlook and the drivers, obviously, your margin is a big one,
and the pre-tax margin for all of last year was 36%. It was 37% this quarter, which I thought was impressive. So when
you just look at the businesses at more of a granular level, are there areas where you feel like you're getting to about as
good as it will be? And then where do you see the biggest areas for additional leverage to the margin?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the discussion around how we manage the businesses and where we think about
driving additional leverage, that's a continual conversation at Goldman Sachs. That's going to happen all the time
because we're always reviewing the businesses and making sure we're driving them to the optimal outcome.
Now the operating leverage you're seeing, that's firm-wide and really is the result of, again, the years of investment
we've made in technology, how we've scaled the resources, the cost-cutting program that we announced several years
ago that was raised to several billion dollars. And so you're now just starting to see all that translate through, but we're
constantly evaluating the businesses for opportunities, both to grow and to hold.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Thanks. And then just coming back to Europe one last time here, the stability that's
helping client activity, is there any way you can just help size that for us relative to the recent past? How much stronger
was it this quarter? Again, we talked about derivatives, but where else is that pick-up? And then any perspective around
how much bigger it was this quarter relative to the recent past?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I highlighted it to give you some sense of the underpinnings of the activity that's
driving it, but again, in equities, it really was broad-based client activity, geographic and across the business and within
individual product lines.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Devin.

Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yes. Hi. Just coming back to equity...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Kian.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Hi. Just coming back to equity derivatives, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit
more flavor in terms of products, if the strength's on the execution side came maybe more from the flow side or was it
more from the delta one side or structuring side or dividend swaps? Can you just talk a little bit through the products in
order for us to get a better understanding of what we should think about going forward trends in some of these areas,
because clearly some of them are bit more bulky than others, if I may.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So really, again, it's truly client activity across each of the businesses, and so I
wouldn't highlight any particular product line within the derivative businesses. Obviously, when you have a big
up-move in European equity markets like you did with QE. Obviously that's an opportunity for clients to get involved,
and there's lots of things they look at both from a plain vanilla perspective and a more structured perspective. And I
don't know, if you're trying to ask a question around things like were people more interested in derivatives that had
maybe multi-variables? Sure, but again, it was broad-based. It wasn't in any one particular driver.

<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And there's no real distinction between structuring versus flow in terms of your mix, not
much has significantly changed?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Look, I won't talk to our mix, because the firm obviously, we have the intellectual capital
on the systems and the capacity to deploy that capital for clients. And so I think we're always well positioned for those
parts of the cycles in the market. But again, broad-based in equities.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yeah. And in respect to fixed income, we've had some things giving us a bit of a steer of
how the revenues break down between macro and credit. And I was wondering could you give us a bit of a feeler as
well? Is it half-half at this point in the first quarter? Or should we think about it differently?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We don't provide a detail by macro versus credit. What I would say is that, look, we have
an investment in all of these businesses. And again, we benefited from the diversity at times, credit is going to be
particularly active and at times macro is going to be particularly active. But we don't provide disclosure in terms of that
split.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. And lastly of commodities. Clearly, commodities had an uptick in volatility, but at
the same time, you highlight volatility as a business which year-on-year was down. I'm just wondering if you could just
explain a little bit to me why commodities was relatively weak on a year-on-year basis?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So you may recall that last year, now we're going back to the first quarter 2014,
commodities had a very strong quarter. A lot of that, as we discussed at the time was due to the extraordinary volatility
in natural gas. And it drove a lot of client activity in the sector. And that was really the first time you and I started
talking about the fact that we were really seeing the absence of competitors on the field. And a huge uptick in client
dialogue. And so you're just coming off of very strong 2014 first quarter, but commodities remains a very active space
for us and our dialogue with clients is quite strong.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. That explains it. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Kian.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you. I want to ask you one thing that you highlighted in the press release was the
largest ever – largest increase in five years in tangible book value. With the increasing returns and still some constraints
on capital deployment, isn't that really a fundamental accelerator as you look forward over the next couple of years?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So look, again, the environment is going to ultimately be something that we participate
in, but I would say that again, the thing that we've focused on over the last several years, which has been making sure
that we continue to invest in our client franchise and at the same time build the operating leverage. That's why you're
seeing that. You're seeing the 14% year-over-year growth in quarterly revenues, and it's just translating to the
bottom-line with a lot of operating leverage.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then when you look at the comp ratio at 42%, which you made some improvement
with what you've done in the past, but when you look at it on the average for the year, you've recently highlighted the
38% kind of number in that, you would look for the year being closer to what you've done in the past couple of years.
When you say that you almost have $0.50, $0.60 of earnings per share that's basically pushed forward as you review
performance and your compensation plans over the rest of the year?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's our best estimate today, Mosby, and we'll – look, we'll evaluate the year as we go
through. And obviously again, as we've discussed in the past, the culture of pay performance at Goldman Sachs we'll
evaluate it continuously as we go through, and it'll be driven by performance.
