Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for listening in today. Joining me on the call is Bob Loughran. As we
announced last month, Bob is Avon's Acting Chief Financial Officer, filling in while we conduct a formal search
process to replace Kimberly Ross, who left Avon in early October.
Since this is the first chance I've had to talk with you since we announced Kimberly's departure, I'd like to provide my
perspective on the CFO transition as well as address some additional questions that you've been asking.
Let me start by saying that I'm well aware that a chief financial officer transition is potentially a sensitive issue for
many of you. As it relates to Kimberly, Kimberly worked hard and contributed to the firm, a turnaround that has taken
longer than expected. The bottom line is that she would seek an opportunity to run a new industry and be in a location
that was attractive to her.
I want to assure you that we have a comprehensive transition plan in place. Bob is leading a solid financial team, and
we do not anticipate any disruption to the business.
Looking forward, as we outlined in our September 8 press release, we are conducting a comprehensive search, with our
preference being a seasoned CFO. As you might imagine, I'm actively involved in the search. And I'm pleased with the
quality of candidates that have been identified thus far. But at this point, I don't have anything to report. We have been
advised that a typical CFO search can take six months or more, depending on any number of factors. We will be back
to you when we have something definitive to say.
Turning to our third quarter results. There are three topics I would like to cover this morning. First, I will provide my
high-level perspective on the quarter. Second, I will provide you with some additional details on our sluggish Brazilian
performance. And lastly, I will briefly update you on our recent U.S. digital launch, which I flagged for you on our last
earnings call. Bob will then take you through the details of the quarter.
Let me start with third quarter results. As you are aware, we began the year with the expectation that the second half of
2014 would show improvement relative to the first half. In my perspective, while I think our third quarter results are
consistent with modest improvement on both top and bottom line, our overall performance, particularly in terms of
revenue growth, continues to be below where I'd like to see it.
Our third quarter revenue was $2.1 billion, up 1% year-on-year in constant dollars, somewhat below our expectations.
However, our adjusted operating profit was in line with our expectations, and our adjusted operating margin was 9.3%,
up 390 basis points year-on-year, despite our revenue shortfall. Active Representatives were down 4%, an improvement
versus last quarter, but improving at a slower rate than anticipated. To sum up, while we made progress, it is slower
than I would like. And we also continue to be impacted by headwinds in some of our key markets.
From a geographic perspective, North America, while still declining in revenue, continued to make the progress in
reducing the cost base and landed where we expected. I believe North America is on track for profitability in 2015.
EMEA delivered better-than-expected revenue growth, driven by recovery in Russia. I would note, though, that EMEA
continues to be impacted by FX, negatively affecting operating margin. Latin America performance was disappointing
and below our expectations, primarily driven by a slowdown in Brazil as well as slower recovery in Mexico. And Asia,
while small, showed progress.
We also did a good job of controlling corporate costs. In the quarter, we continued to execute on previously announced
actions to improve our cost base, specifically head count reductions and reduced project spend. In addition, we continue
to aggressively review opportunities for additional cost savings.
Let me add that Avon's business leaders and I are committed to cost discipline. And we are determined that further
progress will not be sidetracked by our search for a new CFO. We continue to drive the cost take-out processes and
look for additional actions that will allow us to operate more efficiently. Lastly, there was no change to our expectation
that the second half will show improvement relative to the first half. And we anticipate modest additional improvement

in the fourth quarter.
Before moving to Brazil, let me provide some comments on Mexico. As I mentioned last quarter, we anticipated
Mexico would be a contributor to the improvements in the second half. We are disappointed with the speed of recovery
in Mexico, as it is taking longer than we would like to stem the declines in Active Representatives.
As we discussed last year, we have two issues in Mexico. First, pricing product portfolio issues; and second, a decline
in Active Representatives. We have made good progress in improving the product portfolio and pricing, and we've seen
a nice increase in average order. However, we have not yet stemmed the decline in a number of Active Representatives.
We are bringing new Representatives in, but too many of them are dropping out early in the process. It's important that
we engage our newer Representatives, especially during the first six campaign cycles.
As I discussed last quarter in the example of the United Kingdom, our retention rate of Representatives goes up
significantly where we help them navigate through the first six campaign cycles. Mexico has actions in place to
strengthen the on-boarding process to improve the retention rate. In fourth quarter, we expect Mexico to show
sequential improvement in overall performance.
Let me now discuss Brazil, given the sluggish performance in the quarter and its importance to Avon. As you know,
Brazil is our largest market and Latin America is our most profitable region. Let me provide some perspective. By way
of background, Brazil is the third-largest beauty market in the world, and it has generally averaged over 10% per year
growth during the last decade.
Given the emerging middle class and the importance of beauty, the longer-term outlook for the market remains bright.
Direct selling penetration in our categories was high, particularly in Fragrance, Color and Skincare. In these categories,
direct selling represents about 70% of the market. The attractiveness of the market has not been lost on our competitors.
Retail has been gaining ground, particularly in personal care and hair care.
In addition, the direct selling market remains highly competitive. These factors have led to significant increases in
competitive activity over the past year, with strong promotions and high levels of advertising spend. In addition, the
Brazilian economy has not recovered, as anticipated, after the World Cup. Consumer spending also seems to be
impacted by the uncertain economic environment, the election cycle and high household debt. That being said, while
growth may be slowing, Brazil remains a highly attractive market. And we are committed to participating in its
longer-term growth.
Let me give you some context on Avon Brazil's third quarter business performance, which came in below our
expectations. Following solid results in 2012 and 2013, Brazil's performance weakened in the second quarter of this
year and was again below our expectations in the third quarter. Bob will give you more detail, but Brazil's revenue was
flat, including four points due to value-added taxes. And Active Representatives were essentially flat. As I've been
working closely with the Brazilian team, I can see that there are three factors impacting our performance.
First, the Brazilian economy and consumer spending were weaker than we expected. Second, while the Brazilian
market has always been competitive, the competitive environment has gotten tougher. And third, our in-market
execution has been a bit disappointing.
Regarding execution, last quarter, we discussed an issue with forecasting revenues for new product. This was addressed
and, from my perspective, did not play a role in Brazil's third quarter results. On the other hand, because of lead times
needed for manufacturing and marketing, our third quarter plans were locked in more than six months ago and were
designed to target a more robust consumer environment.
Specifically, we were moving up the pricing mix curve, where the consumer was becoming more price-sensitive. You
may recall that we believe the second quarter weakness was related largely to the World Cup, and we expected a
rebound in consumer activity during the third quarter. And that has not happened.
Let me provide you with more detail. Most of our shortfall on Brazil's third quarter results was in the Color category.
We introduced Luxe, our premium Color line, that was successful in a number of our European markets. In Brazil, we
are the market leader in the Color category. And at the time the innovation with planned, we anticipated that our core

consumer would be receptive to premium-priced innovation. And while the new launch performed well with a subset of
consumers, this line did not reach the broader audience, given its premium price point.
In hindsight, given the economic background, we did not sufficiently activate the field or support the base Color
segment strongly enough. Let me briefly outline what I expect from here. While it's difficult to precisely measure the
proportional impact of the three factors that I believe we are facing, the economy, competitive activity and our
execution, and while it will take some time, we have a solid management team in place. The longer-term outlook for
the beauty market remains bright, and I believe our execution will improve.
In the fourth quarter, we expect the Brazilian performance to improve a bit but not necessarily return to growth. We are
in the early stages of our 2015 planning. And while it's too early to be more precise, we are adjusting our marketing
plans to take into account more muted consumer spending. In addition, I think we have a great program of new product
initiatives and responses to the more competitive marketplace.
Putting the pieces together and based on what I know today, I expect our Brazilian business to grow in 2015. Key to
delivering our growth will be a continued focus on base-enhancing activity, while also launching new innovation,
including product from our two strategic alliances. We expect this to enable us to trade-up existing customers as well as
to attract new consumers.
I would like to now provide an update on the progress of our U.S. business. Some detail on the recent avon.com
re-launch and more broadly, what we are doing to evolve our business model to make the Avon experience more
attractive for today's Representatives and consumers.
As I've said many times, the U.S. is an important market for us. It is a large and growing beauty market. And while it's
clear that we have a long road ahead to get the Avon business to where it needs to be, we are making good progress.
We are taking aggressive actions to deliver profitability in 2015, and at the same time, we are working to build a
sustainable business by including all aspects of the Representative experience to drive better engagement.
As I mentioned last quarter, the management team is executing well. They continue to improve the cost base, having
reduced SG&A by $50 million this quarter versus prior year. Importantly, while taking significant cost out, the North
American team has made equally impactful process enhancements. They've also made significant improvements in
product mix, pricing and merchandising execution. And as a result, we saw good increase in average order this quarter,
up 3% versus prior year.
At the same time, we are not yet seeing improvement on our Active Representative trends. Over time, it is critical that
we grow our Active Representatives, while first making sure that the Representative experience is one that will attract
and retain productive Representatives.
We have been taking action in the field, increasing our support for new Representatives, improving the Representative
experience with Avon and improving her overall earnings opportunity. Equally important to what we're doing is how
we're doing it. We're listening to our Representatives and working together with them to build a better experience. The
recent relaunch of avon.com is a great example of this and highlights the opportunity we have to innovate our business
by offering a more contemporary social selling model.
Prior to the site's launch, we worked collaboratively with our Representatives to better understand how best to structure
our e-commerce strategy to support their businesses. While we consider avon.com to now be a best-in-class beauty site,
it's designed to be much more than that. And it's a key component in our commitment to improving the Representative
experience and strengthening her earnings opportunity.
At our August sales conference, we introduced the concept of two ways to earn and two ways to sell to the field, and it
was positively received. Representatives receive commission when they sell face-to-face and when their customers buy
online. The site provides agility that we don't have through our print brochure. For example, the opportunity for special
online-only offers and last-minute shopping deals help consumers meet their needs and help Representatives generate
more sales and grow their earnings.

Avon.com can also help them build their customer base. We are giving her the tools, training and incentives to be a
successful, multi-channel social seller, if she so chooses. Alongside avon.com, we recently launched the Avon social
media center. This enables a Representative to easily set up and use her own personal social media tools, like her
eStore, Facebook and Twitter accounts to connect with her customers and build her business.
Since the social media center launched in mid-September, more than 30,000 Representatives have used it. And we
continue to train and promote in the field. We'll be tracking the data over time. But anecdotally, we're seeing that once
they experience the social media center, they're getting to a habit of returning on a regular basis to share the content
that is refreshed every campaign.
In the first fourth months of being active, Representative social media posts generated over 400,000 visits to
Representative eStores. For those consumers who choose not to have a relationship with a Representative, they can
shop with us as well.
Avon has great products. And by enhancing awareness and trial of our brand, Avon and our Representatives benefit. It's
early days, but so far we've had a positive response from our Representatives and consumers.
We plan to roll out a similar e-commerce model in the UK in 2015. And across all key markets, we will be looking at
ways to innovate our business model to offer a more contemporary social selling experience.
While the re-launch of avon.com is an important milestone in the U.S. recovery, e-commerce is just one aspect of the
U.S. business plan. While we don't break e-commerce revenue out separately, it is typical in the U.S. beauty industry
for 6% to 8% of total sales to be generated from e-commerce. And we expect to be in line with that.
Most importantly, the improvements to avon.com fit within the broader context of making it easier to do business with
Avon.
Lastly, let me make a brief comment on our longer-term financial goals. During our second quarter earnings call, we
highlighted two things. First, we intended to review our goals at year end once we have deeper insight into our progress
in North America and the other areas that impact timing. And that continues to be our intent.
Second, we said we think our goals of mid single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin were the
right goals, but the degree of difficulty was getting greater than when we set the goals in late 2012. We discussed that
we were somewhat behind where we thought we would be at this point, particularly in terms of revenue growth. That
remains the case.
In addition to the U.S. issues that proved deeper than we originally anticipated and the influx of several unexpected
macro issues, we are now facing a tougher environment in Latin America than we expected. So while I continue to
believe that Avon is capable of mid single-digit revenue growth longer term, it is increasingly less likely that we will
hit our revenue growth goals in 2016.
Regarding the goal of low-double digit operating margin, we feel better on this one, based on the traction we are getting
in our cost-reduction efforts. Cost management will remain an area of focus for us but, at the same time, we know it's
crucial that we drive top line growth as well. And we will achieve growth by continuing our systematic
market-by-market approach.
To reinforce what I said to you last quarter, we're very clear on what it takes to restore any of our top markets back to
sustainable, profitable growth. First, get the right management team in place. Second, execute well against our critical
processes. And third, drive Representative engagement. We continue to work through this step by step in our top-12
markets.
Now I'd like to hand it over to Bob, who will take you through the third quarter results. Bob?

Thank you, Sheri. I'm pleased to be speaking with all of you today in my role as Avon's Acting CFO. Consistent with
what Sheri just reviewed, our overall results this quarter are in line with our expectations provided in July of a second
half improvement. The sales recovery is still taking us longer than we had originally anticipated. And Latin American
sales trends were disappointing to us this quarter, specifically in Brazil and Mexico.
On the flipside, we are pleased with the progress we made in EMEA and notably in Russia, as well as with our
operating margin performance. With that said, let me take you through the details of the quarter. I'll start by providing a
quick overview of our consolidated results, and then I will review the geographic performance.
In the third quarter, constant dollar revenue rose 1% but declined 8% on a reported basis, negatively impacted 9% by
foreign exchange. The biggest contributors to the negative foreign currency impact on revenues were Venezuela,
Argentina, Ukraine and Russia. Constant dollar Beauty sales were up 1%, while Fashion & Home was down 4%.
Within Beauty, Skincare and Fragrance were up. And Color declined, driven by weak Color performance in Brazil.
With regards to constant dollar revenue growth, our consolidated results benefited 1% from additional VAT tax credits
in Brazil. Growth in EMEA was better than we had expected, while Latin America did not meet our expectations. I will
provide more information on each region later.
Active Representatives were down 4%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in North America as well as
softness in Latin America. However, we are pleased that EMEA Active Representative showed recovery in the quarter.
We're also pleased that we saw average order growth in all regions. Units declined 4% and, consistent with the Active
Representatives declines, was driven by weakness in North America and Latin America. Q3 price mix was up 5%, with
increases in most regions led by North America, due to higher pricing in the U.S. and inflationary pricing in Latin
America.
Adjusted gross margin declined 110 basis points to 62%, impacted by foreign currency, primarily in EMEA. As many
of you are aware, in EMEA, we manufacture most of our products in Poland and some in Russia. We source raw
materials mostly in hard currencies, including euros and dollars. At the same time, we sell products in many countries
with soft currencies, including Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Ukraine.
This creates the negative transaction foreign exchange impact. In addition, there is a delay in our ability to realize
pricing in order to offset the currency impact, partly due to timing of brochure creation and partly due to the
competitive and consumer environment in each market.
Adjusted operating margin was up 390 basis points, with approximately 200 basis points of the improvement due to
some items that are one-time in nature. The most significant items include the incremental impact of VAT tax credits in
Brazil in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the third quarter of 2013. We also updated our estimates associated
with employee incentive compensation plans, and reversed a portion of these accruals.
Although there were some one-time benefits, the underlying adjusted operating margin was still up nicely, despite the
gross margin decline, as we continued to make good progress on our cost-reduction efforts, particularly in North
America. We also saw cost savings from other head count reductions and lower corporate expenses.
The adjusted effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 32.5% a year ago, in line with our expectation of mid-to-high
30% range. Adjusted EPS was $0.23 per share compared with $0.14 a year ago.
I will now provide more details on our results by geographic region.
Turning to Latin America. As Sheri mentioned, overall, we are disappointed with our sales performance in Latin
America, especially in Brazil, where sales did not recover from the weakness we experienced last quarter, and in
Mexico, where the recovery is taking longer than we expected.
Third quarter revenue was 2% in constant dollars, including two points from VAT tax credits in Brazil. Active
Representatives were down 4%, as we continue to focus on improving field engagement. The decline in Active
Representatives was driven by Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela. While Active Representatives were down, average
order was up 6%. Average order benefited from the recognition of the Brazil VAT as well as inflationary pricing in

Venezuela and Argentina.
Units were down 5%, primarily due to declines in Brazil and Venezuela. As we mentioned in the last two quarters, we
adopted SICAD II for Venezuela at the end of the first quarter. But we only update our constant dollar exchange rates
on an annual basis, so we won't utilize the SICAD II exchange rate in determining our constant dollar results until first
quarter of 2015.
Had we used the SICAD II rate to translate Venezuela results into constant dollars, the region's constant dollar revenue
would have been flat with the prior year. Latin America adjusted operating margin was 13.5%, up 220 basis points.
This 220 basis points improvement included an approximately 150 basis points benefit from the incremental impact of
VAT tax credits, mentioned previously.
The remaining underlying improvement was due to reduced field investments, primarily in Brazil. This reflects efforts
to lower bad debt expense as well as comparisons with a year ago, when we had heavy spending in support of our
restage Color line. We also made progress in lowering brochure costs in the region.
Turning to Brazil. Constant dollar revenue was flat, including approximately four points from the VAT tax credit. Note,
we also recognized the VAT tax credit in the third quarter of 2013. The four points refers to the incremental amount in
this quarter compared with the prior-year quarter.
Beauty was down 4% in constant dollars, primarily driven by Color. To a lesser extent, we were also impacted by
Fashion & Home, which was down 3%, due to weakness in Fashion. We believe our business in Brazil is being
impacted by a combination of macro challenges as well as some executional challenges that we had in the Color
category this quarter, specifically around new products, as Sheri discussed.
We are course correcting as we move forward. We believe our field is healthy and, as a result, are focusing on enduring
that we have the proper activation around new products, while at the same time appropriately supporting our base
business.
Turning to Mexico. Revenue was down 6% in constant dollars, driven by a continued decline in Active
Representatives. However, we did make progress in average order. We were disappointed that we didn't achieve better
Representative engagement during the quarter. The field management process continues to remain a priority, as our
programs have not yet yielded the targeted results. As a reminder, our new General Manager started on September 1,
and he's working on plans to reinvigorate the business.
The team in Mexico remains focused on improving Representative engagement to more outreach to new
Representatives and new loyalty programs. We expect some sequential recovery in Mexico in Q4, partially due to
easier comparisons. Venezuela revenue increased 29% in constant dollars. The increase was driven by inflationary
pricing, as the business continues to face a difficult economic environment.
The lack of availability of raw materials has limited our product portfolio in Venezuela, which has significantly
impacted units sold and pressured Active Representatives. While we have been able to secure inventory, we continue to
monitor the situation.
As a reminder: while Venezuela is a challenging environment, as we move into 2015, Venezuela has a relatively
smaller impact on constant dollar performance when we update our constant dollar rates. As our largest and most
profitable region, driving improved performance in Latin America is critical.
We expect the environment to remain challenging in the near term, with the soft economy and high levels of
competition. But we are focusing on engaging Representatives with new products, ensuring appropriate support of our
base business and providing attractive incentives.
Moving to EMEA. Revenue was up 5% in constant dollars, with improvements in Active Representatives' average
order end units. The closure of the French market negatively impacted the region's growth in Q3 by approximately one
point.

Adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 8.9%, down 100 basis points, due to currency and product mix negatively
impacting the gross margin. This was only partially offset by volume leverage from the revenue growth. Overall, we
feel good about the progress we made in EMEA this quarter. We had a strategy to address the weak economies across
the region and geopolitical issues in Eastern Europe.
We drove consumer and Representative engagement through unit-moving offers and Representative incentives. This
resulted in a recovery in units and Active Representative growth. For you to note: the revenue growth did benefit from
the timing of some items in Russia this quarter that will dampen the growth in Q4, which I will discuss in a moment.
But we are still pleased with the underlying recovery in the region.
In Russia, constant dollar sales rose 14%. Our strategy was to improve Representative growth as well as to activate
consumers, and we are pleased that we did both. We offered Beauty unit movers in the brochure to drive
Representative engagement and excite customers. And we also backed this up with incentives, targeted to activate
Representatives. Additionally, we saw strong sales of Fashion & Home as we increased promotional activity to drive
sales of excess inventory.
Russia also benefited this quarter from the timing of the close-out of campaigns in the third quarter as compared to
similar campaigns ending in the fourth quarter last year. We are very pleased with the recovery in Q3, but we expect
Q4's growth rate is more likely to be in the low single-digit range. We expect this timing of the end of the campaigns
will cause some variability in our growth rates through the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to the UK. We are pleased with the continued growth. Constant dollar revenue was up 4% in Q3, driven by
improvement in average order, which was partially offset by a decline in Active Representatives. We will remain
focused on improving Active Representatives in the UK.
Looking forward, we are encouraged by the signs that we see in EMEA and feel good about actions the team has been
taking to accelerate customer-and-Representative engagement. But do note that growth is likely to slow a bit in Q4, due
to the timing issues I discussed that are impacting Russia.
Turning to North America. Constant dollar sales were down 15%, due to continued declines in Active Representatives
of 18%, only partially offset by average order growth of 3%. Units were down 22%. On a constant dollar basis, both
Beauty sales as well as Fashion & Home sales declined 15%. Adjusted North American operating margin was negative
4.5%, up 570 basis points from the prior year.
The third quarter is usually our least-profitable quarter in North America, given the small revenue base. But we were
still able to show a significant improvement in margin, once again, due to our cost-reduction efforts. As we look ahead
to Q4 for North America, we expect to see some sequential improvement due to a number of factors.
First, in an effort to be more aligned with the rest of our markets, we are moving the end of our U.S. President's Club
cycle from Q1 to Q4. This is likely to pull forward some sales from the first quarter of 2015 into the fourth quarter of
this year.
While this will benefit the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison, it will hurt the first quarter 2015 results. In
addition, we feel good about some of the new launches we have in place to engage Representatives during the
important holiday season, including the redesign of our jewelry line, our ANEW Vitale skincare collection, which is
aimed at women showing the first signs of aging and the launch of the Elsa and Olaf dolls from the very popular
children's movie, Frozen.
We still have a lot of work to do to continue to improve the performance in North America, but we are making
progress. We also remain on track with our goal to become profitable in North America in 2015.
In Asia Pacific, revenue rose 4% on a constant dollar basis. Active Representatives declined 9%, while units rose 11%.
Adjusted operating margin was 5.2%, up 360 basis points. This was due to revenue leverage as well as cost reductions.
The improved revenue results in Asia Pacific this quarter were primarily due to China, where we are comparing against
the inventory destocking at the beauty boutiques last year. As a result, China was up in the quarter. Philippines also
contributed, rising 5%, while other markets remained soft.

Now I'll take you through the three adjustments we made to our GAAP results in the quarter. During the quarter, we
recorded additional charges associated with our previously executed restructuring, with an operating profit of
approximately $3 million, primarily related to the company's $400 million cost-savings initiative. We also recorded a
settlement charge of approximately $5 million pre-tax as a result of payments from the company's U.S pension plan.
As was mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, in an effort to better manage our pension obligations, we had
offered former employees who invested in their pension benefits a payment to settle the pension obligation. This
settlement charge in this quarter is a follow-on from that effort. Also, as a result of the adoption of the SICAD II
foreign exchange rate to re-measure the results of our Venezuelan business, we recorded an additional $2 million
charge from using the U.S. historic dollar cost basis of non-monetary assets that's particularly inventory particularly
inventory.
Moving on to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $126 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 compared with net cash provided by $96 million for the same period of 2013. 2013 cash flow
included significant payments for make-whole premiums on debt that did not recur in 2014.
In addition, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by the timing of the accounts payable, primarily for inventory
purchases and lower tax payments. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower cash-related earnings and
higher payments in 2014 for the 2013 employee incentive compensation.
The overall net cash used during the nine months ended September 30 was $282 million compared with overall net
cash used of $400 million for the same period in 2013. Our net debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.8 billion,
which is up $191 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower cash balances, which is partly due to the
devaluation in Venezuela.
In the third quarter, we also continued to make progress on working capital, which operationally improved nine days
compared with a year ago. Accounts payable improved 22 days operationally, as we continue to focus on renegotiating
payment terms with our vendors. However, inventory was 13 days worse operationally, primarily driven by Latin
America, due to markets with high inflation and also due to the weaker-than-expected sales in Brazil.
We now expect that our full-year capital expenditures will be in the range of $120 million to $140 million. This is a
reduction from our earlier expectation of $200 million to $230 million. The reduction is partly due to foreign currency.
We have also reduced our project spend. We had originally planned some additional supply chain enhancements this
year. But given our current volumes, these enhancements didn't make sense at this time. In addition, as you know, we
remain vigilant on ensuring every project has an appropriate ROI.
Looking ahead to Q4. We continue to anticipate constant dollar sales and margin growth. We expect to see sequential
improvement in Brazil, Mexico and the U.S. We expect adjusted operating margin to be up year-over-year but up much
less than in Q3, given the benefits we had in Q3 that I highlighted earlier that we don't expect to repeat in Q4. For the
full year, we still expect to make progress towards our margin goal, but sales are likely to still be down a bit.
With that, I'll hand it back to Sheri.
Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Bob. In closing, let me reiterate that we continue with our expectation that the second half of 2014 will
show improvement relative to the first half, including modest additional improvement in the fourth quarter.
There's a lot of work to be done, but the organization is working on the right things to return Avon to sustainable,
profitable growth. We're managing down costs, and we're focused on delivering sequential improvement across key
markets and categories. I look forward to updating you again in February on our progress. Thank you.
And I'll now turn it for Q&A.

Please note, you will be limited to one question and a related follow-up question until all callers in the queue have
posed their questions. Please note, once you have asked your related follow-up question, your line will be muted once
again. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then
pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks so much. It's Barclays. Sheri, a lot of the detail in your prepared remarks was
really helpful and the deep dive in some of those markets, so thank you for that. And just, a lot of the things you said
pointed to one big question around the timing of brochure development. It feels like a couple times now, you talk about
an execution issue in a given market because the market has zigged while your plans have seemed to zagged. And so is
there anything that you're doing currently to accelerate or compress that brochure and incentive development cycle and
that could happen kind of quickly to help you out next year? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren, and very good point. I mean one of the things that as we look at our
top-12 markets as it relates to execution, we look at it from the standpoint of, where are they from an external
perspective? What are the macros? What is the competitive environment? And then we're also looking at it from where
we are from an internal perspective in terms of, do we have the right management team in place? How are we focusing
on our processes?
I think that the learning for us is really to make sure that we're focusing more externally. The example in Brazil is, had
we thought about it more, we would've had a contingency plan. If the market doesn't turn, how do we make sure we do
that? We're buying a lot more data today in terms of the looking at the macros, and so that's an area that will help us do
that. But I think in terms of our planning, where we need to get better on execution is to understand how we are going
to behave if the consumer environment doesn't come back.
Great example of that is Russia. I think Russia, they were challenged, as you know. A couple quarters ago, they quickly
looked at, okay, what do we need to do in the consumer spending environment? I think Brazil is taking a lesson out of
that. We just need to be much more nimble on that.
I think ultimately, I mention the North American case. Ultimately, we're more online and we can do things with an
e-commerce play to activate our Representative, we have more flexibility. So we're doing that. At the same time, we're
working with our – if you get into the tactics, we're working with our vendors to look at how we can buy time to
shorten our printing cycle. But there are going to be some limitations on that.
I think the key thing is understanding the marketplace and being a little bit better on contingency planning. Making sure
over time that we have other vehicles, like online, that allows us to be more agile and flexible and making sure we don't
get too much ahead of ourselves. I think in the situation specifically in Brazil, the team had come off last – I guess
second half of last year, we saw the consumers trading up. I think we were a little bit more bold and ambitious than
perhaps we should've been in hindsight, given the environment. And that's good learning for us. So I think moving
forward, we will take all of these factors into consideration. Thanks, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey. It's Wells Fargo. I guess similar question, different angle, I guess. Sheri, do you learn
anything about the business, I guess, is it informative to you at all in any way that the Brazil business is seemingly so
economically sensitive, right? More so than most other CPG categories that you'd look at, right? Seemingly, much

more economically sensitive than the categories as a whole. So I guess what do you think that means in Brazil? And
then can you give a little more detail on the reduction of field incentives in that market? What's that going to do for
you? And what does it mean for the improvement of the business?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks, Chris. Brazil is a very attractive beauty market and, while the economy is down,
it's still a large and growing middle class. Some consumers are ready to trade up. And as you know, in our situation,
many of our Representatives carry multiple books, and what our focus needs to be is looking at how we get more of the
fair share of the wallet.
We do know that women will still invest in beauty. Their wallet may shrink a little bit, but what we have to figure out,
how can we be more competitive? I do think one of the things that we, as we go forward and as we put our plans
together for 2015, we are going to assume that there are going to be a base of consumers that trade up. And making
sure we have innovation at that level – at the high-mass level is critically important. And now also allows us, perhaps,
to take share of wallet from others.
But at the same time, we cannot walk away from that core base and making sure – I'll use the Color example – making
sure that if we look at all three parts of mass, lower all the way up to higher, that we have attractive either incentives or
motivation from a consumer, particularly at the lower end. So I think it's a matter of balancing the base business with
looking to trade up consumers.
And so while it may be slowing, I still see the market as very, very attractive. And certainly, if you look at Skin, Color
and Fragrance, most of that is still going through direct selling today, about 70%. We still see that as a very attractive
space. In fact, many of the retail competitors are coming into that space. We need to up our game in terms of
competitiveness, but also making sure that we're doing things to activate our Representatives.
So we remain bullish on Brazil, despite the challenges. And we're looking at for the longer term, how do we do the
right thing? I think also our strategic alliances allow us to trade up the consumer in a different way. So being really
thoughtful about the role each of our sub-brands play and then putting the right consumer activation as well as
Representative activation behind them is critically important for the future. Thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi. It's Deutsche Bank. Hey, guys, can you just tell me what the currency impact was in the
quarter – and then I have a follow up – because I saw the gross margin impact was 110 basis points. But I was
wondering what the total margin impact of currency was. And then maybe if you have an outlook for the fourth quarter,
quarter, noting that currency's obviously going to get a little bit worse quarter, noting that currency's obviously going to
get a little bit worse.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes. I'll ask Bob to take that question. Thanks, Bob.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Sure. Currency impact on the quarter was about 160 basis points, all in, on operating margin.
And in Q4, we expect similar impact at this point.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. That's great. And then my real question. You've probably seen the success of Mary Kay
recently. I don't find their business to be that dissimilar than yours. So is there anything you could learn from what
they've done recently and how they've kind of managed to like really pull things out, even North America, but in Brazil
as well?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think one of the things that Mary Kay has done well is I think that they focus on the
consumer and the representative and making sure that there's alignment between the consumer activation and the
representative activation.

Skincare is a very important category. I'm actually pleased this quarter that we saw growth in Skincare after eight
quarters of decline, so it's an area that we will continue to focus. I think that the key to our success and any of our
direct-selling competitor success or I would even say CPG is, understand the consumer and the representative; then
make it work for both of them. And I think they do a nice job of that. And we'll get better at it.

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, with Citigroup. My question centers on the moving pieces in SG&A because I know
you break out in a fair amount of detail in the Q kind of all of the areas of savings. But when I pick through them, I
think there's one thing, the brochure costs where you talk about cost savings specifically, and that's a benefit of 60 bp.
But every other area of savings is lower investment in IT or advertising, the bad debt expense, lower executive comps.
It's all, number one, seemingly one-off items, but number two, it reflects underinvestment or lower investment in the
business. So I guess my question is, am I misunderstanding that? Are there more genuine cost savings that are
improving the SG&A spending? And number two, what's the sustainability of the margin bump? I mean it strikes right
now that, wow, we have one heck of a tough comp when we get to the third quarter of 2015 in terms of the EBIT
margin. So can you help me with that a little bit? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure, Wendy. I'll comment and, Bob, feel free to add anything if I miss. I think one of the
areas that you didn't capture is we have made a lot of progress on head count reduction and looking at how we simplify
our processes. So that's an area that flows through and perhaps doesn't pop out in terms of how you are looking at that.
The other comment I want to make is on bad debt. I mean bad debt is one of these areas where we have seen an
increase in the bad debt, and that's something that's challenging as we look at some of these markets. But that's
something that needs to be sustainable over time, and so we are putting a lot of energy and effort on that in Latin
America to get the balance right, obviously, to bring Representatives in. But we need to have them paying their bill.
And so that's something that is sustainable that we will continue to work on.
As it relates to your comments around some of the other items of the SG&A line. One of the things we are continuing
to look at is, how do we make strategic decisions around where we invest in marketing and/or field? And we've made
improvements in some areas. Other areas, perhaps we should have spent more. And so when I was giving the example
of the Color situation in Brazil, perhaps we should've put a little bit more in field or redeploy some resources there. So
we will continue to look at that. But I think the key thing that we're focused on is making sure that we continue to
improve our overall effectiveness and efficiency.
A lot of it's driven through head count. Project spend, we will cut projects – and we've been more diligent on that – is,
if they're not showing return on investment – and the example Bob gave on CapEx with the pricing. Some of the things
we looked at does not provide return on investment, and we're not going to spend against those. So that's where we are.
I don't think I missed anything.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Well, no, you didn't miss anything. I would just add, your point on a tough comp when we
hit third quarter next year, that's why tried to be transparent in letting you know that about 200 basis points was kind of
one-off type items this quarter. But even if you exclude that 200 basis points of one-offs, we still feel that our
underlying operating margin improved pretty well.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to the reversal of the executive comp payment. I
mean I know a little while back, some of the targets looked pretty achievable. And my suspicion is that folks, including
Kimberly, thought that there was lot of money being made as you reached your target.
But can you talk just broadly about sort of morale in the organization – and not in the field – not the Representative,
themselves. But more, Sheri, a lot of the people that you've hired over the last 12 to 18 months, I assume that some of
their comp is tied to the stock as well. So given what you've seen in the stock and given the performance of the

company, do you anticipate more attrition at that kind of senior level of management, perhaps? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. Thanks, Wendy. Certainly, one of the challenges that we see is our ability to deliver
on revenue. And I think where we've made progress is on the cost side, and we continue to focus on the cash side,
which is how our comp is set up because it's a third revenue growth, a third op margin and a third cash as it relates to
the short-term compensation.
And what we continue to look at is, how do we make a difference and show improvement that's important from an
employee morale perspective? It's one of these things where we need to make sure that people feel like they're part of a
winning team. And it's difficult when you're in a turnaround. With that said, we feel good that we're making sequential
improvement. We need to continue to make sure we're communicating with people and showing that the underlying
business is, in fact, improving. But it's not an easy task, frankly.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: From Bernstein. I had a quick clarification, and then I want to revisit a question just a little bit
earlier. The clarification is around Brazilian VAT, if you guys could help. So the $42 million that you say in your Q
comes from Brazil, Brazilian VAT benefits. That flows straight to the net income line, does it? So of the $91 million,
$42 million was that? But kind of the just the -I don't understand; please clarify it.
The second thing I guess, which is still an I don't understand – and I want to give you another shot at a earlier question
because it feels like – I'm looking for you to dispel me of this, but it feels like you're very focused on making these
short-term numbers, perhaps, hurting a long term. So if you go back to the SG&A line – and I just pulled up the Q
during your answer to the previous question, but there's 80 basis points from cutting IT. You have to spend that at some
point. It's 80 basis points from bad debt expense, debatable about that. It's 60 basis points from lower investments in
your Reps, especially new product in Brazil, which you just said was a problem earlier on.
You go down the list, it's cost cutting, which maybe there's something there on the headcounts and brochures. Then
lower incentive compensation internally and to your Reps. Tax credits on Brazil's another 40 basis points. 40 basis
points on advertising cost reductions. It just feels like when you read down the list, to Wendy's question, that you're
doing a lot, plus pulling Russia forward from a campaign, plus keeping the 6.30 as long as we can on Venezuela to
make the short term.
And I want to understand, well first, can you dispel me that? And two, if you can't, why that is? And why are you so
focused on now when there's a lot of stuff you got to do, I think even investment, for the future? So sorry for the long
question, as usual, but those two things I'd love some help on. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Okay. I'll start with – turning to Bob relative to your question on the VAT impacts.
<A - Robert Loughran>: So there was quite a bit in that question. But the Brazilian VAT. First of all, that's flows to
operating profit but it doesn't flow from – 100% to net income because there's income tax impact on that as well. As I
said, there was a lot in your question, but your comment on pulling Russia forward. That's just a factor at the calendar,
so it's not like we did something intentionally to bring that forward for the quarter. That, literally just a factor of the
calendar. And as I said, we're just trying to be transparent on all of that.
But going back to what I said before, a lot of it – there are some things that are one-time in nature. We tried to strip
those out. Some of it did hit the incentive spending as well. So while it seems like it's down significantly, it is down but
it's not as down as significantly as you're pointing out. It's captured in our 200 basis points that we're talking about of
kind of non-recurring items.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. Ali, just to address the question of short term versus long term – and I'll tie this back
to Wendy's question about management team. I think our management team is very committed to the long term. We are
making decisions as it relates to the specific short term. If something doesn't make sense to spend against, we're not

going to spend against it. So you cite – I'll go to the [ph] IT example. The IT example was really driven by S&P
(56:06), which that's a cut we made.
We made that deliberately because we recognize that we couldn't go all the way to a global solution, given where we
were in the business. And it didn't make sense because our businesses aren't exactly the same globally because of
developed market versus the developing market. So we've taken a much more prudent approach to that, and so we're
doing an IT test and evaluating a new system in the UK, as an example. And we're going to learn from that and then
take that and roll that out.
So we've made some decisions like that, which really are the right decision for the long term but they have a short-term
impact. And so the team is looking at, how do we balance that? It's always – running any company, it's always a
balance between short term and long term. But we recognize we're in it the long term. We have 6 million
Representatives globally who depend on our company and depend on us from an earnings opportunity, and we're very
committed to that.

Ladies and gentlemen, please now limit yourself to one question. Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian.
Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi. Morgan Stanely. Sheri, we're now two years into your leadership or a little more than
two years in, but we aren't seeing top line trends improve, despite the enormous changes you've put into place. So I
wanted to get a review on why you believe you aren't getting as much traction as expected? Where you kind of stand in
terms of some of the key areas you've been focusing on? And then back to the spending question, I understand you're
getting efficiencies and more effective in some of these areas in terms of spending. But do you think you need to
re-boost underlying spending behind the business in order to drive top line growth going forward? And if not, why do
you think you can drive improved top line growth going forward?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So as I talked about both growth and profit, I mean one of the things – and I went
through this a bit in my example with the UK last quarter – is it's important to look at the context of making sure that
we have the right management team in place. And we're in the process of that. And as I said, in our top-12 markets, we
have about 75% of the people in the right positions. It's taken us time to get there. Once we have that in place, the two
processes that we focus on is Representative engagement piece of it, and secondly, the commercial marketing.
What I would say is on the commercial marketing side, we've made more progress and so you can see that with our
average order up. We've been more challenged on the Representative enhancement side. And I think part of that is due
to some macro issues in some of our critical markets. But that, to me, is the area that we need to continue to focus on.
We are probably more challenged in North America than we had anticipated, and I've stated that several times. That's
one area we have been disappointed and that we haven't been able to get under that as quickly as we would like. In the
other areas, I think we have made good progress with the team. Some of it has to do with macro issues, so I feel good
about that.
As it relates to investments, we will invest where we think it makes sense and we need to be strategic. And we'll also
make decisions where we're not going to invest. We are focused on those top-12 markets and making sure that we're
understanding the opportunities there. And I think in some instances, it makes sense to put more marketing dollars
behind it; Brazil, certainly. But at the same time, we need to make sure that we're looking at it from a total standpoint,
both from a consumer activation standpoint as well as a field activation standpoint. Thank you.

<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First, just a follow-up. Since it's not the $42 million
flow-through on the Brazilian VAT, can you specify how much of that benefited net income? And then the actual
question is just, in the context of your turnaround, two of your biggest markets now, Brazil and Mexico, are
underperforming – and I understand that macros are a contributor. But execution's obviously an issue, too. So is there a
discussion that you need maybe a more expansive, fixed program specifically for those markets that may take more
than a few quarters to execute and may require a bigger charge or something like that?
And then I know you said you think the field is healthy, but why cut Rep investment when it seems like you're seeing
tougher macros and also having some concerns around growth? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sorry. Could you just repeat – I could not – the second part of your question, we could not
hear, here. Sorry.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Oh, I'm sorry. It was just around, do you need to do something bigger for Brazil and Mexico,
given that those businesses are underperforming? And then also, if you think that the field is healthy – you said you
think that the field is healthy, but why cut the Rep investment then when these are two of your biggest markets and
there are clearly tougher macros and some concerns around growth?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think as we look at both Brazil and Mexico, our focus is on making sure that we're
supporting the initiatives, whether it would be new products or baseline. As I said in the case of Brazil, in hindsight, we
probably – if we put some more money in consumer, we probably would've put more in field as it relates specifically to
Color this quarter.
Moving forward in 2015, as we look at the plans, we're looking at it within the competitive environment, the consumer
spending trend. And we will look at how we deploy resources to be competitive. And so we have our baseline business
that we're looking at. We also have our two strategic alliances that will be coming into play in 2015 and looking at how
we make sure we're supporting both the consumer activation portion of it as well as incentivizing the field. So I don't
think it's more that we have to do something dramatic. I do think we have to be thoughtful about how we look at it in
the competitive environment that we're in.
And on Mexico, I think the key thing here is in the field. We've made nice progress as it relates to the commercial
marketing piece and pricing and activation. We expect that we're going to continue to show improvement there. What
we find is when we have challenges in the field, it takes us longer. We saw that in a number of our markets, whether
it'd be UK, Russia, Mexico. But over time, we get to where we need to be, and that's our focus there.
<A - Robert Loughran>: And on your other question on Brazil VAT. I do want to remind you that we had VAT in the
third quarter of last year as well. So there was only an incremental impact this quarter that was less than the $42 million
you mentioned. But bigger picture, I think you should probably be looking at all of the non-recurring items within
which we kind of laid out that impacted operating margin by 200 basis points. If you wanted to talk to those, I would
just generally apply the consolidated tax rate on those.

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. Thanks. It's Stifel. Just wanted to follow up on that last point on the non-recurring
piece and just try to get a sense of how to think about what margins underlying look like. So I hear you on 200 basis
points, that's VAT. But there's also global expenses being reduced from SMT, employee incentive accrual, reversal of
the [ph] FCPAP (1:03:49). So if you sort of back all of those out, the operating margin in the quarter, instead of being
9% and change is closer to 5% and change, 4% and change, something like that. Like, I want to try to just get a sense of
where we think this should be on a go-forward basis.
And the same is true from a revenue standpoint as well. So currency neutral, constant dollar, however you want to think
about it, was up slightly. But Venezuela goes away next year in terms of the benefit, how you recognize it. The VAT

benefit flows through as well, so it was really slightly down. So maybe confirm that that's true or correct or it's not, and
then just maybe talk about directionally, where on an ongoing basis, you think the base is. And where you think you
can go then in that context?
<A - Robert Loughran>: Right. So how I would attack that is just basically, the 200 basis points, [ph] we're bracked
(1:04:39) in all of our one-time items into the 200 basis points. So if you took that out, we'd still be at a good
underlying expansion of our operating margin. The SMT that you mentioned, that's going to continue. That's now out
of our base, so it's not like it's coming back into our base. So – and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do
expect operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter, albeit not as great of a expansion in the third quarter because
of those 200 basis points but still expansion.

The next question comes from Michael Steib. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. I work at Credit Suisse. I was wondering, could you give us an update on where
you are with regards to the $400 million cost savings program? Are there still any sort of significant steps or any
significant reductions that we should expect?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes. I'll let Bob give you those specific numbers. I will say that we have a number of
cost-reduction programs still underway. So we are continuing to execute against a number of them. Bob, I don't know if
you want get into specifics.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yeah. As Sheri says, we're continuing to get our cost base. But we've taken charges to date
of probably a little over $200 million. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I'm sure it's slightly over $200
million. And the savings associated with those are roughly $250 million.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: And at the same time, those are the ones where we've taken charges. There's other things
that we've done to continue to drive costs out.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Right.
Operator
And your next question comes from Alice Longley. Please state your affiliation, pose your question.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Alice Longley, Buckingham Research. I have another way of asking the Latin America,
Brazilian question. As I go back several quarters, it looks like you can't have – you can't keep sales and earnings
growing at the same time. Either sales are up and margins are down because of the support, or margins are up and sales
are down because you've got support so it hurts sales.
So what I'm wondering if the brand has been so damaged over time that you're really not going to be able to get the
sales and profits growing at the same time? And this leads to my question, which is, how do you define your brand in
Brazil versus competition in terms of low end versus higher end? And I'm wondering if it's become more lower end
versus competition over time; and if so, it's really hard to shift a lower-end brand up to premium prices the way you
have tried to do.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So I think the brand is seen as a value-oriented good product for good value. In Brazil, we
have been successful, as I mentioned, in second half of last year and even first quarter of this year, of trading
consumers up with our Mega Effects launch, our [ph] Encanta (1:07:49) launch. So we have been able to do that. We
continue to look at how we will do that in – moving forward. At the same time, we have two strategic alliances that
allow us to trade up even more.

So we've looked at it from that standpoint. We need to continue to make – to your point, we need to make sure that we
continue to invest and talk to people about the Avon brand, whether we do that through TV advertising, online or
through the Representatives because having 1.5 million Representatives being ambassadors for our brand is another
way to talk about it.
But we are able to take – we need to understand it in the context of the macro environment and the competitive
environment and make sure we have a surround-sound approach to that. But we feel good about our plans in place for
2015. Thank you.

And your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question. Javier, your
line is open.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Yes. Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. Good morning, everyone. I think that
many of us have problems with the characterization of savings. Seems that for many of us, [ph] a strike of (1:09:03)
this investment, the Rep, the field investment, the lower advertising. And one market that I think that hasn't been
touched today is North America, where you reduced the head count significantly to extract savings. And since then, the
sales force has been cut by over more than a third. And it doesn't seem that you have a change in plan so far. So to what
extent you, by cutting this spending, you are essentially foregoing the opportunity to turn around this company? Thank
you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks, Javier. As it relates to North America, one of the challenges that we've seen is that
we sized our business for a much larger business. And as the sales were declining over several years, we never really
addressed the cost structure underneath that. As we looked at this last year, focused on getting costs out, we have not
been focused on getting costs out of the field. In fact, we've actually supported the field. Where we've been looking at it
as it relates to some of the internal resources that we have against the business; supply chain, project execution.
So the business was sized for a much larger business, and we hadn't course-corrected for that. And that's really where
we've been driving the costs out. It hasn't been that we're taking it out of the field. And in fact, we're looking at how to
– our resources around how to engage the field and thinking about that differently. But as I've said in the past, there are
some underlying issues that we need to fix to make it more attractive for representatives to come into our business. And
that's where we've been spending our energy, both internally as well as within the field. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Steve Powers. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Yes. Hi. It's UBS. Bob, could you just clarify when you expect the VAT benefits to run
out? That's just a clarifying question.
Then Sheri, maybe just to build on Wendy's question – I guess also Ali's – and to push on the notion of underlying
improvement in the quarter. If I go back and through everything and try to quantify it quickly in dollars rather than
basis points, tax credits sound like they benefited net income by close to $40 million. Bad debt expense looks like it's a
[ph] $10 billion benefit [ph] $10 million (1:11:33). Lower corporate costs, which I assume is the reversal of that
compensation accrual, $20 million. And then there's the lower [ph] AMP (1:11:40) in Representatives, which is $15
million. If I add it all up and I conclude – it's hard to conclude that it wasn't close to $0.20 of the EPS this quarter. It
was either attributable to timing benefits or cost cuts that seem to actually make it harder to grow in the future. And that
excludes the IT spend cuts.
And as been pointed out, this isn't a quarter where Active Reps are still trending downwards. North America and Latin
America fell short of my top line expectations; sound like yours as well and so on. So I guess tell me where I'm wrong
in that characterization or math and why I should see this quarter as a bigger inflection point? And I guess why even

sticking to the long-term margin target is the right objective because it still feels like you have to spend a lot more
going forward if you're going to stabilize the top line. And it feels, to some extent, like trying to get to the margin is
actually causing downstream revenue targets Thanks.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Thanks, Steve. Just to, I get – a lot of questions again, but the first question of when we
expect VAT credits to run out? I think first of all, team in Brazil is doing a great job in identifying these and finding
them when they can. But we're not expecting significant in the future, although we continue to look for – wherever we
can to – if we can, but not expecting significant wins.
On your other questions and that impact on net income, doesn't feel like you're applying the income tax rate to get to
net income. But once again, what I would say is, we had a 200 basis point impact from one-time items, which covers a
lot of the things you mentioned. It's the Brazil VAT; it's incentive comp. So if you were to take that 200 basis point
impact on operating margin, run that through and take the consolidated tax rate on that, that's how you would get to the
impact on net income.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. As it relates to the longer-term goal and cost savings, we have made a lot of
improvement. As we've announced in the past, as we talk about our PPI, we are looking at how we streamline our head
count in North America as well as corporate. And that's what we're seeing run through that will be consistent. We've
also looked at our supply chain and looked at things to make sure that we're being more cost effective. So I do feel that
there's underlying improvement in this. I think that we do have the right goals in place, and we're not making decisions
to say we're going to short investment relative to business opportunities when it makes sense from a return on
investment standpoint.
So we feel good about the progress we're making. We're going to continue to focus on that as we move forward, but it's
not a matter of cutting for the short term. We're not going to spend on IT projects that don't pay out or that are going to
disrupt our business. And so we're being very prudent in how we're doing that. We are holding the markets accountable
for top line growth as well as bottom line as well as cash generation. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Thanks. B. Riley. So I guess with all the kind of special items and things running through
the income statement, I guess one metric that value investors might look at to try to value your company is cash flow.
And you mentioned a couple of things that affect the comparison of the operating cash flow in 2014 versus 2013. So
going forward, if we want to just come to a base level of cash flow for your company, are we there? In other words, is
2014 fairly representative of sort of operating cash flow? Or are there unusual things that could cause unusual
comparisons next year?
And then so related to that, would, therefore, cash flow move going forward – operating cash flow – roughly in line
with net income? In other words, if net income declines, operating cash flow declines, net income increases, operating
cash flow increases. Is that how we should think of it? Thanks.
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yeah...
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Bob?
<A - Robert Loughran>: So thanks, Linda. With regards to the cash flow, yeah, we did have a number of one-time
items last year in 2013. We are in our budget process now, so I can't really comment on 2015. But we really didn't have
any major significant items impacting our cash flow this year, if that helps. But – so I guess that's all I can say on that.

And your final question comes from Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation, then pose your questions.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Thank you. It's BMO. I also had a question on cash and cash flow. Given that cash is
down about $280 million since the start of the year, can you tell us what portion of the $825 million that's on the
balance sheet is available and if you think the dividend is sustainable?
<A - Robert Loughran>: Yeah So on the balance sheet – so we have over $800 million on the balance sheet right now
of cash. We generally think that we need probably roughly $300 million to support working capital needs. So
effectively, the rest is available right now. And as you probably recall, we took a tax charge last year regarding the fact
that the foreign earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. So we can take all of the cash back with no additional
charge.
