On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP
financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.
Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference
call. Today we're pleased to report strong results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, up more than 32% from the
first quarter of 2014 and significantly exceeding our guidance range for the quarter.
Our performance included strong operational sales growth of nearly 18%. We delivered these results with growth
across a number of products in our portfolio, including uptake of our new HCV therapy, VIEKIRA, as well as strong
growth from HUMIRA, Synagis, Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa. We continue to see strong underlying demand for
HUMIRA with accelerating U.S. prescription growth and continued market share gains. We also saw improvement in
gross margin to 82.9%. And we continue to see our investment in the business deliver strong results.
Based on our outperformance, we've raised our full year EPS guidance range for 2015 by $0.05, reflecting our strong
underlying business performance year-to-date and the expected continued positive trends through the remainder of the
year. And we've also done this despite the negative impact of foreign exchange.
In addition to our strong financial results, we also have advanced several of our most important strategic priorities
during the quarter. Since the start of the year, we've achieved a number of important regulatory and development
milestones, including the EMA approval of our interferon-free HCV treatment; the regulatory submission and priority
review of our two DAA ribavirin-free once daily combination for genotype 1b HCV patients in Japan; the U.S.
regulatory approval for Duopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease; and the U.S. and EMA regulatory
submissions for Zinbryta, our novel treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.
We also reported positive top line efficacy data results from the first Elagolix pivotal trial in endometriosis. And
recently, our partner Galapagos reported positive data on our partnered selective JAK1 compound. Each of these
milestones continued to underscore the advancement and the robust nature of our mid- and late-stage pipeline.
Importantly, we recently announced the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, a strategic addition to our business that will
provide significant benefit for our shareholders and the patients which we serve. Pharmacyclics acquisition will add
another compelling growth platform to add these existing strong prospects in immunology and virology. It will
accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology, broadening our portfolio in hematological
oncology, an attractive and rapidly growing market in a segment where we have several other assets in mid- and
late-stage development.
While strategically important, this acquisition will also drive strong financial benefits. It further diversifies our revenue
base and significantly enhances our revenue growth across our long-range plan. We expect the transaction will be
accretive beginning in 2017 and significantly accretive in the years that follow. Specifically, as we have outlined, we
expect accretion in excess of $0.60 per share in 2019, ramping to more than $1 per share by 2021. The addition of
Pharmacyclics will augment AbbVie's already strong position and growth prospects. We remain on track to complete
the acquisition in the second quarter.
When we launched AbbVie as an independent company nearly 2.5 years ago, it was our stated goal to build an
innovation-drive, patient-focused bio-pharmaceutical company which could deliver strong, sustainable performance
over the long term. Our efforts have been focused on developing a culture of innovation and building a strong and
talented team, driving strong performance from our current portfolio and building a robust pipeline of innovative new
drugs and enhancing our efficiency and delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders. As we look back at our
performance, we're pleased to say that we have made significant progress towards all of these objectives.

Our 2015 guidance underscores our goal of driving industry leading growth this year, as we expect earnings per share
growth of nearly 27% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our strong first quarter performance certainly supports
our ability to deliver on this objective, and we expect to be among the top performers over our long-range plan. In fact,
given our execution across a number of fronts and the strategic actions that we have taken in the business and now the
addition of Pharmacyclics, we're well-positioned to generate top tier growth through the rest of this decade and beyond.
As we look at our business following the acquisition, we are strategically positioned with a number of compelling
growth platforms. Clearly, we're enthusiastic about our oncology franchise. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics is highly
complementary with our existing oncology pipeline, which is comprised of five late-stage assets poised to launch over
the next few years. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor, Venetoclax, and our dual PI3 kinase inhibitor, Duvelisib, both
being investigated for the treatment of a wide range of blood cancers.
So our portfolio will include three novel and promising mechanisms for the treatment of hematological malignancies:
BTK inhibition, BCL-2 inhibition, and PI3 kinase inhibition. We intend to move quickly to explore combination
therapies that have the potential to significantly elevate the standard of care and improve efficacy in hematological
cancers. The combinations have the potential to reduce or eliminate the toxic chemotherapeutic agents currently being
used in the management of these conditions.
Our oncology pipeline also includes Veliparib, our PARP inhibitor, being investigated for a wide range of solid tumors,
and ABT-414, our antibody drug conjugant for glioblastoma multiforme, both of which have demonstrated promising
signals of efficacy. We're also partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb on Elotuzumab in late-stage development for
frontline and relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. We'll see data from a number of our oncology programs as the year
progresses, including data from Venetoclax in relapsed refractory CLO patients with 17p deletion, as well as mid stage
data on Veliparib in non-small cell lung cancer, and Phase III data on Elotuzumab in relapsed refractory multiple
myeloma.
We also anticipate numerous readouts on IMBRUVICA, including data from the RESONATE-2 study in CLL, Phase
III monotherapy data in relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma, and additional details from the Phase III trial on
relapsed refractory CLL. Our combined late-stage oncology franchise will represent a significant source of growth for
AbbVie in the coming years with peak year sales estimated to exceed $15 billion.
Our virology franchise will also be a growth driver for AbbVie going forward. With the launch of VIEKIRA we have
established a meaningful position in HCV, another large and growing category. Our global launch of VIEKIRA, which
has been underway roughly three months, continues to perform within our expectations. As a reminder, the tracking
services do not capture all the sources of prescription data for VIEKIRA, including certain managed care organizations
and a number of government entities. When all sources are considered, VIEKIRA weekly prescriptions are tracking
well ahead of reported levels.
Our international launch is progressing faster than anticipated, and discussions with government payers in various
countries are underway and advancing rapidly. We're pleased with the pace of our progress internationally, which is
tracking ahead of our planning assumptions. This will lead to a higher level of international sales this year than we
originally expected. VIEKIRA will be a significant product for us, and we continue to expect an annualized run rate of
more than $3 billion in global sales by the end of 2015. Our current position will serve as a strong base from which we
will launch further enhancements and innovations.
Our next-generation HCV program continues to progress well. It is our goal with this program to bring to market a
ribavirin-free once-daily pan-genotypic combination. Our next-generation HCV program is generating promising early
SVR data. Earlier this month, we disclosed preliminary results from a 79 patient Phase 2b study of our next-generation
protease inhibitor, ABT-493, and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor, ABT-530. The interim data showed that
treatment with the two compounds in non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b patients receiving the ribavirin-free therapy for
12 weeks resulted in SVR4 rates of 99%. Full data from the Phase 2 studies will be presented at future medical
meetings.

Evaluation in other genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results. We're also evaluating shorter durations
of therapy with this combination, with data expected later this year. And we remain on track to advance our
next-generation HCV program into Phase 3 later this year, with commercialization expected in 2017. The HCV market
is significant, and we expect it will remain a large and attractive opportunity for many years to come.
Our immunology franchise represents another compelling growth platform for AbbVie. Clearly, we have established a
strong leadership position in the immunology market with HUMIRA, the world's leading anti-TNF. Behind HUMIRA
we have a rich pipeline of mid- and late-stage immunology assets in clinical development. This includes our two
selective JAK1 inhibitors currently in mid-stage development. As I mentioned, our partner, Galapagos, recently
announced promising top line 12-week data from the first of two Phase 2b studies in RA, supporting our thesis that
JAK1 specificity can drive high levels of efficacy while maintaining an appropriate safety profile. We look forward to
seeing additional data from the ongoing trials, as well as results from a mid-stage study of our internal JAK1 inhibitor,
ABT-494, as the year progresses.
We're also working to advance several other mid-stage immunology programs, including ABT-122, our anti-IL-17
TNF combination, and an anti-IL-6 Nanobody, among others. All of our R&D efforts are focused on advancing the
standard of care in each of our areas of immunology leadership. As we have said, we expect HUMIRA to continue to
drive strong growth and significant cash flow generation for many years. We have a multifaceted strategy in place,
which we believe will allow us to protect and grow our immunology position.
We have two new indications in late-stage development as well as a new formulation currently under regulatory review
in the U.S. and in Europe. We have a robust portfolio of intellectual property protecting HUMIRA, which we intend to
enforce if infringed by a biosimilar applicant. We have hundreds of patents globally covering the formulation,
manufacturing and indications for which HUMIRA's approved. As the first fully human monoclonal antibody
approved, the extensive clinical trial work, development and investment we undertook led us to many important
inventions with HUMIRA. We have important intellectual property covering these innovations, and we intend to
enforce this intellectual property.
And we recently received a commission decision in Europe regarding compliance with the pediatric investigation plan
for HUMIRA. With this decision, we will now apply for a six-month extension to our composition of matter patent,
extending the date for this key European patent from April 2018 to October 2018.
Beyond the pipeline assets I've already mentioned, we have a number of other compelling pipeline programs that have
potential to deliver significant peak year sales. All told, we have more than 40 active development programs underway,
spanning large and growing specialty categories. And our late-stage pipeline has been significantly de-risked as a result
of our ongoing clinical work, already demonstrating safety and efficacy.
This includes Zinbryta which, as I mentioned, is currently under U.S. and EMA regulatory review for relapsing
remitting multiple sclerosis; Elagolix, which is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b
for uterine fibroids; Atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in late-stage development for diabetic kidney
disease; and a number of other attractive assets in mid- to late-stage clinical trials.
We have a number of attractive growth platforms which sit within the context of a company that consistently generates
strong financial results and consistently meets financial commitments. We believe AbbVie has a unique investment
identity as we offer promising pipeline prospects along with strong growth and compelling shareholder returns. Our
business generates significant cash flow which we expect will grow in 2015 and beyond with new product
introductions.
To that end, earlier this year we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.51, beginning with the dividend payable in May.
This increase follows an increase of nearly 17% late last year. Since our inception as an independent company in 2013,
we've increased the dividend nearly 28%. We intend to maintain our strong commitment to a growing dividend going
forward. Additionally, we've utilized our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering
activities. We view these activities as an important component of our R&D strategy, and we expect to continue to
augment our pipeline in the coming years.

And finally, operating margin expansion is a key priority for AbbVie. We have initiatives in place to improve
efficiency across our operations, and we have delivered significant improvements in our operating margin profiles since
we launched in January 2013 to the current level today of just over 40%. We're forecasting additional improvements in
operating margin profile in 2015, reflecting these efforts as well as favorable leverage across our income statement and
we remain committed to improving this metric across our long-range plan.
In closing, since AbbVie became an independent company, we've been focused on executing our key strategic
priorities. We've established a strong track record, consistently exceeding our financial commitments, generating strong
shareholder returns and driving leading performance of HUMIRA and other products in our portfolio. We've also built
a promising late-stage pipeline, which will fuel our future growth, and we gained regulatory approval on several
important products and advanced many more. We've set a strong foundation for the company. The addition of
Pharmacyclics significantly strengthens our long-term growth prospects, positioning AbbVie for top tier growth
through the rest of the decade and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for some additional comments on the first quarter performance as well as our
second quarter outlook. Bill?
William J. Chase
Thank you, Rick. This morning, I'll review our first quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the
remainder of 2015. As Rick said, we're very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Reported sales were up
10.5% despite a challenging foreign exchange environment. Operational growth on the top line was a very strong
17.8%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.1 billion, up 26% on an operational basis. We continue to see
strong momentum from HUMIRA, with robust growth across categories, driving all-time high market share for the
brand.
U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 39.6%, driven primarily by prescription volume increases in excess of 20%, and
favorable pricing impacts. Wholesale inventory remained constant at fourth quarter 2014 levels of less than half a
month. International HUMIRA sales grew 14.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 14.6% unfavorable impact from
foreign exchange. As occurs periodically, the first quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select
markets. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the mid-teens on an operational
basis.
International sales of Synagis were $335 million in the quarter, up 8% on an operational basis. Synagis, which protects
at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease, is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth
quarters. We continue to expect 2015 Synagis sales growth to be similar to 2014 performance.
Global VIEKIRA sales in the first quarter were $231 million. In the U.S., many of our contracts have start dates in the
April and May timeframe, and we expect those to begin to ramp in the second and third quarters and build for the
remainder of the year. Our commercial efforts are focused on driving strong penetration in the AbbVie exclusive
accounts. We've been successful in this regard with our largest contract, which has been in place since the beginning of
the year.
Internationally, we've been able to secure reimbursement in many markets faster than we had originally anticipated. As
a result, as Rick indicated, we expect a higher mix of international sales this year than originally forecasted. Globally,
we continue to expect an annualized run rate of more than $3 billion in sales by the end of 2015.
Global Lupron sales were $192 million in the quarter, up 3.8% on an operational basis. For the full year 2015, we
expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014 sales. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $186 million, up 18.8% versus
the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2015, we expect Synthroid sales to be roughly flat from 2014 levels, in line with
market trends.
AndroGel sales were $153 million, down significantly due to continued market declines and the entry of generic
competition for the 1% formulation. As we've said previously, we expect AndroGel sales of less than $500 million for

the full year 2015. U.S. Creon sales were $127 million in the quarter, up 18.8%. We continue to capture the vast
majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market, and we expect double-digit sales growth for Creon
in 2015.
Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 19.5% on an operational basis in the quarter. We
expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. Our U.S. launch will be
getting underway in the second and third quarters, and as we've said previously, we anticipate a gradual ramp for
product sales in the U.S. this year as physicians grow familiar with the product.
The foreign exchange environment has clearly been challenging for our industry over the last few quarters and like our
peers, we saw a negative impact on our top line in the quarter as a result. While we are not completely immune from
currency swings, our global business structure and hedging actions we've taken will allow us to deliver our bottom line
commitments despite foreign exchange headwinds and protect shareholders from the negative impact. As a result of
this mitigation, we will see a favorable effect on our margin profile.
We showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. The adjusted gross
margin ratio was 82.9%, up 450 basis points from the prior-year quarter, driven by the effects of exchange, product mix
and operational efficiencies. Adjusted R&D was 16.1% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our mid- and
late-stage pipeline assets.
Adjusted SG&A was 26.7% of sales in the first quarter, down from the prior year, contributing to continued
improvement in operating margin leverage. The adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 40.1% of sales, up
620 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by product mix and
efficiencies. We are on track to deliver an operating margin profile in excess of 40% in 2015.
Adjusted net interest expense was $67 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted
earnings per share, excluding noncash amortization expense and specified items, were $0.94, up 32.4% year-over-year
and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.63.
As Rick communicated, this morning we increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2015 by $0.05.
Our adjusted EPS guidance range is now $4.10 to $4.30. This range reflects EPS growth of 23% to nearly 30%. The
increase in guidance is reflective of the strong underlying performance of the business that we see playing out this year,
and we have raised our outlook despite the increasingly negative impact from foreign exchange. We are now
forecasting roughly 7% negative top line impact from currency this year, which we have covered in our guidance
increase.
Our 2015 adjusted guidance range includes the previous communicated $0.20 dilutive impact of the Pharmacyclics
acquisition. It excludes $0.53 of amortization and specified costs, including Pharmacyclics' transaction costs booked in
the first quarter. We plan to communicate specific profile guidance for the combined company as well as the 2015
accounting impacts of the transaction on our second quarter call in July.
Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 to $1.06. This excludes roughly $0.09 of
specified items and noncash amortization and includes a modest amount of Pharmacyclics dilution based on a partial
quarter impact.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our outperformance in the first quarter and its impact on our full-year
projection. We have driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also
advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to deliver industry-leading growth this year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Congratulations on fantastic P&L
management this quarter. Rick, I heard during your opening comments you talked a little bit about your long-range
plans kind of qualitatively about operating margin improvement as part of your long-range plans. What I'd like to know
perhaps is are you willing or can you yet quantify where you see operating margins going over the medium to long
term? And if you can't do that today, which would be understandable, do you have plans to maybe schedule an analyst
meeting or some other venue at which you might communicate a long-range plan to investors?
And then also, can you comment on whether or not your assumption for operating margin improvement over the
medium to long term is or is not dependent on revenue? In other words, can you commit to your investor base that
AbbVie can and will expand its operating margin even if the top line were to come in below your internal expectations?
And obviously, there the focus would be the HUMIRA biosimilar erosion curve. Thanks so much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Good morning, Mark. This is Rick. Thanks for the question. I think probably the
best way to answer your question is to maybe talk for a few moments about the philosophy by which we manage the
business and how we think about investment and how we think about revenue and ultimately, how we try to deal with
changes in those dynamics. So let me start by saying I'm sure you understand that our business strategy is really
designed to maximize both short and long-term profitability of the business, giving shareholders strong returns and
strong value over that long period of time. That philosophy really plays out in how we look at investment decisions,
whether we're increasing investment or we're decreasing investment.
And what I'd say is this management team at AbbVie that came out of Abbott has always been disciplined in our
approach to resourcing opportunities as well as overall P&L management. We manage the business with the objective
of driving robust growth in both revenue and EPS, but at the same time improving operational efficiencies – and I think
you've seen some of that, and I'll talk more about that in a moment, and costs in order to maximize shareholder returns,
but again, short term and long term.
And the examples I would give you is this. I mean just take a look at what you've seen play out since we launched as a
new company. For example, our gross margin profile has improved from 76.2% in the first quarter of 2014 to 82.9%
this quarter. Additionally, if you look at despite building the infrastructure that was necessary to be an independent
public company, operating margin profile has improved from 33.7% in first quarter of 2014 to 40.1% in the most
current quarter. So we have delivered significant improvement in both of those metrics, and we're committed to
continuing to do that. And importantly, we delivered six points of operating margin profile improvement in the last four
quarters.
The other thing I'd say is we've recently seen a number of comparisons to various peer groups as it relates to AbbVie.
And I think it's important to recognize that no two companies are identical when it comes to product mix, geographic
coverage, the size of the market that they operate in, the brand's responsiveness to investment and many other factors.
And I realize it is tempting to do these macro comparisons and I would even agree to some extent that it's instructive at
some level, but I'll also tell you there are limitations and flaws in doing it.
I can tell you that we benchmark and compare ourselves to many companies, and we believe that we compare favorably
to most of our peers. Let me give you a couple of examples here. When you compare AbbVie to the other large cap
pharma peers, Bristol, Lilly, Merck, Pfizer, what you would see is the following: our gross margin profile is on average
approximately six points higher, our R&D profile on average is five points lower, our SG&A profile on average is three
points lower and our operating margin profile is about 13 points higher. Our geographic footprint is similar to many of
those peers, but our product mix is different. They have more primary care.

And when you compare AbbVie to the pure biotech peers, specifically Amgen, Biogen, Celgene, what you'd see is that
our gross margin profile is on average six points lower, and that's due to differences in the product mix. Our R&D
profile is approximately four points lower. Our SG&A profile is approximately five points higher, and that's driven by
geographic distribution of our revenues, especially the percentage of revenues that come from international sales. As
you probably know, it's about 45% for us, and many biotech companies have 70% of their revenues coming from the
U.S. And there are other anomalies that you have to be careful, such as some biotech companies have a definition of
adjusted SG&A that excludes the impact of equity-based compensation, which we include. And there are other
accounting differences as well.
So finally, when you compare to this group and you look at our operating margin profile, it's approximately seven
points lower as it exists today. But the conclusion of assuming that that's related to investment spending is not accurate.
In fact, I would tell you it's misleading. If you look at our total investment spending, R&D and SG&A, our investment
spending on a profile basis is slightly below those peer companies. The entire difference is in the gross margin profile,
because of the product mix, and we've shown significant improvement there with more to come, and we're committed
to deliver more. But that's the fundamental difference between those two peer groups.
And again, as we look at this data, it is instructive, and on balance, I'd tell you that based on the geographic footprint
that we have, that's larger than many biotech companies, the product mix and the investment in R&D and SG&A, the
analysis shows us that we're favorable to both of those peer groups. But in the end what really matters is what
investment decisions do you make in the business and what's the return that you ultimately get for them. Can you
maximize the short and the long-term value for the shareholder. And our philosophy is we invest in businesses and the
brands to maximize that value, meaning we increase investment when we can drive a strong return, and we reduce
investment when we can't or a product gets to the end of its life cycle.
And I would tell you that I believe we do both very well. And I'll give you an example of each. If you think about the
last two years, we have protected shareholder profitability the last two years as our $2.5 billion lipid franchise went
generic, and we did it by drastically reducing costs in that brand and other parts of the business. We're doing the same
thing right now on AndroGel. It's the obvious decision for us. I would just tell you, it's the culture that we have here.
Now let's take the opposite example of that, HUMIRA. HUMIRA's a complex business model. HUMIRA sales and
profit contributions come from a broad geographic footprint with about 40% of its sales coming from outside the
United States. HUMIRA has an unparalleled breadth of indications and we use a unique selling model for HUMIRA.
We utilize specialized and dedicated sales organizations for all major indications. We manage and invest in HUMIRA
to maximize its short- and its long-term value to the company and to our shareholders. And I think it's pretty hard to
argue with our success.
When we took the company public a little over two years ago, HUMIRA was a $9 billion product. Today, in 2015,
HUMIRA is a $14 billion product; $5 billion of growth in two-and-a-half years despite the foreign exchange
headwinds. The brand is 55% larger. If you take Enbrel and Remicade together, over that same period of time,
HUMIRA grew almost twice as much. So we think the performance speaks for itself. And I can tell you that based on
the performance, the strong potential for future continued growth, accelerating script trends in the U.S. and strong
international growth, cutting HUMIRA spending today is not a prudent long-term strategy for us.
And finally, I'd make two last points. We've been very clear that we're committed to driving strong, continued
improvement in operating margin profile. You saw that this quarter and we're going to drive further improvements in
2015 and across the long-range plan. Our goal is to drive strong growth and operate as efficiently as we possibly can to
maximize profitability. We're not going to make a prediction right now because we just made a significant acquisition
and we need to start to integrate that acquisition, and we will be in position to be able to communicate things after that.
Second, I'll get to the final part of your question, because I think what you're really trying to ask me is, if there were
some unforeseen surprise around HUMIRA, how would we react to that? So let me begin by saying the following, we
do not, in any way, expect that type of an event to happen. In fact, I tell you quite the contrary. We anticipate HUMIRA
will be a growth driver for us for many years, and our investment in new indications like HS and uveitis speak volumes
for our confidence.

However, to answer your question, if a bear scenario played out and threatened to materially impact the profit
contribution of HUMIRA, we would apply our investment philosophy in an appropriate manner. We would take
prompt and appropriate action to reduce our expense base accordingly with an eye to minimize the impact for the
investors. To us, as I said before, that's the obvious strategy. It's part of our responsibility to shareholders as
management.
As a new company, we have met or exceeded expectations in every quarter of our existence, including this quarter. We
take our responsibility to deliver on our commitments and our performance to shareholders very seriously. If we saw
any unforeseen event impact the business, we'd aggressively pursue actions to preserve profitability. That's part of the
culture and the commitment that we have. And in fact, I'd tell you we're doing that right now. We're protecting
shareholders against significant foreign exchange impact. And so that's the philosophy we run the business and,
hopefully, that's answered the question that you asked.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thanks for the very thorough answer. I really appreciate it, Rick. Look forward to more
communication after PCYC closes. Thank you.

<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Mark.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. And I don't want to beat a dead horse. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on
operating margins but, Rick or Bill, maybe you can just comment on our math here. I mean clearly we see the
improvements in gross margins and much of that will come from royalties going away on HUMIRA as R&D seems to
be in line with other large biotech peers. But SG&A seems to be where things appear to be a bit out of kilter.
If I do a bottoms-up analysis on HUMIRA, it would seem that it would be difficult to spend more than $1 billion,
maybe $1.5 billion if you really stretch it, so that leaves about $4 billion to $4.5 billion for the rest of the portfolio. And
when I look at the rest of the portfolio, I mean Synagis, Lupron, Synthroid, these are drugs that I don't think require
active promotion, and I can't imagine requires the multibillion dollars in expenses.
Obviously, there's other stuff thrown in there, but when I sort of bring it all back to where we started out here, it seems
that there's about $2 billion in excess spending. Can you comment on this? And is there anything structural that would
prevent you from eliminating that without really touching the HUMIRA spend? And just maybe another way to go
about this is that, is there anything structural that would impede you from achieving large cap biotech operating
margins, which in the next couple of years are forecasted to be in the low 50% range? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Well first, Jami, I disagree with your analysis on the investment expense because if I take
your own report and I add together the SG&A and the R&D spend for those three companies that I mentioned, we're
slightly below the total investment when you include SG&A and R&D. So it's a question of how you distribute your
investments. I'd say the second thing is, in many cases, we have a broader portfolio of products and a broader
geographic spread of our products than some of those companies do. Is there anything structural? No. There's nothing
structural. I mean obviously we have a geographic footprint that's much larger than many of those other companies. We
believe that's a competitive advantage.
As far as HUMIRA spending is concerned, we obviously do bottoms-up budgeting every single year. We justify what
we're going to spend. I would tell you that the selling model that we have is somewhat unique in the industry, but I'd
also tell you that the performance that it's delivering is unique as well. And products don't sell themselves. And so at
the end of the day we believe we're getting a good return out of the investment that we're making. And we're balancing
our ability to be able to perform and invest long term as well as short term to give a good return. And we make tweaks
all the time.

I'd also say that when you look at some of those brands, the broad conclusion that they don't require promotion is not an
accurate conclusion. Lupron has promotional activities associated, as an example, with it. And so generally speaking
what I would say is that there's nothing structural that would cause us not to be able to make significant changes and I
as I mentioned in my comments to Mark, if we were in a situation were ultimately that was something that we believe
was in the best long term interest of shareholders then we would make that change.
But we're certainly not in that position now. If you look at our performance this quarter, we're growing rapidly. We
expect to continue to grow. We have a number of pipeline drugs that we believe will be approved over the course of the
next two years. We're certainly going to put ourselves in a position to be able to launch those drugs and be effective,
and we're going to balance the investment we're making in other areas against that investment to try to be as efficient as
possible. And we believe that is the appropriate way to run the business. And we don't believe it is appropriate to try to
hit some margin target, of whatever the number is, by cutting R&D or productive SG&A. We don't think that's in the
long-term interest of the shareholders.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jami.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks very much. I've got three questions. The first is just a very short one. Just wonder if
you can comment a bit more in term of the gross margin uplift you've had there? Just give us a bit more break down in
terms of what was mix, what was efficiency and what was FX. Second, I wonder if you could just maybe comment
around, there's been quite a few experts speaking around patents on HUMIRA, really focusing on dosing and
formulation patents specifically and potential weaknesses there. Would you say that that's the key area of the IP
portfolio to focus on? Or are there potentially other stronger areas that aren't being discussed? And then lastly, also on
IP, I wonder if you can talk to any of the IP that you have in the area of Alzheimer's, [indiscernible] (44:08) antibodies,
and just tell us a little bit more around that. Thanks very much.
<A - William J. Chase>: So Jeff, its Bill Chase. I'll start with your gross margin question. I'm actually going to expand
it to operating margin as well, because exchange impacts those profile metrics differently. So on the gross margin basis,
exchange made up a little bit over half of the improvement in the quarter. The remainder was product mix and
efficiency, and I'd say you could split those, the remainder two-thirds, one-third. On the operating margin line where
exchange has less of an effect what we saw was about a one third impact of exchange and the rest being leverage on the
P&L product mix and efficiencies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thank you.
<A - Laura J. Schumacher>: This is Laura. I'll take the question on IP. As we've said before, we have a robust
portfolio of IP that covers a wide variety of patents including manufacturing patents, formulation patents, process
patents and patents that cover virtually every indication for which HUMIRA is currently approved. We think these
patents have a very broad applicability to any bio-similar application, and the earliest of these patents expires in 2022.
When thinking about these patents, it's important to note that HUMIRA was the first fully human monoclonal antibody
as such little was known about how to use fully human monoclonal antibodies, and the work that we did in the area was
foundational. Collectively, we think these patents were the subject of extensive prosecution in the patent and trademark
office over nearly a decade, and we think, given the innovative nature of our work and the rigorous prosecution, that
the patents are strong and will withstand challenge.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And then who wants to talk about the Alzheimer's IP?
<A - Michael E. Severino>: So, with respect to IP – this is Mike Severino – with respect to IP in Alzheimer's disease,
we're active from a research perspective in a wide range of areas and we're active in neuroscience as well, and that

work generates IP. It's done so in the past, and it will continue to do so in the future. So I think you'll see us continue to
pursue research activities in this area over time.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Yeah. We just haven't provided a lot of detail there yet, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. On the VIEKIRA overseas, can you give us a sense of what countries the growth came
from? And just what new countries are coming on so we can get a sense of the geographical mix there. And then you
mentioned Atrasentan, can you just give us an update on that product? We haven't talked about that in a while. Where
is it? When are we going to see data? And then the third question is why are there still such significant separation costs
that you are excluding from the numbers, given that we're a couple years out from the separation from Abbott? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. This is Rick. So I'll talk a little bit about the international roll out. You know
obviously we've launched in a number of European countries and a number of other select countries outside of Europe.
Germany is a good example of one that has gotten significant uptake. But you'll see Italy coming online, Spain has
come online, a number of other ones have come online, so it's the major European countries that you expect to be the
greatest value. And then we're assuming Japan we'll see in the fourth quarter as well.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: This is Mike Severino. With respect to Atrasentan status, that's our molecule that's being
studied in diabetic nephropathy. That is progressing well; it's in the Phase 3 study. That's an outcome study and it's
event driven, so it's hard to make exact predictions about when it will read out, but I think it – those data will continue
to mature over the next few years and so I think you can expect to hear more from it in that timeframe.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: I think it is fair to say though because it's an outcome-driven trial, this trial will take a
significant period of time to hit the number of events based on the endpoint that we've assumed.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Yeah that's correct.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Yeah, several years.
<A - William J. Chase>: And then Marc, on separation expenses. When we separated from Abbott, we operated under
a number of transition service agreements. They generally had a two to three-year timeline. The majority of those we're
off of with the exception of two large ones, and that had to do with the rollout of the existing back office in Abbott and
how quickly we could create a new back office and we've made great progress on that rolling out a very efficient shared
outsourced model, but we're not completely done with that. We'll be done at midpoint of this year. The other major
initiative as you can imagine is disentangling the IT environment and infrastructure in general is extremely complex
and that will be done by the third quarter. And those are the majority of the costs you're still seeing coming through.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Marc.

<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Rick or Laura, the HUMIRA intellectual property that you referred to, will that protect you against
biosimilars manufactured outside the U.S.? In other words, are there ways for biosimilar companies to circumvent
those patents with ex-U.S. manufacturing? And second question on HUMIRA. The U.S. growth is truly impressive.
You mentioned I think all-time peak market shares. Could you put some numbers around those market shares in major
indications? And then finally on hep C, why did you exclude cirrhotics in your Phase 2, and will you have cirrhotic
data later this year? Thank you.
<A - Laura J. Schumacher>: I'll take the IP question first. With respect to the IP, the patents that I'm talking about
broadly are global patents. So we have global patents covering manufacturing and process. The specific indication
patents that I referenced are U.S. patents. We have patents pending outside the U.S. right now. Those patents have not
issued yet, but we think the portfolio we have is very broad and we think that we will have some protection outside the
United States as far as certainly manufacturing process and formulation.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: In terms of market share, Alex, let me give you just a quick snapshot. Rheumatology
we've got about a roughly 25% share right now, in dermatology it's approaching a 40% share, and in the gastro space
it's kind of around 45% market share for us. So a very strong market share.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: So this is Mike Severino. With respect to our next generation HCV program, I think
you're referring to comments we made about a 99% SVR4 response rate in genotype 1 non-cirrhotic patients. Those are
simply the first data that we have available. We have not excluded cirrhotic patients from our Phase 2 program. You'll
see our Phase 2 program continue to mature over the course of this year, and we'll be providing updates as appropriate.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: All right. Thanks, Alex. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah thanks for taking the questions. So just a couple more on the hep C side. One, can you
just share your kind of internal sense of the market share breakdown right now? It's obviously a tougher market than
usual for us to kind of see from the outside. But between yourselves and Gilead, any color there in terms of the
breakdown would be helpful. And then in terms of the next-gen, we're seeing some good data over here at EASL this
week from competitors. How do you think about the duration there? Does yours need to be an eight week regimen? Are
you looking at maybe even potentially shorter than that? How do you think about that given what the competitors are
showing over here?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. This is Rick. I'll cover the market share piece. So we're obviously still pretty early
on into the launch. We're three or four months into the launch, and maybe the easiest way to characterize it is this. If
you actually look, I'm going to give you a slightly different number than we've given you in the past because it'll relate
better to the overall market shares, so if you look at what we have under contract, now, in preferred or exclusive
contracts total. In other words, there's still a percentage of covered lives that have not contracted yet, and that
percentage actually has stayed pretty constant for the last 30 or 45 days, so that's why I'm going to give you a total
market share. You'd say that we have about 21% of the market that's under contract as a preferred agent within those
accounts. The vast majority of those have come online roughly in the March timeframe. They're actually spread from
March, April, May.
Obviously, ESI came on early on and we've now demonstrated within the exclusives that we've been in, for 90 days,
that we're able to achieve high share. But ultimately, what will deliver the overall share in the U.S. market will be
ramping up in these other preferred or exclusive accounts, and we're not going to be able to see that data probably for
another 90 days or so, as they come online and we ramp. So I think the best way to think about the U.S., just
qualitatively, would be that you'll see essentially this lighter ramp in the first half of the year for the U.S. and a faster
ramp in the second half of the year.

Page 13 of 16
And then the parity accounts, obviously, we've had a number of those under contract and we're ramping there. They're
not ramping as high as the exclusive accounts did, and so the blended share will be determined. It's really too early, I
think, to give you a prediction yet, but within 90 days or so, I think we'll be in a better position to be able to predict
that. But it will be a blended share between what we're able to drive in these preferred accounts, the level we get in
parity accounts, and then, obviously, in the areas where HARVONI is contraindicated, we're getting some share out of
their exclusive accounts, and it would be the blend of all of those. But now I'd say, you should be thinking about it in
the teens right now, low end of the teens, but should ramp from there.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: All right. This is Mike Severino. With respect to data coming out of EASL, and
short-course therapy in the future for hep C, I think it's still a bit early to say where various regimens around the
industry are going to sort out with respect to treatment duration. We've seen hints that six weeks may be possible, but
those have sort of come and gone in the past, and I think we're going to need more data to know where treatment
durations will really sort out over the next few years. What we do know is that it's very important to have high response
rates, very high cure rates and I don't personally believe that people will be willing to sacrifice a lot, in terms of cure
rates, to shave, for example, two weeks off of treatment duration, and that's certainly the philosophy that we're taking.
So I think those data will continue to evolve and we'll keep a close eye on them.
With respect to our next-generation program, we are going to study eight weeks and we'll go where the data take us.
We'll go as short as we think the data support, again, while maintaining those very high cure rates. So I think when I
look at all the data coming out of EASL, I still see our regimen as very, very competitive and I think treatment
durations that we are exploring are going to be appropriate for the landscape that we see out there in three to five years
and beyond.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Vamil. And we'll take our next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have a few questions. On the January call, AbbVie said it would provide more
specific guidance on 2015 VIEKIRA sales expectations as the year unfolds. What uncertainties still exist, such that a
single point full year guidance number is not being provided now? So that's the first question. Second question is I
thought both the ABT-199 17p deletion and Elotuzumab readouts were supposed to be in early 2015. What does it
imply that the data is not yet available? And then lastly, what has been the tone and the substance of your conversations
with partners J&J with Ibrutinib and Roche with ABT-199 post the news of the Pharmacyclics acquisition? It would
seem that there could be some issues and/or concerns and I'm just wondering if that's the case? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay, this is Rick. I'll take the guidance question. It's specifically two things. It's what I
just mentioned a moment ago that many of these exclusive accounts are just now coming on, and if we look at our
experience in the earlier ones it has taken about 90 days to get to peak share. And so we need to make sure that we can
demonstrate that level of share in those accounts to be able to give you an accurate prediction because obviously that
drives a significant part of the share and the volume. And then the second thing is it's this issue that we described
before and that is clearly we are having greater success than we had planned in the international markets, and so the
mix is different than what we expected in our original planning process.
And so we need more time to see that roll out and that's gated based on how you get reimbursement in those countries.
So we don't want to give you an inaccurate number and we want to see it play out a little bit longer. But what we do
know is we feel confident that we should be able to hit the greater than $3 billion run rate by the end of the year, and
we've looked at that carefully and we've re-communicated that. When we're at a point that we feel comfortable that we
can give you a full-year estimate, we'll provide that to you.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: So this is Mike Severino. With respect to Elotuzumab and ABT-199, specifically the 17p
del data, the question if I can paraphrase is are we on track and when can we see more data from these programs. We

are on track with both programs. Elotuzumab you'll see an update at ASCO. So that's in the very near future.
With ABT-199 and 17p del, we're on track. We are working with the data. Recall that this is an open-label study, so
we're working with the data. And what we see is consistent with our expectations. We'll look for an appropriate venue
and timeframe to share details of those data externally, but we continue to have confidence in that molecule and have a
view towards a regulatory submission later on this year.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And on the partner aspect of it, I mean first let me start with J&J. Obviously
Pharmacyclics is an independent company right now, and the relationship that they have with J&J is not something that
we can interfere with or be directly involved in. We've had communication with J&J. It's been very, very positive.
We've worked with J&J in other aspects of relationships that we've had in our prior experience with Abbott, and they're
a fine company. I think the relationship will work extremely well. I'd make similar comments about Roche. I think
Roche, Genentech we've had very good relationships with and we don't anticipate any challenges in managing our way
through this relationship between the two partners.

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for slipping me in. I guess two questions, I guess for Rick. So first of all,
I guess are you opposed to an analyst day just to help us understand in greater depth your rationale behind the
confidence in HUMIRA, how you run your business? And the second question is, I appreciate that you're confident in
your HUMIRA business, but when you talk about a disaster scenario, what is that for you? Is that a launch of a
biosimilar or is that massive share loss? And do you run your business like that is the possibility or do you run your
business like we are so confident in HUMIRA that it's something we're not really worried about? Just trying to
understand how you run your business versus your confidence. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Two good questions. Thank you. So the analyst day, we have kicked around the
idea of an analyst day. We may do something post-closing Pharmacyclics, so it's obviously something we need to plan
for and not only be able to talk about the other aspects of the business but talk about our Oncology strategy in more
detail. So I would stay tuned on that and we think there are a number of things that we can communicate; kind of the
summer or fall kind of timeframe I think would be the most appropriate time. And others have suggested similar
suggestions to us about doing an analyst day, so that is something we're considering.
What I would tell you on the HUMIRA situation, it is not the launch of a biosimilar. Obviously we have a strategy in
place that we believe will allow us to continue to drive strong performance out of HUMIRA post a launch of a
biosimilar. But what I would tell you is we obviously have contingency plans that we have in place that we would pull
the trigger on. Remember, it's going to be not just one single launch, right, because HUMIRA is sold all around the
world. So there'll be different countries, obviously the U.S. is a significant part of that and the major European
countries are another significant part of it, but we would be evaluating every single country on an ongoing basis and we
would make a determination.
And I'd say the disaster scenario for us would be that ultimately we were significantly unable to achieve the objective
that we built into our long-range plan. We've obviously built into the plan expectations of how we would deal with any
price erosion that might occur, any share erosion that might occur, and then we have a contingency plan that basically
would be built around missing that particular set of assumptions. And you wouldn't pull it all at once, you'd basically
start to titrate if you were missing in a way to be able to offset or mitigate any financial impact versus what you had
planned for. And so I think that's the way to think about it.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: That's really helpful. Thank you.

<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Robyn. Our next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great. Thanks for the questions. First one was just on HUMIRA, was just
interested in your perspective and how you're thinking about the biosimilar Remicade launch in Europe this year. I
guess what are you expecting there in terms of uptake? And how should we think about this launch as a comp that if a
biosimilar HUMIRA was to enter the market in Europe, let's say in late 2018, is the Remicade biosimilar ramp
something that we should think about as a reasonable comparison there?
Second question was on leverage and business development priorities post PCYC. What is the sense of urgency at this
point to add or build upon existing growth verticals with further in-market product acquisitions post this deal? Is that
still a priority or should we think about AbbVie kind of coming back to focusing on some of these earlier stage, more
R&D-focused transactions going forward? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Thank you. So on HUMIRA and the Remicade biosimilar launch expanding
beyond the countries that it's been in now for a couple of years, what I'd say is we've been watching these launches
carefully in the countries that they've been in for some period of time. If you look at those countries, relatively modest
share has been achieved by the biosimilar product in most of those countries and it's well within the expectations of
what we would have assumed.
We're watching the competitive response and learning from how that competitive response works, and I'd say, so far,
that's been consistent with what we would have expected from a pricing standpoint and a strategy standpoint. And so
within the countries we're in now, where we're seeing these launches, I can tell you HUMIRA is not impacted. We're
continuing to grow patient share within those countries. And so there certainly isn't any direct impact on HUMIRA
within those countries where we see it today.
Is it a good metric in order to measure what we could expect with HUMIRA? I think that's probably a little bit difficult
to judge because, again, it all boils down to your position in the marketplace. And I'd also say that the European market
and international markets are different than the U.S. market for a number of different reasons. And so if you were to
assume that a HUMIRA biosimilar would be in the U.S. prior to the international markets, then I'd say it's not a good
surrogate at all to look at because I think the U.S. will be a very different kind of competitive situation. And again, I
think even in the European markets, each product is positioned a little bit differently within the market, and it boils
down to, how does the competitive response handle the launch of that product? So that one's a little tougher for me to
answer, but I'd say for right now, it's tracking the way we would have expected it to be.
On the BD priorities post-deal, if I understand the question correctly, are we looking to go out and find another large
growth platform? The answer is no. We've obviously made a significant commitment here with the acquisition of
Pharmacyclics, and it positions us well in this sector. And ultimately, it was a platform play for us and it's a platform
play that we would assume that we needed or wanted going forward. So now I think you will see us go back to a
similar kind of strategy that we had before, which is more looking for individual products that we can build out the
areas that we have specific therapeutic interest in, like immunology, like virology, like oncology, and continuing to add
on to that, potentially some tuck-in kinds of acquisitions, smaller acquisitions to add to it, but more of what you've seen
from us in the past.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Chris. And operator, we have time for one more question, please.

Thank you. Our final question today is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just to piggyback on Vamil's question, we're
seeing a new datasets emerge from Gilead at EASL. I was just curious how do you see VIEKIRA PAK competitively
positioned as we move into 2016 given this intensifying competitive landscape? And then another one on hep C; there's
been some discussion in the hep C community that real-world realized cure rates for VIEKIRA PAK could be a greater
delta to those seen in clinical trials versus HARVONI given the complex regimen. I'd love to get your feedback here
based on your experience so far. And then just one quick one on IMBRUVICA, where one of your peers recently
entered into a partnership with a BTK inhibitor for autoimmune conditions including RA; is this something you plan to
pursue with IMBRUVICA? Thanks.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Okay. So with respect to EASL, we continue to feel confident that VIEKIRA PAK will
provide competitive efficacy in the timeframe that you're describing in the 2016 timeframe and beyond. Recall that
cure rates with VIEKIRA are very high and that the regimen's been well tolerated. And we don't see major shifts for
example in duration of therapy in the timeframe that you were describing that would change that picture in any
meaningful way. Of course over the longer term, we have our own next generation program, which I talked about a
little bit earlier in this call, which will continue to drive innovation in this space. And so we feel good about our
presence in hep C today, and we'll continue to do so over the years that follow.
With respect to real world cure rates with VIEKIRA PAK, that doesn't match our experience, and so I really can't
comment on that report. Our real world experience is actually quite good with respect to adherence to the regimen and
therefore realizing the sort of cure rates that have been demonstrated in clinical trials.
With respect to IMBRUVICA with BTK inhibition in autoimmune disorders, obviously that's something that has been
a focus of research for a number of companies, including ourselves. It's something we'll continue to investigate. I think
we will be positioned very well to pursue that aggressively given our extensive experience in immunology and
post-close, given PCYC's experience in BTK inhibition. So it's certainly something that we would keep a close eye on,
something that we would pursue.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Thank you.
