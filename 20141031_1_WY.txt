I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Denise. Welcome, everyone, and Happy Halloween. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results
in each of our businesses as our employees continue to drive sustainable performance improvements through relentless
execution of our operational excellence initiatives. Net earnings for the quarter totaled approximately $1.15 billion or
$2.15 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.9 billion. This includes a gain of approximately
$970 million related to the July 7 divestiture of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.
Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $178 million or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase of
almost 31% compared with the year-ago quarter.
Special items for the third quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to a postretirement health plan, and
restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. I will begin the discussion of our business results with
some brief comments about market conditions.
Housing starts continued to improve in the third quarter but at a measured pace. We now anticipate approximately 1
million housing starts for 2014. We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen, supported by
employment growth and increasing consumer confidence. We're also encouraged by changes recently proposed by the
Federal Housing Finance Agency that would improve mortgage credit availability.
Looking forward to 2015, our outlook is in line with consensus forecast, which anticipate 1.1 million to 1.2 million
housing starts and an accelerated single-family recovery.
Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $136
million to third quarter earnings compared with $170 million in the second quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes
declined as we intentionally accelerated harvest during early 2014 in anticipation of lower price realizations in the third
quarter.
Realization for Western logs declined due to normal seasonal increases in domestic supply and softer Asian markets.
Inventory to Chinese ports, although down from their peak, are still elevated and takeaway remains below normal
levels. Sales volumes to Japan increased due to timing of shipments.
Our Longview Timber acquisition contributed $36 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and remains on track to
achieve our 2014 target of $175 million to $185 million of EBITDA. In the South, fee harvest volumes increased due to
improved weather conditions. Average realizations for Southern logs rose slightly compared with the second quarter.
Third quarter earnings included $19 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, a decrease of $5 million
compared with second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives to optimize truck scheduling, road construction and
maintenance, and silviculture practices contributed to Timberlands' strong performance in the quarter.
Wood Products, chart 6 and 7. Wood Products earned $105 million in the third quarter, a slight improvement compared
with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $135 million. In lumber, EBITDA improved by $8 million compared
with the second quarter. Average price realizations improved approximately 1% as higher realizations for narrow
lumber were partially offset by lower prices for wide-dimension lumber.
Log costs for our Western mills declined and operating rates fell slightly. This business continues to implement
operational excellence initiatives focused on reducing manufacturing costs net of logs. In OSB, EBITDA decreased by
$3 million compared with second quarter as the decline in average realizations was partially offset by lower
manufacturing costs. This business remains focused on lowering costs, improving operating reliability, and increasing
sales of higher value products.

Engineered wood products reported third quarter EBITDA of $27 million, a slight decrease compared with the second
quarter. Average sales realizations improved for solid section products and TJI joists as we captured the value of our
announced second quarter price increase and benefited from a favorable sales mix. These improvements were offset by
lower sales volumes across most product lines as second quarter included pre-buying in advance of the price increase
and customers manage inventories tightly during the third quarter.
The distribution business reported EBITDA of $5 million in the third quarter, an improvement of $2 million. This
business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs. Our engineered wood products and distribution
businesses continued to make strong progress against their operational excellence targets and we remain confident that
both of these businesses will improve EBITDA by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 compared with 2013.
Cellulose Fibers, chart 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $59 million to earnings, down from $91 million in the
second quarter. Fluff pulp markets remains strong through the third quarter and average realizations for pulp and liquid
packaging board increased. This was offset by substantially higher maintenance costs due to a scheduled increase in
maintenance outage days within the pulp mill system, and an extended planned outage at our liquid packaging board
facility. Our liquid packaging board facility restarted in early October and is running well following the safe and
successful completion of several maintenance and capital projects. The Cellulose Fiber business continues to
demonstrate excellent operational performance.
Let me now switch gears briefly to SG&A and other matters. Our SG&A initiative remains on track, and I'm highly
confident we will achieve our $70 million run rate reduction target by year-end.
On August 13, our board of directors approved a 32% increase in our quarterly dividend and authorized a $700 million
share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 19% of that authorization. Our foremost
priority for capital allocation is returning cash to shareholders, and these actions demonstrate that commitment.
Also in August, we announced we will move our corporate headquarters from Federal Way, Washington, to Seattle.
We expect the move to occur in mid- to late-2016 when construction of our new lease building will be complete.
Although our existing campus has served us very well over the years, it is too large and too costly for our current needs.
Our move to Seattle is an important step forward and will help position Weyerhaeuser for future success.
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the fourth quarter is on chart 11. I'll begin my comment
with Timberlands. Starting with log exports in the West. Log inventories at Chinese ports are still at elevated levels,
which will likely result in somewhat lower sales volume to China this quarter. We also expect lower sales volumes to
Japan primarily as a result of timing of shipments and realization for our Japanese exports are expected to increase
modestly due to mix. Sales realizations for domestic logs in the west are expected to increase compared to the third
quarter.
In the South, we anticipate volumes will increase slightly with flat pricing. Silviculture costs are expected to increase
seasonally. Earnings from non-strategic timberlands sales and miscellaneous items are anticipated to be approximately
$15 million lower in Q4 compared to Q3, primarily as a result of timing. Excluding these items, we expect fourth
quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter.
In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal
slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes across all product lines. Average sales realizations for both lumber and OSB
are expected to weaken relative to the third quarter. Log costs are anticipated to increase somewhat with seasonal
inventory build and weather-related restriction.
Production volumes in the fourth quarter will decrease due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete
maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per unit manufacturing costs. Consistent with the

normal seasonal pattern, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third
quarter and likely comparable to the fourth quarter of last year.
Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. Worldwide inventories for soft wood pulp at the end of the third quarter were at 27
days, slightly below normal level. Demand for our products continues to be strong, especially for our fluff pulp, and we
expect mostly pricing to be stable in the fourth quarter. Sales realizations for liquid packaging board are expected to be
somewhat lower due to grade mix, and fiber costs are expected to be higher. Total maintenance expense for this
segment will be much lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
As I discussed on our last quarter call, we had an extended planned shutdown at our Longview operation during the
third quarter for maintenance and installation of capital equipment. We had a very successful startup of the mill, which
was completed during the first week of this month. The mill is running well and customer response has been very
positive.
During the fourth quarter, we planned only one mill down for maintenance. That shutdown was completed earlier this
month and that mill is also back up and running well. We expect earnings on our Cellulose Fibers segment to be
significantly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third.
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. As shown on chart 12, during the third quarter, we invested
approximately $112 million in capital expenditures in our businesses. This brings our year-to-date expenditures through
the third quarter to $271 million and we still estimate total expenditures for the year, including reforestation, to be
approximately $400 million.
As reported earlier, we completed the divestiture of our homebuilding business in early July. As a result of the
transaction, we retired approximately 59 million shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of over $700
million during the third quarter. These proceeds, combined with strong cash flow from operations during the quarter,
resulted in a cash balance of approximately $1.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter.
Chart 13 details significant actions we are taking to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In
August, the board increased our quarterly cash dividend by 32% to $0.29 per share or $1.16 on an annual basis. Based
on the closing stock price at the end of the third quarter, that equates to a 3.6% yield. In August, the board also
authorized a $700 million share repurchase program.
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares using approximately $130 million at an
average price of $33.63. As a result of the WRECO divestiture and the share repurchase program, we reduced our
outstanding share count during the quarter by over 10%.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. As many of you have heard me say over the past few months, we are relentlessly focused on
performance and capital allocation to grow shareholder value. The pace with which we have begun to execute our share
repurchase program illustrates our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Through our operational excellence
initiatives, we remained focused on driving performance to sustainably grow earnings and cash flow and deliver
additional value to our shareholders.
And now, I'd like to open this up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Just a question on Wood Products. If I look year-to-date, it seems like your third-party sales
volumes in lumber and OSB are sort of flat with the first three quarters of 2013. And if I think that housing starts are
growing and maybe your operating rates are in the [ph] low-90s (15:41) and you have maybe some room to ratchet
them up. Is there a reason that your volumes in lumber specifically aren't up more year-over-year and, by that same
token, if we do 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts next year, would you expect your volumes to be up in 2015 by a decent
amount?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Anthony, as we look at our volumes for lumber, I think year-to-date – based on
year-to-date, we were pretty flat, as you said. But I think that the third quarter, we probably produced a little bit less
than what we thought we would. And as we look at 2015, I think that we have the ability to increase with the market,
which, as Doyle said, we don't have a real robust outlook for housing starts, although they will continue to improve as
we move forward.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay, okay. And then, Doyle, last week, one of your competitors in fluff pulp said it was
exploring the possibility of putting their mill system in an MLP structure, and I was wondering obviously,
Weyerhaeuser is a REIT and the Cellulose Fibers business is in TRS. But is the MLP angle something that you've
looked at? Or do you have any thoughts you can share on whether the structure might ultimately be appropriate for
Cellulose Fibers?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. And that, Anthony, is something we have looked at. And I'll ask Patty to give a little bit
more color on that because she's coordinating that effort for us.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Anthony. We are actively looking at the applicability of the structure. As
you know, there are a number of uncertainties and not the least of those is the fact that the IRS has put on pause issuing
any additional private letter rulings until they've completed a thorough review of the MLP structure overall. We don't
have clarity on when that will be, but we do continue to monitor the situation. And if we think it will add value, we'll
move forward with our review. We have consulted our advisors and we've included their input into our review.
As you probably know, a number of years ago, there was a private letter ruling for pulp, but private letter rulings are
fact-specific, and technically, it can only relied on by the taxpayer that's making that particular application. And given
the fact that the IRS is now undertaking an in-depth review, we don't think it would be prudent to move forward
without a ruling. And so, we're sort of on pause waiting to see what happens. We haven't made any decisions one way
or the other, but we'll continue to monitor the situation.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.

<Q - Mark Wilde>: Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Doyle, the progress that you're making in these Wood Products business is pretty impressive. I
wondered if you could give us a sense of where you think the gains are coming from. Is it kind of better – commercial
performance, just better operating performance, reduced costs, and where you think you are on sort of a scale of 1 to 10

in terms of optimizing those wood businesses?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Mark, thanks for that comments. And there's a lot of really good work going on in our
Wood Products businesses. In terms of the progress, we're making – as we've identified in – starting with lumber – we
said that we think there's a $100 million opportunity there. And as we've previously said, we'll think we'll get $30
million to $40 million of that in 2014. And then part of what we're going to be doing on December 9, Mark, on our
Investor Day is being laying out more details of what we think the opportunity is and the timing is in that business and
our others going forward.
In OSB, similarly, we've made some progress there, more work to do. But again, we've identified $50 million to $60
million of operational excellence opportunities and more work to do there. We will get $5 million to $10 million of
that, we believe, in 2014.
In ELP and distribution where we had, in my opinion, and I think most people's opinion, the biggest opportunity to
improve. As I said in my comments, very encouraged by the progress we're making in both of those businesses. And
we believe we're going to improve despite not great housing starts. We think we're going to improve both the EBITDA
in both of those businesses by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013 and we are on track to do that.
I would tell you, Mark, to your exact question, there's still a lot of work to do in both of those businesses and
opportunities. The $30 million to $40 million, the way we think about it, proves that we – or shows that we've earned
the right to be in those businesses. And our next step is to show that we can win in those businesses, and part of
winning, of course, is earning above cost of capital over the cycle.
So good progress there, very encouraged by all the hard work that our employees done, but still a lot of work to do in
both of our ELP and distribution businesses.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And if I could, as a follow on, just for Patty, even if we assume the rest of the share
repurchase were to happen in the fourth quarter, it still looks like you're going to be sitting on over $1 billion of cash.
Can you talk to us about how much cash you want to carry going forward and just thoughts on the use of that residual
cash?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Mark. In terms of how much cash we carry, it's a function of where we are in the
cycle. We'll use some cash in the first quarter – at least we hope to use some cash in the first quarter to build some
working capital as housing recovers, so that's one place that we're looking. We're also are continuing to utilize the share
repurchase, as you said, as we look at capital allocation. Our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost, has
been returning cash to shareholders. We increased the dividend as we've talked about, continuing to execute on that
share repurchase. And then, we'll also be investing in our businesses, in our capital expenditure program.
We'll give you a little more color on that when we get to our December Investor Day and then certainly on our earnings
call for the fourth quarter. I would expect that maybe a little higher than this current year, not huge magnitude. And
then, obviously, as we said before, we're looking to grow our businesses in a disciplined way. Our first priority there
would be in Timberlands but, as you know, imperative has to grow. So we're being very disciplined about looking at all
areas where we would utilize that cash.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: In addition, we do have the credit line that doesn't expire until September of 2018, $1
billion that has not been utilized to this point. So we really feel very good about our opportunities to continue to
provide value to shareholders as we go forward. So [indiscernible] (23:14).
<Q - Mark Wilde>: That's helpful, Patty. I'll drop back in the queue. Thanks.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Good morning, Doyle. I guess my first question, maybe this is under the category of no
good deed goes unpunished. I mean, you've done quite well in Wood Products; Mark was noting that in his Q&A.
If we look at slide 7 of your deck, we generally see product prices that are flat to higher on average than where they
were last year, OSB maybe being an exception there. We know the progress that you're making in cost reductions and
operational excellence. So, just curious, why – if I heard you correctly, fourth quarter guidance and EBIT for Wood
will be flat year-on-year, not to mentioning the progress you've already made this year-to-date. And then I had a couple
of follow-ons.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: George, I would say just from a seasonal perspective, as you know, the fourth quarter is the
slowest seasonal period. So, that's going to have some impact on our performance in the fourth quarter versus the third
quarter.
If you look year-over-year, we have made improvements as you said. And a part of the year-over-year will be impacted
by sales realizations. It remains to be seen what happens in the quarter. I will tell you, currently, lumber prices are
down roughly $10 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, OSB down roughly $5 in the fourth quarter versus the
third quarter. But part of it, of course, will be if you look at pricing on the chart that you referred to, specifically in
OSB, if you look at it year-over-year levels, pricing will be down fairly significantly in OSB fourth quarter of 2014
versus fourth quarter of 2013. So, we'll see how that plays out for the balance of the year, but that's the biggest driver of
what's going on.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. And that's fair. We appreciate the thought. If we switch gears a little bit but still
within Wood Products, and I recognize again, this is probably going to be something you talk more about in detail on
December 9. Can you give us a little bit of a flavor in terms of what kinds of investments you're making within the
mills? Is it similar to what you did at your former shop in terms of automation and improvement of yield? Can you give
us a little bit more color there?
And then my follow on, and I'll turn it over, again, you're clearly getting improvement in SG&A, at least in terms of the
numbers that we are seeing across the segments. Do you worry at all that with the cost reductions, and you're on target
for your $75 million, at some point in time that begins to impact negatively your ability to be commercially more
effective within Wood Products, i.e., cut a little bit too much on the cost side, cut into the bone. Thanks guys. I'll turn it
over.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thanks, George, for the questions. So in terms of what we're doing in investment in our
Wood Products businesses, George, those are specific investments that will be made to lower our costs. This is proven
technology that's in place in some of our mills and we will be extending that to additional mills. But again, the key
focus is on investments, improving technology that are focused on lowering costs, this is technology that we are
comfortable with, we know how to put it in, and are confident as we implement these capital expenditures that we will
ultimately get the cost reduction associated with it.
In terms of the SG&A, as I said earlier, we are on track to achieve the $75 million cost reduction initiatives in SG&A.
With that said, I'm not worried at all about that cutting into the bone, as you said, in Wood Products. These are cost
reduction initiatives across the entire organization, and we are making sure that we are still very well positioned from a
commercial standpoint and able to do what is necessary to service our customers going forward. So no concern
regarding that.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Doyle, with all of the work on operational improvement, do you think we're going to see a
faster rate of growth in profits in REIT income or TRS income over the next, say, 12 months and 24 months assuming
housing continues the slow recovery?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, as you know, we are looking at operational excellence across the entire organization in
our Timberlands business as well as our manufacturing businesses, and we've laid out specific targets for both. We've
given an update on where we are on each of those for 2014 versus 2013. And we'll, as I said, in December 9, be giving
more clarify on what 2015 looks like. So I think there's opportunity, Mark, and clearly on the REIT assets, on the
Timberland, and encouraged by the progress we're making there, and there's also opportunities on the manufacturing
side both in Wood Products and Cellulose Fiber.
If you look at it just from a dollar basis in terms of what we've laid out and added up, the bigger numbers are, of course,
in Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers combined compared with the Timberland business, but we're focused on
operational excellence across the entire organization including, as we just alluded to, the $75 million of SG&A.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. And just one more question. How much of the improvement that we saw in
engineered wood this quarter was attributable to lower OSB prices. And should we assume that that division is already
seeing the full benefits of the decline we've seen so far?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So only a minor part, Mark, of what you saw in the ELP was a result of the lower OSB prices.
And, yes, you should assume – we'll see what happens to OSB prices from this point forward – but yes, you should
assume most of that benefit has played through the system.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Terrific. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: Just given [ph], I think, (30:21) where housing starts are and where Southern sawlog prices
are and just with your thoughts on sort of housing starts for 2015, could you share some thoughts, I guess, on the type
of harvest growth you may be planning for in the West and the South as we look out for 2015.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. On the Southern harvest, we have kind of been expecting, as we've talked to you about,
a slow steady increase in Southern sawlog pricing for 2014, and that's generally what we've seen up 3% to 4%. We
continue to have consistent demand from our customers.
So we're not planning, at this time, any type of deferral as we look into 2015. We'll continue to keep a close eye on
market conditions. Just in terms of how we think about our harvest overall, what we look at is the financial maturity
and the expected market demand. And those are the factors that we use to build our harvest plans going forward, and
we're working on those for 2015.
We also, as you know, and we've talked about, have the ability to flex some during the year and during a specific
quarter. And you saw some of that earlier this year as we capitalize on stronger export prices in the first half of 2014

<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the Wood Products side, I don't know if
you could kind of quantify the type of volume declines you're looking for in the fourth quarter. And then – is this – are
these declines just sort of typical seasonal declines, or are they driven by, I guess, a greater than expected drop in
demand at all?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No. What we are talking about, Tyler, is just your typical seasonal type slowdown in the
fourth quarter. As Patty said in her comments, the fourth quarter is typically the slowest seasonal period from a Wood
Products perspective.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: All right. Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Maybe tagging on, on the question of kind of 2015 outlook. And, again, I appreciate we'll
get more either in December or January. But given the housing outlook that you've put out for 2015, how do you think
that affects the trajectory of sawlog pricing in the South? Do you think it's kind of more of the same? Do you see any
chance for acceleration?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Gail, our best guess on Southern sawlog pricing is we will continue to see slow, steady
improvement. I think the range we gave in housing, 1.1 million to 1.2 million, at the upper end of that range I think you
could see maybe an acceleration in pricing in Southern sawlogs even above the 3% to 4% that we anticipate for 2014. If
it's at the lower end of that range, then maybe it's more in the 3%, 4%, 5% range that we've seen for – or we anticipate
for 2014 versus 2013. So, that's our kind of best guess on Southern sawlogs.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: In the near-term.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you. And can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of
log export markets? How severe do you think the inventory situation is in China? How long do you think it would take
to normalize? And ex the timing of volumes to Japan, can you give us a sense of kind of the underlying trend in Japan,
particularly relative to has it fully worked through the consumption tax at this point?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Gail. This is Patty. As we think about China, as I've said inventories are still at
higher than normal levels and the takeaway is going a little slower than probably what we would have expected last
quarter when we were on the call, but they are working their way through. That will probably take through the rest of
this quarter. So, we don't anticipate any significant change in direction for the quarter other than what I talked about
earlier.
In Japan, I think that stepping back from that too, you'd have to say there is the Japanese market overall but then there's
also the customers that we have. And the customers that we have worked with, as you know, for some of them well
over 20 years are really talking to us about making sure that they get the volume that they need to support their
operations.
So, they are large customers, they have very efficient supply chain both in terms of the supply for logs, but importantly
as well, how they merchandise lumber in Japan. So volumes in Japan, as I've said, are primarily down because of

timing. We had a little better shipments in the third quarter, as Doyle talked about in his remarks. So we are still
confident in our Japan volumes, although pricing will be impacted as we go forward based upon what things do overall.
But we do expect our realizations to Japan for this quarter to be up a little bit because we'll have a little bit higher grade
to Japan relatively.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you. And on engineered wood, do you think the volume you saw on the third
quarter is reflective of kind of the underlying market or was it depressed, do you pay back from the outside strength in
the second quarter?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I think the – we clearly saw, as we indicated after the second quarter, or on the second quarter
call, Gail, some pre-buying in the second quarter due to the pricing increase that went in late in the second quarter in
our engineered wood business. So, I think maybe if you average the two, that would probably be kind of the normalized
rate, but clearly we had some pre-buying in the second quarter versus the third.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Just one last quick one. Patty, can you possibly quantify particularly since it seems
like you're already done what the outage expense would be for the fourth quarter in Cellulose?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Gail. As we looked at Cellulose Fibers, if you look at chart 9 where we detailed the
maintenance expense and outage days, so in the third quarter, we had about 38 days of maintenance downtime. We
would expect, because we are now complete, that that would be about 14 days for the fourth quarter. So that's a
difference of around 20 days, 24 days. And as I've said in the past, each day is usually about $1 million. So it's around
$20 million delta from third quarter to fourth quarter, which is the primary difference between our outlook for the
fourth quarter as it compares to the third.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Alex.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Good morning, Doyle. On engineered wood products, can you just talk about how engineered
wood is performing in the marketplace relative to lumber in single-family construction and any progress if any that's
been made in further penetrating the multi-family end market with engineered wood?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. So in engineered wood, we continue to be, as I mentioned earlier, encouraged about the
progress that we're making. As you see from our overall shipment numbers, we continue to gain in terms of capturing
profitable share going forward. And some of that is coming from multi-family.
Still – I don't want to mislead you, the key driver for engineered wood has been and will continue to be single-family,
but we have had some successes in moving into multi-family in terms of our engineered wood products.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Got it. And then at the Analyst Day last year, we talked about the performance in engineered
wood and distribution didn't materially improve and potentially those businesses will not be part of the portfolio longer
term. Obviously, we've seen very meaningful improvement in those businesses. So are we at a point now where the
improvement is enough where we can say that engineered wood and distribution will be part of Weyerhaeuser for the
long-term?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Alex, the way I would answer is that, and I think I said this earlier, is the $30 million to $40
million was necessary to show that we deserve the right to be in those businesses. I think we are delivering on that. So
our next step now is to show that we can win in these businesses. And again, we'll define winning as showing that we
can earn above cost of capital in each of these businesses over a cycle. That's going to take some additional work in

each of these businesses going forward. But that's what we're focused on doing, winning both from a cost of capital
perspective and showing that we can be the leader in each of these businesses going forward, and that's the way we
think about it.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Understood. And just last one on share buybacks, so good to see that happen in the quarter.
Should we read into – in terms of the amount and the timing, is that – any sort of potential number that we could see
consistently on a go-forward basis? Is that the sort of run rate that we can think about on a go-forward basis that you
could buy back?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No, what I would read into it is the fact that we are committed to executing this share
repurchase plan on a timely basis. The comment we made when we announced this authorization is this is when we
fully anticipated completing on a timely basis, we will report to you, just as we did this quarter, the progress we're
making going forward. But I wouldn't read into just to say we're going to do this amount every quarter based on what
we did for half a quarter in third quarter of 2014.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Hey, good morning Doyle and Patty.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Hi, Chip.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Hey there. First question is, we've seen a pretty interesting divergence of opinion in the last few
weeks, and one way guys can, of course, buy timbers just by buying your own stock and it looks like we've seen two of
your competitors; one, step-up and pay pretty close to peak prices I guess for Southern lands and another of your
competitors decide to focus more on, not only maybe buying back stock but actually selling land into the strength to
buy back stock. And I didn't know if you had an opinion on what you thought of land values and I'm really thinking of
the South at this point where there seems to be a divergence of opinion, and whether we'd see a step-up now or hang
back?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Chip, I think you can look at our actions in terms of the way we think about things.
Clearly, as we've already highlighted, we are in the market actively repurchasing our shares, so we are convinced that
we are creating value for our shareholders for doing that. In terms of actively buying timberland, there's no doubt that
there are a lot of opportunities out there to do that in today's market, there's also lots of money chasing those deals.
We look at those deals each and every one of them that comes along. And as we've said before, we're going to be very
disciplined in what we actually acquire and, to-date, we have not made any acquisitions in the South. The type of
transactions we're looking for, again, actions are the ones that are along the lines of what we did in the Longview
acquisition, and you can look at the type of returns that we are generating from that acquisition that we made last year.
That's not a South versus West statement, Chip.
We would look if the right opportunities are there that where we think we can grow value for shareholders, we would
look at making acquisitions both in the West and in the South, but we're just going to continue to be very disciplined in
the way we look at those potential acquisition opportunities going forward.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow up. Last year, I seem to recall that you all
made a point of saying that lumber and OSB were a little bit more strategic in possible areas of growth through

acquisition than, say, EWP and distribution. And I just wanted to know if you're still open to making acquisitions if the
right thing comes along in those two businesses that you mentioned. And if those other two businesses, EWP and
distribution, continue to improve as they've certainly done this year, could they also be areas that maybe in a couple of
years you could see growing in?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Chip, I don't specifically remember making the comment that you just referred to. But let me
talk about how we think about acquisitions generally. As we've consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities for
acquisitions are going to be in our Timberland business. With that said, if we can find acquisition opportunities in our
Wood Products business or Cellulose Fiber business, for that matter, that will result in additional shareholder value,
that's something we would look at.
Now, we don't feel compelled to grow any of our businesses, but again if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions in Wood
Products or Cellulose Fibers that we think add value for shareholders, that's something we would potentially consider.
But again, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisition will be in our Timberlands business.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of clean-ups. In engineered wood, can you
please tell us what your operating rate was in the quarter? And what you expect it to be in 2015?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: If the operating rate in the third quarter, Steve, continued to be in the [ph] mid-7 (46:02)
range, so roughly [ph] 70% to 75% (46:05) type range, operating rates in EWP in the third quarter. And we'll see what
happens to housing, but I don't think that number – again, we'll – so I would anticipate as housing continues to
improve, that number could go up going forward.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Yeah. And I was going to say, given that housing is kind of underwhelmed over the last
couple of years, is it appropriate to budget your production to the lower end of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million range,
maybe particularly with respect to OSB?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. OSB is a different story of course. And what I would tell you in OSB is we took 20 days
of downtime in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we would anticipate a higher amount of downtime due to
normal seasonal factors, holiday season and some maintenance in capital projects that are going in place, in terms of
OSB in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Great. And final question, with respect to your understanding of MLPs, is converting logs
into lumber panels in EWP also eligible or is it just for pulp-based businesses?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Steve, as I said before that the IRS has a project, a very complete project that they've
undertaken and it seems they're taking even a little bit longer than maybe what was anticipated when they announced
the project, which was back towards the beginning of this year.
So I think it's difficult to know really where they'll come out on their deliberations. What we do know, as I said before,
was a number of years ago, they did have a ruling on pulp. But whether or not they will modify that ruling and
application going forward and whether or not they would say anything about the other businesses is still yet to be
known.
So tough to give you any more clarity. I wish we all had a little more clarity at this point. But that's sort of what we
know as we sit here today.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. I, too, like George, was looking at chart 7 where you had Wood Products
volumes and pricing. And I had something of a different question and that's, the lumber, engineered wood and if we
threw plywood on here, it'd be the same, prices have been pretty good over the last year-and-a-half. Obviously, OSB
has been a very different story. There was a lot of restarts last year but that was a while ago.
Any thoughts as to why it's taking so long for OSB to regain at footing and what needs to happen for the markets to get
into balance and more profitable.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, I think you said it right. There are significant additional supply that came online. I
think in anticipation of maybe stronger housing starts than we've seen occur in the 2014 type timeframe. So I think it's a
simple supply and demand equation that appears to be out of balance currently, and that's what has resulted in the
current pricing environment.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Do you think there are any structural impediments to regaining balance because I'm not
sure the operating rates in engineered wood are higher or for that matter in gypsum than in OSB, it just seems to be that
the market struggles to adjust to the demand situation. Any thoughts as to what impediments might be in place?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No, Mark, I don't think there are any long-term structural impediments. OSB tends to be very
volatile, as you very well know, over a cycle. And I think we're just in one of those periods of low pricing currently.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: One thing I would say, Mark, that's different in the two technologies, OSB, when capacity
comes on the market, comes on in pretty big chunks, and people seek to run those mills 24/7 because of the type of
operation that they are. So I think when new capacity starts up as we saw a number of mills earlier this year, it takes a
longer time for the market to absorb it if the housing doesn't recover as quickly as I think what people anticipated as we
started the year. So I think I would point to that as a difference between the two technologies.
Lumber similarly, also is a more fragmented business that capacity comes on in smaller chunks than what OSB does.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Fair enough. And certainly, I realized it's not your job to be prognosticating on price
actions, et cetera. But given your housing starts forecast for next year, is it feasible that OSB gets into balance, or do
you think we're still a ways away?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, I think as we move through 2015 and housing continues to improve, I think they're in
the range that we laid out. You could see an environment, and again, we're not prognosticators of pricing, and we'll
leave that to others. But I think you could see a point where that is more in balance going forward.

your non-strategic timberland sales where are those happening, is it more West-based than South? And in terms of
transaction values, are you seeing a steady increase over the last year?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So we have those in both the West and the South. I'll give you an example of one that
was in the third quarter. It happened to be in Oklahoma. It was a tract that was roughly 760 acres and it sold for
$14,000-plus per acre. So that's an example of what we see occurring out in the marketplace right now. So some of it's
truly non-strategic, some of it's more HBU-type land. And that's what we've seen going on and we think will continue
to be opportunities for us going forward.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay. And just getting back to the Q4 outlook on lower lumber and OSB pricing, just
specifically on the OSB side, it looks like those prices bottomed out in September. And we've seen, depending on the
reason but anywhere from 10% to 14% price lifts since that point. What's your level of confidence that prices will be
lower quarter-over-quarter?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Again, we're not better than anybody else in predicting what's going to happen on prices. The
number that I referenced earlier is if you look at third quarter average versus October to-date prices, October to-date is
down roughly $5 for our overall mix. So, that's to give you some sense of where we are today.
Now again, that's third quarter average. You referenced into the third quarter. But if you look at third quarter average
versus October to-date, that's where we ended up.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings
with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Thank you and good morning. Congrats again on a solid quarter. Just a couple of clean-ups
here. Just a kind of a follow up to Gail's question on Japan. You mentioned that you're seeing better realizations in 4Q
due to mix. How are like comparable quality log price. Are they still falling in that market or are you actually starting
to see some stabilization and lift on kind of a apples-to-apples basis there?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I would say that Japan is stable as it relates to price overall. And as I said both in terms of
the volume to Japan, we are also very pleased with the customer relationships that we have that really are focused on
making sure that they have adequate supply of Douglas-fir logs in order to supply their large operations.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Thanks for that, Patty. And then as far as the Cellulose Fibers guidance for 4Q, could
you see as far as from an earnings contribution a bounce back all the way to what you saw in 2Q, or is it probably going
to fall out somewhere between what we saw between 2Q and 3Q?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, I think as you look at that, the major difference between the third quarter and the
fourth quarter is going to be that roughly $20 million of maintenance expense that I referenced when Gail asked her
question. There are some puts and takes in other – I said liquid packaging realizations will be down, full pricing should
be pretty stable. But the major difference between the two is that – two quarters is that $20 million of maintenance.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Thanks, Patty. And then just one last big picture question, Doyle, and kind of a follow
up to both Chip's and Paul's questions. Given the strong bid for timberland right now, have you thought about just
becoming more aggressive as far as capital recycling within the Timberland business? More specifically, are there
certain wood baskets in the U.S. South that you want to try and get more aggressive and have a bigger presence in and
maybe exit some of the regions you are in now?

Because just looking at your footprint in the region, there are some areas and states where we have a pretty large
concentration and some other areas where we're seeing arguably a little bit better signs of a price recovering sawlogs
that you're not in. So are you looking at kind of shifting some capital around within timberland from that perspective?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, that's good question. And as you, I think, know and as we've talked about before, we're
always looking to improve through trading and buying and selling the overall quality of our timberlands, and some of
that may include as you alluded to, potentially getting in markets maybe that we're not in, although we're in most of the
markets currently. So those are things that we are considering, have considered, and will continue to consider going
forward.
With that said, we have, as you know, a pretty good footprint in terms of both in the South and in the West in terms of
where our strategic timberland is located and we're convinced that through growing and harvesting trees on that
strategic timberland, we're going to be able to drive value for our shareholders going forward. But we're always looking
to improve the overall quality of our timberland base and I think had some success in doing that historically and we'll
continue to look at opportunities to do that going forward.
