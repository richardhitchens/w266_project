MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Accenture second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings
conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being
recorded.
And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations, KC
McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Brad, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings announcement.
As Brad just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second
quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook
for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the
end of the call.

As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking, and as
such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other
SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this
call.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are extremely pleased with our financial results for the
second quarter, continuing our momentum from the first quarter. Our strong performance in the second quarter was,
again, broad-based across different dimensions of our business, and we gained significant market share. Here are a few
highlights.
Let me start with our new bookings of $9.4 billion, our second highest quarterly bookings ever. This brings us to $17
billion for the first half and positions us well for the year. We delivered very strong revenue growth of 12% in local
currency, with double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Earnings per share were $1.08, a 5% increase.
We expanded operating margins 30 basis points to 13.6%. Our balance sheet remained very strong, ending the quarter
with a cash balance of $4.1 billion.
And we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Today, we announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share, which shall bring total dividend payments for
the year to $2.04 per share, a 10% increase over last year.
So, with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our results and the momentum we are creating in our
business. And we have, again, raised our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year.
Over to you, David.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, we
delivered a very strong second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of strong and building momentum in our
business as we continue to execute a growth strategy that's clearly resonating in the marketplace. During this period,
we've gained significant market share by being relevant and responsive to the needs of our clients.
Looking more specifically at the second quarter, following a strong start to the year in quarter one, we again delivered
on all three imperatives for driving shareholder value. Our 12% growth, which continues to be broad-based across
almost every dimension of our business, reflects the durability of our revenue growth model as we drive growth at
scale.
Our operating margin of 13.6%, 30 basis points higher than last year, demonstrates the success of the actions underway
to improve profitability, and reflects our ability to manage our business to drive sustainable margin expansion. And our
free cash flow of $220 million was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash
flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning significant cash to shareholders. So we were extremely
pleased with the second quarter, very strong growth, strong margin expansion, and cash flow consistent with our

expectations.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.4 billion for the
quarter, as Pierre said, representing the second highest quarter in our history. Consulting bookings were $4.2 billion,
with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $5.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.4. On a year-to-date basis,
bookings are now just over $17 billion, a very healthy level especially when considering the FX impact, and puts us
within our target book-to-bill range for both consulting and outsourcing.
Taking a closer look at our quarter two bookings, an important theme was the continued strong demand for both
digital-related services and operations. At the same time, we saw very good demand for both application services and
consulting-related services. Another important characteristic was the broad-based nature of the uptick in new bookings,
with sequential improvement in bookings across all operating groups and all three geographic areas.
Finally, we were pleased that we had a record 15 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which points to the
strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive the most important initiatives on their agenda.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.49 billion, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in
local currency, reflecting a negative 6.5% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 5% impact provided in
our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the additional FX headwind, we came in well above the top end of our
guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD and 11% in local currency.
Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, up 6% in USD and 13% in local currency.
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter, we saw consistent trends with our most recent
quarters. The dominant drivers were strong double-digit growth in digital-related services, operations, and application
services. And it's also noteworthy that our results reflected an uptick in growth rates in both strategy and consulting
services, which are now growing at mid-single digits.
Turning to the operating groups. Communications, Media & Technology delivered another quarter of 15% growth,
which continued to be broad-based, with almost all dimensions growing double digits. The strongest growth drivers
continue to be digital-related services, cost rationalization, and several large transformational projects, as well as
increasing demand for network-related services.
H&PS also grew 15% in the quarter. And the drivers continue to be very significant growth in our Health business,
particularly in the public sector, driven by our health exchange and Medicaid-related projects at U.S. federal and state
clients. Digital-related services and operations, particularly in BPO, continue to be very significant drivers of growth as
well.
Products growth of 13% continued to reflect strong and balanced growth across all three geographic regions and most
industries. Digital and cost optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well.
Application services was also a driver, as well as very strong overall growth in consulting.
Financial Services grew 9%, led by strong growth in Europe and across all three industries, particularly in capital
markets and insurance. Digital-related services continued to be a major theme as our clients are looking for new and
innovative ways to connect with their customers and serve their needs. Additionally, cost optimization and risk and
regulatory work continue to be significant areas of focus.
Resources grew 6%, with growth in all three geographic regions and all industries except energy. Revenues were
driven by growth in outsourcing across all industries including energy, as clients focus on operational efficiency and
cost rationalization.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared with 31.3% for the same period
last year, down 140 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% of net revenues compared
with 11.7% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 100 basis points. General and administrative expense
was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the second quarter last year, down 60 basis points.
Operating income was $1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points
compared with quarter two last year.

Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% compared with an effective tax rate of 24% in the second quarter last
year.
Net income was $743 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $722 million for the same quarter
last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.08 compared with EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter last year. This
reflects a 5% year-over-year increase.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading. They were 35 days, down from 37
days last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $220 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities
of $301 million, net of property and equipment additions of $82 million.
As I mentioned in quarter one, we shifted the timing of a portion of our compensation payments from quarter one to
quarter two. While this shift negatively impacted the second quarter, there's no impact to full-year cash flow.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at February 28 was $4.1 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31
last year, down $800 million, as we've returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the
first half of fiscal 2015.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global head count of about 323,000 people.
We now have approximately 226,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter two, our utilization was 91%,
consistent with last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 13% in quarter
one and 12% in the same period last year. Lastly, we continue to expect at least 90,000 people will join our company in
fiscal 2015.
Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
approximately 6.8 million shares for $601 million at an average price of $87.72 per share. Year-to-date, we purchased
15.2 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion at an average price of $83.62 per share. As of February 28, we had
approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.02 per share, representing a 10%
increase over the dividend we paid in May of last year. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2015.
So, with two quarters in the books, we've delivered very strong results and feel positive about how we're positioned for
the remainder of the year. That said, we don't take anything for granted. We continue to drive our business with rigor
and discipline, doing everything possible to deliver a strong second half of the year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
We are executing very well against our growth strategy and taking a leadership position in each of the businesses in our
portfolio. The investments we've made in assets and solutions, in strategic acquisitions, in attracting talent and in
building the skills and capabilities of our people, has positioned us very well to capture new growth opportunities. We
are driving innovation across Accenture to build capabilities that are both highly relevant to our clients and highly
differentiated in the marketplace.
You have heard me mention two important trends, digitization and rationalization, that are driving demand for our
services and contributing to our growth. We invested ahead of the curve to build a capability that will help our clients
respond to these trends. Digitization is all about helping our clients tap into new sources of value and new sources of
revenue to create competitive advantage. We are helping clients capitalize on this trend to become the disruptors in the
new digital world, not the disrupted.

A great example is the work we are doing with a leading retailer, helping them envision entirely new ways to attract
customers and achieve their goal of quadrupling revenue. We are bringing innovative digital technology to help them
move beyond the traditional store model to a multichannel digital strategy. For a global telecommunications provider,
we developed a digital strategy underpinned by analytics to significantly upgrade their customer service, while
delivering cost savings of almost $100 million.
We are also working with our clients to develop innovative products and services based on the Internet of Things. We
are helping Visa explore the future of mobile payments to make purchases more convenient even inside a car.
Leveraging our expertise in digital commerce, we built a proof of concept to show our consumers, in the connected car,
can order and pay for it securely.
Digital services represents about 20% of our total revenues and grew more than 20% in local currency in the first half
of the year. We are seeing demand for digital across all dimensions of the business, in every industry and around the
world. And we are clearly benefiting from the investments we have made in this space.
In January, we acquired Structure, a Houston-based firm that will further enhance our smart grid operations, energy
trading and risk management services for utilities and energy clients. In February, we announced the acquisition of
Agilex Technologies, a provider of digital solutions for the U.S. federal government. The acquisition enhances our
digital capabilities in analytics, cloud and mobility for federal agencies. And earlier this month, we completed the
acquisition of Gapso, a Brazilian analytics firm that will expand our advanced analytics capabilities in the supply chain
and logistic areas.
The second theme, rationalization, continues to be top of mind for our clients as they look for opportunities to increase
productivity and efficiency across their organizations. We have invested to take a leadership position in this space with
Accenture Operations. And we are the first company to combine business process services with infrastructure and
cloud services at scale.
We are working with a leading global airline on a major transformation of its procurement function, including a
cloud-based supplier portal. The airline expects to realize significant cost savings, as well as increased standardization
and transparency. We are helping a global beverage company create a global operating hub for finance and accounting,
HR, procurement, supply chain, and marketing operations. Our multi-tower BPO services will streamline processes,
minimize risk, and provide new analytical insights.
And we are working with a leading European manufacturer to transform its IT infrastructure. We will migrate existing
applications and data services across more than 60 operating companies into a single hybrid cloud environment. We
expect to deliver improved services and flexibility, increased automation, and a 30% reduction in operating cost.
Now, turning to the geographic dimension of our business. In the second quarter, we again delivered very strong
growth across all three of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered revenue growth of 13% in local
currency, driven by double digit growth in the United States where we continue to perform extremely well. In Europe,
we grew revenues 9% in local currency, driven by double digit growth in many of our largest markets, including
France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. And in our growth markets, we grew revenues 12% in local currency
with, again, strong double-digit growth in three of our largest markets, Japan, Australia and Brazil.
So, as you can see, we have delivered an excellent first half of the fiscal year. Our diverse portfolio of business,
together with our geographic diversity and our unique ability to integrate our capabilities end-to-end, positions us very
well to bring innovative services to market-leading companies, both globally and locally.
Looking ahead, based on the successful execution of our growth strategy, I feel confident in our ability to deliver
sustainable profitable growth over the long-term, providing value to our clients, our people and our shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year 2015. David, over to
you.

David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre.
Let me turn now to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of
$7.35 billion to $7.6 billion. This assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 11% compared to third
quarter of fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal year 2015, based upon how the rates have been trending over last few weeks,
we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 8% compared to fiscal 2014. For the
full fiscal 2015, we now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal
2014. For the full fiscal year 2015, we now expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion,
reflecting our revised FX assumptions.
Before I continue with our business outlook, I'd like to comment briefly on a non-cash item that will be recorded in the
third quarter. In May, we expect to record a non-cash settlement charge estimated to be approximately $60 million as a
result of a current offer to former employees to receive a voluntary lump sum cash payment from our U.S. pension
plan. This will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. On a GAAP basis for fiscal 2015, the estimated
impact of this settlement charge is approximately 20 basis points to operating margin and approximately $0.05 in EPS.
We will provide both GAAP and adjusted results for quarter three and year-to-date results.
For operating margin, on a year-to-date – on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal 2015 to be 14.4% to 14.6%,
a 10- to 30-basis-point expansion over fiscal 2014 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in
the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal 2015 to be in the
range of $4.66 to $4.76 or 3% to 5% growth over fiscal 2014 results. Absent the higher FX headwind, which impacts
EPS by $0.14, our EPS range would have increased $0.10 to $0.14, driven by higher revenue growth.
Turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2015, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.85 billion to
$4.15 billion, reflecting our revised FX assumption. Property and equipment additions continue to be approximately
$450 million, and free cash flow now to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion.
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also continue
to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to
returning substantial portion of our cash to shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?
KC McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Brad, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A

Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney. Please go
ahead.

<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: I was wondering, could you provide a little more color on your exposure to digital? Just give
us some sense of what you expect the growth rates to be there. And how should we think about that as it relates to
bookings as far as the size of the deals and the margin contribution? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, okay, I will take the first part of it. And indeed, as we communicated recently and even
this last year, we all embarked in rotating more of our business to what we are calling now digital-related services.
Digital is positive across the board. This is something we anticipated frankly a few years ago, probably in the range of
29%, and we invested a lot ahead of the curve. You'll remember around what we are calling interactive analytics, cloud
and mobility. And now, indeed, we are – significantly benefited from this wave, which is very important, that's why I
was very pleased and proud to report our position in terms of digital-related services now at 20% of Accenture
revenues in that short period of time. And as important, and even more important, well above 20% local currency
growth for the first half of the year.
So needless to say that we have great momentum in that business, and indeed is covering a large variety of
opportunities, small, medium, large, covering consulting or outsourcing type of work. So digital is positive across the
different dimensions of our businesses. Consulting, outsourcing, across all industries, they are more or less around this
20%, some above, but a few slightly below. And on balance, I guess, David will comment good pricing.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And I think, just as it relates to the bookings question, although Pierre alluded to this, is that
the digital deals do span all sizes. We have larger digital projects, and obviously we have a high volume of
medium-sized to smaller projects. I guess what I would say is that you might think about it in the context of the quarter
we just delivered, where we delivered $9.4 billion in bookings, with a heavy component of digital. And so I don't think
that this necessarily changes anything in terms of that dynamic overall.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Just to add a piece of information on this, as you know, we created as well Accenture Digital,
where we organized our Accenture Interactive, Accenture Mobility, and Accenture Analytics work. And what we are
aiming at in a true Accenture way is to create more and more synergies, integration end to end of the three capabilities,
and that's a unique differentiator in the marketplace.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Okay. Thank you, Joe.
Operator
And we do have a question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great, thanks, great growth here. I wanted to ask on the bookings side, just the 15 clients that
did bookings over $100 million. That was a big number, obviously. Can you comment on types of deals, geographies,
maybe pricing, any common theme there in business in any way, pull-forward bookings for the third or fourth quarter?
I'm just wondering if the big deal pipeline has been impacted now that you signed these deals. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: No, I'll tell you that I'll just work backwards. We feel good about our pipeline. Obviously,
when you have a big bookings quarter, you convert a lot of pipeline to bookings. That's a factor. But even with that, we
feel very good about our pipeline. We actually feel good about recent movement that we've seen in the larger deal
category within our pipeline.
Tien-Tsin, I would say just in terms of color on the bookings, I don't know if there are really any dominant themes. It
crosses the spectrum of operations, including BPO-type contracts. There's a flavor of application services in there. And
I guess stating the obvious, there's a flavor of digital in there as well. The thing about our bookings that we were
especially pleased with, and generally this would apply to the 15 clients, is the pervasiveness of the strength of the
bookings. And I mentioned that we had sequential growth across all five of our operating groups and all three
geographic areas. And so I would say that there's not anything unique about the 15. And again, we feel good about our
pipeline going forward.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, absolutely. What I appreciate with our results is they are broad-based, and so bookings
exactly the same pattern. If you're looking from an operating group standpoint, if you're looking from a geographic
standpoint as well, you would see they are extremely well balanced across the board, so we don't especially benefit this
quarter of any outstanding performance of one part of the business compared to the others. It's very well balanced with
of course a lot of digital across the board. And this is the kind of balanced growth we appreciate.

And we have a question from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: I was just hoping to get some color on the breakout of consulting and outsourcing, how to
think about those on a constant currency basis in the second half of the year.
And then my second question is just on gross margins. I know we're solving for operating margins. But on the gross
margins, they were down 140 basis points. I think it's a little more than usual. Maybe you can just give us some color
on the gross margins. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say on your first question in terms of the second half of the year, I would think in
terms of mid to high single-digit positive growth for consulting. And let's say probably high single-digit positive for
outsourcing. So that puts us on a track for the full year of probably mid to high single for consulting again, and low
double digit for outsourcing.
In terms of the profitability point, at the risk of being redundant, I guess let me just share a few things with you beyond
what I said in the script. First of all, we're very pleased with the 30 basis points of expansion. That obviously is at the
upper end of the range that we target, and it does reflect a lot of the hard work that our organization has been doing
over the last four quarters.
What I really focus on when I look at our profitability are a few things. The first thing I focus on is the progression of
our contract profitability. And I can tell you that our contract profitability was up compared to the same quarter last
year, and we continue to be pleased with the progression of contract profitability.
The second thing that I look at is the progression of the overall efficiency of our labor costs, both our Accenture
personnel and our subcontractors. And we have made really good improvement in our labor cost efficiency for several
quarters now, and that's in the mix as well when you look at our second quarter results.
The third thing I look at is how our organization is doing in managing every dime we spend as if it's our own
individually related to non-payroll expenses, and we've done a very good job with that.
And then finally, although this is certainly not last on the list, at the end of the day we are seeking to create headroom
in our P&L so that we can invest at sufficient levels to really drive our business growth going forward, and we have a
good mix of investments in our results as well.
And so we always are talking about, or in this forum at least, we get the questions on the gross margin, on the SG&A,
but those are the things that I really focus on. And all of those things were in the right zone relative to my expectations,
creating the 30 basis points of expansion.

The last thing I'll say is gross margin again includes a lot of things. It's not just contract profitability. It includes
recruiting, training, integration of acquisitions, onboarding costs for new hires, et cetera. So there's a lot that goes in
there that ebbs and flows quarter over quarter.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: That's helpful. Thanks for the color and congrats on the super quarter.

And we do have a question from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Hey, guys. Nice job.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
<Q - David J. Koning>: And I guess first of all, just high level. If we think back, the last four quarters have been very
good. And the prior six quarters before that had been kind of low to mid-single digit growth. And I guess, I'm
wondering, is it just kind of the natural ebbs and flows of the business to have kind of a nice acceleration after a period
of slowdown? And really, behind the question is, can this higher level of growth, now that we've seen it for a full year,
kind of stay sustainable, or have there kind of been one-off events that allowed revenue to kind of ebb higher that starts
to, I guess, anniversary and starts to slow down a bit? Just kind of high level, just wondering how that plays out over
time.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Commenting on the first part of your question and what happened these last three quarters
compared to what happened before. I guess, as you know, the world has changed significantly, and we put a lot of
thought at Accenture on what it takes to be relevant in this new world and to respond to the current needs of our clients.
And the needs are much more around how we deal with uncertainty, how we deal with volatility, how we bring more
flexible solution, how we provide more productivity and efficiency. And that's why we come with this I think quite
simple, but this really vision around at the end of the day, it's all going to be digitization of the business for clients, on
behalf of our clients, and the rationalization of their operations. And then we significantly align the Accenture strategy
agenda and our investments toward these two main trends.
And as you know, and you've seen that recently and we communicated to a lot, we invested in new skills, we invested
in new organization with the creation of Accenture Consulting, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Digital, Accenture
Technology and Accenture Operations. We make several strategic acquisitions especially focusing on digital and
operation. We acquire very deep skills, we have more than 1,000 PhDs doing algorithm in analytics at Accenture. So
this is what we did these last couple of years, and I guess that now, we are getting the return on the strategy we set and
on the investment we've made. We are absolutely not complacent with that, but to a great extent, we have seen a way, a
path through to be relevant to our client. We committed to it, and now, we are executing seamlessly.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And I would – I don't know that I can really add anything to that, frankly. It's – I mean, you
– in your question, is there anything unusual or like one time of that nature, and the answer is absolutely not. And
again, I think the thing that you would have to just look at is the broad-based nature of the growth, which speaks to the
durability. And one of the things at Investor/Analyst Day, David, if you remember, is I really talked quite a bit about
our growth model and why we believe it is durable over time. And again, our enduring objective is to grow faster than
the market. Now, the market growth rates change over time and our growth rates will change with it. But our enduring
objective is to grow faster than the market, and we're working hard to have durability in our growth model to allow us
to do that.
<Q - David J. Koning>: That's great, thanks. And I guess just one short follow-up. Just this quarter, the Resources
margin was 12.8%. It hasn't been under 15% in about six years, and just on that line item specifically, if something
changed a little bit?

<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, the operating group margins can be lumpy quarter-over-quarter. As you know, we
have been working hard to position our Resources business for growth, and congratulations to our team for doing that. I
also called out – if you've extracted this from the comments I made on Resources, the growth in Resources right now is
coming really exclusively from our outsourcing-related services, operations and application services. And so, you see a
little bit of mix there as well. But we're not – I'm not particularly concerned about the profitability in a single quarter.
We have good profit potential in Resources going forward, and over time, we will tune the levers to get it back to the
right level.

And we do have a question from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim E. Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us
a little bit of color on some of the transactional shorter-duration business and how those bookings are tracking, and
more importantly, going forward, what inning do you think we're in cyclically in terms of that improvement?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, we've definitely seen an increasing volume of the smaller short-term type projects.
And of course, that's reflected in our consulting growth. And I would say that the drivers of that broadly anchor back to
the themes that Pierre has talked about so often. You look at the digital space, and the nature of the digital work is that
it really lends itself to this agile, quick turn development and deployment of capability. But also on the cost
rationalization agenda, that drops a lot of demand for our strategy practice, for our consulting practice, what in the past
we've referred to as management consulting, as an example, working with our companies to develop a strategic cost
map for cost rationalization and then getting into the implementation of that. And we see some of that in shorter,
smaller projects, which are contracted in phases over a period of time. So those are the kinds of things that are in the
mix. Pierre may add some additional flavor to that.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, indeed. I think what is interesting to see in the mix of work we are telling is we have at
the same time, and as you know, we are quite famous for this large scale transformation program, and again, this year,
as mentioned by David, we had a few large-scale opportunities at clients. And at the same time, especially with the rise
of digital, you have more what I would call higher velocity projects. So I think what we have now in our portfolio of
bookings is these large scale transactions, which are clearly the kind of savoir faire, unique savoir faire of Accenture, is
kind of end-to-end combining all our capabilities to deliver transformation, plus the higher velocity programs, more
digital-related services driven, and this is this mix which I think has impacting – has impacted, on balance, the average
duration of our bookings.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Does that help, Jim?
<Q - Jim E. Schneider>: Yes, it does, it definitely does. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Great.
<Q - Jim E. Schneider>: And then maybe as a follow-up, just – you're doing well on the cost control side with both
sales and marketing and G&A dollars down in absolute terms on a year-over-year basis. Any color on how much of
that is FX versus organic, and then some of the initiatives you're doing to kind of keep those expenses under control?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think it's real cost savings. I mean, one big area is – and we've talked about for years, as
you know, but we are always focused on continuing to look for improvements in our sales efficiency and our channel
costs. And so we have made improvements in that area under the leadership of our COO, Jo Deblaere. We also have an
ongoing – really, it's ongoing transformation agenda for each of our corporate functions. And we very much do to
ourselves – I should say, we leverage the same kind of capabilities that we sell to our clients internally. And so we use
BPO concepts, for example, across HR and finance. And we have more room to go. It's an ongoing journey for us, just

as it is for our clients, and we've made improvements in our – what we call our corporate function costs as well. And
those are real savings, not FX related, and we'll continue to focus on that going forward. So those are a couple of
examples.

And we do have a question from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Michael Grossman>: Thank you. So this is the second consecutive quarter that you beat your revenue
guidance, and you've reached the year. Can you help us understand whether that was, again, relative to your guidance,
was faster backlog conversion or some of these smaller higher velocity projects that you just mentioned? And again, I
know you said that strength was broad-based across geographies and verticals, but I'm just wondering, again, relative to
kind of where you started the year, whether that's more relevant to a particular vertical or particular geography?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, it's interesting, because we looked quite a bit at where did we come in better than we
expected. And I'm – not to be too simplistic, but the answer is that all five of our operating groups, every single one of
them came in stronger than what we and they expected when we provided guidance in December. And again, I think it
gets to – part of the deal is that when you are on a revenue ramp, it is – it can be a little bit more difficult to predict the
slope of the ramp because, for example, we can be quite confident in the work activity, but yet, we have to also think
about our operating groups, too, the availability to the resources, the timing the projects get started, et cetera.
And so at the end of the day, all five of our operating groups exceeded. So again, it was broad-based. And I would say
that it was more in our consulting-related services than our outsourcing. So consulting came in stronger, and part of
that, again, goes back to this digital theme that we talk about as a driver of consulting. But also, we see more activity
across our other consulting type services, both strategy and our core Consulting business, management consulting, et
cetera. So it's really Consulting came in better and all five operating groups came in better. Those were really the
drivers. And I do think that this – the higher volume of smaller contracts is in the mix of everything I've said really
across the board.
<Q - David Michael Grossman>: Okay, thank you for that. And then just secondly, I think you mentioned the EPS
impact of currency at the end of your prepared remarks. Could you just repeat what the impact, your expectation for the
EPS impact for the year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: So what I said specifically is that there were really two factors that we used to adjust the
range. One is the higher revenue, which we increased revenue and we narrowed to a two point range, so therefore, we
narrowed the EPS range. And the second factor was the FX. Plain and simply, those two factors, and what I said is that
absent the FX headwind, which impacted our EPS by 14 pennies, so FX impacted by 14 pennies, our revenue would
have increased $0.10 to $0.14, absent the impact of – I'm sorry, our EPS would have increased $0.10 to $0.14 absent
the $0.14 FX headwind.
<Q - David Michael Grossman>: And does that include the first quarter impact as well or is that just from the second
quarter on?
<A - David P. Rowland>: That's from the second quarter on, the revised full-year guidance.
<Q - David Michael Grossman>: Okay. Because you had a fairly significant FX impact in the first quarter as well,
right?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, if you look – I mean, if you look at where we started the year versus – so if you take
our initial guidance with where we are now, absent the FX headwind we've increased our guidance $0.16 to $0.20.

And we do have a question from the line of Charlie Brennan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hello, Charlie.
<Q - Charles A. Brennan>: Thanks. I've got two questions. Hi there. I've got two question, if that's possible. The first
is just on the...
<A - David P. Rowland>: I was going to say, we'll judge whether we give you a second question based on the first. Go
ahead.
<Q - Charles A. Brennan>: All right, okay. Okay, I'll go easy then. A couple of the companies that I've been speaking
to in Europe have been suggesting there's incremental pressure from clients for more favorable DSO terms. I was
wondering if you can just put that in context with the two-day move we've seen in this result. And maybe can you give
us some medium-term expectations of where you would like to see DSOs in two to three years' time?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, there's no doubt that the environment is tougher on commercial terms and conditions,
and billing and collections are really right in the mix of that. So we've seen that trend certainly. We had always
signaled, by the way, that the DSO levels that we've had at some points in the recent years past when they had gotten
down in the low 30 days that we had always signaled that that was likely not sustainable over time and that our DSOs
would creep back up to the mid to even high 30 days range. And so that pattern has played out exactly as we had
expected and anticipated. So we're very comfortable with where we are.
I think that by and large, if you look at the last few quarters, our DSO has been relatively stable. It was up a little, now
it's down a couple of days. And so we're in the range that we expect to be, in the range that we expect to be let's say for
the rest of this year. And it's an area that we are always focused on and have been very good at managing our billing
and collections. So I would just say that at least for this year, we're in the range of what we expect. Okay?
<Q - Charles A. Brennan>: And if we look out two or three years, does the high 30 days feel like the right number, or
is it the type of situation when you're just taking every year as it comes?
<A - David P. Rowland>: It's hard to say. I'm not going to look out a few years really. I think what we've said again is
that we could certainly see DSOs creeping up to the mid to upper 30 days, and that's where we're at. Okay, thank you,
Charlie.
<Q - Charles A. Brennan>: I'm just – all right. Okay.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, appreciate it.

<Q - David Mark Togut>: Could you update us, David, on pricing across consulting and outsourcing, and in particular
perhaps application maintenance and development, where I think you called out perhaps a year and a half ago some
increasing pricing pressure? Where do you stand today?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say overall, we're pleased with the way our pricing has progressed since this same
time last year. We saw actually improvement in our pricing in the second quarter. I would be clear though that the
environment continues to be a competitive environment, no doubt. But we have seen some progression in pricing in
certain parts of our business. And overall, we were very pleased with the margin quality of the $9.4 billion bookings.
I would say that in application services, again, to be clear, David, when we talk about pricing, we're talking about the
margin percentage on the contracts that we signed. And in application services, we've also seen positive progression in
the last six months.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: When you talk about improved pricing, and I think Pierre mentioned good pricing in
digital, are you seeing material pricing increases in digital services currently?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say that we see differentiated pricing in digital relative to other parts of our
business. And I think I'd leave it at that unless, Pierre, you have anything...
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No, no, I think digital-related services, as long as you can bring differentiated solutions,
especially the one we invested a lot around, is commanding a better price compared to the rest of the portfolio. This is
what it is.
<A - David P. Rowland>: It's all about – in areas where we have a leading capability, leading differentiated capability,
then typically we get good pricing. And we are in a very strong position in digital with our offerings, our skills
capabilities, et cetera.

And we do have a question from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Hi, thanks. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Sara.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're gaining significant market share.
Could you talk about where you think that's coming from?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I guess we're gaining market share certainly in all the three regions where we are operating.
So this is again quite well balanced. Given our strong double-digit growth now for almost four years in a row in the
U.S., this is probably a place where we are accelerating our gain. And I guess we are probably gaining against clearly,
the more traditional player of our basket of competitors. You know all of them and you know their results. And we are
growing par with the best of the pure players in each of the businesses we're operating in.
But so far indeed, market share gains are quite broad-based. Again, if you look at the – we have 10 (sic) [12] of our
industries out of 19 growing double digit. So I guess – and another four (sic) [three] with high single-digit growth. So I
guess that we are gaining market share in many of our industries. I mentioned in Europe, as an illustration, that we have
double-digit growth in Germany, in the Netherlands. And again, I'm sure we are gaining significant market share given
the market over there when you're growing double digits. So it's quite widespread in many – again, double digit growth
in Japan, in Brazil, in Australia. So in all places where we have double-digit growth, we are gaining market share,
technically. So we're pleased with that.

And we do have a question from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hello, Ed.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Good morning. Congratulations. My question revolves around non-linear growth head count,
323,000, you're going to add 90,000 fresh bodies this year. Where do you stand with creating BPaaS [Business
Process-as-a-Service] opportunities and other sort of volume or outcome-based contracts? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We continue working on this to, I mean, to create more bifurcation between head count and
revenues. I think we're making some good progress even if we are probably still at the beginning of this journey, if you
will. But I've been recently in India, as an illustration, visiting our BPO practice and looking at all the innovations we
are bringing, especially around automation, especially around robotics, and especially around cognitive computing.
And if you bring these three capabilities altogether, we have, indeed, the unique opportunity is happening as we speak
in our operations in India to bring a level of productivity and efficiency in our business process operations where we
start seeing this bifurcation between head count growth and revenue growth, and we might expect some acceleration in
2016 and beyond. So it's still early days regarding the leading-edge characteristics of these technologies, but I'm feeling
extremely positive, and even more important, Mike Salvino is leading our Accenture Operations business. He's feeling
extremely confident that we have the tools and techniques to move to the next level of productivity.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: My other question is now that you're seeing improved local currency growth and everything
seems to be clicking, will you dial back your M&A investments that you had stepped up in recent years?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean, I could elaborate, but I think the answer is – I will elaborate that, no – I mean, we
will continue to invest to acquire, deal, and develop differentiated skills and capabilities, especially around digital and
operations. And we've been very successful to do it from now, and we will continue with that agenda.

Thank you. And that last question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. Look, I want to just start off quickly on Resources and then follow up on
Europe. On Resources, again, I know you said that obviously, there was some timing around margins, but really, the
growth rate just – even though it's only 6%, it's accelerating. It's a pretty big headwind for you guys. Number one, do
you see enough bookings or contracts there to actually continue that acceleration despite oil prices and everything we're
seeing in the industry so that could become more and more maybe a tailwind? And then secondly, on Europe, I just
wanted to ask about the offshore labor arbitrage opportunity there. I mean, I know for a while, you guys have been a lot
more onshore outsourcing-oriented in Europe as the – that was really the way to operate there. We know now there's a

lot of real demand there for more offshore-ing, and I know you have the GDN to do so, I'm just curious what you're
seeing on that front. That could be, I think, a long multiyear opportunity?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I'll comment on Resources and maybe let Pierre comment on Europe. On Resources, we do
feel good about how the business has been repositioned for sustained growth now going forward. The bookings have
been very good in terms of their book-to-bill on a year-to-date basis, and that speaks well to the growth opportunities
going forward.
I think I mentioned that when you look at Resources, they had growth in all three geographic areas and all of the
industries except energy. But even in energy, we actually had very strong double-digit growth in our
outsourcing-related services, so operations and application services. And so what we're finding is that even with the
pressures in energy, we really are helping our clients with our application services and operations services as they work
on their cost optimization, cost rationalization agenda. So we think that we are positioned for sustained positive growth
in Resources even with the recent challenges in energy.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Yeah. That's great, thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And to add color on this, Resources, we're covering many industries. If you take chemical,
which is a very important industry for us, we're growing more than 20%. So you need to look at this from a portfolio
standpoint. From a European standpoint, I mean, you are absolutely right to mention that the outsourcing market is
vibrant. Again, our clients in Europe are looking for more efficiency and more productivity. And if I look at digital
versus – digitization versus rationalization, probably U.S. would be a bit more on digitization, when Europe would be a
bit more on rationalization, which is opening a good space for the outsourcing operating work. And again, we benefit
from the diversity of our global delivery network, and we can come with our clients and you're right to mention that
you need to be sometime a little bit more balanced and subtle in the way you're driving outsourcing in Europe with
respect to the different nationalities, labor markets and environment.
And so the mix – it's more about the right sourcing and the smart sourcing with a good mix of onshore/offshore, and we
benefit at Accenture of having a very diverse global delivery network with, of course, resources on an offshore
standpoint, especially in India and the Philippines, but as well, a network of near-shore centers which is helping us to
get to what we believe is the right sourcing approach for our clients. So I'm feeling extremely confident, and based on
the results, our outsourcing business in Europe is doing well.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you to all of you. Thanks a lot for taking the time and participating to our call today. As you've seen, with half of
the fiscal year behind us, it's clear that we have built strong momentum in our business, and it's clear as well that we are
gaining significant market share. We are seeing clearly, the return on the investment we've made, particularly in digital
and operations. And we will continue to execute our growth strategy to bring innovative and differentiated services to
the marketplace.
In closing, I went to thank the 323,000 women and men of Accenture for their dedication, their passion and their
commitment to delivering value for our clients each and every day in the marketplace. Thank you to all of you. We
look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call
