MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]
This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the
question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by
Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Brian B. Yoor
Okay. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will
provide opening remarks, and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles,
Tom, and I will take your questions.
Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from
those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are
discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2013. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking
statements as a result of subsequent events or developments as except required by law.
Note that financial results from the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals and Animal Health businesses
are reported as discontinued operations due to the pending sale of these businesses. As a result, the line items of our

businesses.
To help facilitate year-over-year comparisons, we filed an 8-K on Tuesday of this week that provides historical results
from Abbott's continuing operations for the first three quarters of 2014. In addition, our 2015 guidance provided today
for sales, P&L line items and earnings per share is for continuing operations only.
In today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on
our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the
impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay, thanks, Brian. Good morning. Today, I'll discuss our results from the fourth quarter of 2014, but in particular our
outlook for 2015. We made good progress against our objectives last year, and we see good positive underlying
momentum in our businesses going into 2015. However, as you know, recent macroeconomic events have dominated
the discussion on company outlooks for 2015, in particular, the significant strengthening of the dollar against almost
every currency during the fourth quarter of 2014 and into 2015, as well as the impact of the decline of price of oil on
the global economic outlook.
These factors will affect the 2015 forecast for most multinational companies, including Abbott, but while many are
focused on the negative aspects of these events, I'd note that they will impact countries and companies in different
ways. Abbott will clearly face some headwinds where emerging market currencies have devalued; however, underlying
fundamental growth remains strong. In fact, countries such as India and China, where Abbott has a strong presence,
will benefit economically from the lower price of oil. And while the weakening of the euro impacts our
European-based revenue, the fluctuations of this particular currency will not impact our bottom line as a result of our
European cost base.
And this should provide some durability to our results. So while I'll discuss currency in more detail when I review our
2015 outlook, the bulk of my remarks here will address what we control; our commercial and operational execution,
our new product introductions and our efforts to reduce costs and expand margins.
So for the full year 2014, we delivered operational sales growth of 5.5%, including acquisitions. Sales growth rates
improved sequentially each quarter last year as we expected, and sales in emerging markets increased nearly 13%. We
expanded both gross and operating margins and achieved adjusted earnings per share of $2.28, including results related
to the established pharmaceutical developed markets business. This exceeded our guidance range and represents
year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of more than 13%.
During the year, we continued to build Abbott's investment identity as a durable and reliable growth company.
Following a number of actions we took last year, we're broader and deeper in emerging markets, and we're more
consumer-facing. In short, we are more present where the growth in healthcare is taking place now and will be over the
long term.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, we further positioned the division for faster growth. We added CFR Pharmaceuticals,
which provides the scale, manufacturing, R&D and product portfolio to establish Abbott as a top 10 pharma company
in Latin America. We acquired Veropharm, positioning Abbott as a top five branded generics company in Russia. Both
CFR and Veropharm provide Abbott with in-country manufacturing to bring us closer to our customers as well as better
match our costs with our sales and currency in those regions. And we're on track to close on the sale of the EPD
developed markets business in the first quarter, a business that performed above expectations in 2014 and is
well-positioned to move forward with Mylan.

Last year, in our Nutrition business, we increased our local presence by investing in our global infrastructure. We
opened three new manufacturing plants in China, India and the U.S., and we partnered with the world's largest dairy
cooperative, Fonterra, to invest locally in China's milk supply. These investments are a reflection of the strong
underlying demand for our high-quality Adult and Pediatric products.
In Medical Devices, we've positioned our portfolio for stronger growth over the long term. We entered the $3 billion
fast-growing electrophysiology market through the acquisition of Topera.
In Vascular, we achieved improved reimbursement and coverage for MitraClip in the U.S., which should further
expand adoption, and we presented the first of multiple randomized clinical trials underway for Absorb.
In Medical Optics, we broke ground on a new facility in Malaysia to expand manufacturing capacity for our cataract
lenses, driven by strong global demand for cataract surgery.
And in Diabetes Care, we established a new market with our Flash Glucose Monitoring Device, FreeStyle Libre,
launched directly to consumers in Europe last fall. It eliminates the need for routine fingersticks and provides glucose
data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.
In Diagnostics, we delivered another year of mid-single digit to high single digit growth, well balanced across both the
developed world and emerging markets. And in Europe, we introduced our IRIDICA Testing System, what we believe
will be a breakthrough in infectious disease testing.
We're entering 2015 with good momentum. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and the underlying trends
across our markets remain positive. The innovations we're launching are driving share gains, and we're investing in our
businesses to drive above-market growth over the long term. We expect a step-up in our 2015 sales growth rate, the
high single digit operational growth, including acquisitions, with emerging markets expected to contribute another year
of double digit performance.
From a currency perspective, we expect around a 6% negative impact to sales from foreign exchange. This is roughly
double the impact we had expected just three months ago and is in line with what a number of other companies and
analysts have forecasted as part of their outlooks for 2015. Currency is a headwind that's impacting all multinationals,
and our assumption for this impact has been incorporated into our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance from
continued operations of $2.10 a share to $2.20 a share, reflecting top tier growth at the midpoint of the range. Strong
business performance and growth in operating margin expansion has and will continue to help offset even these more
pronounced currency impacts in 2015.
At the same time, we need to continue to invest in our businesses to drive sustainable long-term growth. And in 2015,
I'm optimistic about our prospects.
In Nutrition, our R&D organization has been the most productive it's ever been, launching multiple products over the
last several years. In 2014, in China, this included two new infant formula products, Eleva and Similac QINTI in new
market segments. We expect continued momentum in 2015, including our new Ensure product in China, which is the
first product introduced in the new newly established Adult Nutrition category in this country.
We are also building our brand in India. Local R&D, manufacturing and supply chain are fully established. We recently
rolled out our first line of Similac products produced in our new state-of-the-art facility.
Margin improvement remains a key priority for our Nutrition business, and we expanded its operating margin by
several hundred basis points each of the last two years. Our original target was to reach 20% of sales by 2015, and we
exceeded that goal in 2014. Going forward, we expect further margin expansion in this business.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, we are continuing to improve our commercial execution by strengthening our
capabilities in key geographies and channels, expanding our product portfolios through innovation that is both fast and
locally driven, and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers who are taking even greater role in making
decisions about their healthcare.

We are also strengthening our local scale and infrastructure through the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals and
Veropharm. Both of these acquisitions enhance our local market insights knowhow and our commercial capabilities as
well as help build out our portfolios in our core therapeutic areas.
And finally as I mentioned, we anticipate closing on the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan in the first
quarter. We will receive 110 million shares of Mylan stock which provides us with significant optionality given our
strong balance sheet and ability to redeploy the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of Mylan shares.
In Medical Devices, we are investing in a number of new products across Diabetes Care, Vascular and Medical Optics.
In Medical Optics, in our cataract business, a steady stream of new products over the last two years has resulted in
several points of share gain. In 2015, we expect continued strong growth of our cataract business driven by more than
20 new product launches across multiple geographies as well as continued expansion of our laser cataract system,
Catalys.
In Vascular, we're continuing to drive updates of our new products, MitraClip, Supera and Absorb, as well as our
newest drug eluting stent, XIENCE Alpine, launched in the U.S. and recently approved in Japan.
In Diabetes Care, we'll expand FreeStyle Libre into multiple new markets over time, targeting the more than $8 billion
global blood glucose monitoring market. Strong patient awareness has exceeded our initial expectations based on our
direct-to-patient sales model. We are already executing on a capacity expansion, and we're working to secure broader
reimbursement for Libre.
And finally, Diagnostics, which remains one of our most durable and reliable growth businesses, consistently
delivering mid-single digit to high single digit operational sales growth for past four years. We'll continue to execute on
our commercial strategy in Core Laboratory Diagnostics in both developed and developing markets. We are also
investing simultaneously in the development of next-generation system platforms in blood screening, immunoassay,
clinical chemistry, hematology, molecular diagnostics and point of care.
Margin improvement in Diagnostics once again exceeded our expectations, increasing nearly 100 basis points versus
2013. Our gross margin improvement initiatives are continuing to yield results, and we expect continued steady margin
expansion in this business.
So to summarize, as we enter 2015, we expect a step-up in full year 2015 operational sales growth into the high single
digits, with double digit growth in emerging markets; and we expect continued gross and operating margin expansion
as we execute on our division improvement programs and back office support initiatives.
While we anticipate currency to be a more significant headwind this year than in 2014, the long-term fundamentals of
our business are healthy, and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders. In addition, to our dividend
and share repurchase activity, our strong balance sheet and additional flexibility from the Mylan transaction provide us
with a significant opportunity to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long-term
durable growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2014 results in more detail and the 2015 outlook. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. Before I review our financial performance and outlook, I'd like to remind you that my remarks today
regarding 2014 earnings per share will include the contributions from the developed markets branded generics business
that we've agreed to sell to Mylan and the Animal Health business that we've agreed to sell to Zoetis. Both of these
transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. This basis of comparison is consistent with the adjusted
EPS guidance we provided in October; however, my comments for sales and other P&L line items this quarter and for
our 2015 forecast will be for continuing operations only, that is excluding the businesses being sold.
Today, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.71, above our previous guidance
range due to the full year effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December, including the R&D tax credit for 2014.

Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 29% in the fourth quarter.
We saw strong operational sales growth and increasing sales momentum in the fourth quarter. Sales from continuing
operations increased 10.2% on an operational basis in the quarter, which includes the impact from the recent CFR
Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm acquisitions. Operational sales excluding these acquisitions increased 6.5% in the
quarter.
Reported sales increased 5.6% in the quarter, including an impact of 4.6% from foreign exchange. The negative impact
of foreign exchange on sales was almost twice as high as the estimate we provided in October, reflecting strengthening
in the U.S. dollar versus almost every currency during the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in Nutrition, Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals.
Total company sales in emerging markets increased strong double digits on an operational basis in the quarter. Fourth
quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, ahead of our previous guidance reflecting underlying gross
margin improvements across the businesses as well as the impact of the weaker euro on our manufacturing cost base.
Adjusted SG&A expense was 29.5% of sales, and adjusted R&D investment was 6.4% of sales. The fourth quarter
adjusted tax rate was below our previous forecast due entirely to the inclusion of the full year impact of U.S. tax
legislation enacted in December that I mentioned earlier.
Overall, as we look at 2014, we delivered strong EPS growth above our initial guidance range and up more than 13%
versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew 21%. We continued to make significant progress
in our margin improvement initiatives, expanding our full year adjusted operating margin from continuing operations
by 200 basis points. And importantly, we exited the year with a strong underlying momentum as we head into 2015.
As I turn to our outlook for 2015, I'd note that as detailed in our earnings release, in 2014 we achieved adjusted EPS
from continuing operations of $1.98. This is the new baseline against which we will be measuring EPS growth in 2015.
Miles indicated the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting our 2015 growth as it is for most
multinational companies. Based on current exchange rates, the impact of foreign exchange on our sales will be even
more pronounced in 2015 than it was last year with a negative impact on 2015 sales growth of around 6% compared to
2.5% for the full year of 2014.
Although, the impact of currency will be significant in 2015, it is important to note that, as I mentioned earlier, we
exited last year with strong underlying performance momentum. Our top line operational growth accelerated
significantly in the second half of the year as expected, and we continue to make substantial progress on our margin
expansion initiatives. Importantly, the underlying trends across the key geographies and healthcare segments in which
we compete remain positive and attractive over the long-term, driven by improving access to healthcare and
demographic trends that are aligned to our businesses. So despite recent currency dynamics, we are well-positioned to
deliver strong EPS growth in 2015.
So turning to the specifics of our outlook for the full year 2015, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per
share from continuing operations of $2.10 to $2.20, which reflects growth of around 8.5% over 2014. At current
exchange rates, currency would negatively impact 2015 EPS growth reflected in this guidance by around 10%. We
forecast operational sales growth from continuing operations in the high single digits for the full year 2015.
As noted, at current exchange rates, we'd expect negative impact of around 6% on our full year reported sales, which
will result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015. Brian will provide more detail on the
2015 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57% of sales for the full your 2015, reflecting more than
150 basis points of expansion driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. I'd note that at
current exchange rates the impact from foreign exchange on our gross margin ratio is expected to be relatively neutral
in 2015, as the impact of exchange on sales will be largely offset by the benefit we will realize from the weaker euro on
our European based manufacturing costs.

We forecast adjusted R&D investment as a percent of sales consistent with 2014 levels at around 6.5% of sales, and we
forecast adjusted SG&A expense of around 31% of sales for the full year as we invest some of the savings from our
efficiency programs in new products across our businesses to drive top line growth. Overall, we expect to expand our
full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015, reflecting another year of significant margin
expansion.
We forecast interest expense of around $150 million, up over 2014 due to a planned refinancing of a portion of our
short-term debt, an expectation of higher U.S. short-term interest rates impacting short-term debt in the second half of
the year and somewhat lower interest income as a result of the funding of 2014 acquisitions.
We forecast an adjusted tax rate of 19% for the full year 2015, which is in line with the normalized 2014 rate excluding
the effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Our forecast does not assume reenactment of the U.S. R&D
tax credit in 2015.
Finally, I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter of 2015. For the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings
per share from continuing operations of $0.41 to $0.43, which reflects growth of over 23% at the midpoint of the range
over adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2014 of $0.34. This strong growth, even in light of
currency headwinds, is driven by strong underlying performance as well as favorable year-over-year comparisons, due
to certain items that reduced sales and earnings in the first quarter of last year, including the carryover effects of the
2013 supplier recall in Nutrition, the timing of a plant shutdown in EPD to expand capacity, and reimbursement
changes effecting our U.S. Diabetes business.
For the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, while we forecast strong underlying adjusted EPS growth, this
performance will be partially offset by the significant impact of foreign exchange on EPS growth in each quarter of the
year. This would result in adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digits or mid-to-upper single digits depending on the
quarter over the last three quarters of 2015 as we work through the exchange headwinds that began in late 2014.
Returning to our first quarter forecast, we project operational sales growth in the high single digits, and at current
exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange approaching 7%, resulting in reported sales growth in the
low single digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense somewhat
above 34% of sales, consistent with the relatively higher ratio we typically experience in the first quarter and reflecting
investment in growth initiatives.
We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales, net interest expense of around $30 million, and around
$20 million of income in the exchange gains and non-operating income lines in the P&L.
In summary, we delivered another year of strong adjusted EPS growth in 2014, exceeding our initial guidance range;
and exited the year with strong momentum, including sequential improvements in operational sales growth each quarter
of the year and significant operating margin expansion. This strong underlying performance and momentum positions
us well to deliver durable growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment. Our 2015 outlook reflects top
tier ongoing EPS growth driven by high single digit operational sales growth and continued operating margin
expansion.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Brian B. Yoor
All right. Thank you, Tom. This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter 2014 performance and 2015 sales outlook by
business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I'll start with our Nutrition business, where global sales increased 9% in the fourth quarter. In our International
Pediatric Nutrition business, sales increased 14%. We continued to capture market share with new infant formula
products, including Similac QINTI and Eleva, which we launched in China during 2014 to further enhance competitive

position in our relevant market segments.
International Adult Nutrition sales increased 13% in the quarter, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double
digit sales growth in this business as we continue to expand the Adult Nutrition category internationally. Earlier this
month, we launched our Ensure brand in China. Although we expect modest sales initially, the Adult Nutrition market
in China represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Abbott. The aging population is expected to grow to
four times the size of the U.S. Baby Boomer population.
In the United States, Pediatric Nutrition sales were relatively flat in the quarter and in line with our expectations, as
share gains in the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market were offset by lower sales in the WIC segment. Adult
Nutrition sales in the U.S. were impacted by volume and price dynamics in the institutional segment and by softness in
our Performance Nutrition business.
For the full year 2015, we will continue to focus on capturing market share with recently launched Infant Nutrition
products and expanding the Adult Nutrition category internationally, including developing and shaping the Adult
Nutrition market in China. We are forecasting high single digit growth on an operational basis in our Global Nutrition
business with double digit operational sales growth in International Nutrition. For the first quarter, we expect the
Global Nutrition business to deliver mid-single digit to high single digit sales growth on an operational basis.
In our Diagnostics business, sales increased 8.6% in the fourth quarter with sales in emerging markets growing double
digits. Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales also increased 8.6% with high single digit growth in both the U.S. and
internationally as we continue to build momentum with our commercial model.
We are also expanding our testing menu in order to provide greater value to clinical laboratories and ultimately
patients. In the fourth quarter, we received U.S. FDA clearance for the first fully automated Galectin-3 test for use with
our ARCHITECT platform. This test assists doctors in assessing the prognosis of people diagnosed with chronic heart
failure.
Additionally, a study on our high sensitive troponin test previously launched on ARCHITECT generated new data that
was recently published in the British Medical Journal. The study found that Abbott's test can precisely measure very
low levels of troponin, which may help doctors accurately diagnose twice as many heart attacks in women compared to
standard troponin tests.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales increased 4.4% in the quarter. Our infectious disease business, which is our core focus
and represents more than half of our Molecular Diagnostics sales, increased double digits in the quarter. This growth
was partially offset by decline in the oncology and genetics businesses in the U.S. resulting from pricing and market
channel dynamics.
As Miles mentioned, in December, we received European approval for our IRIDICA infectious disease testing
platform. IRIDICA is a first-of-its-kind platform that more rapidly diagnoses serious infections, such as sepsis or
pneumonia, in critically ill patients and has the potential to lower associated healthcare costs by up to 30%.
In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 14% as this business continues to build and expand its
presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. The Point of Care business had a considerably strong fourth
quarter in the U.S. due in part to customers ordering Abbott's i-STAT Analyzers as part of their Ebola preparedness
activities.
In addition, a major hospital network in the U.S. standardized its point of care testing around Abbott's market leading
i-STAT platform, which also contributed to strong growth in the fourth quarter. We expect another year of durable
performance in our Diagnostics business in 2015 as we continue to execute on our commercial model on Core
Laboratory Diagnostics, drive uptake of our new IRIDICA infectious disease platform in Molecular Diagnostics in
Europe, and increase market penetration with our Point of Care platform.
At the same time, we continue development of our next-generation platforms across all three businesses. These systems
are being designed to positively impact patient care, improve service to customers, enhance laboratory productivity and
reduce costs. For the full year 2015, we expect our Global Diagnostics business to generate operational growth that is

similar to our performance in 2014. For the first quarter in Global Diagnostics, we are forecasting low single digit to
mid-single digit operational sales growth.
In Medical Devices, we completed the acquisition of Topera in the fourth quarter. Topera provides Abbott with a
foundational entry in the $3 billion fast-growing electrophysiology market. Its breakthrough technology can transform
how physicians treat people with complex heart rhythm disorders.
Our Vascular business increased 1.7% in the quarter, representing a sequential improvement versus the third quarter of
2014 and somewhat above our previous guidance. In our structural heart business, we continued to see strong double
digit sales growth on MitraClip, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation.
Our Endovascular business also generated double digit growth in the quarter driven by our Supera Peripheral Stent for
the superficial femoral artery, or SFA. In November, we presented long-term Supera data that demonstrated very strong
freedom from target lesion revascularization rate of 94% at three years.
In the fourth quarter, we launched our new drug eluting stent system, XIENCE Alpine, in the U.S. XIENCE Alpine is
the only drug eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions. We've recently received XIENCE Alpine
regulatory approval in Japan and expect to launch it in the next few months following reimbursement approval.
We are also making regulatory progress with our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold, Absorb, which we expect to submit
for approval in the U.S., China and Japan by the end of this year. These three geographies represent more than 50% of
the world's coronary stent market. For the full year and first quarter 2015, we expect sales in our Global Vascular
business to increase modestly on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, global sales in the fourth quarter were down mid-single digits, in line with our expectations, as the
rate of decline in the U.S. is moderating following the U.S. reimbursement changes that were enacted in the middle of
2013. Outside of the United States, we launched our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology, FreeStyle Libre,
direct to consumers. With the launch of FreeStyle Libre, we expect our Global Diabetes business to return to low single
digit growth on an operational basis in 2015. For the first quarter, we are also forecasting low single digit operational
sales growth in our Diabetes Care business.
In Medical Optics, sales increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter and 8.5% for the full year. Sales of our cataract products,
which represent approximately 70% of our Medical Optics business, increased high single digits globally in the quarter.
This growth was partially offset by market declines in the refractive and corneal segments of the Medical Optics
business.
In 2015, we look forward to multiple new product launches across a number of key geographies as well as continued
penetration of our Catalys laser cataract system. The first of these new products are TECNIS Multifocal Low Add
premium intraocular lens, which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons, will soon launch in the
U.S. For the full year 2015, we expect our Global Medical Optics business to grow mid-single digits to high single
digits on an operational basis with low single digit to mid-single digit growth in the first quarter.
And lastly, our Established Pharmaceutical business, or EPD, where sales from continuing operations, excluding the
developed market branded generics pharmaceuticals business, increased strong double digits in the quarter. As Miles
mentioned, we completed the acquisitions of CFR and Veropharm last year but at the same time generated strong
underlying performance from our EPD emerging market business.
Excluding the sales contributions from acquisitions, organic sales increased nearly 9.5% in the quarter. This
performance was driven by double digit sales growth across several emerging geographies, including India, Russia and
China. For the full year 2015, we expect continued strong double digit growth in EPD on an operational basis,
including the impact of acquisitions, as this business continues to expand product portfolios in key therapeutic areas,
implements new branding initiatives across the portfolio, and increases its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channel.
Excluding the contributions from our acquisitions made in 2014, we expect high single digit operational sales growth in
EPD for the full year 2015. For the first quarter, we are also forecasting strong double digit growth in EPD on an
operational basis, including the impact of acquisitions.

So in summary, we achieved our expectations in 2014. Sales growth improved sequentially every quarter this year, we
exceeded our earnings per share expectations, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points, and we
completed several actions to continue to position Abbott for durable growth. As we look ahead to 2015, we are
well-positioned to deliver a sequential improvement in operational sales growth and another year of top tier earnings
per share growth.
We will now open the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions, guys. Let me touch maybe on two
topics. So the first, Tom, could you talk a little bit more about FX, the impact on 2015? And how should we think about
your ability to manage through the additional dollar strengthening going forward?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well I pretty much covered that in my remarks. We talked about 6% based on current
rates on the top line, and there is about a 10% headwind on our earnings growth year-over-year. Historically, as those
of you that follow us know, within any one year, we have done a pretty good job of managing through what I call
normal fluctuations in currency. And really it has not affected our performance against our expectations.
And going forward from this point, assuming the major moves that happened, we would expect something similar in
2015. I think what everyone is seeing in this season is that there are limits if there are major, major moves, but I'd say
anything within the normal levels of fluctuations we'd continue to do what we have done in the past.
<A - Miles D. White>: Mike, I would add to that. We may have an unusual mix of currencies relative to a lot of
multinationals. For us, for example, the euro is not an impact, because we just happen to have enough cost
manufacturing and other things in Europe that it pretty much self-hedges. So as we look forward at the year, one of the
more uncertain currencies might be the euro, and that won't affect us. We are pretty protected on that. And a rather
backhanded, I guess, bit of good fortune, I don't really expect the ruble to impact us very much because it already did,
and it already impacted us pretty significantly in 2014.
So when we look forward at the particular currencies that are most likely to be volatile or might have risk, and I have
no corner on a crystal ball here to know what is going to happen, certainly no one would have projected any of the
things that happened this last year. I think that where we are likely or possibly going to see volatility in FX, we are in a
pretty good position.
And so we don't anticipate it impacting us like it could some. And we've already had the impact in 2014 and others and
absorbed that and we always go into the year with a little bit of cushion and contingency just in case. So I think we are
probably in as good a place as we ever have been in spite of how heavy the headwind is of FX in general for all
countries.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Miles, let me ask the strategic question. So you exit 2014 with the underlying business in
really good shape. Obviously not all pieces are doing as well as you'd like, but in the aggregate it looks very strong,
obviously a lot stronger than it did, say, 12 months ago, 18 months ago. So what are the strategic priorities and in
particular in the context of your balance sheet and what your balance sheet could look like, so you'd monetize your
Mylan stake over the next several months?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I assumed that question would come up at some point. My first priority is to get the deal
closed. And you may know that their shareholder vote concludes today. We have got some really good news here in the
last week in terms of EU approval for the deal and so forth. So I expect to get that closed pretty quickly here. I don't
want to forecast where or what we might be looking at or considering. I do want to add to the business; I do want to add

to the company in places where we either want to expand our footprint or can certainly expand the strength of our
footprint without telegraphing where that might be. I mean, as you know, I don't always telegraph those things ahead of
time and yet, we have been pretty consistent at the kinds of things we are interested in.
I think we have got a lot of capacity and presuming that everything concludes properly here with our Mylan
transaction, we have got a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity. And I think I want to make good strategic deals that
are prudent. I think that is a little more difficult these days. It's not difficult to be prudent. It's difficult to find a lot of
good opportunities that fit.
A lot of price tags out there have very ambitious expectations and I don't think it is as rich or robust an M&A
environment as we've seen in other years. But having said that, I still see plenty of opportunities for us to expand and
add to the business. And it's just a question of right timing, right receptivity on the other side, right values and finding
some overlap. I think the good news is, I think you only want to really add to a sound foundation and sometimes if you
do M&A to patch something that is not working in the core of the company, doesn't always work that well.
And we have had a lot of disintegration to get through here separating from AbbVie. That is pretty much concluded;
getting close. We have got the same thing we're working through on the EPD developed market business. You want
your organization ready for the integration of whatever you may do, however big or small it may be. And I think we are
in a good place where the underlying performance of all the businesses is really good.
You're right, there's places I'd rather see better commercial performance but overall, it's very stable. Internal
organization has the other paths and distractions pretty much concluded. So we couldn't be more ready, and positioned
better with a good, strong balance sheet. Having said that, I know it doesn't give you any sort of indication of where,
what, when, et cetera. But we're obviously observing, looking, hunting.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: And, Miles, a comment about targets. Ideally, with the cash you're going to have outside
of the U.S. in your balance sheet, an ideal target would be outside of the U.S. Are there no shortage of targets for you
outside of the U.S.? Do you see opportunities there?
<A - Miles D. White>: I see a lot of targets outside of the U.S. A lot of them have high valuation expectations that are,
I think, a little unrealistic in some cases. But in the grand scheme of things, I think that's just negotiation. And I think
there is a lot – I think the external, ex to the U.S., is in a fashion not quite target-rich but there is a lot that can be done
to expand our business and our presence in a number of key countries. I don't rule out the U.S. I think that there is still
opportunity in the U.S.; it's just a lot more selective. And obviously, financially speaking, it's a lot easier to deploy cash
that's outside of the U.S., which there is going to be a lot of, and that is a lot easier under today's tax regimes.
So, it's probably a more attractive environment than a lot of our monitoring and hunting, if you will, is outside of the
U.S. The good news is we've been in these countries outside of the U.S. a long time and we know them reasonably
well. In a lot of cases, the kinds of businesses that we are interested in outside of the U.S. are family-owned or
family-sponsored. It's a little different environment in the U.S. or European markets, but we're comfortable there. We're
comfortable navigating there. We've had a fair amount of experience there. And that's a plus for us.
I think in the last couple of years, we have been able to accomplish some pretty unique and unusual acquisitions. I think
Veropharm was pretty unusual, particularly given that we were well into it when the Ukraine issue happened and made
it more difficult. And I would say I pat the CFO on the back here for having the presence of mind to do this deal in
rubles so we were not exposed to exchange on that particular deal. I think it's a fabulous deal for us long-term in Russia
and that's an important market for us and we anticipated – we didn't wish for the devaluation of the ruble but we were
prepared for it.
So I think there's a number of places where there's opportunities for us outside of the U.S. that aren't necessarily that
visible to U.S. investors or U.S. analysts. I know you know that but there is a lot out there that enhances what we're
trying to do with the business and where we believe the growth opportunities are and where we can leverage the
already existing infrastructure we have.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Perfect. Thank you, Miles. I'll let some others jump in.

Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you could just focus on the margins
and the underlying performance; what stands out the most to me is just the guidance in terms of the EPS being up 8.5%
at the midpoint, despite a 10% FX headwind. Can you maybe just walk through the confidence in the underlying
margin expansion? And then also just touch on the fourth quarter gross margin, because that came in much better than
we were anticipating.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'll make a couple of comments about it, Kristen, and then I'll hand it over to Tom for a
little more color here. First of all, I think, we had a head start here because with the separation of AbbVie, as we've said
in past calls, we took a very comprehensive look at our G&A costs and our underlying costs in manufacturing and other
things across the company. And we've had initiatives in all of our divisions pointed at that for some time and we've had
some very good success with improvement of cost and improvement of expenses in the company in a variety of ways
and I highlighted Nutrition and Diagnostics as two that stand out where we've had tremendous improvement in
underlying costs, costs structure.
The unfortunate thing is that given the exchange rates that multinationals have experienced around the world and so
forth, some of that has been chewed up or at least that improvement in our cost and expense structure has protected us
from erosion from exchange and it continues to. Ideally, we want to keep improving those costs over time which we
believe we can. But the single biggest cost we've had has been exchange and I think you can see that in the top line.
The good news is in a lot of cases we have our cost structure and our expense structure distributed among the countries
where we have the highest sales and profits. And so it does offset to some degree the impact of exchange on the sales
line.
And what you'll see is, when it hurts the sales line, it improves the gross margin. It is just offsetting. So part of the
improvement that you see in our gross margin is being in the right places when exchange hits us so that we can mitigate
the impact on our profits and we got a big head start on that two years ago when we split. So we've been well prepared
to sort of absorb what's happening. It would have been our intent to have much higher earnings, but in fact, it has
absorbed the impact and kept us at a, I'd say, a performance level that's really good but we could have hoped for more
had it not been for that.
Tom, you want to give some more color on that?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I'd just add a couple of things. Recall that when we announced the EPD developed
markets transaction, we said that the underlying growth rate of Abbott was about 2% better on a continuing operations
basis than it was before so certainly that's giving a little more oomph to our growth than what you might have expected.
And I think the other thing, and it's really all about the manufacturing margin, or gross margin that Miles alluded to. In
the last two years, we've had relatively flat gross margin and what we've been saying is that has been in spite of the
really strong cost improvement programs Miles talked about, because currency was hurting our gross margin. But that
was because the euro was strong, and that was keeping our costs for that particular large manufacturing cost base up
pretty high.
But now the euro is moving with the other currencies and the real benefit of the real actions in our manufacturing plants
and our operations people are really starting to show through the gross margin now that the euro is matching where the
other currencies are going direction-wise. So I think those are a couple of differences that really are the basis for our
relatively stronger EPS growth rate in 2015 than what you might be seeing from other companies.
<A - Miles D. White>: I mean, make no mistake, if we weren't, all of us, facing some of this currency headwind,
earnings would be even stronger.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And I guess just in light of all the portfolio moves, how do you look at longer-term
growth? Do you feel very well-positioned in the mid-single digit to high single digit, and certainly it sounds like double
digit EPS growth forecast?

<A - Miles D. White>: Well, it's always our intent to be in that range, or better. And I'd say yes, I feel pretty good
about that. I mean, I say this with caution because I would not have predicted the things that happened in the latter half
of the year in 2014, and I don't think there's many people that would have predicted what happened in 2014 towards the
end of the year, either in what happened with the price of oil, what happened with interest rates, what happened with
exchange rates, et cetera.
So that said, all things being equal, yes, I expect that we can maintain healthy high single digit sales growth rate and
double digit bottom line growth rate. That's our intent. That's our goal. We think that's kind of the identity and
expectation of the company. And so every year, and every LRP, every long range plan is sort of built around the
expectation of maintenance of that, and we've always got sort of a long-term view of where we believe those growth
and share opportunities are. And I'd say so far, so good, and I don't see any reason to expect less.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And just to clarify, you said high single digit sales or mid-single digit to high single digit?
<A - Miles D. White>: Mid-single digit to high single digit. To be clear, I'm always pushing for more. In reality, today,
mid single digit's pretty good. And I can remember when mid-single digit was a disaster; and today mid-single digit
looks pretty good. And I guess if the market, the world, all of us are down long enough, anything looks good. But I
think we target that range. I mean, if we steadily are in that mid-single digit to high single digit range, we're going to be
targeting high single digit, and if we're steadily in the high single digit range, we're going to be targeting double digit.
It's going to be always wanting to do a little better than, or maybe a lot better than, what the market gives you.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Perfect. Thanks very much.
Operator
And our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I wanted just to start on the U.S. as obviously
markets outside the United States were very strong for you in the quarter. But maybe you could just talk a little bit
broadly about your U.S. franchises, particularly in the context of what looks to have been a better operating
environment domestically, whether it's what we're seeing out of the hospitals or some of the other volume-related
companies. How do you sort of think about the evolution of your U.S. franchise in 2015 and beyond?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd say that I think the U.S. – first of all, it's a very important market to us. It's a big market to
us. It's our largest market and three of our major businesses are large and important here. And one, the Established
Pharmaceutical business, is not here at all in the U.S. I'd say it's interesting to me – most shareholders and analysts that
I listen to today or hear from will tell me the U.S. is better. I think better relative to what? I don't think that the
healthcare environment for healthcare products companies in the U.S. is that much better, to be honest. I don't think it's
a robust market. I think it's a reaction to the kind of sudden volatility that a lot of companies have experienced outside
of the U.S. and we tend to like predictability in this country, and we tend to like our predictability in quarterly doses.
But I look at the markets long term, and I think, look, the U.S. is a healthy market. It's important for products, but I
don't consider it in our businesses a particularly robust growth market. And that means that as we look at the U.S., our
expectations are to be in good single digit range and remain profitable and healthy here, but the real growth, even in
this volatile market, worldwide, is outside of the U.S. For I think for healthcare products, for pharmaceuticals, for
devices, for the products that we're in, I think the growth rates are much better outside of the U.S.
We just have to navigate the volatility of what that means. And in that case, there's probably 15 countries around the
world, maybe 20 countries, depending on what company you are, that are important at varying degrees as growth
opportunities, market development opportunities, et cetera, and as those economies are developing or recovering as the
case may be, I think the underlying fundamentals of growth in those markets exceed the U.S.
That doesn't mean the U.S. is bad. I think the U.S. is better than it's been, but it hasn't been particularly good. So better
is easy. It's a low hurdle. And while we say the U.S. is more solid today, I think the U.S. today isn't necessarily a better

growth market. It's just a lot more stable and predictable than a lot of markets around the world. You guys want to add
to that?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: No. I'd just say, I mean, even as we look at 2015, putting currency aside again, we're
looking at growth rates 2X, 3X, 4X, what the U.S. is, and it underscores Miles' point that that's where the growth is. But
we do see improvements in some of our U.S. businesses in 2015. Diagnostics has continued to be a pretty good
performer there relative to the lower growth market, and ADC is now moving into better territory and we do have some
new product activity in Vascular, which can help you outgrow a slow-growth market. And things like MitraClip and
Supera and XIENCE Alpine are going to help us do a little bit better in that business in 2015. But the relative growth
rates, I'd just back it what Miles says, there's no comparison and that's why we've pursued and invested more in these
higher growth markets.
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd tell you, one last comment on it. In the U.S., and frankly it's good for any company around
the world in any country. But here in the U.S., you're not going to get a lot of tailwind of growth, and so you better be
prepared to innovate and slug it out for share. And you got to look at it that way that you've got to win. You've got to
beat a competitor. You can't just take a tailwind. And we've got to keep improving our products and got to keep putting
out better products and gain our share that way.
The thing I'm heartened by is that when I look across all of our businesses and divisions and their R&D pipelines and
the products they're bringing, whether they are incremental innovation or maybe substantial innovation like Libre in our
Diabetes Care business, they're really good products and they really will make a difference and they really will drive
share gain and growth.
So that actually I look forward to as a real positive here over the next let's call it two years to five years as we keep
bringing out more and more new products. It keeps us and makes us more competitive in markets like the U.S. Frankly,
the reverse side of that is in markets where you've got a great tailwind of growth, you tend not to be as sharp in terms of
competitiveness because you are getting that tailwind of growth. And so I think it's actually healthy for us to be both
ways, and we'll get the benefit of our new products and new innovations in all markets.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's a helpful perspective. And maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions
around M&A and strategic vision here. I think the language that you've used on the past couple of calls is looking as a
reshape Abbott in 2014 was obviously a busy year in that regard. Can you maybe give us some more perspective on
reshape Abbott into what?
I mean what is sort of the long-term vision here given all the moving parts? And are we looking at this as a four-legged
stool for a sustainable period of time? Is the mix of business one that makes sense here? Ultimately when you're done
with that reshaping, what do you want Abbott to look like?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I like the foundation we've got. I like the four legs that we have if we want to describe
them as four legs. We've talked off and on from time to time about whether something is truly a fifth leg or whether it
relates to our current structure. I mean, for example, a lot of people wouldn't necessarily see the branded generic
pharmaceutical business as an efficient business as related but truthfully, overseas, they go through all the same
channels. They go through the same wholesalers, they go through the same retail outlets, they go through the same
pharmaceutical or pharmacies and so forth. And they're very consumer-facing in the markets and targets we've focused
on.
And so there's a lot of I'd call it brand synergy and customer synergy and consumer synergy among them. So those are
pluses for us. And we are not in, other than in our Nutrition business and in a way, our branded generic business, we're
not fully in the OTC business but, yes, I'll just use it as a wild example because I think if someone brings me an
opportunity here that says, well look, it's got this, this and this and oh, by the way, it's got OTC. Would you reject it
with the OTC? I think, well you know, I wouldn't in some countries. Does that mean I'm looking for that to try to
compete with say a P&G in the U.S.? No, I'm not. But if in a country like India where the overlap of OTX/OTC,
branded generic pharma and Nutrition is such that that was an expansion opportunity, it would strategically fit really
well with our infrastructure in India.

So I'd say it kind of depends. And I think we are much stronger when we can add two businesses we already know and
already understand the operating models of and know how we can leverage both the business, the brands, the
infrastructure, et cetera, much like we are with CFR in Latin America. But I want to be cautious not to rule out
opportunities that I think are long-term expansions for us. I look at Medical Optics, and you know when we made that
acquisition a number of years ago, well there was some criticism that, gee, that's kind of far afield for you. And it isn't.
It's now a nice strong growth driver for us. Would I add to it? I would if I see the right opportunities and the right
circumstances.
So I think that the related business is here. They all have a couple of things in common. They all are in growing
markets. They're all innovation driven. They're all durable. They are durable in terms of their growth rates, and I
compare that to the pharma business that we used to be in. You know, pharma is a fabulous business if you get all the
way to the finish line and launch a product. And it's a risky business. It's the science that's so risky with the
pharmaceuticals, and so it's a different business model.
Without the pharmaceutical business, that particular pharmaceutical business which has been tremendously successful,
separate from Abbott, we are more of a durable growth company. A lot of people would interpret durable a number of
different ways. I think it's at least mid-single digit to high single digit growth. I think it's not particularly volatile in
terms of patent expirations, and so forth; although, it might benefit from IP like our device businesses do and so on. But
it's got a certain stability to it while it's also growth and innovation driven.
And I think that the long-term identity of Abbott has been to be growth, to be relatively reliable, to be real growth, and
to return cash, et cetera, to shareholders as it grows. And that's been the identity of the company for a long time. I think
the mix of countries and products that we're in delivers that identity without a lot of harsh volatility. And I think an
example would be the environment we are in right now. If we can weather 2014 and 2015 with what is happening in
the world economies and in the world markets and so forth, and deliver the results we are delivering, I think we are
absolutely living up to the identity of a very reliable, durable, profitable growth company. And that's what this mix of
businesses and mix of geographies does. And I think it's a bit unique that way.
But I think that's the intent of what we are trying to do. Whether there is room for a fifth leg or sixth leg in there, I think
kind of depends. And I think we kind of take our opportunities as they come. We know what we are good at. We know
what we are not good at or don't know about. If we are looking at some acquisition or business to add to the company,
my first question is, can we add to it? Can we do better? Because it's in our hands. And I think that's a critical threshold
for us to hold ourselves to as we invest shareholder money.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate all the perspective. And congrats on a good quarter and first
start to 2015.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. I just want to come back to the guidance for a quick second. I think the
earnings numbers were largely in line with many expectations, but the revenue outlook has been, I think, more bullish
this morning, and I think the stock is reacting to that. So either for Miles or Tom or Brian, thinking about this year, if
you can get acceleration, you had more difficult comps versus 2014 as the business improved in the back half of 2014.
We talked a lot about emerging market currency, but there may be some emerging market weakness investors are
concerned about.
So the first question is just what provides sort of the confidence that you can get that incremental acceleration and be
very confident in that revenue number? Is it products? Is it specific segments? Where does that momentum reside, even
in the face of EM and the face of strengthening comps, you feel pretty confident that you can deliver this top line
number? And then a quick follow-up.

<A - Miles D. White>: Yes. Let me – I think all three of us are dying to pounce on that one. Let me give a couple of
comments, and I'll hand it back to Brian and Tom to add. There is a number of moving parts here. The first thing is, I'd
say, we look at the underlying growth of the businesses. Some of them are very strong, stronger than you might see.
Some countries have stabilized and turned more positive, India as an example, than it has last year. So there's some
underlying strength here that comes from a variety of sources, number one. Number two – and there's still some I'd like
to see do better. Number two, there's the lapping of various events or unevenness in the quarterly reporting.
So for example, you'll recall last year in the first half of the year, we were lapping a recall from the prior year which
suppressed the first quarter and second quarter of 2014, which enhances the comparison for 2015. So we've got some of
that up and down in here as well. We have the launch of some new products. We have two acquisitions in here that
weren't there before that particularly affect the last half of the year, CFR and Veropharm. There will be two
subtractions from the company, which will also affect that quarter-to-quarter comparison. The Established Pharma
developed market business will be out of the mix.
So when you change the mix of the pieces and the growth rates of the various pieces, when it all comes together, it
actually looks like what we forecasted, and makes sense. It's just that there's a lot of moving parts and I think it
probably is not that easy for investors to tease those apart, put them back together, and see what it all boils down to. But
this is what it boils down to, and I'm very confident in it.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yes, David, this is Brian. And I'd say, too, it's just as like foreign exchange. I think what's going
on in the world impacts companies differently in different ways. You take for example what's going on with respect to
the price of oil; there's actually countries who benefit from this, and you see that passed all the way down through their
GDP and ultimately to the consumer. And as Miles talked about being a more consumer-facing company, clearly this is
playing out very nicely in the countries, for example, of China and India, who are net importers of oil. We're seeing
very strong performance by our Nutrition business, particularly with the launch of the products of Similac QINTI that I
referenced as well as Eleva. Recall, we just turned on promotion there towards the end of 2014, and I'd add that in
China as well, we've not only recovered to baseline, we've gone beyond shares. So, all signs are pointing positive there.
<A - Miles D. White>: David, let me add one more thing to it. Clearly, under the circumstances in the last four weeks
when so many companies have identified the currency risk that everybody's feeling and the currency hit that
everybody's feeling and the oil shock that many are feeling and the impact of that on tertiary markets and so forth, a lot
of people are necessarily having to report that it's going to impact their business. And we've all got different businesses.
In that environment, I'd have to say it's tempting to reset the bar lower. We looked at that and said no. We're not going
to reset our bar lower, and it's not because it's hard for us to stretch to do it. It's if you want to be a transparently reliable
growth company as we are, and we're already dealing with always educating our investors about the variety of
emerging markets we're in and so forth, I think it's important for us to kind of be true to what we think we're going to
do, and this is what we think we're going to do.
I mean there was a temptation to buy a little conservatism here and estimate lower and beat. We may beat anyway. But
I didn't want to take that opportunity to set lower, so I'm confident in these numbers, I'm confident in the earnings
projection. I think our mix is different than others. I think, as I pointed out earlier, we're just not vulnerable to the euro.
And a lot of companies are. And so they've got to forecast that. And I don't have the same issue. So our earnings turn
out where they are.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. And just one quick question. I'm loath to ask another balance sheet M&A question, but
I'm just going to ask and hate myself for the rest of the week. So, Miles, what are the hallmarks of how you've
approached M&A as to basically fixed exposure, right? You've obviously had this Nutritional asset, which is great
exposure, you've increased your exposure to the part of the pharmaceutical business that you want and decreased your
exposure to the part you didn't want. I wonder if you could talk about the consumer more broadly. I mean, is getting
access or getting exposure to the consumer or theme or something we could expect out of the company in coming
quarters and years?

<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, but for a reason different than just exposure to the consumer. I'd say we've intentionally
wanted to change the mix of the company to a source of sales and profit, et cetera, that wasn't necessarily as reliant on
government reimbursement. We wanted a greater mix of patient pay, or consumer pay, and I'd rather ride with the
consumer markets than ride with the volatility of say, a Europe where it's heavily, heavily reimbursement driven, and
given the economic issues that most European countries in the EU faces, you're at the whim of the next stroke of the
pen to cut prices.
So we wanted a different mix. And we wanted a different geographic mix. We wanted a different balance in how much
we're reliant on payers, how much we're reliant on governments and how much we're reliant on the consumer or the
patient themselves. So that drove some of the choice around geography and/or business areas that we believe make up a
durable growth company. We also find that the predictable growth and profitability of countries or businesses that are
more patient pay is frankly more reliable than those – at least for us – are susceptible to reimbursement cuts, et cetera.
So it doesn't mean we don't want to be in countries that are reimbursement driven. We do. It's a matter of balance, it's a
matter of mix, it's a matter of trying to have it all but not too much.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Okay. We will have time for one more question, operator, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a couple of quick clarification questions for
Tom and then one product-related question for Miles. So on EPS, I just wanted to confirm the FX sits at 10 percentage
point hit. So at the midpoint, constant currency, we would be about $2.35, Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yes, I mean 10% is around $0.2, so that's about right, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: And then the contribution from acquisitions implied in the high single digit constant
currency growth for 2015. So we have about 4% for...
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Sort of closer to 3.5%, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: 3.5%, okay. And that includes – that's net of divestitures, Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Pardon? Divestitures are already out of the numbers because of our continuing
operations, so that should be comparable between the years.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Got it. And then just lastly for me. Miles, on Libre if you could talk about your excitement
for that product, how big you think it could be and your long-term strategy in atrial fibrillation, a new market for you.
I'm sure people would be interested to hear kind of your long-term strategy there. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. First of all on Libre. I am excited about the product. I think it's a great innovation, a
great product. I think we've had really good customer response, and I guess our challenge right now is capacity
expansion. And I'd say that's a limiting factor for us; quicker, faster, sooner than we expected. And so, the
organization's got the blowtorch going to expand capacity because I think that product, particularly as word of mouth
spreads among patients, is going to be very strong.
I'm frustrated with the pace of regulatory approval in the U.S., but nevertheless, right now, we need the capacity
anyway. So it's opened to really good reception in Europe, and I expect it's going to be a real positive product for us
and for patients in that sector.
On the electrophysiology front, I don't want to create high expectations there because everybody's going to tell me
we're entering land of the giants and so forth. I think it's a great segment. I think there's a lot of opportunity for
advancement of technology there to make a real and improved impact on the treatment of the patient. People see it as a
$3 billion market today. I think it's going to be a bigger market – a much bigger market over time, and I think there's a

lot of room for technology innovation there.
We've invested in not only Topera but a number of other companies, from an equity standpoint, to bring them along,
and we have a long-term view of how we want to play in that market, which I don't want to detail here, but we're going
to take a run at it and see what can be accomplished there.
