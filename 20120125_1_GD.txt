General Dynamics' fourth quarter was marked by our best cash quarter ever and strong operating performance at
Gulfstream and across our Defense businesses. Charges taken by Jet Aviation completion business blemished an
otherwise solid quarter and year.
Fourth quarter sales and operating earnings were the largest of the year at Gulfstream, and at each of our Defense
businesses. Company sales totaled nearly $9.2 billion and up 6% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by Gulfstream
G650 deliveries. Operating earnings were $950 million for the quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations
were $603 million, or $1.68 per fully diluted share.
For the full year, sales were $32.7 billion, a modest increase over 2010. Operating earnings totaled $3.8 billion, with
combat systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.6 billion,
or $6.94 per fully diluted share, an increase of 2% over last year's EPS result. Free cash flow after capital expenditures
totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. For the year, free cash totaled $2.8 billion, or 109% of earnings from continuing
operations.
Let me address the two Jet Aviation charges first, one related to contract losses and the other an impairment of an
intangible asset. These charges reflect two issues that I have previously highlighted, namely lingering performance
challenges on several narrow body/wide body aircraft, and the significant decline in other OEM business jet
completions work.
The contract losses taken this quarter, which depressed group margins by over 400 basis points, resulted primarily from
cost growth caused by increased labor hours and late penalties on three wide body/narrow body aircraft. These legacy
aircraft are the most complex custom completions project ever undertaken at Jet Aviation. Once we have delivered
these aircraft, our Jet team will focus on completing the next series of aircraft, which are already benefiting from new
management and operating processes.
As a result of trends experienced in the completions business, we conducted a fourth quarter review of long-life to
assets at Jet Aviation, and recorded an intangible impairment charge of $111 million. This impairment, which reflects
an outlook with substantially fewer business jets and narrow body/wide body completions than when we acquired Jet
Aviation, negatively impacted Aerospace margins by 600 basis points in the quarter.
These charges are very disappointing and clearly not in keeping with General Dynamics' operational track record. The
new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business in 2012,
including restructuring operations to lower overhead and head count, improving the coordination between engineering
and operations, and strengthening supply chain management controls. I would point out that the other three quarters of
Jet's business portfolio continues to perform well.
Revenues at Jet's aircraft service facilities around the world were up double digits in 2011 and remain well positioned
with an established global footprint as emerging market business jet demand takes hold. I said many times that we
acquired Jet for their global footprint. As the business jet install base expands internationally, Jet's facilities will be
evermore elemental to our Aerospace growth.
Now let me talk about the Aerospace group and more specifically Gulfstream. Gulfstream enjoyed a banner fourth
quarter, marked by strong cash generation, healthy order activity, and the first 12 green G650 deliveries. These aircraft
deliveries drove significant growth in the group's fourth quarter sales. Aerospace sales, which totaled $1.9 billion, were
up nearly 50% when compared to fourth quarter 2010, and up over 30% sequentially.
Operating earnings were $73 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of charges taken at Jet. For the year,
Aerospace sales were $6 billion, up 13%, while operating earnings were $729 million. The group's top line growth was
driven by the fourth quarter G650 deliveries and improved service activity throughout the year.

Gulfstream made meaningful progress in product development in the fourth quarter to include receiving provisional
type certification from the FAA for the G650, and from Israel's Civil Aviation Administration for the G280. Both
aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA IASA certification and entry into service in the mid year. Our first 12
green G650 deliveries went smoothly, giving us further confidence in the G650's design for manufacturing processes.
Business jet and market indicators were positive again in the fourth quarter. Aircraft utilization remained robust and our
service centers enjoyed another good quarter. For the year, our Aerospace Service business was up a combined 15%,
including Gulfstream's best year ever in service volume. Preowned inventory levels for both large and mid cabin
aircraft continued to show gradual improvement. We took one aircraft in trade in the fourth quarter and subsequently
sold it for a small profit. We had no pre-owned aircraft in inventory at the end of the year. For the year, we made a
modest profit on just over $75 million in sales on five preowned aircraft.
The Gulfstream order book was healthy again in the fourth quarter, and exhibited many of the trends we've seen
throughout the year. Although orders were placed for each of our aircraft models this quarter, demand remained
strongest for our large cabin offerings. Similarly, international customers continued to dominate new orders, although
North America enjoyed its strongest quarter of the year comprising nearly 45% of the order book. Notably, with this
strong fourth quarter finish, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders in 2011 since the introduction of the G650
in 2008, causing year over year backlog to increase to $17.9 billion.
New aircraft book-to-bill this quarter was one time on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite strong bookings, backlog
decreased from the third quarter due primarily to the large number of green G650s delivered. Also, as expected, G650
defaults were higher than normal this quarter, as customer milestone payments were triggered by provisional type
certification. We actually saw fewer defaults than anticipated and still have over 200 G650 aircraft in backlog.
I should also highlight that we continue to maintain an 18- to 24-month backlog for our G450 and 550 aircraft. At
yearend, Gulfstream's backlog consisted of 64% international customers, including 27% in Asia-Pacific.
The Gulfstream product support organization continued to expand in 2011 to keep pace with our international customer
base, including new facilities or additions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore, and elsewhere.
In the fourth quarter, we also announced the opening of a product support office in Hong Kong and the opening of an
office in Beijing, which will enable us to better serve our growing Asia-Pacific based customers.
Fortune 500 and other public companies comprised 34% of year-end backlog, up modestly from 2010, with individuals
and private companies comprising the other two-thirds.
In 2012, we plan to deliver just over 100 large cabin green aircraft, including approximately the same number of G550s
and 450s as in 2011, and about two dozen G650s. We expect midsize green deliveries to be around 10 to 15 aircraft,
primarily the G280. The additional G650 deliveries will drive 15% top line growth in the Aerospace group this year,
and margins should be around 15%, driven by improvement at Jet Aviation.
Next, the Defense side of the business. Before discussing the performance and outlook for each of our Defense
segments, let me comment briefly on our Defense outlook. Amidst a backdrop of continued deficit focus and political
divide, we are pleased to start the new year with a 2012 defense budget, as this provides some clarity to our 2012
planning process.
General Dynamics' programs were well-supported again in this year's budget, including $577 million for Abram tanks,
$723 million for Strykers, $1 billion for WIN-T, and $1.1 billion for JTRS, and full funding for all of our ship and
submarine programs.
Congressional support for the defense industrial base was solid throughout the 2012 legislative process, particularly as
it relates to our tank, Stryker and shipbuilding programs. However, even with an approved 2012 defense budget, we
recognize the potential complications to budget execution from the combination of upcoming elections, likelihood of
another continuing resolution, and the looming shadow of sequestration.

As we saw in 2011, particularly in the shorter cycle IS&T world, budget officers and program managers are put in the
position where they naturally hold back or make awards very cautiously when a Continuing Resolution is likely. This
year, with the added threat of sequestration, the situation becomes even more unsettled. If sequestration were to occur
as laid out today, it would be very bad for defense and frankly, for our country. While many believe, as do we, that it is
unlikely to happen as presently described, no one knows how it will be resolved.
The DOD has already provided some FY2013 budget details, particularly as they relate to the Budget Control Act
Defense top line. The Secretary of Defense is scheduled to provide more detail this week, with the service chiefs to
follow in the days thereafter. That should give us more insight as to how investment accounts overall, and our programs
in particular, will fare.
Given our incumbency and relevance, we do not expect any significant surprises. The roles and mission study implies
that ship, ISR, and cyber programs will continue to be priorities in 2013 and beyond, especially as the new Pentagon
strategy pivots toward Asia-Pacific. Conversely, we would expect to see some uncertainty in the 2013 budget request
concerning the final disposition for Stryker and Abrams funding by Congress.
Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is clearly coming down. Given this
backdrop, and our lessons learned from the changing defense environment in 2011, my 2012 Defense segment
guidance is realistic. We are doing everything in our control to position our defense businesses for the declining budget
headwind, including continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting noncore businesses, and head count
reductions.
These types of actions enabled us to maintain defense earnings in 2011 despite declining sales. As appropriate, we are
also adding new businesses to shore up our outlook and improve our competitiveness in faster growing market
channels. We continue to feel confident about our defense portfolio relevance in this environment.
Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base, which must be maintained. We have solid incumbency in the
Army and Navy force structure, and with fewer new programs, incumbent platforms and programs capable of
addressing today's dynamic threat environment will require continued production and modernization.
Now let's move to Combat Systems. The Combat Systems group delivered a productive fourth quarter marked by the
acquisition of Force Protection and healthy domestic and international order activity.
The Force Protection acquisition, which closed in late December, expands Combat Systems' sustainment business,
tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio and product development capabilities. As partners in delivering thousands of
Cougar variant MRAPs to the Marine Corps, we gain an appreciation for the company's significant research and test
capabilities.
Our broadened development experience, together with Force Protection's proven product portfolio, better position
Combat Systems to compete for vehicle sustainment and upgrade opportunities and new development programs
globally.
In the fourth quarter, Combat Systems sales were $2.6 billion, while earnings were $388 million, both down 3% when
compared to last year.
This down slope was in part a function of timing, as several new engineering and development opportunities planned
for the year, including the Ground Combat Vehicle, moved to the right.
Margins were 14.9%, also on par with the year-ago period. For the year, the group sales were $8.8 billion. This
represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume, particularly Abrams and
Stryker. International LAV upgrades and axles for military and commercial OEMs helped to soften the U.S. vehicle
decline. Cost reduction in productivity improvements enabled Combat Systems to maintain operating earnings at $1.3
billion, despite the year's decline in sales. Margins were 14.5%, modestly ahead of our expectations, as cost
performance improved on several of our core vehicle programs.

Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order quarter in two years in the fourth quarter, with sizable awards for U.S,
European, and FMS vehicle programs. Notable U.S. orders in the quarter included approximately $800 million for
Stryker production and sustainment, and $100 million for MRAP upgrades.
The group's nearly $1.4 billion in international fourth quarter awards included LAV, and tank upgrades for several
customers, and another tranche of Duro vehicles for the Swiss government. The quarter's healthy order activity and the
addition of Force Protection caused Combat's backlog to expand by $1 billion, a 10% increase from the third quarter.
Yearend total potential contract value for Combat was $14.9 billion, including $11.4 billion in backlog and $3.5 billion
of unexercised options in IDIQ contracts.
While the way ahead is not entirely clear, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker
vehicles are undisputed. We believe we will see additional Abrams upgrades and Stryker double V hulls either through
new production or upgrades of existing vehicles.
The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in each of the major development programs,
including the Ground Combat Vehicle, where we are one of just two teams selected to compete, the joint light tactical
vehicle, the amphibious combat vehicle, and the armored multipurpose vehicle.
In the event that these programs are impacted by budget decisions, we have a portfolio of proven vehicle solutions to
offer. Combat Systems will continue to provide support and sustainment of vehicles we produce. We have the
experience and the infrastructure to expand those services to support a wider array of Army and Marine Corps vehicles.
Our successful teaming relationship with the Army's Anniston Depot over the last 5 years differentiates General
Dynamics from our competitors. Additionally with Force Protection now in our portfolio, we have enhanced our
exposure to U.S. and international inventories by several thousand vehicles.
The requirement to improve vehicle suspension, protection, and power capabilities will create opportunities for us to
leverage our experience and help our customer identify ways to affordably reconstitute and modernize.
Our international vehicle business continues to grow. With several billion dollars of orders in backlog, we are at work
on LAV and tank production and upgrade programs for a variety of foreign customers. This work helped to mitigate
pressure on our U.S. vehicle business volume in 2011, and will continue to do so through 2014. Beyond our ongoing
contracts, we're tracking a variety of international competitions, including the TAPV and CCV programs in Canada,
and several 8x8 vehicle tank programs in the Middle East.
Our munitions and weapons systems businesses also face budget pressures over the next few years, however adjacent
and international market opportunities and continued strength in the axle business should provide some offset. For
2012, I expect Combat Systems to deliver around $8.5 billion in sales, reflecting declining domestic vehicle funding
somewhat offset by growth in our international vehicle programs and the addition of Force Protection. Expect operating
margins in the low to mid 14% range, consistent with 2011.
Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished the year with another solid quarter. Quarterly sales totaled
$1.8 billion, up 3% over 2010, while operating earnings increased 7% to $190 million. The group's 10.8% margins
were 40 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2010.
Higher Ohio-class replacement volume and the addition of Metro Machine, now known as NASSCO Norfolk,
stimulated top line growth while strong TAKE program performance drove the earnings and margin improvement. For
the full year, sales were $6.6 billion, down modestly from 2010, while earnings grew 2.5% to $691 million. The sales
decline was primarily a timing issue, as several destroyer awards planned for earlier in the year slipped into the third
quarter.
The group's 10.4% operating margin for the year reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our
shipyards and improved performance on the TAKE and MLP programs throughout 2011.
Marine's yearend backlog totaled $18.5 billion. This enduring backlog includes several awards received in 2011 which
position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including two additional ZUMWALT class
destroyers, DDGs 1001 and 1002, two GD51 destroyers, part of the Arleigh Burke restart program, two Mobile

Landing Platform MLP ships, and additional repair work, enhanced in part by the NASSCO Norfolk acquisition.
In 2012, we expect to receive the RFP for the next block of Virginia-class submarines which should include nine boats.
This contract is scheduled to be awarded in 2013. For the year ahead, I expect Marine Systems sales to be ever so
slightly down, with margins in the low to mid 10% range. The group's outlook is very stable, with a number of
opportunities, including the next block of Virginia-class submarines, the SSBN replacement program, additional
DDG51s, a new program to replace the Navy's aging class of oilers, and new commercial work.
The value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent roles and missions study, which
emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong military presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This
bodes well for our ship builders.
Moving to IS&T. IS&T finished the year with fourth quarter sales at $2.9 billion and earnings at $315 million,
essentially flat from the year-ago period. Continued strength at our IT service business bolstered by the addition of
Vangent helped to offset a decline at the group's Tactical Communications business. Group sales were pressured by the
FY12 Continuing Resolution, which exacerbated the sluggish award activity felt throughout 2011.
Margins increased 20 basis points to 10.8%. For the full year, IS&T sales were $11.2 billion, down 3% from 2010,
primarily due to lower Tactical Communications volume. This lower volume was the result of several program
cancellations, FCS Brigade modernization, I-Win, integrated wireless network, and JTRS AMF, just to name three, and
award delays particularly in shorter cycle encryption, mobile, and ruggedized computing products. Two of our largest
sole source tactical awards in 2011, WIN-T increment 2 and CHS-4, were delayed by approximately 6 months.
Despite significant market pressures, the group's IT service business continued to deliver organic growth in 2011. This
growth, which helped to mitigate the group sales decline, was primarily due to several large IT infrastructure support
projects, and success in capturing new business opportunities. IS&T operating earnings were $1.2 billion in 2011, as
margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.7%.
Consistent with the group's historical trend, IS&T order activity was lighter in the fourth quarter than the previous
three. For the year, IS&T book-to-bill was 0.92 times, a good result in a year which included 7 months of continuing
resolutions. Yearend total potential contract value, which includes backlog, IDIQ contracts, and unexercised options,
totaled $32 billion, an increase of 28% from 2010. This healthy opportunity set positions IS&T well for 2012,
particularly given the reasonably strong support the group's products received in the 2012 defense budget.
For instance, following successful 2011 customer testing, we anticipate receiving FY12 funded awards for the next low
rate production increment of WIN-T, and the first tranche of full rate orders for our Rifleman radios.
Also, despite the market environment, IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than ever, as our products and services
portfolio remains well aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security, enhanced ISR, battlefield
communications, and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure.
IS&T sales will likely be flat in 2012. As suggested earlier in my remarks this guidance anticipates that the shadow of
sequestration and the potential for another fourth quarter continuing resolution continue to prolong and delay awards,
effectively pushing sales to the right even more than what we saw in 2011. Margins should be in the high 9% range,
driven by a higher percentage of IT services work, continued slowdown in product volume, and the competitive market
environment.
The 2012 segment guidance I provided this morning implies total earnings per share from continuing operations in a
range between $7.10 and $7.20. This guidance is operational and does not include or anticipate the results of capital
deployment.
In terms of capital deployment, we maintained our balanced approach in 2011 and I expect that to persist this year. Last
year, we deployed $1.4 billion to repurchase 20 million of our shares. Through both share repurchases and dividends,
we returned 77% of free cash to shareholders in 2011. We also spent $1.6 billion to acquire 6 businesses that enhance
our combat, marine, and IS&T portfolios. Our strong cash performance in 2011 and excellent cash outlook for this year
afford us great flexibility to further enhance and strengthen our business.

In closing, while no one today can say with certainty what defense spending will look like in 2013 and beyond, we feel
our businesses are as well positioned as any. Marine's products are at the heart of the Pentagon's Asia-Pacific focus,
while IS&T's cyber, ISR, and intelligence mission support capabilities remain well aligned with customer requirements.
Combat's vehicle programs will be challenged. However, strong international sales will help to defray budget head
winds. And we continue to believe that enhancements and upgrades to our vehicle programs offer an attractive, lower
risk alternative to our customer as they recapitalize the force following a decade of war.
Outside of Defense, our Aerospace group will serve as the company's primary growth engine over the next several
years, as G650 deliveries ramp and the international sales increase. Clearly, General Dynamics' diverse portfolio
remains a distinguishing asset.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hue?
L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Jay and good morning. I'd like to cover a few additional financial items before the question-and-answer
period. First, net interest expense was $38 million for the quarter, and $141 million for the full year. These amounts
were in line with our expectations. For 2012, we expect net interest expense between $155 million and $160 million,
reflecting the full year impact of the $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes we issued in 2011. As you may recall, in July we
issued $1.5 billion just prior to the maturity of notes in the amount of $750 million.
Corporate expense was $77 million for 2011, and we expect corporate expense to approximate $80 million again in
2012. The effective tax rate was 33.8% for the quarter and 31.4% for the full year. The fourth quarter was higher than
prior quarters and higher than we anticipated due to less European income than we had expected. That of course was
the result of the performance in our Swiss-based completions business. For 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of
approximately 32%, rising slightly over the be 2011 rate, due in large measure to the current lack of an extension of the
R&D tax credit in the provisions of the tax code.
Finally, cash contributions to our pension plans for 2012 are expected to be approximately $500 million, occurring
primarily in the second half of the year. Amy, that concludes my remarks.

The underlying organic decline there, about 10%, can you give us a little bit more clarity on programs that constitute
that shortfall or that decline? And as you look out further, are those programs stabilizing or are they continuing to
retreat? And then you'd backfill them with the international growth elsewhere?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, as I mentioned, I mean, we're seeing U.S. decline that we offset with the international, as
you just said, and I said in my remarks. But I mean, it's a combination of Stryker and Abrams, primarily. And if you
look out past 2013, you don't see a lot. But if you looked at a year ago, what we had in 2012, you didn't see a lot either
and we ended up being very well supported.
So this is a constant work in progress between us, the customer and the Congress, and I would anticipate that to
continue.
So there will be some U.S. vehicle decline. We see that quite clearly, but don't forget those programs are both
elemental to the United States Army even as they reshape themselves. So we'll use the international sales to help offset
that, but we'll still do a great deal of business in both those domestic programs and now we've got Force Protection in
there to help us on both the product and sustainment piece for the vehicle business.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Was it roughly split, the $1 billion decline organically, between Stryker and Abrams,
or favoring one more than the other?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No, I think it was more Stryker, actually.

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good afternoon.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Good afternoon, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Jay, just to follow up on that. A lot of moving pieces. Could you maybe give us a number
organically how much you see the entire Defense side of the business down in 2012?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Probably a percent or two would be my – off the top of my head, offset by the Aerospace
growth.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay, and as a quick follow-up, you mentioned North America for Gulfstream's strongest
quarter in a while there. What do you think is driving that at this point? And do you think what you're seeing is
sustainable?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, first of all, the Gulfstream order book is healthy across the board. I mean, we're very
pleased, particularly as I mentioned in the large cabin. That's a consistent message I've been delivering. But it's backed
up by the backlog and the order book we see. Very healthy order activity, particularly in the large cabin offerings.
I would say the North American market returning is a good sign. It's still outpaced by the international space. But we're
very encouraged to see the North American market activity picking up.

Jay, on the G650, could you update us on how things are going there. You got the provisional cert, you delivered the
aircraft. You had said I think that margins on the first aircraft would be in line with the sector average of around 15%.
So did that actually transpire in the quarter? And then as we look forward, how do you feel about getting the complete
cert, how – the rate ramp-up, the completion, how is all that coming along?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay. Joe, first of all, I'm very pleased with the 650 program. We're very excited about it. It's –
the aircraft is performing beautifully and the sales book is still very active, even with over 200 in the backlog. So that's
all good.
We are on track, as I mentioned in my remarks, and I think the way I said, the words I used were in the mid year. We're
still looking at about late second quarter thereabouts, it's paced quite honestly, by the working down of the test points in
collaboration and with the FAA all on track, all looking real strong right now. The airplane's, as I said, performing
beautifully.
The margins were consistent with what I've been saying, Joe. They are better than the group average, but not as strong
as you would expect as the in-production large cabin aircraft.
That, too, will change as I've said before. And it will ramp up beautifully. I'm just not – I'm not ready to whip that up
verbally yet. But everything we see in the production side, everything we see in Savannah is coming along very
handsomely with the 650.
So the rate ramp-up that you asked about, again, I'm going to hold to what I've said before. The production we're going
add about two dozen or so green deliveries a year. Did I say – yeah. Ten to 15 a year is what – yeah, 10 to 15 a year.
Green deliveries. But my complete deliveries, I'm sticking with 17, 33 and 33 for right now with every expectation that
we'll exceed that. I'm just not ready to go there yet.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: And just finally, the completion process, that has been a bottleneck in the past on new aircraft
types. How are things going and how do you feel about getting those first dozen aircraft that you've taken payment on
in terms of green deliveries into customers' hands?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: We feel very good about it. I think it's proceeding just very well, actually. So we're anxious to
get them to the customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Hey, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit about the Marine segment. I would have thought that I guess with the
delay on the DDG1000, as that starts to come in that you would actually have a worse mix, and it sounds like if I just
look at this fourth quarter as well as your outlook into next year, it would seem like you're not seeing some – any sort
of an adverse margin mix in Marine.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, I mean, we're clearly still benefiting from the superb performance on the TAKE program.
And that keeps it up. But honestly, even as that matures out and completes at the end of this year, I don't – I do not
expect to see a drastic margin reduction at all and I've been very consistent in that. This is a 9% to 10% margin
business with these three superb shipyards. And I say that publicly and then charge the shipyard presidents to beat it.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: But it's 9% to 10% but you're guiding to above 10%. So should I say – or think that's the
TAKE?

Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, Jay. Question on Combat. I just want to get a clarification. Can you tell us what the
percentage of international sales was for combat in 2011, and what that looks like in 2012?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, Heidi. It's about low 30%s in 2011. And I'd see it going up probably a couple percent or
so in 2012, and therefore continuing that kind of a ramp out for the next – well, with clarity, through 2014 to 2015.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: And on the Jet Aviation, at your September conference you talked about the issues at [ph] Basel
(43:15) and highlighted Jet as a turnaround story in the second half of 2012.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Could you give us – sort of fold in the charges we're seeing today relative to those comments?
What changed and prompted this charge? Did things get worse?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I think the way I would – the best way for me to say it, Heidi, and I've described it, as you
point out, kind of throughout the year, but when we put the new management team in place, okay, just after the
mid-year, and Dan Clare and his team settled in, we brought in some other subject matter experts from across the
businesses here at General Dynamics and particularly at Gulfstream, with a sight line to get clarity and definition, if
you will, more granularity, on what we were feeling and seeing. They did exactly that. And as we brought ourselves
through the second half of the year, we came to a point in the fourth quarter where the magnitude became very clearly
defined for us. And therefore, we realized the operating earnings impact, which then triggers an impairment review of
the long-lived assets, and so you have it. $78 million of one, $111 million of the other. And I also mentioned in my
remarks that most of this tied to the legacy aircraft and the three legacy aircraft in particular, and somewhat to the OEM
business mix change, if you will, from the other OEMs, which has impacted us.
Those three legacy aircraft will be delivered here within – one of them within a matter of a couple of – few weeks, and
the others, by the mid year I should think they'll all be gone, delivered to customers, with very happy customers in
terms of the quality of the work. But I would also say that the charges that were taken capture the costs that we have
incurred thus far and those we project for the completion of those three legacy aircraft. I think it's important to put that
out there.
So we've got the right leadership in place, the management team is firmly in control. The processes that were causing
us problem with throughput have been, in large measure, really well defined, clarified and we're running smoothly with
a workforce that is pulling together in the way that they need to. So I think we're finding ourselves, in 2012, in a place
of much better improvement at jet completions and we're anxious to see that reality unfold throughout the year.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Excellent, thanks very much.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you. I guess two issues at Aerospace. First, if you could update us on the status of
the G280, when that should be certified. And secondly, if you could give us the number of the dollars you had of
forfeiture gains in the final quarter, and some color on what you look for for 2012. Thank you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Okay, Cai. Thanks for the question. The 280 cert timeline, I mentioned in my remarks, we got
CAAI, the Israeli certification provisional full cert, sorry, and so now we're working with the FAA to get provisional
type certification here in the U.S. That's ongoing right now. And proceeding, there's no issues here, it's just marching
down the time line. I believe, based on that some of the software issues we talked about before in terms of what you
need to get final certification type certification, I would expect that to be a second quarter mid year, as I said, entry into
service. But as far as the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself is performing very well and there's great customer interest. So I
think that captures most of the 280 – let me think, yeah, that's probably enough on the 280. But we're on track for
delivery by the mid year.
The dollar forfeiture, the forfeitures, the LD is really a function of getting liquidated damages from the defaults that we
experienced which were higher than they would normally be, we knew that would probably be the case. It was the case.
Yet it was less than we expected, which sounds like I'm talking around a circle. But at any rate, we got substantially
fewer than that in the forecast for 2012, and I think that's probably enough to say right there.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Can you give us the number?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No, I won't give you the number. But let's just say it was probably at least half of the entire
year's amount in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: That's very helpful, thank you.

<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Hey, good morning, Jay, good afternoon.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Hey, Ron, good afternoon.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Just want to follow up, I think it was on David's question from earlier, you mentioned you're
seeing some activity pickup, a little bit more in North America. Are you seeing any of that in the midsize aircraft? If
you could give some commentary on what you're seeing in the midsize aircraft, because that's clearly been a softer spot,
right?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah, honestly, Ron, it's still a soft spot. I think that's a fair way to say it. We are seeing
activity, as I've said, I think the last several quarters, in the mid cabin. We've got activity in the 280, but it's still a very
– there's a lot of inventory out there still to absorb, is probably a fair way to say it. So it's clearly still a very bifurcated
market with, I would say, very strong activity in the large cabin, and modest to – but active, at a lower level, activity in
the mid cabin.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay, that begs a follow-on to the large cabin. So it's very active in the large cabin. I think
at one point you guys said that maybe full production on the 650 would be like 40 a year. Have you questioned that to
maybe go higher, to maybe 50 a year or 60 a year? I mean, is that – are those kind of program assumptions being
investigated?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, let's just say, with 200 in the backlog and the purpose built facility that you've seen, and
the way these airplanes are coming together and the excitement that surrounds all of that, we're always looking at
opportunities to increase production as rapidly as we can smartly do it. And that's really the operative. And that's why
you won't have me getting very aggressive on the number – as aggressive as perhaps you would like, or that the

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, Jay, Hugh and Amy.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Or good afternoon, I should say. Jay, I wondered if you might talk briefly to aircraft
development. The company has always focused on a regular cadence of product updates and introductions, and with the
650 and the 280 entering into service later this year, you're working on some stuff, what should we think – be thinking
about when we hear about new product introductions, what kind of impact should those have on – or are they having in
your plan, on the 2012 margin outlook within Aerospace?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: I don't think that that's – the R&D investment, as I've – we've said for years around here, is a
constant investment. And whether the top line is going up or down, we've been through that over the past few years. I
would say that the R&D investment this year was higher than kind of normal for us, I'll pull 3.4%, something like that.
But we target 2% to 2.5%, and then deviate from that as circumstance and development requirements dictate.
But suffice it to say we're in product development all the time. And you know the cycle of our airplanes, nominally the
15-year cycle. So we're either looking to enhance, upgrade or perhaps replace airplanes in due course. The 650, as you
well know, isn't replacing anything. It's defining its own spot at the top of the market. The 280 is coming in for the 200.
That transition is going well. And the rest of it will be done in due course. But we're very pleased with the product line
we have right now, and by the order activity that I described earlier, I would say so is the customer.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: So just to follow up to that briefly, presumably with the growth in the 650, the R&D
investment would be declining as a percentage of sales, but is it declining in absolute dollar terms?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: No. No.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: It's up again?

thinking has evolved on whether it might be more effective to increase your dividend as a proportion of the cash
payout, versus buybacks or acquisitions?

Page 13 of 15
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, as you've heard me say many times, we do believe in a balanced capital deployment
philosophy here. But specifically to your point, Rob, on the dividend, we've been very proud to increase our dividend
for the last 14 years. We gave it a 12% increase last year. We deal with that, and have that on the agenda for our board
meeting on the first week of March. And rest assured, we will have a very thorough discussion of that and we'll see
where the board goes. But I would anticipate dividend activity to come out of that.
Beyond, that I certainly – it would be inappropriate for me to comment.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Maybe just as a follow-up to that, with regard to other cash deployment and acquisitions. How do
you see the M&A market as it stands today, particularly with regard to pricing in the defense area?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, I think – I mean, I think there will be opportunities to acquire defense properties at good
value going forward. I'm not sure we're there right now. But as this market tightens, I believe that there will be defense
space opportunities and having a lot of cash in your rucksack, as we do, gives us the opportunity to take advantage of
some of that, as we did with Force Protection, whereby we got a good strategic asset at a very fair price.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, good afternoon, Jay.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Hey, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Just a follow-up to the acquisition question. I guess, the backdrop that you painted regarding
Defense and the cautiousness and the uncertainty regarding sequestration, how do you really approach having any kind
of comfort level regarding M&A on the Defense side?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well I think, again, I mean you have to look at your criteria for acquisition, and be very
disciplined in how you analyze, assess and actually then act on a potential acquisition. Does it enhance your portfolio?
Does it give you a [ph] fast current (56:39)? Does it give you a return on your investment? And that will be perhaps
more challenging as this environment tightens, or perhaps it will become even more clear that this is an obvious go or a
no go. So I think, look, it comes down to the discipline by which you execute these acquisitions, and we have a very
good internal process for it. We risk adjust everything we do, based on the type of business it is. So I feel like we've got
the rigor we need to fairly assess what's out there and make good judgments on whether it makes sense to acquire or
not. But having said all of that, I'll go back to where I was a minute ago, that I believe there will be acquisition
opportunities going forward in the defense space, if for nothing else, just as a result of the tightening of the defense
market.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, and Jay, just as a follow-up to that, how do you weigh that against the maybe
commercial manufacturing opportunities, just given your history and exposure to commercial markets with
Gulfstream?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: We wouldn't restrict our scan pattern to one or the other.

Operator
All right. Your last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Thanks for taking the call.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: You bet.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Just a clarification on the G650. Can you remind us how many planes you could produce on
an annualized basis with your current installed capacity?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, I don't think – there have been numbers out there. They haven't come from us. But let's
just say that the 650 production will be gauged by the purpose-built facility which is being constructed, and our ability
to put airplanes through there, which, if you look at what we're doing now versus when we started, it was good when
we started. It's really good now. It's only going to get better. So once we get the supply chain flow, the vendor flow,
which is coming nicely, you're going to see very strong production levels of G650. But as I said earlier today, I'm not
ready to give you numbers outside of what I've already committed to.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay, maybe just a quick follow-up question on the 650 and just the competitive
environment that's out there today.
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: If a customer, a new customer were to approach you today, when could you deliver the plane
to them? And if it's in the same timeframe of when they could go and get a plane from a competitor, doesn't there seem
to be a pretty strong incentive for you to speed up the production rate so that you can get those planes to the customers
sooner and perhaps create that as a point of differentiation from a competitive perspective?
<A - Jay L. Johnson>: Well, Jason, the way I look at it is if you have 200 airplanes in the backlog, you want to get
them to the customers as soon as you can do it. But when you're dealing with the premier brand and premier aircraft
that's going to be out there very shortly, you want to make sure it's done correctly and that the customer has complete
satisfaction when the product is received. Therefore, you don't want to over-accelerate yourself, as I say, overdrive your
headlights. We're not overdriving our headlights. The production is very measured and very solid, and we'll wick it up
when it makes sense to do so and when we hit steady state production, the supply chain, everything is feathered in and
flowing beautifully, then we'll wick up the production.
But right now, the answer to your question is you'd get an airplane in 2017. That's how big that backlog is. And we'll be
producing more every year as we go forward, and until we hit a steady state backlog. But we're very bullish on the 650
and so is our customer base, on a global scale.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That's helpful, thank you.
