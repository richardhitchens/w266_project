Operator
My name is Marvin, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's fourth quarter earnings conference call.
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at
the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we
would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Okay, thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I hope the blizzard for those of you in the Northeast wasn't too
disruptive. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the fourth
quarter and full year 2014.

We accomplished a lot during 2014 on many fronts, and we look forward to delivering once again for our shareholders
in 2015. While 2014 was characterized by significant clinical data flow, 2015 will be characterized by regulatory
submissions and new product launches.
So leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our
performance in 2014 and outlook for 2015. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will then review our Q4 and
full-year results and address financial guidance for 2015. Tony Hooper, our Head of Global Commercial Operations,
will discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. And finally, Sean
Harper, our Head of R&D, will provide a pipeline update.
After Sean's comments, we should have ample time for Q&A.
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you
separately by e-mail.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of
our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert A. Bradway
Okay, thank you, Arvind. Thank all of you for joining our call this afternoon.
2014 was really an outstanding year for us. Let me start with the financial highlights, which include revenue growth of
7%, enabling us to eclipse $20 billion for the first time.
Consistent with our international expansion objectives, sales outside of the U.S. grew by double-digit rates in 2014.
Our adjusted operating income growth of 22% reflects our commitment to generating operating leverage from our
business. As you know, one of our objectives for 2014 was to deliver to shareholders $800 million of improved
profitability from Enbrel. We exceeded that objective in 2014.
In addition, our free cash flow grew by 40% to $7.8 billion. This strong financial performance and our confidence in
the longer-term outlook enabled us to increase our dividend by 30% to 2014 and by 30% again for 2015 while
increasing our stock buyback plans as well.
Turning now to our progress with innovation, we had an extraordinary flow of data from our pipeline in 2014. We
generated positive pivotal data for six innovative programs and submitted four of them for regulatory approvals. To
remind you, this includes filings for two immuno-oncology molecules, BLINCYTO and T-VEC, and two
cardiovascular molecules, evolocumab and ivabradine.
In December we received FDA approval for two products, including BLINCYTO and our On-Body Injector for
Neulasta. BLINCYTO is an immuno-oncology agent which addresses an important need for acute lymphoblastic
leukemia patients who currently have very limited options. More generally, we're excited about the proof-of-concept
represented by this approval and look forward to progressing our BiTE programs in other forms of cancer as well.
Our On-Body Injector for Neulasta also represents an important innovation for cancer patients and one which will help
improve patient experience for those undergoing chemotherapy and at high risk of infection. I'd like to point out, of
course, that launches are now already underway for both of these products.
While 2014 was a watershed year for us in research and development, 2015 is sure to be another important year,
starting with the prospects of launching three additional innovative products, including evolocumab, of course for
hypercholesterolemia, ivabradine for heart failure, and T-VEC for metastatic melanoma. And in addition to these
launches in 2015, we expect regulatory submissions for Kyprolis, which we announced earlier today, brodalumab, and

potentially AMG 416 as well as the start of a Phase 3 program for AMG 334 in migraine and Phase 3 readouts from
two of our biosimilar programs.
As we discussed in July and October, we began last year the process of transforming our company. And importantly,
we initiated this from a position of strength. David will update you on our progress with that transformation and the
benefits achieved in 2014. We're on track, as reflected in our $1.5 billion growth in operating income and six point
operating margin improvement last year, even while absorbing the full-year impact of Onyx and investing in our launch
opportunities. Across our company, we'll continue our transformation efforts in 2015 and deliver more progress against
our long-term objectives.
Before I hand it over to David, let me thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their
unwavering focus on delivering for patients and for shareholders.
David?
David W. Meline
Okay, thanks, Bob.
Turning to the fourth quarter on page five of the slide deck, revenues grew to $5.3 billion by 6% year over year, with
8% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues at $187 million
decreased by $55 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a reduced level of partnership payments received
for brodalumab compared to last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income at $2 billion grew 15% from prior
year. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.9% improved by 0.1 points.
Research and development expenses at $1.2 billion were flat versus prior year and included the $60 million upfront
payment to KAI Pharma for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration. SG&A expenses were flat year on year.
On October 31, 2014, the company passed the one-year anniversary of the first stepdown in Enbrel-related payments.
This resulted in a year-over-year expense decline of approximately $100 million in Q4. This compares to
year-over-year expense declines of approximately $250 million per quarter in the first three quarters of 2014.
Additionally, we incurred incremental expenses in Q4 in preparation for new product launches. These increased
investments were offset through savings from our transformation to a more focused operating model as well as through
the reduced Enbrel-related payments.
Other income and expenses were flat year over year at $173 million in the quarter.
The tax rate was 10.2% for the quarter, a 2.5 point decrease versus Q4 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the
favorable tax benefit from the extension of the 2014 federal R&D tax credit which occurred in Q4 of 2014, which was
offset partially by unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net
income increased 20% and adjusted earnings per share increased 19%.
In summary, our fourth quarter results from operations were in line with our previous expectations while overall results
in the quarter benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was approved in late December and had been
removed from our previous guidance. You will find a summary of our 2014 full-year results on page six of the
presentation.
Our 2014 full-year revenues grew 7% to $20.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to
$8.70 per share. Product sales grew 6% year over year, and other revenues increased by $252 million over the same
period a year ago, primarily driven by our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships.
For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $8.5 billion, a 22% increase, based on the combination of solid
revenue growth along with stable operating expenses, which were down 1% year over year. On an adjusted basis, cost
of sales margin was flat at 15.8% year over year.

Research and development expenses increased 5%, driven by the addition of Onyx and support for later-stage clinical
programs. These increases were offset partially by lower spending associated with marketed product support.
SG&A expenses were down 10%, driven primarily by reduced Enbrel-related expenses, offset partially by the addition
of Onyx and increased commercial expenses in preparation for new product launches.
Other income and expenses were unfavorable 7% year over year due to higher interest expense and portfolio
rebalancing, partially offset by higher interest income.
The tax rate was 14.9% for the full year, up 5.7 points versus 2013. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to
favorable resolution in 2013 of our federal income tax audit as well as the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal
R&D tax credit in 2013. During 2014, the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax was 1.9 points higher in cost of sales
and 3.3 points lower in our adjusted tax rate. We would expect a similar impact to continue through 2017.
Turning to page seven, I would like to take a moment to provide an update on Amgen's transformation initiatives,
which we've previously discussed at our July and October 2014 investor events. 2015 marks an exciting year, as we are
in full execution mode towards our focused operating model. We are advancing a number of key initiatives to
streamline processes, increase agility and efficiency, and improve operating performance. We also have completed and
largely implemented the first phase of reductions in workforce announced in July, which will total approximately
3,000, and have made significant progress on reducing our facilities footprint towards the 23% goal.
In terms of the 2014 impact, all areas of operating expense benefited as our transformation to a focused operating
model began to generate cost efficiencies. In 2014 we realized approximately $300 million of cost savings towards our
$1.5 billion goal. This includes lower labor costs from workforce reductions and sales force optimization. It also
includes lower external expenses from improved contracting and sourcing and rationalizing discretionary spend
categories.
In 2015, we expect incremental savings of at least $400 million. This will in large part be driven by the annualization of
savings following the reductions in workforce, which occurred in late 2014. It also includes greater use of shared
services and further external spend improvements resulting from the rigorous transformation initiatives developed over
the past year. These savings will be redeployed to underwrite launch investments and one-time transition costs incurred
as part of the transformation implementation.
As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline in 2015, we will further improve adjusted operating margins on
the trajectory to our 2018 target of 52% to 54% through improved operating leverage. We will continue to provide
periodic updates on our transformation progress going forward.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page eight, based on our confidence in the performance of the
business going forward, we announced a commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through
2018 while continuing to invest strongly in our business. For the full year 2014, we generated $7.8 billion in free cash
flow, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales and profitability as well as
improvement of working capital, a portion of which are permanent.
As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total debt outstanding declined to $30.7 billion and total cash and
investments increased to $27 billion. As a result, net debt improved by $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion at year-end 2014.
Additionally for 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 30% to $0.61, with payments totaling $1.9
billion. We also announced another 30% increase to the dividend to $0.79 per share, starting with our first quarter 2015
payment.
Finally, at our October meeting, we indicated the intent to accelerate the re-initiation of our share repurchase program,
with up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of 2015. In the fourth quarter, we took a first step towards this
commitment with $153 million deployed to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares in the period. We intend to
continue repurchases at a stepped-up level in 2015. At the end of 2014, we had approximately $3.8 billion remaining
under our board-authorized share repurchase program.

I will now turn to guidance for 2015. Please turn to page nine. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2015
guidance at our October business review. In terms of what has changed since that time, we completed 2014 with solid
in-line operating performance, with full-year results of 7% revenue growth, 22% adjusted operating income growth,
and 14% adjusted EPS growth. With this background, we remain confident in the outlook for 2015 despite additional
potential foreign exchange headwinds.
Today we are reaffirming our 2015 revenue guidance of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion, adjusted tax rate of 18% to 19%,
which excludes the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit in 2015, and adjusted earnings per share of $9.05 to $9.40 a
share. Finally, capital expenditures are planned at $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.
Anthony C. Hooper
Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth
quarter starting on slide number 11.
The underlying prescription demand remains strong as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew in volume
terms across both the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets in quarter four as well as on a full-year basis. Globally, product sales
grew 8% year over year and 6% for the full year. Our international business grew 11% in the fourth quarter, excluding
the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our new and emerging markets delivered just over $1 billion in sales in 2014.
So far, the first quarter of 2015 is playing out as anticipated. We are on track for the full year. And let me remind you
that products like Prolia and Enbrel historically experience slower first quarters.
In assessing quarter-over-quarter performance, it's important to note the U.S. wholesale inventory dynamics. On
average, wholesale inventory levels returned to normal from rather low levels at the end of quarter three. There are
some exceptions on a product basis, which I'll cover later.
Let me now turn to the fourth quarter performance, beginning with Enbrel. Enbrel delivered strong growth of 11% year
over year in the fourth quarter. Underlying demand remains strong, as both the rheumatology and dermatology
segments grew on a value basis by 24%.
As expected, in the fourth quarter we saw inventory levels increase from the relatively low levels we reported in quarter
three. Quarter four ended with approximately $40 million higher wholesale inventories than normal. We expect to see
the draw-down of this slight build along with the typical seasonality in the first quarter. We remain confident in the
value potential of Enbrel and expect to continue to drive meaningful growth during 2015.
Now I'll turn to our filgrastim franchise, starting with Neulasta. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 7% in the
fourth quarter. The growth was driven mainly by price and to a lesser extent unit demand, which included the benefit of
the commercial rights we acquired outside the U.S. from Roche as part of our international expansion strategy. As Bob
said, the FDA recently approved the Neulasta On-Body Injector, and we look forward to bringing this innovative
product to patients in the U.S. shortly. The Neulasta On-Body Injector better serves patient needs and provides
important differentiation from potential future competition.
Next, NEUPOGEN, which declined 11% year over year in the fourth quarter due to branded short-acting competition
in the U.S. as well as unfavorable changes in inventory levels and foreign exchange rates. Like Neulasta, this was
partially offset by the benefit of the commercial rights we acquired from Roche.
In the U.S., 15 months since the launch of its first new competitor, NEUPOGEN has retained over 80% share of the
short-acting segment. The balance of the market is split between GRANIX and Leukine. We continue to compete
account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and reliable supply to patients.
With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S., we'll leverage the success we've had in the U.S.
versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.

I'll now move to our denosumab franchise, starting with Prolia. Prolia delivered 33% growth year over year, as we
continue to capture share in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., unit share grew six percentage points over the year,
exiting at 19% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong response from our DTC campaign, with one in three
patients who start post-menopausal osteoporosis treatment being prescribed Prolia.
In Europe, we completed the buyback of the Prolia rights from GSK and transitioned the entire business to Amgen. We
now also have reimbursement across all EU countries. Unit share grew four percentage points over the year, exiting at
13% in the fourth quarter. Both the U.S. and Europe have opportunity for continued growth.
XGEVA continues to capture share in the U.S. and EU markets, and we expect to see continued segment share growth
throughout 2015. U.S. unit share increased four percentage points over the year and is now just under half the segment.
In Europe, unit share increased eight percentage points over the year and is now just over one-third of the European
market. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile.
Vectibix grew 29% year over year and continues to show strong unit growth across all regions, gaining share in
first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe.
Now let me turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 25% following the acquisition of Onyx in
quarter four 2013. Quarter over quarter, we saw continued unit growth at 6% in the U.S., but overall net sales declined
slightly due to an inventory drawdown. Kyprolis continues to maintain leading share in the third-line multiple myeloma
setting.
As I announced earlier, I'm delighted that we completed the submission of the regulatory applications for the treatment
of relapsed multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and Europe. Getting this into the label in the U.S. and launching in
Europe will be the next major inflection points for Kyprolis. We look forward to enabling more patients to benefit from
Kyprolis following these regulatory approvals.
Next is EPOGEN, which grew 3% year over year. Increases in price were offset by unit declines. Fourth quarter 2013
volume included a few large customer buy-ins that did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Aranesp sales grew 2% year over year, with unit growth from a few large customer buy-ins in the U.S.
Sensipar showed year-over-year growth of 3%, as 10% unit growth and higher prices were offset by low inventory
levels.
Nplate continues to grow in both the U.S. and European markets, driving 7% unit growth. Quarter four was negatively
impacted by inventory declines.
Lastly, BLINCYTO; we're pleased with the initial launch of BLINCYTO following a swift FDA approval in
December. Physician and patient responses are indicative of the significant unmet need for patients with relapsed and
refractory ALL.
Regarding our upcoming launches, I'd like to share with you that our cardiovascular specialty sales force is now in
place, focusing on disease state awareness and profiling target segments. We look forward to launching Corlanor, the
new brand name for ivabradine in the U.S., and Repatha, the new global brand name for evolocumab, later this year.
We see a significant opportunity to address unmet need with these two medicines. In the U.S., over 1 million medically
eligible chronic heart failure patients could benefit from Corlanor treatment once approved. In the U.S., Europe, and
Japan, over 25 million people have risk for cardiovascular disease, have LDL above 100 grams per deciliter despite
current treatments, and could benefit from Repatha once approved.
In closing, I'm confident in the strength of underlying business. I'd like to thank the Amgen team around the world for
their outstanding performance in 2014.
Looking forward, our focus in 2015 will be threefold: firstly, to build on the performance of growth products such as
Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar, and Nplate; secondly, to successfully defend our mature brands from
potential new biosimilars and branded competition; and thirdly, to launch several important new medicines.

Let me now pass it to Sean.
Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon.
2014 was a very productive year here for R&D, and the last several months have been eventful as well, with one
regulatory highlight being the FDA approval of BLINCYTO in a remarkable 2.5 months after initial submission. We'd
like to thank the FDA and Amgen staff, who worked tirelessly to drive this outcome. BLINCYTO provides patients
with a breakthrough therapy for a terrible disease, relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, and
clearly validates our BiTE immuno-oncology platform. We look forward to introducing our next BiTE, AMG 330, into
the clinic, directed at acute myelogenous leukemia, later this year.
We were also very pleased to receive FDA approval for the novel On-Body Injection system for Neulasta, which will
help address the issue of having to administer Neulasta no sooner than 24 hours following chemotherapy, which can be
difficult for cancer patients and interfere with optimal use of the product.
As we announced today, we have submitted marketing applications for Kyprolis in the U.S. and Europe for relapsed
multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data which, as you know, was presented in detail at the ASH meeting and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine late last year. We look forward to working with regulators to make
Kyprolis available to patients with earlier-stage relapsed multiple myeloma global.
Two of our submissions are under review by FDA did receive three-month extensions to their target action dates,
T-VEC for metastatic melanoma and Corlanor or ivabradine for chronic heart failure. In the case of T-VEC, the agency
requested additional manufacturing data for this very unique product, which may require additional review time. In the
case of Corlanor, the agency requested more of the existing clinical data than were originally agreed to for our heart
failure specific submission, also potentially requiring the additional review time. We've provided the data for both
programs as requested and we continue to work productively with regulators to bring these innovative medicines to
patients who need them as soon as possible.
For Repatha or evolocumab, our coronary intravascular ultrasound study, which is critical for the product, has
completed enrollment, and our outcomes study continues to enroll very well. We're also working closely with
regulators on our filings. We will also be presenting some new analyses from our evolocumab clinical program at the
upcoming American College of Cardiology scientific session, including analyses of cardiovascular events in our
ongoing open-label extension studies.
AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody, performed very nicely in a Phase 2b dose-ranging study in patients with
episodic migraines, resulting in our decision to move aggressively into Phase 3 later this year. These data will be
presented at a scientific forum in the first half of this year. A Phase 2b dose-ranging study in chronic migraine is
currently enrolling. We feel AMG 334 has the clear potential to a best-in-class agent for migraine prophylaxis with a
favorable dose and schedule as a result of walking receptor rather than a ligand.
We generated positive data from three Phase 3 psoriasis studies of brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antibody, in 2014,
including two studies that demonstrated superiority to Stelara. And we and our partners at AstraZeneca plan to file this
data later this year. We also expect Phase 3 head-to-head data for AMG 416, our intravenous calcimimetic, against
Sensipar in the first half of this year.
This year we will also be reviewing the results of our Phase 2b study with the oral formulation of AMG 423 or
omecamtiv mecarbil, the innovative cardiac myosin activator we are developing with Cytokinetics. These data will be
critical in informing our decision on advancing AMG 423 into Phase 3.
Turning to our oncology pipeline, in addition to our T-VEC combination study with ipilimumab, we've initiated a
combination metastatic melanoma study with T-VEC and Merck's PD-1 antibody, and are in the planning stages for
additional such combination checkpoint inhibitor studies in other tumor types.

We've presented BLINCYTO Phase 2 data from both minimal residual disease positive patients with ALL and our
pivotal relapsed refractory study in ALL at ASH, along with Phase 2 data from our lymphoma study. We also presented
data from Vectibix Phase 2 PEAK study and Phase 3 PRIME studies, supporting our approval for first-line use with
FOLFOX in metastatic colorectal cancer at the ASCO Annual Meeting and ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium.
And we terminated our trebananib program directed against the angiopoietin axis in recurrent ovarian cancer, as well as
our rilotumumab program directed against the MET axis in gastric cancer due to disappointing results.
Our recently announced collaboration with KAI Pharma on CAR T-cell technology complements our existing BiTE
and oncolytic virus platforms, broadening our overall immunotherapy capabilities. We have a very robust antigen
discovery program at Amgen, and the KAI collaboration provides another modality we can employ against these
targets in both liquid and solid tumors.
Our biosimilars programs are advancing with Phase 3 data for our Humira biosimilar in moderate to severe rheumatoid
arthritis, expected this quarter, and Phase 3 data for our Avastin biosimilar in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer,
expected in second half of this year.
Finally, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of the R&D organization in delivering for patients. 2014 was an
unprecedented year for Amgen in terms of the volume of pivotal data and regulatory submissions, with multiple clinical
and regulatory milestones ahead of us in 2015.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great, everyone, thanks for taking the question. So I have two things I want to ask. So
first on NEUPOGEN, I think in the past you've talked about Teva having single-digit share. It sounds like they're now
at double digits. And if I look back on some of the other quarters where you're doing this unit growth, the second and
the third quarter you were down maybe seven to eight percentage points in unit growth and you've grown 11%. So I'm
just wondering. What's happening there? Are you seeing additional traction from competitors?
And then separately, can you just comment a little bit on FX? I know you said you're keeping your guidance in light of
increasing FX. Just walk us through, from a top line and a bottom line perspective, any hedging that you do and any
offsets that you have there? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, sure, Matt. Why don't we take that two-part question in two parts? We'll start with
Tony and then David can answer your FX question.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So, Matt, this is Tony. Some of the discussions we've had in the past have referred to
Granix's market share as a percentage of the overall filgrastim market, which is way within the low single digits. This
quarter we've actually spelled out for you both the short-acting and long-acting, so there has been no dramatic change
in the fourth quarter. The same trend has continued as we've seen throughout the year.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Okay. FX, David?

<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So yes, so framing the FX question, a couple of context points. One is Amgen has
about 75% of its sales currently are in the U.S., and 25% are non-U.S. So vis-à-vis other global companies, we have a
relatively more limited level of exposure. Secondly, we have a three-year rolling hedge program. So we're able to
significantly offset in the short term foreign exchange movements, either plus or minus.
If you then look at where we are in terms of rates on a current basis, if you look at the year-over-year effect on revenue,
if we were to stay at the current exchange rates through the balance of 2015, that would have about a $250 million
impact unfavorable year over year, so about one percentage point on revenue and about $0.05 a share versus what
we've given as our original guidance.
So with that in mind, we felt that it would be appropriate given the range that we're working with and other
developments that we felt it appropriate to maintain our existing guidance despite those potential headwinds.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. If I might for Sean on the migraine
antibody AMG 334, I noticed during the prepared comments you said that you thought you may have a better dosing
interval or schedule than competitors. I think Teva, they're targeting the ligand. I think Teva also has a Cu monthly
dose ongoing. So I was wondering maybe if you could expand on your rationale for that statement if possible, Sean,
please?
And then also the filing strategy for that molecule, can you discuss what the FDA requires for episodic versus chronic,
if those need to be linked in the filing, or if you think you can do it separately? Thanks so much.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Sure. I don't know the details, of course, of the type of program beyond what's in the public
domain. But the bottom line is it's just – the science here is very clear in terms of the relative potency of these
approaches. And this has been true on the first principals. It's true in animal models. We're seeing the same thing in the
clinic. So it's likely that that is difficult to overcome. A receptor antagonist is just a more efficient and potent way to
address this particular biology. And I think that will translate into a situation where the amount of drug that has to be
administered, presumably subcutaneously, will be an issue for the clinical approach profiles. And I expect us to have
the most favorable profile with respect to that just basically on those principles. So we'll see how it plays out but that's
what I would expect.
We haven't had our end of Phase 2 discussions with the agencies yet because we just saw the data quite recently. It's
clear that both episodic and chronic migraine are separate regulatory entities in that you can have an approval. For
example, Botox is approved in chronic and not in episodic. You can have separate approvals. Whether the programs
can be prosecuted together with some kind of efficiencies and how to coordinate those activities is something that we
will be exploring with regulators. So it's a good question. We just don't have the advice from those type of interactions
yet.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric Thomas Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question, another one for Sean. It sounds like you're getting fairly
deep in the FDA review process for Corlanor, T-VEC, and even Repatha. Have you been informed for any of those
three molecules that you'll need an AdCom [Advisory Committee] prior to approval?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: So we have discussions with the agencies about the possibilities of AdComs. Generally
speaking, when you're doing innovative new mechanism work in the United States, the default would typically be to
have them. But we always agree with the agencies not to disclose anything about their intentions until it's in the Federal

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks for the question. Obviously, topical of mind is a lot of context around pricing and what
managed care is doing these days. So to the extent that you have a multibillion dollar PCSK9 product in the future,
maybe you could comment to us on how discussions with payers works with that type of molecule, pre-outcomes
versus post-outcomes and so-called value or not value of so-called exclusive contracts. Maybe you could offer some
perspective around those debates.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes, thanks, Michael. I'll let Tony address that question.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Michael, so Amgen sees both payers and providers as being an essential part of our
customer base. And we interact with them on a daily basis both about our products and about the contracts with our
products. The payers often request information about Amgen's investigational products in anticipation of upcoming
launches so they can make coverage decisions. In these situations, appropriate personnel from our medical team
respond to the inquiries in a balanced, scientifically rigorous manner consistent with the FDA guidance.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. How are you doing? Maybe just one for me, it's a two-part question. I'm just wondering
if you can offer your perspectives on the bar for interchangeability following the FDA panel on the buzz from the
NEUPOGEN product earlier this month. I'm wondering if that's something you'd pursue for your drugs. And then any
thoughts on indication extrapolation for both Humira and Avastin, your biosimilars, and what can you tell us there?
Thanks.
<A>: Okay, thanks, Terence. Sean, why don't you get those questions?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, so I think the interchangeability in the United States is clearly going to take a little bit
longer than achieving biosimilarity through a regulatory filing. Actually, the agency's been pretty clear about that. I
think that all companies, including us, will of course seek to have that kind of status for the product. It's just a question
of what are the rules and guidance and how onerous is it to go through the process of trying to achieve that.
The indication extrapolation is something that we do expect to be the general rule. There may be exceptions to it. But
we've found generally in Europe that it was the way that things shook out. And it is a reasonably, scientifically sound
concepts to have extrapolation across indications. But sometimes there are indications in which the pharmacokinetic
exposure response relationship is not as clear. And in those cases, some additional data can be required.

Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Robyn, are you there?
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Yes, I'm so sorry. I'm very glad you're not hearing Let It Go because I muted the phone
and my daughter was singing Let It Go, so I apologize.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: No problem, go ahead.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Okay, all right, so one housekeeping. Is PCSK9 included in your guidance? And how do
we think about Enbrel given the color you gave going into the fourth quarter?
And the big picture question for biosimilars, there was a company discussing how you haven't had IP around your
Humira drug and manufacturing process, and that could hurt you on the filing against AbbVie during the 180-day
period where you can – they get to start their IP. How do we think about your filing timelines for Humira and how you
decide to protect yourself against filing against the formulation? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, there are lots of questions in there, Robyn. Let's see whether we can get those. First
is PCSK9 included in our outlook for the year? Yes, it is. Second, I wasn't clear what you were asking for on Enbrel.
Can you reframe the question? You said how should we think about Enbrel given the guidance we gave in the fourth
quarter. Is that right, Robyn?

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Robyn? Yes, go ahead.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: All right. By our math, Enbrel sales were positively impacted about $200 million this
quarter due to inventory. So where does the inventory stand for Enbrel versus normal ranges is what I was asking about
for the year.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay, so let me answer that one, Robyn. It's Tony. As I said, we think there's about $40
million of additional inventory that happened in the fourth quarter, and that $40 million will work its way out of the
first quarter, but we continue to have very positive views on Enbrel for 2015.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And then finally with respect to our biosimilar programs for Humira and the other
molecules that we're seeking to advance, the other eight molecules, we're obviously very attentive to the intellectual
property and the statutes that exist to enable us to advance a biosimilar program, and you should expect we'll be
compliant with those statutes. And we've provided the guidance that we think we'll be launching our first biosimilar by
2017.

Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hey, thanks a lot for taking my questions as well. First one is to which extent does your 2015
guidance bake in the potential biosimilar competition for NEUPOGEN? And then will your litigation against Novartis
end or delay or even prevent marketing of that [ph] field (46:25)? And then another question is, for your PCSK9,
evolocumab, during your discussion with the payers, would you actually go down the path of pursuing exclusive
formulary against the other payer? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. And again, let's take that in two parts. Why don't I take the first part? Our 2015
guidance includes our expectations across the product portfolio, including the prospect of competition for
NEUPOGEN.
With respect to your specific question about the lawsuit versus Novartis, a subsidiary of Sandoz, we're not going to
speculate on the outcome of that litigation. As you know, that's going to make its way through the courts. And, Tony, if
you want to, address the PCSK9.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: I don't think we're going to be talking about our rebating strategy or contracting strategy at
this particular stage. We come to market with a drug that has a unique and definitive value proposition. We'll price it
accordingly. And obviously, the rebating contracts are essential to get a preferred position on a formulary.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: So, Marvin, let's take the next question. But before you do, I would just like to request that
everybody limit themselves to one question, just to be sure that we can get through with everybody that's lined up. Let's

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: The question, David, could you just comment on your tax rate guidance? For the last
two years you've had a windfall in the fourth quarter from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Could you give us a
sense of what your full-year tax rate guidance would be if we assume that the R&D tax credit was indeed reinstated?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So if you look at the impact on an annual basis of the R&D tax credit, it's about a
percentage point for Amgen. So hence, this quarter, the gross positive impact was about four points, which then netted
the 2.5 points, as I mentioned in the call. But I think from a planning perspective, we said 18% to 19% for 2015
ex-R&D, so that would be a point less if the R&D credit were to be approved again this year.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Great, thanks very much.

Enbrel outlook for 2015. Maybe can you talk a little bit about the dermatology and rheumatology market share where it
stands, how it's changed on a year-on-year basis, and how you would expect Enbrel could be potentially impacted by
the IL-17s launching in derm? Thanks.

double digit. Enbrel has been losing market share in both rheumatology and dermatology. From an actual unit

perspective, we continue to show positive unit growth, and we've been in a position to drive some of the pricing in the
marketplace.
From a derm perspective, we take all competition seriously. But Enbrel, as you know, has been on the market for 15
years now. And when you're treating psoriasis, it's a long-term chronic disease, and Enbrel's efficacy and safety are
important for patients. And patients do switch backwards and forwards. So we continue to see a clear place for Enbrel
in the marketplace in spite of the new competition.

Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Following up on this derm
subject, this morning we heard Novartis talk a lot, at least relatively speaking, about the potential of Cosentyx and the
IL-17 pathway. So can you just remind us of the differences you see between it and brodalumab and how you see the
competitive dynamic playing out there? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure. Sean, why don't you field that question?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: I think that the data that we've generated with brodalumab that will be included in our filing,
both head to head to Stelara and in placebo-controlled trials, have generated the best kind of skin clearance data that's
existed for any agent that's been tested in the disease. Now that said, we don't obviously have head-to-head data against
the other IL-17 molecules. But I think that the general impression that people – the experts in the field that look at the
data sets have is that the efficacy of brodalumab is unmatched in the class so far with the data that's been generated. So
I think that's probably the key kind of differentiating.
Remember, this of course is a receptor blocking antibody rather than a ligand sequestering. We know there are multiple
ligands for the receptor, so it is possible that one would see differences in efficacy. That was always our hope was that
this would be the most efficacious approach to this particular axis. So we'll have to get all of our data package together
into a label, and then obviously Tony can talk about the competitive environment. But my sense is there may be some
differentiation largely on efficacy.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Okay.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: I think we'll see once we see the labels of all products in the marketplace.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great, thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the EPO franchise. So Roche is
now currently testing MIRCERA at Fresenius clinics, sort of what Affy [Affymetrix] did back in the day, and [ph]
Aspira has (52:35) just filed their generic EPO for approval. Can you just remind us your agreement with DaVita, does
it if I remember correctly, guarantees them, is it the breadth twice in the market for EPO based on share through 2018?
If you don't mind, just refresh us on that. And then just your thoughts on what happens for biosimilars when you're
looking at two different indications like CKD dialysis and oncology, is that something that they can get a single label
across all three diseases? Thank you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So let me answer those questions one by one. Probably ask Sean to take the last one. From
a contract perspective, we haven't made the details of our contract with DaVita public, but the contract is an exclusive
contract which extends to 2018.
As regards MIRCERA, we understand from public statements that Roche has said that they've made the product
commercially available. We have not seen any impact on our business yet as regards the MIRCERA entry to the

approval standards. In general, again, the default would be indication extrapolation, but it won't be true in all
circumstances.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Joshua E. Schimmer>: Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping you could discuss the expected cadence of
adoption and maybe the eventual penetration levels that you'd be looking for, for both the Neulasta auto-injector and
for Corlanor into their respective markets? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: He was asking the penetration for the On-Body Injector for Neulasta and then the Corlanor
market penetration.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So let me take those two together. As we look at the marketplace, we know that there are a
number of patients that really struggle to come back for injections of Neulasta post-chemo, including patients who
receive drug on a Friday. We estimate, I think patients get in the region of about 4.4 cycles per chemo, which is way
beyond what it should be. So there's a fairly large group of patients who will benefit definitively from access to the
On-Body Injector. We'll be launching this in the not too distant future, and will be looking to switch as much of the
business as possible to the injector.
When I think about Corlanor; Corlanor, as you know, is an interesting product that will be used as an add-on to existing
standard of care. Irrespective of what the standard of care is, the product will augment the value and help manage
patients with heart failure. So we know exactly where the heart failure clinics are and we know how large the unmet
medical need is. And the cardiovascular team that are presently in place are busy segmenting the market as we speak.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Sean, I have a couple of related ones on
Kyprolis. When you look beyond the label expansion, would you say that ENDEAVOR represents the next inflection
point for the product? And does recent data at the ASH meeting change your view on the hurdle for that study or other
head-to-head studies? Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: I think ASPIRE was of course really an important study for the molecule in and of itself, and it
performed as well as one could reasonably expect. Always the question has been how will the agent compare head to
head to Velcade. And I think ENDEAVOR will be the first example of that question. And then, of course, we'll see
CLARION, which will look at that same question in the first-line setting. I think we continue to have the same point of
view that we've had since we acquired Onyx, even before we acquired Onyx, which is we believe that Kyprolis is a
best-in-class proteasome inhibitor, and so we're looking forward to seeing the results of these studies over time.

pilot program that's going on right now. But it seems from what they're saying that they're moving along pretty quickly
here. And I can't imagine you'd want to talk about specific customer discussions. But given that they're such a big
player in the U.S., I wonder if you could maybe frame the situation for us. I know it's probably within the realm of your
guidance. But come July 1, is there any scenario perhaps where you might want to revisit what your thinking is on
EPO? And maybe just, again, put some brackets around the range of outcomes here. Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So this is Tony. The guidance we gave in October included the knowledge that MIRCERA
will be coming to market. We've competed with MIRCERA in the European market now for about five years. They
hold between 8% and 10% of the marketplace. As I said, we had saw no impact yet on our business in the fourth
quarter of 2014.

Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: In 2011 you guys expected total denosumab sales to be around $3 billion to $4 billion in 2015,
and current sales run rate is tracking below $3 billion. So can you comment on what came short of your original
expectations?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, we'll take it in two parts, Eun. Obviously, as you know, we're pleased with the
progress that we're making with denosumab, both in the Prolia setting for osteoporosis and of course, XGEVA in
oncology. I think the international pricing took longer than we thought for Prolia. So if anything has changed since the
original guidance, it was that. But fundamentally, we still think this is going to be a big product. It continues to grow in
the way Tony described. And, Tony, I'll invite you to elaborate on the outlook for Prolia and XGEVA from there.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So as we continue to watch the marketplace and look at the new naive or bio-naive
patients, our market share on new patients to drug is continuing to be higher than our normal TRx share. We see our
share of new patients at about 30% of the market, and our actual in-market share of about 19% in the U.S. So as you
extrapolate those two, there continues to be room for growth as these patients move in and get their second and third
injections.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Furthermore, the long-term safety and efficacy data continue to be very encouraging for
the product. So we continue to think this is a source of growth from the way we outlined earlier on the call.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: We now have safety data in the label, just confirming what Bob just said, yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, which regards biosimilars. Given your relatively unique
position as being both the hunter and the prey, I'd be very interested in your view on the defense mechanism of the
originators from a regulatory and legal perspective, and then flipping on its head, how your biosimilars programs could
circumvent these defense mechanisms. And link that very specifically on Humira. There has been a little bit of chatter
on the frequency-of-dosing patent that AbbVie has. Your comment on that patent defense mechanism would be
appreciated as well.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Ravi, I guess a couple things. First, we've said for some time that we felt there was
benefit for both our innovative products and for our new potential biosimilar products that we participate in both
aspects of the market. So through time, what we have found is that we continue to learn about our own innovative
process development efforts, et cetera, by virtue of the work that we're doing in our biosimilars program. And I think
our dialogue with the regulators around the world is enhanced by the fact that we're recognized to be both an innovator
and a company that's seeking to advance biosimilar molecules. So we're continuing to work both sides of this.

As you know, we have nine biosimilar molecules that are advancing successfully through the clinic. We continue to
believe that this will be a large revenue opportunity for us. So again, with respect to any individual program and the
biosimilar to Humira in particular, as you know, we've generated Phase 3, positive Phase 3 data already. We added on
this call that we expect another data set early in the year, and we look forward to having all of that data and filing that
as an attractive biosimilar alternative to proprietary adalimumab. So we think we're in good shape there, and we look
forward to having the data and being able to file with the regulators.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Hey, Marvin. As we are going past the hour why don't we take two more questions?

Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thanks, just a question on the biosimilars, maybe more specifically on potential for
interchangeability. I think you had mentioned a couple weeks ago that the FDA might require switch studies on the
originator drug to the biosimilar drug to get comfortable on the immunogenicity or potential for immunogenicity. I was
wondering if are there any other clinical trial requirements that you feel the FDA could place before allowing a drug to
get interchangeability [ph] play (1:03:02).
<A - Sean E. Harper>: This is Sean. I really – I think that the agency is still very much working internally on their
thoughts about interchangeability. That's the sense I have. They have not put out the same level of clear written
guidance that they have, for example, for achieving biosimilarity. I think that they are in discussions about this with
various sponsors. And the switching issue is one that they've identified and that make certain first principle sense. It's
hard for me to speculate really about what other requirements they might put in place beyond demonstrating that it's
possible to switch patients back and forth between the agents without any untoward effects.

Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. I have a question on the proteasome inhibitor franchise. With regard to
Takeda's ixazomib, my understanding is that they will likely report data sometime this year. Do you see impact on
Kyprolis? And then how do you feel about your own oral proteasome inhibitor, oprozomib?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: This is Sean. I think we are interested in pursuing oprozomib as an agent that may deliver a
level of efficacy in a chronic maintenance setting particularly that would be above and beyond what we are imagining
is going to come from the Takeda product. So I think these are difficult molecules to develop, these oral molecules
because of the GI toxicities that can be associated with them. So there are dose-limiting toxicities, and it can be difficult
to manage around that. We're working on that problem. Tony, obviously you'd be the appropriate person to comment
on the competitive environment.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Sure So I think when we think about multiple myeloma, we're talking about a disease that
patients will die from. And therefore, I think every single physician and patient in this setting thinks about efficacy
first. And our belief and commitment to Kyprolis has been around the deep science of this product where we truly
believe it will be the best in class in this category. And I think our ability based on the ASPIRE data and potentially
other data coming to show the definitive improvement on progression-free survival with regimens including Kyprolis
stand us in very good stead to maintain a large part of the market.
Arvind K. Sood
Excellent. Thank you, Tony. I would like to thank all of you for your participation on our call this afternoon. Of course,
if you have any follow-up questions or comments, the Investor Relations team will be standing by. Thanks again.
