MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the
discussion, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. If
you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may
begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Vince, and thanks for joining us today for our analyst call.
Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release of this call include forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we encourage you to read our full disclosure on
forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as
well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially
from those in such forward-looking statements.
Before I turn the meeting over to Steve Kean and Kim Dang to review the fourth quarter of 2015 financial results and
other important developments during this period, I'd like to talk a bit about the future of the company. We will be
delving into the 2016 outlook in more detail at our upcoming Investor meeting next week, but I believe it's important to
focus on a few key points.
KMI's underlying business remains strong even in this challenging environment. Our year-end results turned out very
consistent with what we projected to you in our third quarter call, both from a DCF standpoint and a debt-to-EBITDA

standpoint.
This says to me that our fundamental businesses are doing well, notwithstanding the current weakness in our industry.
Fundamentals don't seem to matter in this Chicken Little, the sky is falling market, but they should to prudent
long-term investors. We are a generator of a tremendous amount of free cash flow, about $5 billion per year, and that's
after we've paid all of our operating costs, our interest expense and our sustaining CapEx.
There are several ways we can utilize that cash flow. We can delever the balance sheet, internally fund our growth
capital needs and/or return cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend and/or buying back shares.
We have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expansion expenditures for 2016. You will hear more details on
that from Steve today and at our Investor conference. And that's a trend you can expect to continue, as we high grade
our capital investments and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate.
As we reduce those expenditures, we will obviously have more cash to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and
return to our shareholders. Reducing the dividend was not an easy decision, but given the strength and sustainability of
our business and the cash generated thereby, I believe, as the largest shareholder, you will see KMI emerge as a
stronger company with a strengthened balance sheet, higher coverage on the dividends we pay and with no need to
access equity markets for the foreseeable future.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks, Rich. So, I'm going to cover three topics before hitting on a few segment highlights. First is the
performance of our business in these challenging times. Second is our counterparty credit risk and third, our growth
capital. And then I'll do some segment highlights.
So looking at full-year 2015 compared to 2014, here's the summary. On an earnings before DD&A basis, three of our
five business segments grew year-over-year: Gas was up 1%; Terminals was up 8%; and Products was up 27%. Kinder
Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year but for the effect of a weakening Canadian dollar. And no surprise,
CO2 was down 22% as a result of lower commodity prices.
To put this performance in context, this performance was against the backdrop of a very negative environment for the
entire energy sector. On a full-year basis, 2015 to 2014, oil prices were down; 49%, of course they're down further still
from there. And gas was down 40%. Oil and gas commodity prices directly affect the portion of our EBITDA which we
quantify each year. But the larger driver of our business is the demand for what we actually sell: energy transportation
and storage services. That's the primary business we're in.
Let's look at those numbers. In the Gas business, which provides more than 50% of our segment earnings before
DD&A, our transport volumes were up 5% year-over-year, and sales and gathering were up 4% each on a full-year
basis. Our Products pipeline volumes were up 3% on refined products and up 15% on total liquids transported. Now,
that includes crude, condensate and NGLs, and those were driven by expansions and the Hiland acquisition. While
most of what we handle in our liquids businesses is made up of refined products and other liquids, not crude, crude is in
the news. So let's look at our crude transportation assets.
Our Trans Mountain system is prorated. That means there's not enough capacity to serve the available demand. KMCC,
Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate, our Eagle Ford pipeline, its volumes have been growing through the year with
our expansions. We have good contracts. We're in a resilient location in the Eagle Ford, and we have great downstream
connectivity to end use markets and storage and dock capacity. In this business, especially now, contracts matter,
location matters, and connectivity matters. And we have all of that with the KMCC system. First half of the year, July
year-to-date numbers were about 193,000 barrels a day transported. December was just under 240,000 barrels a day.
Now, it's a much smaller piece of the overall picture, but our Wink Pipeline in West Texas is moving record volumes,
so even our crude transport assets are doing pretty well under the circumstances.

Finally, the liquids parts of our Terminals segment, which is now 74% of the earnings before DD&A of that segment,
saw volumes increase 18.7% for the full year and 11.3% in the fourth quarter. Now, granted for all of these businesses,
our contracts, in many cases, call for us to get paid whether the capacity is used or not, which is a good thing, by the
way.
So volume is not always a perfect driver of margin, but it is a good indicator that, notwithstanding drastically lower
commodity prices, the demand for our specific midstream assets is really quite good. Commodity prices do directly
affect us in the CO2 business and a subpart of our midstream business. We also suffered in our bulk terminals business
in coal and steel and especially from the bankruptcy of two of our important coal customers. And those things
absolutely pulled back our performance without a doubt.
But it's important to remember, particularly in times like these, that our primary business is the transportation and
storage of energy commodities for a fee, and that the commodities that we handle the most are natural gas and refined
products. So notwithstanding all the headwinds we've faced in our business, we believe that, once again, we
demonstrated that our large, diversified portfolio of fee-based assets, we can produce stable results even in extremely
tumultuous market conditions.
All right. Now, let's talk about counterparty credit risk just briefly. We're going to talk more about this at the
conference next week. We continue to monitor closely our counterparty credit risk as we always have. Fortunately,
we're a large and very diverse company with operations across a number of sectors and across a spectrum within those
sectors. We have a large customer base with only about 20 customers accounting for more than 1% of our annual
revenues, and the great majority of our customers remain solidly investment grade. The largest of those 20 customers is
about 5% of our revenue, and that customer is rated AA minus.
We estimate that our top 25 customers constitute about 44% of our revenue and just over 80% of the revenue from that
top 25 is coming from investment grade rated entities. We'll provide you with some more detail and more refined
analysis on our customer base at next week's conference, but those are some high-level indications. And just once
again, only 20 customers account for more than 1%. The largest of those is just under 5% and is rated AA minus. Our
top 25 constitute 44% of the revenue, and 80% of that is from investment grade sources.
Thirdly, we also worked hard this last quarter on securing our investment grade debt metrics for 2016 and beyond and
insuring that we can continue to invest in high-quality opportunities that allow us to grow value per share. We high
graded our backlog to focus on the highest return opportunities. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and
selectively joint venture projects where appropriate.
We reduced our 2016 spend that we initially announced to you by an additional $900 million. That's off the $4.2 billion
we said in December. And we reduced our backlog by $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2015, and that's just under
$1 billion worth of projects placed in service during the quarter.
That action, along with retaining cash above our $0.50 annual dividend, obviates the need for us to access the capital
markets, shores up our investment great debt metrics, and both of those things add stability to our outlook in difficult
times while enable us to continue to grow our value over time.
Now just a few segment highlights, and Kim will cover all the financial details here. Again, just some operational
things. Natural gas, as I said, volumes were up 5% compared to the fourth quarter. That's higher volumes on the Texas
intrastates because of exports to Mexico; higher throughput on EPNG, also Mexico; and power generation load.
And looking at those two sectors of demand for just a minute, so our power demand on our systems was up 10% on a
full-year basis year-over-year – I'm sorry, 10% for the fourth quarter and 16% for a full-year basis compared to 2014.
That throughput to Mexico was up 22% on a year-over-year full-year basis across our systems and is now about 2.3 Bcf
a day to 2.4 Bcf a day on average.
Also worth reminding you, over the last two years, the gas group has entered into new and pending firm transport
capacity commitments, totaling 8.5 Bcf a day, and about 1.6 Bcf of that was previously unsold capacity. We now
estimate that of the natural gas consumed in the United States, about 38% moves in our pipes. Now, some of that is

moving on other pipes, too, gathered into ours or delivered off of ours, but 38% of the gas consumed is moving at some
point on KMI pipelines. And we believe that the combination of power demand, LNG exports, exports to Mexico, and
additional petchem and industrial demand on the Gulf Coast create a bright outlook for our gas transportation and
storage assets.
Products Pipelines, as I mentioned, refined products up 3% compared to 2014, and this demonstrates the upside of
lower commodity prices in at least some parts of our business. And as I said earlier, total volumes were up 15% with
the effects of the acquisitions and expansions in our liquids business.
CO2. SACROC generated record annual gross oil production during the full year, up 2% compared to 2014. It was
down 11% quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter versus a record Q4 of 2014. Combined oil production across all of
our fields was up 2% compared to 2014. Net NGL sales volumes were up 3% compared to 2014, and we kept a close
eye on costs and produced cost savings in OpEx and sustaining capital of roughly 25% off of our 2015 budget.
The Terminals business was up 8% year-over-year on segment earnings before DD&A. This continues to be the tale of
two businesses with strong performance, very strong performance in our liquids business, which is now roughly
three-quarters of this segment, offset by continued weakness in our bulk terminals, driven again by weakness in coal
and steel volumes, and compounded of course with the bankruptcy of our two coal customers.
The strength of our liquids performance is driven by several organic growth projects: our Jones Act vessel additions,
the Vopak terminals acquisition, and the Houston Ship Channel. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the
demand for our capacity in the significant positions that we have built in refined products in the Houston Ship Channel
and in oil in Edmonton.
Finally, an update on Kinder Morgan Canada and Trans Mountain in particular. This expansion, as I will remind you, is
under long-term contracts with customers who want to see the project built. Now, the three key areas of focus for us
now are the NEB recommended order, consultation and accommodation with the First Nations, and the satisfaction of
the BC Government's five conditions. We're making progress on all three, though not as quickly as we'd like.
With respect to the NEB, we received our draft conditions in August. We think they're manageable, though we did seek
important changes especially around the time required to approve specific portions of the project. We're waiting to see
if further process will be required by the new federal government and remain hopeful that all the work that we've done
to-date, both inside and outside the NEB process to address stakeholder concerns, will be taken into account. We're
currently scheduled to receive the NEB recommended order in May and the Order in Council process to follow.
Now, we continue to make good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have with
First Nations. We've added several mutual benefit agreements which bring actual support for the project from a
majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project.
On the BC five conditions, the BC Government has made clear that we are not there yet but have clearly left the door
open to closing the gap which we are working to do. We have this project in the backlog, and we're aiming for a third
quarter of 2019 completion.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start with comparing against what we said last quarter, which was that we expected to end
the year with approximately $300 million in coverage and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.6 times.
Now, we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage, as I will take you through in a moment. That's not an
apples-to-apples comparison due to the change in our dividend policy. If you adjust the fourth quarter dividend to the
$0.52 per share that we expected to pay prior to the decision to reduce the dividend, we would've ended the year with
approximately $297 million in coverage, and that includes absorbing over a $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter
results that we did not anticipate as of the end of the third quarter to account for the Arch bankruptcy. On the

debt-to-EBITDA side, we ended the year at 5.6 times, as expected, and I'll take you through the details of the balance
sheet in a moment.
On the face of the GAAP income statement, you will see that revenue is down both for the quarter and the full year,
compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This quarter, we've added a line to break out cost of goods sold, which
you can see is down more than the decrease in revenues. As I've said the last three quarters, change in revenue is not a
good predictor of our performance, as we have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity
prices that the margin generally does not. We believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate
or DCF per share.
However, for those of you who need adjusted EPS for your models, adjusted EPS without certain items is about $0.21
in the quarter, which is slightly above consensus.
DCF, on the second page of the numbers on the press release, we calculate for you, distributable cash flow. We
generated DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion and $4.699 billion for the year. For the quarter, DCF is down
approximately $45 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, DCF is up $2.1 billion. The increase in
the full year is largely the result of the acquisition by KMI of KMP and EPB that was completed in the fourth quarter of
2014. And so, a lot of the benefit to DCF is due to the fact that the MLPs are no longer outstanding, and you can see
that benefit in the line of our DCF calculation entitled MLP declared distributions.
For the quarter, the 4% reduction is primarily the result of our CO2 segment which was down about $77 million. Our
Terminals segment, down about $20 million, primarily as a result of the Arch bankruptcy and increased interest
expense and preferred interest payments. Although we're not happy to be down 4% in light of the overall circumstances
in the energy and capital markets, as Rich and Steve have both – we believe this performance is very strong and
demonstrates the stability of our assets.
For the full year, DCF per share is probably the best way to look at our results because it takes into account the benefit
of the DCF of the merger transaction, as well as the cost of the approximately 1.1 billion shares that we issued to
purchase the MLPs. For the full year, DCF per share is $2.14 or an increase of approximately 7% over the $2 per share
in 2014.
For the quarter, DCF per share is down approximately 8% for the reasons I mentioned a moment ago with respect to
DCF, plus incremental shares issued to finance our projects and to reduce leverage. The $0.55 and DCF per share for
the quarter and the $2.14 per share for the year results in coverage for the quarter of about $950 million and
year-to-date coverage of $1.18 billion. As I said a few minutes ago, if we had paid a dividend of $0.52 in the fourth
quarter, coverage would've been around $300 million, just under, versus our budget of $654 million.
So let me give you the major components of the $350 million change versus our budget. If you utilize the commodity
sensitivity metric that we gave you last January of $10 million change in DCF for every $1 change in crude and $3
million change in DCF for every $0.10 change in natural gas, the impact to our full-year results is approximately $246
million. We have additional commodity price impact of a little bit over $20 million, most of which is due to
deterioration in the crude to NGL ratio, meaning the NGL prices deteriorated more than crude prices and we budgeted
for a constant ratio.
Indirectly, commodity prices impacted us by another $117 million due to three primary things: lower CO2 sales
volumes; lower gathering and processing volumes in our midstream natural gas segment; and a weaker Canadian
Dollar, so the FX impact, impacting our Terminals segment and our Kinder Morgan Canada segment.
Coal bankruptcies impacted us by over $65 million, which was Arch and Alpha. So you take those items that I just
went through, that accounts for about over $450 million, so well more than the total variance of about $350 million.
There are lots of other moving pieces, both positive and negative, but the primary offset to the $450 million were lower
interest expense and CO2 and other cost savings.
Now, let me give you a little more granularity on where we ended up in the segments versus our budget. Natural Gas
Pipelines ended up about 1% above its budget as a positive impact of the Hiland transaction, better performance on the

Texas intrastate, SNG and TGP were largely offset by the impact in our midstream group of lower commodity prices
and lower gathering processing volumes.
CO2 ended the year approximately 15% below its budget as we projected last quarter. This, as we have discussed, is
more than our commodity price sensitivity would indicate. And it's driven by lower crude oil volumes, lower CO2
volumes, and lower capitalized overhead, as a result of reduced expansion spending, offset by over $40 million in cost
savings.
Terminals ended the year approximately 10% below its budget versus the 6% we discussed last quarter with the
primary variance being the Arch, the impact of the Arch bankruptcy. The Terminals segment was negatively impacted
in its budget by lower coal and steel volumes, again the largest piece being the Alpha and Arch bankruptcies and also
the FX impact of the weaker Canadian dollar.
Products ended the year approximately 2% below its budget. The positive impact of the Double H Pipeline, which was
acquired in the Hiland acquisition, is slightly more than offset by approximately $24 million of commodity price
degradation, consistent with the sensitivity, lower volumes on our KMCC pipe that we budgeted and lower margins in
our Transmix business.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, KMC was below its budget for the year by approximately $20 million due to FX.
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes and sustaining CapEx all came in lower than expected, therefore positive
variance versus our budget, and that was somewhat offset by higher G&A. The negative variance in G&A is driven by
the Hiland acquisition and lower capitalized overhead as a result of lower expansion capital spending.
On interest, the incremental interest, associated with financing the Hiland transaction, was more than offset by lower
balance than our budget and lower rates when you take out the impact of the Hiland transaction. Finally, we expect
cash taxes and sustaining CapEx – they came in lower than our budget or, said another way, they were a favorable
variance.
There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. One, we recorded an estimated $1.15
billion non-cash goodwill impairment on our midstream natural gas assets. We also recorded approximately $284
million in impairment on other assets, primarily in our CO2 segment. These impairments were driven by the lower
commodity price environment and also by lower stock prices. Let me give you this warning. If commodity and equity
prices continue to fall, then we may have impairments in future quarters.
We also recorded as a certain item in this quarter a $200 million benefit associated with the contract buyout payment
that we received on Kinder Morgan's Louisiana pipeline.
And with that, I'll turn to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with the net debt of $41.2
billion. Based on $7.37 billion of EBITDA, that gives us a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.6 times, again consistent with
where we thought we would end. The $41.2 billion is a increase in debt of $610 million for the full year, and it's a
decrease in debt of $1.235 billion for the quarter.
So let me reconcile first the quarter, $1.235 billion decrease in debt. We spent about a little under $940 million on
acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued equity of about $1.58 billion. The
contract buyout that was received on KMLA was $200 million, and we received an income tax refund of a little over
$150 million. And then working capital and other items were a source of cash of about over $240 million.
Now let me say that here, you would expect, I talked about coverage in the quarter being $950 million. That coverage is
based on the $0.125 dividend, the $953 million. What we actually paid in the fourth quarter was the dividend that we
declared in the third quarter, so the $0.51. And so when I'm reconciling the debt, the $0.51 dividend is what was paid in
the quarter and the cash that went out the door. So you do not see the benefit in the fourth quarter yet of the reduced
dividend. You will see that going forward beginning in the first quarter.
For the year, the change in debt was an increase of $610 million. We spent about $6.9 billion in cash on acquisitions,
expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. Hiland was $3.06 billion and then we spent about $3.4

billion in expansion CapEx. Those are the major components of the $6.9 billion.
We made a pension contribution of $50 million. We issued equity, including the preferred of $5.4 billion. The contract
buyout on KMLA was $200 million. We received $347 million in income tax refunds, and then we had about $400
million of coverage and other working capital items that was a course of the cash. And that gets you to the $610 million
increase in debt. And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And Vince, if you'll come back on, we'll take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue
comes from Mr. Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, Rich. Let's see, on CapEx in the high-grading process for
the growth CapEx backlog, Rich or Steve, can you just kind of walk through the process of how you evaluate each
project in that context, and what thoughts go into whether you go forward with the project or not related to
counterparties and related to return metrics? And obviously, you're out of the market, so the current yield shouldn't
matter to you. But obviously, you have some metric or hurdle rate internally. Has that changed at all over the last 6
months to 12 months?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we've elevated our return criteria. And, look, the way we've gone through our project
backlog is to take out of it things that we haven't committed to that don't meet current return hurdle. And I won't tell
you exactly what that is. But I think a reasonable benchmark is to think of mid-teens returns after-tax. Okay? And what
we're trying to do is really make sure that we're investing capital in the highest return opportunities that we have, make
sure that we're fulfilling our commitments and delaying spend where it can be delayed or deferred, and taking on
partners where it makes sense for us to take on partners.
And I think what we've been able to do successfully over the years is originate really good returning midstream energy
projects. And so, because we're able to do that, even though we're viewing our capital as quite finite, there are people
out there who are happy to participate with us as partners and we're exploring those opportunities where those make
sense.
So we think our returns are adequate on separable projects that could be joint ventured. They're quite good and we
think people will be interested in joining us in those projects. We would continue to build it, own it, operate it, et
cetera. But it gives us an opportunity to free up capital, to deploy in higher return opportunities or to use with the
balance sheet, or to ultimately, in the longer term, return cash or increase dividends just depending on what the
circumstances – what appears to be most rewarded at the time.
So, it's really doing economically rational things like deferring spend where you can. We've flushed out some scope
changes, cost savings, other things that are real improvements to the economics, finding joint venture partners where
those things make sense, and channeling the capital that we have to the highest returns that are in the backlog right
now, and potentially to some new projects. So, again, our capital is constrained for that.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: That's quite helpful, actually. I guess the same topic or same general topic, different item.
Elba, so, go-ahead expected in May. What's the process with Shell in terms of getting formal approval or FID for that
project? And have you had any communications or color from...

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, it's under contract and it's approved to go forward. And just again a reminder on that, that
contract is – we're not taking commodity risks on that facility. Shell has signed up for a 20-year contract. They'll make
this part of the LNG that's in their portfolio. And so we're not taking – they're entering into a terminal use agreement
essentially with us on that project. They also have enough of a portfolio around the world that they don't need, and it's
not hinged on, dependent upon non-free trade act approval.
So that project is very much a go from our perspective. We do need our FERC 7(c) certificate, and we're in that process
now. We filed for it and expect to get it in roughly second quarter? Yeah, okay, second quarter. And we have applied
for and think we should be able to obtain non-free trade agreement authority, too, to take that commodity – for Shell to
take that commodity to other places. So, things are proceeding very well there.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: So the FTA approval is just an incremental benefit to Shell. It has not...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's non-FTA. Right, non-FTA. Yeah, they can go to free trade act agreement countries as it is.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. So just, I mean, it sounds like it's essentially a go, assuming that the FERC timeline
hits on kind of the May or midyear timeframe.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That's correct.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. Any color or commentaries around construction cost? Presumably, it gets to be an
easier project, given where we are in the macro environment and labor cost and all that good stuff.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. No, it's a fair point. The construction environment for LNG facilities is improving, and
we are working on an EPC contract and we have plenty of interest in that. So with an EPC contract – there's nothing in
this world that's turnkey in anything that's this complex, but that allows us to shift a considerable amount of the
construction risk to the contractor.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. Well, that sounds like all good news. I'll jump back in the queue for further
questions. Thank you, guys.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Miss Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Kristina. How are you this afternoon?
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Good, guys. How are you? I really appreciate the CapEx number. The quick question there,
I don't know if I missed it at some point during the call, but did you guys give an update on NED and how I should be
thinking about that and where it sits within the growth backlog?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: NED is in the growth backlog. Without commenting on any really specific project, because
we've got competitors and customers there, I think just more broadly, we are going through the process that I described
earlier on the backlog and looking at the whole thing and, where appropriate, taking joint venture partners, et cetera. So
really, I mean, you can think of that process as we're evaluating and looking as it's applying to a large part of our
backlog.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: All right. Perfect. I just wanted to make sure that's still in there. And then you guys gave a
lot of great clarity around counterparty details, so thanks for those. But how about on the lower end of the scale? If I
aggregated counterparties that were like B minus or below, do you know how large that number would be as a percent
of revenue, and just how I should be thinking about that?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: I do not have that at my fingertips, but let me tell you what we're going to try to accomplish by
the time we see you all next week. We're going to have the numbers that I took you through with a little more
specificity and maybe some refinement to them, and we're also going to be trying to quantify, at least in select cases, a
net exposure number.
So in other words, you can't think of exposures in gross terms. You have to think of the value of the thing that you're
selling if you resold it in a market. And so, we're looking at some of those things, too, to give you a little bit more color
around it. I mean I would say that generally, when we look at our top 25 customers, we pick those as a fairly
representative grouping. And as I said, that's about 44% of our revenues.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Perfect. That's helpful. And lastly, Rich, maybe to get you to pontificate a bit, because I get
this question all the time, can you just maybe touch on high level what you think is going on out there? Like, I mean it's
been roughly a month-ish since we had the dividend cut to reset market expectations, but there's still like a lot of
volatility. How are you thinking about what's generally going on in our market?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Are you talking about the market in general or Kinder Morgan specifically?
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: I'm doing both of them.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Both of them. Well, I'm good at pontification as long as I follow Mark Twain's old saying,
making predictions is difficult particularly when they concern the future. But I think looking at where we are today, I
mean I'm obviously very disappointed, as you would expect, at where the KMI stock price is and the way the market
has treated us post the dividend. We thought we took a great deal of uncertainty out of the equation. And as I said, the
key fundamental thing is the amount of distributable cash flow we produce. And of course, valuation 101 would say
that regardless of what you do with your free cash flow, your distributable cash flow, whether you dividend it out, put it
in new projects, as long as those are good new projects and ours are, or buy back stock or pay down debt, really should
make no difference from a valuation standpoint. But clearly, parts of the market are not on that same page.
I believe that long term, the fact that we have no need to access the equity markets, not just for 2016 but for the
foreseeable future and that we will self-fund our capital expenditures. Our growth capital should, in the long run, I
think, be a very solid underpinning to this company. And we're going to be able to return a lot more money to our
shareholders in the long term, as well as delever the balance sheet.
I think as far as the overall market is concerned, I said in the opening remarks it seems like a Chicken Little the sky is
falling market. There seems to be no discrimination based on quality or based on virtually anything. It's just if oil prices
go down, sell everything in the energy sector. I think that's a very wrongheaded short-term view, but the market is what
the market is. And obviously, we believe we're tremendously underpriced.
If you look, here's a company that's going to have close to $5 billion in free cash flow in the total market cap, but this
level is $27 billion, $28 billion. I'm afraid to even compute it. It upsets me so much. But that's my feeling on it,
probably more than you wanted to hear. But as the largest shareholder, I can tell you it's very frustrating.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Well, then I say congrats on the DCF number. That's it for me, guys. Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay.

<Q - Theodore J. Durbin>: Okay, Rich. Thanks. Just going back to the CapEx here, the projects, the $3.3 billion.
How much of that is for projects that should come into service, say, in this year or maybe in the next year? How much
EBITDA uplift should we be looking for there versus how much of these are more the longer lead time type projects?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. And I don't have, off the top of my head, breakdown on the timing on in-service for the
remaining $3.3 billion. I mean it's going to be a combination. I mean, we will give you updates when we get together
next week about the projects and the associated in-service dates and things like that when we have the conference next
week.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Ted, one way to look at all this – and Kim will take you through more of this next week –
is it's hard to predict what's going to happen. There's so many winds blowing in all kinds of directions in this market,
but I think we can give you some guidance. The fact that you look at what our backlog is, which we reduced, but that
backlog should produce a certain level of cash flow.
And if we're funding it ourselves. You don't need to deduct interest from that or additional equity issuance. You just
look at how much that backlog is going to produce as the pig goes to the boa constrictor. And then you can add that on
to whatever view you want to take of commodity prices or anything else.
It should be a pretty simple way of looking forward and applying your own view of the bigger market. And we're going
to move down that line, show you some of that at the Investor conference next week.
<Q - Theodore J. Durbin>: Got it. Appreciate that. Just on Terminals here, we had a tough quarter. I guess thinking
through to 2016, how much of that is going to flow through? What do you have in terms of the minimum volume
commitments and how those run off and maybe even of our multiyear view on Terminals?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: So, Ted, as you saw today in the press release, we revised the 2016 budget. And so, both
the Arch and the Alpha bankruptcy we have taken into account in the 2016 budget.
<Q - Theodore J. Durbin>: Okay. Great. And then if I could just squeeze one more in just on the hedging, where are
you guys on hedging in the CO2?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: On CO2 hedging for 2016, about 70% hedged at $69; in 2017, 54% at $73; 39% in 2018
at $75; and 21% in 2019 at $65.
<Q - Theodore J. Durbin>: Perfect. I'll leave it at that. Thank you. See you next week.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Jeremy.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Hi. Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could walk us through a little bit more on the
high-grading the projects as far as that applies to CO2 and what prices you guys need to see out there to deploy capital.
Or what still makes sense in this commodity price environment, could you help us think through that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes. So, CO2 has been a multi-part capital review because we've been keeping up with
commodity prices as they've come down. And so, what we're spending money on, when we put incremental capital into
CO2, what we're looking at is getting a very good return in upper teens or 20-plus-percent after-tax unlevered return
incrementally, meaning for the oil that that particular program or that particular development is going to produce at the
current forward curve.
And then we also look at – when we're doing the evaluation, we look at what an NPV 15 breakeven price is for crude
so that we can kind of see how much, if you will, headroom or how much room we have to have that be a successful
program if we proceed with it. So we've been – as prices have been coming down, we've been bringing the CapEx
down, and we've been eliminating programs. It still makes sense to invest in some programs, but you're going to see a
lower CapEx number for CO2 for 2016 than probably we've ever had but still some pretty decent production with that
plan. So we keep bringing it down and we look at the price those two ways.

And the third thing I would say about the way we evaluate it is that these are program spends, right? So what you're
doing is you say, okay, we're going to do this many infills in SACROC. Okay. So we're going to go out and do infills.
The infills produce oil. That tends to be front-end loaded. But if they're not performing the way we think they should,
or the price isn't where we think that it needs to be – and I'm just picking out infills. That's probably a pretty high
return, high-end project for us, but just to use it as an example – we have the flexibility to scale that program back and
not deploy that capital. So we have high graded the CO2 capital, kept up to date with what commodity prices are.
Although as you know and as you can see from today, that's a day-to-day exercise. But we also have flexibility in the
spend when we do deploy it.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. I was wondering as well on the gathering and
processing business, thoughts that you guys have as far as visibility into volumes and if you could help us think through
that and where producers are because everything is changing so rapidly. So, just wondering how you think about that
and what risk you see to that part of it.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, I'll start and let Tom pick up with additional detail. The gathering and processing part of
our business, that really has two parts to it. I mean, there is a piece of that business that is secured under transport
agreements with minimum takes that look something like, which you would see in a – or in a gathering agreement, or a
fee-based processing arrangement which looks something like you would see in the rest of our business.
The second part of that business is percentage of proceeds kinds of business where we are more exposed to commodity
price. We picked up some of that with Copano and some of that with the Hiland acquisitions as well. And so you have
to kind of break it apart, and we're talking about seeing if we can break that out further – quantify that further so that
people can see the two parts of that business.
What we're trying to do on the percentage of proceeds part is to try to migrate that more to fee-based, so we're kind of
in the start of that process right now. But we do have exposure there. So then that becomes commodity price
assumption driven, what do you think commodity prices are going to be, what do you think processing spreads are
going to be. And we made some high-level assumptions in the budget, including a NGL price deck that we use. And so
we think we've calibrated that reasonably well. But there is certainly variability in part two of that business, as I've
mentioned it.
Tom, anything more?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. No, I mean I would just say overall that volume trend, I think we do better than our
peers. I mean, our network is in, I would say, the premier locations of all of these basins. But I mean there's no question
as you trend in time, these low commodity prices, you'll see lower volume activity. But again, as Steve said, there's a
high-degree component on many of these agreements where we have some fixed component to that. So it's really just
on that volume metric component of the overall [indiscernible].
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thanks for that. And then just to make sure I had it right, as far as the capital market
activity for 2016, was that no activity for equity and was that no activity on the debt side as well? Did I get that right?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We'll go through that at the Investor conference, but that's generally what we're thinking.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. Great. Thanks for that. That's it for me.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: So there's been some questions about what's involved in raising the hurdle for growth CapEx
and kind of trying to hone CapEx portfolio down, to the point of what was raised by Steve that you definitely kind of
view a limited amount of potential spend to be had and hence looking for third party capital or JV relationships. Is there

Page 12 of 17
a particular absolute or proportion of DCF that, on average and annual spend, you kind of see as your sweet spot?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. I think, look – again, you got to break all these things down. If you look at some of the
capital projects that we do that are, if you will, build-outs of our existing network, those things are very high-returning
projects and they're on our network. So it's not like we're going to look for a JV partner on them. And in many cases,
like where it's building out connections or adding some capability in a terminal or something like that, it's really not
separable and we can do it. And we can get relatively quick and early returns and generally very good returns for it.
And then there are projects maybe at the other end where they're quite attractive for a market return. They're probably
less of a return than what we are looking for on an incremental investment basis, and they are separable or identifiably
separate from the rest of our network, and those would be obvious JV candidates for us.
But look, what we're trying to mainly do here is we're trying to make sure that we, first and foremost, defend our
debt-to-EBITDA metrics and maintain a secure investment-grade rating. And the CapEx that we spend in 2016 drives
that. So we're going to be very mindful, and we're going to treat it as finite and precious, and we're going to allocate it
to the highest available returns that we have.
But there are going to be projects that we're going to have the opportunity to do, and we're going to continue to do
those. And we're going to JV the ones that are, if you will, amenable to being JV-ed where we continue to build the
projects, operate it and own a significant interest in it. But we maybe bring third-party capital in, in order to help cover
some of that cost. So I mean, broadly, that's how we're looking at these things going forward.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: That helps and it makes sense. I guess what I'm trying to get at is on an absolute basis, when
you think about getting your arms around the balance sheet, achieving the transition, if there was a large chunky
position in the growth CapEx inventory that dropped out, would that change how you look at new projects and
alternatives?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, look, I think you have to look at what the situation is when and if that occurs.
Obviously, in today's market, if something happened, we'd love to be buying stock at this kind of ridiculous level. But
that may not be the case a year or two years from now. If the market is more rational, we might use that to increase the
dividend. We're certainly going to be continuously mindful, as Steve said, of keeping our investment-grade rating and
maintaining a real solid balance sheet.
But just very simplistically, and we outlined this in the released today, even after we have done a revised budget,
reducing measurably the commodity assumptions and raising the interest rates projection in accordance with the
forward curve, you do all that and we still have $4.9 billion of DCF for the equity holders. You deduct the roughly
$150 million in preferred dividends, it leaves you about $4.7 billion available to the common. You pay $1.1 billion in
the reduced dividends, that leaves you $3.6 billion. And as we've said, we reduced our capital expenditure program to a
little less than $3.3 billion.
Now, there's a heck of a lot of other moving parts in that. But when you just look at very simplistically the ability to
fund the capital project program, we can do that. Now to the extent that that $3.3 billion is something less than that, that
would free up more money to either further delever the balance sheet or return to shareholders through one of the two
methods that we've talked about.
So I think the real message here, guys, is we are self-funding now. Okay? And I got to tell you that, to me, that's a big
relief. Nobody is affected any more than I was by the dividend cut. Okay? But the point is we are building a very solid,
stable balance sheet with the ability to return an awful lot of cash to our shareholders over the next few years.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Thanks. That's helpful. I look forward to next week.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How are you?
<Q - John Edwards>: I'm good, Rich, given the market circumstances, I guess as best as can be expected. I'll just ask
a couple of questions. I'll save the rest for next week. But just I'm wondering on contracts, particularly the natural gas
sector, are you seeing rates fall on contract rolls? And then what's kind of your average contract tenure now, and if you
are seeing rates come down a bit, kind of order of magnitude if you could give us a ballpark?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I'm thinking Tom can weigh in here. I think we have – we continue to see good strength
on our renewals in our Texas intrastate business. SNG is very strong. TGP, the eastern pipes are very strong. The place
where we've seen – and we've seen it some this year already, John – is on some of the pipes that are exporting out of
the Rockies. Okay. So there, we've seen deterioration on renewals. But generally speaking, we've got a great set of
natural gas assets and very strong, I think well-positioned for the longer term.
If you look in the appendix to our normal Investor presentation deck, you'll see a layout of contract tenures for each of
our business units, and we'll have an updated version of that for everybody next week.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. Fair enough. And then how do you view the probability now, on – I think you had the
supply path and the market path on Northeast Direct. You had secured – you had obviously roughly secured one of
those paths. Where do things stand on the rest of it?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think we continue to make progress there. And as I said, we'll continue to evaluate it as we
evaluate all the projects that we have in the backlog.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then just the last thing, in terms of the change in capital spend, I mean you already
alluded to the fact that a lot of that was because of the fall in commodity prices, so you're taking out of it in the CO2
segment, and then you've raised the hurdle rate as well. I guess, if you could, what's contributing to that and also, just
range, about how much you've raised your hurdle rate overall, that would be great.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. Yeah, I mean, on the CO2, I mean we'll have all the expansion capital laid out by
business unit next week, and you'll see what makes up that $3.3 billion. And that's got everything in it, including
assumed acquisitions. So we'll give you the full breakdown of that. And as I said a little earlier in the call, you got to
look at every project individually and how secure the contracts are, what the creditworthiness of the counterparty is,
how secure the revenues are, whether there are upsides in it, et cetera. But we have been elevating what we're
evaluating, investing in to kind of a mid-teens after-tax return area. And so we may be waiting to see that, right? I
mean, we'll see some of those opportunities build out of our existing network, but we're prepared to wait and see if
that's what it takes to make sure that we're allocating capital to the best opportunities.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And just my final one is just kind of asking Kristina's question a different way. How
much revenue faces credit risk? I mean, in terms of what's the risk of loss? I mean you went into a lot of details and
everything. I mean would you say it's 1% or 2% of EBITDA overall, or is there something more? How should we think
about that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, it's hard to quantify the answer to that question. I think you can take comfort in the fact
that we've got a very diverse set of customers. It's a relatively small number that amount to even more than 1% of our
revenue. And one quick clarification there, revenue is an interesting subject when you're thinking about something like
the Texas intrastates where the revenue moves with – the cost of goods sold and revenue move kind of in tandem with
commodity prices. In that case, we look at margin, all right? But...
<Q - John Edwards>: I mean margins, Steve. You know what I'm getting at.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, yeah. So I think you can take comfort in the fact that there's a relatively small group of
customers that even amount to 20% – or 1%, 20 customers amounting to 1% or more. And the top 25 customers, 80%
of that is investment grade. And I don't have better specific data points to give you than what I did, but I think that if
you – I think we compare favorably to a lot of other people in our sector when you consider those metrics versus what a
lot of other people are facing.

came. But, no, we had a combination of efficiency gains, I would call them, where we reduced scope or found a
cheaper way to do things. We did cancel some projects or assume away some previously unidentified acquisitions. That
was probably on the order of two-thirds of that number, canceled or suspended or just assumed away, right, that we
wouldn't do as many acquisitions as we had in our previous budget expectation. So that would be the biggest chunk of
it, but it is a combination of things.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: But we're going to break those down business segment by business segment at the
conference next week, so you can see kind of where the changes are between what our original budget was and where
we are now.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And so there's not one specific project that accounts more a majority of that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. No.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. And then on NGPL, with your acquiring an additional stake in it, is there any CapEx in
there or in your budget allocation for an equity infusion, or what are the plans there on NGPL?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We did assume some capital in NGPL. We do have some pretty attractive expansion projects
there that we and our partner intend to go forward with, and that'll just be a subpart of the gas group. I'm not sure we're
going to be breaking that out separately.
<Q - Becca Followill>: But in terms of an equity infusion, there's nothing assumed in there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. We do assume that we'll be putting some capital into NGPL to help support project
development for next year.
<Q - Becca Followill>: But beyond project development, no additional equity infusion?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: There's some.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: There's some.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. There's...
<Q - Becca Followill>: There is some in there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes. That's...
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: ...in our budget.

<Q - Becca Followill>: Perfect. Thank you. That's all I have.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, Becca.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Bill Green with EMT Investments. Sir, your line is open.
<Q>: Yes, primarily for Rich. I'm a very substantial shareholder, family shareholder since 1990, the late 1990s, when
you went public. And the stock seems to be, as you've indicated, ridiculously cheap, but it's a dividend orientation,
return of capital, dividend orientation. So the question is with all these moving parts that you've described – and you
went through a description before about the balancing act between the capital spending and the growth – now just
doing a little back of the envelope arithmetic here, if you'd kept to the 10% dividend increase that you'd promised
originally, if there'd been no trouble in the credit markets the way there was, you would have had something like a $3
or $3.20 dividend five years down the road, which would have produced about an 8% yield on the $40 stock that you
then had. Now you've got a stock roughly 25% of that $40.
If you look out, I know you can't be too specific, but in terms of having a basis to buy the stock here, obviously the
dividend in the future, three years to five years down the road, is going to be the crucial determinant, as the capital
spending starts to fade away. So is there any kind of guidance that you can give numerically about that balancing act so
that a person who says, I'm going to buy a $12 stock today – obviously, if you stopped all capital spending today, you'd
have a 20% return with the $2 dividend if you restored it. So the balance between the capital spending and the growth
that you're going to develop for that is crucial here to getting some handle on the ultimate investment return here. So it
would be very powerfully useful to have a little more definitive color on that balancing act, Rich, in terms of the
five-year outlook. I mean, what can we, as shareholders, paying $12 today look for in terms of a dividend five years
down the road as the capital spending may phase down?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Hey. This is Kim. I think in terms of what you can expect as a dividend, that's hard to
say today. I think in terms of what we – next week at the conference, as Rich said, we're going to show you the
portfolio of – the backlog of projects that we have. We're going to give you an approximate multiple that we expect to
earn on that. And so, that is just the backlog. It has nothing to do with our base business, but you will get a sense for
how much distributable cash flow we think will be produced from that backlog, and then people can make whatever
assumptions they want to make about what happens with the base business and where exactly we take the balance sheet
and how we return capital at some point to people, whether that's share repurchase or dividends or otherwise.
But I think there is very good financial theory that says whether a company pays a dividend or doesn't pay a dividend, it
does not impact the value of the firm. So we can tell you how much cash that we're going to produce from these
investments. And then I think from that, you can come up with what you think the value of the stock is worth.
<Q>: Yeah. But as long as you keep spending capital, you're not going to be able to distribute that and do the good
things you're talking about. So there's got to be some end point here. It's sort of like the Amazon story in a different
industry. I mean, as long as you continue to spend capital at this rate, you're not going to have the funds available to
distribute it in the fashion you're talking about. So how do we get some fix because...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: What you're saying is that the value of the firm depends on the dividend policy.
<Q>: No, no. It can depend on a lot of different things. What I'm looking here, $6.4 billion in distributable cash flow
with your current capitalization would produce that $3 dividend. So are you going to get to $6.4 billion or so five years
down the road? That was sort of the original promise that Rich had made last year with the 6% to 10% dividend
increase or the 10% dividend increase on the $40 stock. I mean that's why we held the stock there. I mean had we any
suspicion – the question is getting some idea of the flow here, of the path. The path is crucial in some sense of that;
otherwise, you've got a $12 stock here, which is a disaster, as we all agree.

So the market isn't following your line of thinking. That's the problem. The market isn't looking at the valuation of the
company the way you would like it to, because you converted from an MLP and there is a tremendous focus on
dividend. And now, there's the fear that that dividend isn't even secure, not so much for you guys, but for other people
because of the problem with the debt and the problem with the availability of financing given the challenges.
So the question is – that's the game here. It's a numbers game. And the question is how are those numbers going to play
out? Do we have a $6.4 billion DCF in the future which will be available for payment? That's the key, isn't it? Tell me
if I'm wrong.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: What we've tried to say is that we are going to have a lot of cash flow.
<Q>: Yes.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And you can take where – just let me finish, please.
<Q>: Sure.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: You can take what we have today which is roughly $5 billion of free cash flow. You can
look at our backlog. We can give you an idea of what the expected return on that is. And then you can take that
number. And let's say that's a dollar, whatever it is, per share. You can take that and add it to our present number and
build up what you think the cash flow will be in 2020 or 2021.
But I want to again caution you that we have not been in this business 35 years. This is the most – more headwinds,
side winds, anything that I've ever seen. And to sit here and give you a number in 2020 would be insulting to you and
to everybody else. And what we're trying to tell you is we've got a lot of cash flow. We're going to do that – we're
going to use that in the way that makes the most sense for the company and its shareholders.
And if that involves buying back shares or increasing the dividend to a level, that's what we're going to do. We're not
going to waste the dollars. And the backup for that is just what Steve's talked about, is we're high grading. We reduced
the backlog by $3.1 billion. To the extent we reduce it further or joint venture more of the backlog, that is going to free
up more cash earlier. On the other hand, it is going to, in the long run, depreciate somewhat the amount of cash we
have coming out of those additional investments as a result of the backlog.
So this is what we're committed to. We showed you what we generated. We're going to generate – we generate $2.14
last year. And that, we think, is going to continue to grow very nicely over the years.
<Q>: Right. But the question is will the capital expenditures at some point – in other words, it is very much the
Amazon story. At some point, we're going to stop spending and produce large earnings and large dividends. Right now,
if I go back to the $40 promise, you were not afraid then to talk about a 10% dividend increase at that time. So I'm
assuming that that situation is still pretty much in force. It's just that the numbers have changed for all the reasons we
know.
But as far as the basic business is concerned, which is what I'm hanging my hat on, because I haven't sold a share
either, is whether to buy more shares based on the idea that that original promise that you made is still pretty much
intact. And the way that promise is going to come to fruition is in the year 2021, let's say, we won't have the CapEx or
we'll be able to start distributing huge amounts of money to shareholders. I mean that's the thing we're all looking for, I
think.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Let me close it off...
<Q>: Is that wrong or not wrong, that thinking?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think I've answered the question, and what we're trying to say is this is a very complicated
world. We are generating cash flow. That cash flow, we think, will be increasing as time goes on, and we have uses for
it and we're going to look at it at that time as to what makes the most sense. Of course, as we finish these capital
projects, we do not anticipate huge new additional capital projects, but we'll see what the opportunities are in those
out-years.

The whole thing is to create value for the shareholders. And if the best way to do that is distributing it in dividends,
that's what we're going to do. If the best way is to delever the balance sheet, that's what we're going to do. It's a
combination of all these factors. In this hectic market, it's just very difficult to give you some specific number you can
rely on in 2020 or 2021.
But I appreciate your concern and certainly, we agree with you. I'm the largest shareholder. I want to see all kinds of
value derived by the common shareholders of this company.
<Q>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. At this time, we don't have any further questions on queue.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Well, thank you very much. We appreciate you listening with us, and we'll see most of you next week in
Houston. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.
