MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call.
Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K,
10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ
materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of
acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash
flow less capital expenditures and adjusted for after-tax impacts of major divestitures. Adjusted free cash flow
productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding divestiture gains. Any measure described
as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website,

Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.
Jon R. Moeller
Thanks and good morning, everyone. I'm here this morning with Bob McDonald and Teri List-Stoll.
Our third quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line. Market share showed broad-based improvement
and strengthened as the quarter progressed. And we're ahead of plan on operating profit, earnings per share, and cash
flow. We announced an increase in our dividend, and we're increasing our share repurchase projection on this call to
the top end of our target range.
In the March quarter, organic sales grew 3%. Sales came in at the low end of the guidance range, due in part to slower
market growth. Underlying global market growth was choppy month to month and was down about 0.5 point in the
March quarter versus the December quarter. Organic volume grew 2%, and pricing added one point to organic sales
growth. Product and geographic mix was neutral to sales growth. Foreign exchange impacts lowered sales growth by
one point, resulting in all-in sales growth of 2%.
Global market share trends have continued to improve. We held or grew market share in businesses representing over
50% of sales in the March quarter, the third consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement, from 30% in the June quarter
to 45% in the September quarter to just below 50% in the December quarter and now over 50%. Within the quarter, we
saw sequential market share strength, ending the period with a strong month in March.
In the U.S., we held or grew value share in businesses representing two-thirds of sales in the March quarter. This is up
from 15% in the June quarter of last fiscal year and about 55% in the first half of this fiscal. As with the rest of the
company, results strengthened as the quarter progressed, with businesses representing over 70% of sales holding or
growing share in the month of March. We have more work to do, but trends are continuing to improve.
Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $0.88. All-in earnings per share include an $0.08 non-core
impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and $0.03 of non-core restructuring investments to drive
productivity improvement. Core earnings per share were $0.99, up 5% versus the prior year and $0.03 above the high
end of our guidance range. Better than expected earnings were driven by strong cost savings and productivity progress,
particularly in SG&A, where we are exceeding enrollment reduction targets.
One of the objectives of our productivity and cost savings plan was to create financial flexibility to maintain strong
investment levels and long-term growth while delivering on our bottom line commitments, even when we face a
weaker macro environment or other challenges. This quarter is a good example. We over-delivered our going-in
guidance despite slower market growth.
Core operating profit margin grew 10 basis points, including 260 basis points of productivity improvements and cost
savings. Core gross margin improved 20 basis points. Cost savings and productivity helped gross margin by 170 basis
points. Pricing and volume leverage improved gross margin by roughly 80 basis points. These benefits were partially
offset by a 120 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix. Innovation and new
production capacity startup costs lowered gross margin by about 70 basis points. And commodity costs and foreign
exchange were a combined negative impact of approximately 40 basis points.
Core SG&A costs increased 10 basis points. Overhead cost savings of approximately 90 basis points and top line
leverage were offset by higher marketing spending, increased plans and benefit costs, and foreign exchange impacts.
On an all-in basis, including restructuring costs and non-core impacts from Venezuela, gross margin improved 50 basis
points, and SG&A costs increased 40 basis points. All-in operating profit margin improved 20 basis points.
As we highlighted on our last earnings call, the March quarter tax rate was reduced by the true-up needed to reflect the
extension of U.S. corporate tax law benefits by Congress in early January. The core effective tax rate for the quarter

was 22.2%, about a point below the prior-year level and consistent with guidance.
We generated $3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which is also ahead of our initial forecast. We delivered
adjusted free cash flow productivity of 114% for the quarter, which brings fiscal year-to-date adjusted free cash flow
productivity to over 90%. This compares to a year-ago year-to-date cash flow productivity figure of 76%.
During the quarter we repurchased $1 billion in stock. This brings fiscal year-to-date repurchases to $5 billion
compared to our estimate of $5 billion to $6 billion for the full fiscal year. We returned $1.6 billion of cash to
shareholders in dividends. Earlier this month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7%. This marks the 123rd
consecutive year in which we paid a dividend and the 57th consecutive year in which the dividend has increased. At the
new annualized dividend of $2.41 per share, our current dividend yield is about 3%.
We remain committed to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Fiscal year to date
we've returned $9.8 billion to shareholders, $4.8 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchase. Over the past
10 years we've returned nearly $98 billion of cash to shareholders, over 90% of net earnings.
Stepping back we're continuing to make good steady progress on our plans. We're on track on the top line despite
choppy market conditions with improving market share driven by innovation. Productivity savings are strong, enabling
us to beat our bottom line commitments while maintaining strong investment levels for long-term growth. We're
generating solid cash flow and aggressively returning cash to shareholders.
As we complete fiscal 2013 and finalize our plans for fiscal 2014, our priorities remain unchanged, maintaining strong
developing market momentum, strengthening our core developed market business, building and leveraging a strong
innovation pipeline, and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements to fuel growth. I'll briefly
step through progress on each of these four priorities.
First, maintaining strong developing market momentum. Organic sales in developing markets grew 7% in the March
quarter, consistent with the growth rate in the first half of the fiscal year, despite a modest deceleration in market
growth, particularly in Brazil and China. Our business in India grew organic sales more than 20%, the 43rd consecutive
quarter of double-digit sales growth. Organic sales in Brazil were up 8%, as we grew market share for the 36th
consecutive month. China organic sales growth improved versus first half growth rates with businesses representing
roughly 75% of sales sequentially improving market share.
We're growing beyond the BRIC markets. In Argentina and Venezuela, local currency sales were up about 20% in the
March quarter. In West Africa, sales were up the high teens.
Portfolio expansion continues to be an important component of our developing market plans. This fiscal year we'll
expand our portfolio to over 30 new category/country combinations. Portfolio expansion is enabling us to build scale
and improve profitability in these markets. We're localizing production, which lowers supply chain costs and improves
customer service. And we're improving the productivity of our SG&A spending as these businesses grow. These are
two important drivers of significant profit improvement we expect to deliver in our top 10 developing markets this
year.
We're improving profits while increasing marketing spending and accelerating the pace of innovation. While we're
being prudent with the pace of our expansions, we are in no way pulling back. By the end of this fiscal year, developing
markets will represent nearly 40% of annual sales and over 45% of shipments. Sales and after-tax profit in developing
markets have both increased fourfold over the last 10 years. We remain committed to strong, profitable growth in
developing markets.
At the same time, we're working to strengthen our core developed market business, with a focus on the 40 largest
category/country combinations. Most of these businesses are in developed markets and account for about 50% of
company sales and 70% of operating profit.
In the U.S. we held or grew value share in businesses representing two-thirds of sales in the March quarter, with over
70% of sales in the month of March. This is up from 15% in the June quarter of last fiscal year and about 55% in the
first half of this fiscal.

We're now growing share in Laundry, Diapers, Family Care, Dish Care, Oral Care, Blades and Razors, Hair Care,
Feminine Care, and Antiperspirants and Deodorants. While shares are below year-ago in Skin Care and Cosmetics,
recent innovations have helped drive sequential period-to-period share trend improvement. We have strong innovation
plans coming soon on Pet Care and Personal Cleansing that should help us return these businesses to share growth.
In Western Europe the percentage of businesses holding or growing share is up to 40% from lows of around 25%
earlier this fiscal year. And constant dollar share is improving sequentially on a past 12- to six- to three-month basis.
Japan results have also improved steadily over the past few quarters, returning to share growth during the March
quarter.
The improving developed market trends are being driven by stronger innovation, vertical portfolio expansion, and more
effective marketing, including strong performance in value claims as well as targeted consumer value corrections.
Innovation underpins all of our growth efforts as does our work to drive greater productivity in everything we do. It
would take a long time to go through each of the innovations we're leveraging, expanding, or introducing, so I thought
I'd focus on just five today.
First, Tide PODS. Tide PODS now hold a 6.5% value share of the U.S. detergents market and over a 75% share of the
unit dose form. We expect PODS will generate about $500 million of sales this fiscal year in one brand in one region.
With additional supply now online, we'll soon be able to increase our levels of advertising and in-store display to drive
more consumer trial.
There has been a lot written and said about the impact of PODS on the U.S. detergent category. There are several base
period impacts that are often, conveniently or inconveniently, being ignored in these comparisons. These include our
15% price correction on powder detergents, the impact of increasing high-efficiency washing machine penetration, and
unusually high market growth leading up to the PODS launch due to competitive pantry loading. By the end of the
summer most of these impacts will be fully into or out of the base period, and category growth rates should be more
stable.
Tide PODS are great for consumers. They provide consumers with a super-concentrated, exceptionally performing
detergent, brightener, and stain remover at just the right dosing level, all in one convenient package and product from a
brand they trust. Tide PODS delivers as much cleaning powder as the six next leading competitive unit dose products
combined.
Tide PODS are great for our retail customers. They offer customers a super-premium innovation on one of the strongest
brands in the world that sells for roughly double the category average price per load in a shelf space, return friendly,
compact form.
Tide PODS are great for the environment. They're the most concentrated detergent available in the market, significantly
reducing packaging materials and energy usage, making each load a more sustainable one.
And finally, Tide PODS are great for P&G shareholders. P&G PODS are a consumer preferred product delivered
through a proprietary formula, made on proprietary equipment using a proprietary manufacturing process. It's a
disruptive innovation that creates a significant competitive advantage for our brands.
Ariel 3in1 PODS started shipping in Western Europe earlier this month in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Next
month we'll begin selling PODS in Poland and the Baltic countries. Distribution results are excellent and week one
market shares are outstanding, already over a 3% share in France and a 2% share in Belgium.
We began the launch of Ariel PODS in Latin America, with initial shipments starting in Mexico in the March quarter,
and we'll start shipping in Brazil in a few weeks. We're just entering the Laundry category in South Africa, with
shipments to customers beginning in just a few weeks. Offerings will include a full range of detergent forms, including
Ariel 3in1 PODS.

Next, innovation in our Shave Care business; Gillette's Sensitive Skin innovations across Fusion and MACH3 blades
and razors and shave preps are leading to improved share results. Seventy percent of men believe they have sensitive
skin, and these innovations leverage the fact that our ProGlide products have been recommended by dermatologists in
the U.S. as the best shave for sensitive skin. In the March quarter, we held or grew value share in the U.S. in all three
major elements of male blades and razors, Fusion, MACH3, and disposables. And we're also growing share on Venus
blades and razors.
In the dry shaving category, we're in the midst of the global expansion of Braun CoolTec. CoolTec is the world's first
dry shaver with integrated active cooling technology, which is clinically proven to show a noticeable reduction in skin
irritation. Consumer response to Braun CoolTec has been outstanding in our testing and early in-market experience.
Next, we have a strong innovation bundle on Pet Care. In the March quarter, Iams launched a restage of its ProActive
Health premium dry dog and cat food lines. The restage includes new package sizing to hit consumer preferred price
points and new marketing messages that remind pet owners that their dogs and cats are not vegetarians. Some pet foods
add plant proteins like gluten. Iams has 50% more animal protein than competitive products and includes no added
gluten.
Over the next two months, Iams is launching several very exciting new product lines. Iams So Good will be the brand's
first entry to the mid-priced tier of dry dog food. Unlike other leading brands, So Good uses tasty, wholesome
ingredients like chicken, fruits, and vegetables with no dyes, no added sugar, and no artificial preservatives.
Iams Woof Delights are our first significant entry into the wet dog food segment. They use high-quality real meats and
fish like turkey, chicken, beef, and lamb with no added gluten, no fillers, with no artificial flavors. These innovations
are healthy alternatives for pets and pet owners and have been extremely well received by our retail customers. Iams So
Good starts shipping next week and Woof Delights will start shipping in late May.
We also have a strong program on U.S. Hair Care that has returned us to share growth, with value share up nearly one
point in March. Our Hair Care innovation bundle, launched in January, spans the vertical portfolio. Pantene Expert
Collection includes two super-premium lines, Age Defy and Advanced+ Keratin Repair. Age Defy leverages a new
formula based on our hair biology science, yielding hair that acts 10 years younger by thickening hair as if 6,500 new
strands were added. Pantene Advanced+ Keratin Repair formula leverages a breakthrough in new conditioner
technology to repair two years of hair damage in two minutes. The early results of Expert Collection have been very
good, delivering shipments, display, and trial results at or above our going-in plans. We started the expansion of
Pantene Expert Collection in Latin America, with a launch in Brazil in March.
We've also launched Vidal Sassoon Pro Series in the U.S., a complete hair care line offering shampoo, conditioner,
styling, and permanent color to give consumers salon genius brilliantly priced. Vidal Sassoon Pro Series is priced in the
salon affordable value-oriented segment. Vidal shampoo and conditioner are quickly approaching a 2% value share,
with shipments nearly double our prelaunch estimates.
We're especially pleased with the results of the Pantene and Vidal Sassoon innovations considering the high level of
competitive promotional activity during the quarter, which included buy one-get one offers and high-value instant
coupons. We also delivered strong hair results in many developing markets, including Wella Pro Series in Brazil and
Mexico, Head & Shoulders in Russia and Saudi Arabia, and across Pantene, Head & Shoulders, and Wella in India.
On the salon professional side of the business, Ilumina Color from Wella Professional leverages a new patented
MICROLIGHT technology, and is Wella's biggest innovation in the last 20 years. With Wella, consumers experience
hair that appears lit from within. Results in Europe and North America have been outstanding, delivering sales more
than 50% above internal launch commitments. We just completed the global rollout of Ilumina Color from Wella
Professional in the March quarter, with expansion into Latin America and Australia and New Zealand.
The last category I'll cover today is Oral Care, where innovation is driving strong market share trends in many markets.
Toothpaste all-outlet value share is up over one point in the U.S. to more than 37%, behind the continued strength of
innovations across the 3D White, Pro-Health, and Crest Complete lines. 3D White, which includes toothpaste, brush,
rinse, floss, and Whitestrips, is driving strong share growth in Mexico and the UK. Mexico reached an all-time high

toothpaste value share of nearly 14% for the quarter, up about three points versus prior year. In the UK, the
combination of 3D White, Oral-B Complete, and Oral-B Pro-Expert drove value share to over 10%, up nearly three
points versus the prior year. China market shares are also improving.
We've entered the toothpaste category in more than 40 markets over the past four years, including recent expansions in
markets as diverse as France, Australia, Senegal, and Cameroon. All of our expansions are delivering results at or
above expected levels. For example, in Australia we reached nearly an 8% value share of toothpaste just one month
after launch. In Latin America, Oral Care sales will be up about 50% this fiscal year.
We're growing through expansion but are also growing strongly in established markets behind innovation. In Mexico,
Oral Care sales are projected to be up nearly 40% this fiscal year. In Brazil, a market we entered four years ago, local
currency sales are forecasted to grow by more than 60% and shares up by nearly four points.
Now as you know, innovation is not just about invention. It's also about execution. We're delivering improved results
across all of our innovations by strengthening our execution with both consumers and retailers. Our communications
contain stronger performance and value claims, on air, in digital media, on the package, and at the shelf that
demonstrate the superior value our brands provide.
We're improving customer service levels, which along with improved innovation are being recognized by our retail
partners and in third-party evaluations. For example, Kantar Retail recently released China power rankings and named
P&G the overall winner by a wider margin than last year. We're increasing distribution in our top emerging markets
like China, Brazil, Russia, India, and Africa.
We're also getting new distribution with key retailers in developed markets based on the strength of our leading brands
and commitment to lead in innovation. We're growing share and distribution, for example, in the discounter channel.
We grew sales double digits in the channel for the quarter and are increasing distribution with new and existing retail
partners. We've also been successful in expanding distribution of Duracell batteries across several important accounts
that should continue to strengthen Duracell results in the coming quarters. So we have a very strong innovation
program that we're working to execute well globally.
Like innovation, productivity also underpins all of our developed and developing market efforts, and here too we're
making strong progress. The overhead reduction plan we announced last February called for a reduction in
non-manufacturing staffing of 10%, or roughly 5,700 roles, by the end of this fiscal year, so by June 30. As of the end
of March, we've reduced 6,250 roles, putting us 550 roles or about 10% above the fiscal year commitment with a full
quarter still to go.
Exceeding our goals this year gives us a running start on our announced plans to further reduce non-manufacturing
enrollment by an additional 2% to 4% each year over the next three years, bringing the total reduction to between 16%
and 22% by the end of fiscal 2016. We're making good progress on the organization design work being led by Jorge
Uribe and a team of senior business leaders. And we're feeling confident in our ability to deliver the additional
enrollment reduction objectives.
We're on track to deliver more than $1.2 billion in savings this fiscal year in cost of goods sold. Our efforts in this area
include a targeted 5% net productivity increase across our manufacturing operations, even as we add new
manufacturing capacity and enrollment in developing markets. This will allow us to add about 20 new manufacturing
operations with no increase in head count. So far this year, we're tracking well ahead of target at nearly 7%
manufacturing productivity improvement. While we're still early in the planning process, we already have line of sight
to at least $1.3 billion in additional cost of goods savings for next fiscal year.
We're also achieving efficiencies in marketing spending and are reinvesting these savings in strengthened plans to
support our innovations and expansions. We're shifting a greater portion of media spending to digital, which offers a
higher return on investment. We're also making good progress on cost savings in non-media marketing spending.
As we embrace our cost savings work, we will continue to keep our eye on the overriding objective of shareholder
value creation, with growth being an important part of this. In our efforts to cut costs, we will not compromise our

growth prospects or capabilities. We are building and executing our strategy, with the objective of getting this savings
and growth balance right.
Now let me turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2013 and the April – June quarter. Starting with the fiscal year,
we're holding our organic sales growth guidance range, which we improved last quarter, at 3% to 4%. Given results in
the first three quarters, it's likely we'll be closer to 3% than 4% for the full year. We expect all-in sales growth in a
range of 1% to 2%. This includes a foreign exchange headwind of two points based on year-to-date results and
mid-April spot rates for the fourth quarter. We're raising the low end of our core earnings per share guidance range by
$0.02 to $3.96 to $4.04, equating to an increase of 3% to 5% compared to prior-year core earnings per share of $3.85.
I want to repeat what I've said on several previous occasions relative to guidance. We set a guidance range for a reason.
We're committed to deliver a plan that creates long-term value for our shareholders. We will not chase commodities or
currency out the window just to deliver a top-of-range guidance number. We will execute our plan and we'll do it in the
most fiscally responsible way we know how.
We believe that our core earnings per share guidance range is realistic, not conservative, given several profit headwinds
we're facing. As I mentioned earlier, market growth rates have weakened. Dynamics in countries such as Venezuela,
Argentina, Egypt, Syria, and South Korea continue to be very volatile. Foreign exchange has moved against us in
markets such as Japan, Brazil, Argentina, and of course Venezuela. We're incurring preproduction expenses in cost of
goods sold as we start up several manufacturing operations simultaneously around the world. And we're investing in
marketing to drive our strong innovation pipeline.
We're adjusting our all-in earnings per share range to $3.90 to $3.98. This range reflects the improvement in core
earnings per share expectations, updated estimates for non-core restructuring costs, and the non-core impact of
Venezuela currency devaluation. The all-in earnings outlook now includes approximately $0.19 per share of non-core
restructuring investments, an increase of $0.04 since our last estimate, due mainly to higher than expected enrollment
reductions this fiscal year.
One risk not included in our all-in earnings guidance is the potential impact from revaluation of Venezuelan bolivars
earmarked for foreign currency transactions through the former SITME market. Venezuela has created a state-run
SICAD auction market to replace SITME. At this time, there's no official information available on the details or
planned frequency of the auction process or the underlying rates. So far, we've measured all of our Venezuela
exposures at the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. If it becomes clear as the SICAD market forms
that it will operate in a liquid and transparent manner at a different rate, we may need to adjust our balance sheet, which
will result in additional non-core impact on earnings. We will keep you updated on this is really more.
We continue to expect free cash flow productivity of 90% of net earnings for the year. We increased the dividend by
7% earlier this month, and are increasing our share repurchase target to $6 billion, which is at the top end of our prior
guidance range of $5 billion to $6 billion.
For the April to June quarter, we're estimating organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is
expected to be a two point headwind to sales growth, which leads to all-in sales growth guidance in the range of 1% to
2%.
On the bottom line, we expect June quarter core earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.77. We expect the
effective tax rate for the June quarter to be somewhat higher than previous year's rate. On an all-in basis, we estimate
earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.75, including non-core restructuring charges of approximately $0.02 per
share.
In summary, our third quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line. Market share showed broad-based
improvement. We're ahead of plan on operating profit, earnings per share, and cash flow. We've announced an increase
in our dividend, are increasing our share repurchase target, and have modestly tightened our fiscal year earnings per
share guidance range.

Having said this, we still have more work to do. The next piece of this work is planning for 2014, which we're starting
now. We plan to give guidance for 2014 on our next earnings call, which is scheduled for Thursday, August 1. This
will give us appropriate time to develop strong plans and more fully assess macro dynamics like foreign exchange and
commodities, market dynamics like Venezuela and Argentina, and internal dynamics such as pension costs, new
category expansions, and new innovations before providing our outlook.
We remain confident that our focus areas, maintaining momentum in developing markets, strengthening our core
developed market business, building and leveraging a strong innovation pipeline, and aggressively driving cost savings
and productivity improvement are the right ones; and that executing these with excellence should generate over time
the kind of earnings progress that will put us among the best in our industry. This combined with strong cash flow and
a track record of capital return to shareholders should enable us to generate superior levels of shareholder return.
That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and
will be available in slides which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. Bob, Teri, and I
would be happy take your questions, and the IR team will be available after the call to provide additional perspective.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about Beauty Care. I mean clearly
very good news to hear about how the U.S. Hair Care portfolio is performing in the U.S., especially given how
competitive it has been. But Beauty Care volume down 1%, organic sales down 1%; there's obviously a lot that you
didn't talk about, most notably probably Skin Care and I'm guessing also the overall China business. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Lauren, I think in Beauty and Grooming, we have three key points. Number one is we've
got a strong portfolio of leading brands. Number two is we've got clear plans and sufficient innovation to address these
near-term opportunities you're asking about. And number three, there's a significant opportunity to expand and grow
our Beauty and Grooming business beyond where it is today.
Let me deal with the clear plans and sufficient innovation piece, since I think that's where your question is coming
from. As you suggested, in Hair Care we're expanding the portfolio vertically with innovations like Vidal Sassoon Pro
Series in the salon affordable segment and Pantene Expert Series in the super-premium segment. And this has returned
U.S. Hair Care to share growth, with value share up one point in March, as Jon mentioned. In the U.S., Expert
Collection shipments, display, and trial results are all at or above expectation. And Vidal Sassoon shampoo and
conditioner is quickly approaching a 2% value share in shipments, or nearly double our prelaunch estimates.
In Blades and Razors, our sensitive skin innovation across Fusion and MACH3 blades and razors and shave preps is
leading to improved share results. We're holding or growing value share in the U.S. on Fusion, MACH3, and
disposables, and we're also growing share on Venus blades and razors.
In Cosmetics, share trends have improved sequentially over the past two quarters behind three exciting CoverGirl
innovations, Clump Crusher Mascara by LashBlast, Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Gloss, and Stay Fabulous 3-in-1
Foundation.
In Salon Professional, we've returned to growth behind the launch of Ilumina Color, which is delivering sales more
than 50% above going-in estimates. Billion-dollar Beauty and Grooming brands, I've talked about the strength of them.
And then in Skin Care, which was the point you asked about, Skin Care in China, we've launched several new
innovations, including upgrades to our existing lines and new innovations that address key segments where we have
portfolio gaps; examples, in the United States new Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Total Effects CC Cream,
Olay Fresh Effects. In China, YuLan You Naturals, Pro-X Whitening, a restage of the Olay brand, new counters, and

the launch of a new mid-tier brand. So results are improving sequentially, and I expect that sequential improvement to
continue.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: I think if you look at, as I mentioned, share comments, Lauren, versus year-ago, you're
absolutely right that Skin Care continues to be a drag in terms of market share being down versus year-ago. We have
more work to do there. But as Bob indicated, there have been a number of things that have been just recently put out on
the market that we hope to drive that behind.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: China Beauty shipments grew double digits this quarter.

Your next question is from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan. Please begin.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes, thanks. As we look at lower raw material inflation over the course of calendar 2013,
we're going to see less pricing in the category. And I guess we're not seeing a volume bounce-back, which is what's
leading to deceleration in your overall organic top line growth maybe in these categories. So can you talk about what
you're seeing from an elasticity standpoint as we look at less pricing and how you think that maybe plays out over the
course of the year? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: To me, John, Jon talked about the fact that in the quarter we saw a 0.5 point reduction in
growth versus the previous quarter. I think the economic recovery is going to continue to be choppy, as we've alluded
to in our remarks. And to me, the ultimate response is growth through innovation and growth through productivity
improvement. We're going to continue to work on our productivity improvement.
Jon talked about the fact we're ahead of the pace that we expected to be at this point in time. Some of that productivity
improvement will fall to the bottom line. Some of that productivity improvement will fuel the launch of the new
innovations and the new market category combinations. And as Jon said, we're not pulling back. We've introduced 30
new category/country combinations this year, and we're going to continue to do that. And Jon went through a litany of
those, including the broad global expansion of our Oral Care business. So we're expecting sequential improvement on
the top line, driven by innovation. And we're expecting continued sequential improvement in market share, just as we
tried to indicate with this quarter's report.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi. Bob, I just wanted to focus on the top line. The two-year average organic sales growth
decelerated in the quarter versus Q2 and last year despite the higher marketing and the greater innovation, and it looks
like it was even rounded up to get to 3%. I know you mentioned weaker market growth. But how comfortable are you
that you're getting a solid ROI on the investments you're making in marketing and innovation and the other areas given
the lack of the top line payback this quarter?
And second, more importantly, to broaden out the question longer term, it seems like in recent history you've been a bit
at the mercy of variances in market growth or the competitive environment from a top line perspective. Obviously, that
will impact any company. But market share has only improved modestly here sequentially in the last couple quarters
despite the price adjustment. So can you take us through some more detail on what you're doing internally from a
market share standpoint to manage through the external environment and your level of confidence that you can
sustainably turn around market share as we look out over the next couple years here?
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Yes, Dara, I'm very confident in our sequential improvement in market share driven by
innovation. I would differ with your characterization. I think we've made substantial progress in increasing the percent
of our business growing market share, and I think that ties pretty directly to the innovations you've seen. A classic

example is the fact that Tide PODS is helping us grow laundry market share in the U.S. And it's only on one brand in
one country, and it's worth $0.5 billion of top line.
I think we're in that early days of seeing these innovations have a broader impact globally, and that will translate to an
accelerated growth on the top line. We're continuing to invest in innovation. We've increased the spending on research
and development the past three years, and we're going to continue to make sure that we're building the capability to
keep that innovation going. And the results in the marketplace are demonstrating that we're executing with excellence
today, more so perhaps than the previous period you were talking about. So I'm confident we're going to continue this
sequential improvement, and you'll see it in the share and you'll see it on the top line.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: I share Bob's confidence. If you just step back over the last couple years, as we have discussed
many times, from a geographic standpoint, the one market that we weren't growing in that we needed to grow in was
North America, and that's obviously a large part of our business. And if you just look at the percentage of business
that's holding or growing share there, growing from 15% in the June quarter to 55% in the first half of this fiscal year to
two-thirds in the March quarter to over 70% in the month of March, that gives us a lot of confidence that we're on the
right trail here.

Your next question is from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. You may begin.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Hi, Wendy.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: My question is on the gross margin, and the expansion slowed significantly I think on a
sequential basis. And you called out sort of the startup costs with the new production facilities. So is that all of the
plants coming online in the emerging markets, or is that also just innovation stuff that's launching in the U.S.? And if
it's the emerging market stuff, is that something that's going to be here to stay for the next couple of quarters? Or do we
think gross margin is going to reaccelerate with the better commodity backdrop? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Wendy. It is both of the things you mentioned. It's emerging markets, startup of
localized manufacturing in emerging markets. It is also the startup of manufacturing operations to support our
innovations in developed markets, for example the PODS startup in Europe. Both of those will be with us next quarter
and is one of the reasons that you see some of the trends that you do, but I don't expect this to be an ongoing dynamic.
This should be another quarter or two.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: One of the things we work hard on, Wendy, is ramping up our process reliability as
vertically as we can when we start up a new plant. And process reliability is in a sense the amount of throughput that
you get from a plant versus what you expect. And our process reliability as a company is now at the highest level it has
ever been, and that is what's leading – helping to lead to some of the productivity improvements you see in
manufacturing productivity because as we increase the throughput of every single plant, we then don't need to buy
additional capacity. In essence, that capacity comes with the productivity improvement. So we're going to continue to
work as we start up these new plants to get the process reliability curve as vertical as possible to minimize those
expenses.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Please begin.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Thanks, good morning, guys. Hey can you just talk about the sort of fourth quarter
guidance and all the reasons for that. Because when you think about it, you did 3% organic growth in the year-ago
quarter. You've announced a massive restructuring. You've reinvested all this money back in the business, but it seems

like organic growth is just going to be flat. So is it really just sort of category growth contraction?
And then what would happen if we really did have some commodity inflation, because I think you had like 260 basis
points of productivity savings in the quarter. I mean I think that kind of carries forward. So what's sort of the puts and
takes and how long is this negative mix impact going to last? And I know that was a long question, so I apologize.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Wow, I'm not quite sure how to cut through that. I'll try.
So first of all just let me step back on our guidance philosophy since your question started with guidance. Last quarter
we over-delivered our guidance. We increased guidance a little bit but invested a lot of the money back to ensure that
we continue to leverage the innovation pipeline we have and sequentially build market share.
Effectively this quarter we've done the same thing. We've over-delivered by a little bit. We've taken up the bottom line
– or the bottom end of the guidance range but are going to continue to invest to get the share where it needs to be going
forward.
As we invest to do that and drive higher profitability through our productivity, I'm confident that the returns will be
there, because each case we're growing is worth more. And I expect from a commodity standpoint, if anything, maybe a
little bit of – they're fairly benign. I don't expect a big impact going forward.
And so these productivity savings should begin to impact both gross margin and operating margin as they have in prior
quarters, particularly when we get beyond the startup of these new manufacturing facilities that Wendy was describing.
So I see accelerating top line based on continued market share progress kind of irrespective of market size. And the
productivity savings over time enabling us to both fuel that and drive earnings per share growth.

Your next question is from the line of Chris Ferrara from Bank of America. You may begin.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess I wanted to try to pull together some of the comments you
had made on your confidence in the market share recovery, the timing of the build-out of the innovation pipeline, right?
Because it just – it seems like there has been no shortage of new products for the second half of 2013, you had a couple
of things. You have the Q4 organic guidance implies only flattish market share at 3% to 4%. You're saying momentum
was building through the quarter, but the Q4 outlook is not even an acceleration from Q3 when you came in at the low
end of your organic range.
So I get that you're saying it's early days and some progress was made. But wouldn't you have expected that share
recovery to have kicked in a little bit more by now? And if so, why do think it has? And if not, why not?
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Obviously the market share is affected by many factors, Chris, some of which are
external. But I would say that all in all as we step back from it, we're on track with what we want to deliver in terms of
sequential improvement in market share, and we expect that to continue. We expect that to continue in the fourth
quarter, and we're looking forward to the next fiscal year.
The innovations, many of which we've talked about, are one country, one brand. And they're supported by a technology
platform that we will put across more countries and more brands. I mean we talked about PODS and we talked about
the entry of PODS into parts of Europe, into parts of Latin America, into parts of Africa. This is only now starting.
You're not – we're just now shipping those cases, taking those orders. You're not seeing the impact in the marketplace
at all yet. I think by the end of the quarter, you'll obviously see that impact. And just like this quarter, it will ramp up
through the quarter.
And as we said, March was a much stronger month than the beginning of the quarter. And that's why we grew share at
70%-plus of the U.S. business, grew and held share at 70%-plus.

Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi from UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yes, just quickly on all the innovation, I'm curious on how you guys are thinking about the SKU
complexity across the business, especially at a time where you're trying to also reduce the cost structure, if you can
provide any thoughts on that?
And then just a quick housekeeping, can you just talk a little bit about the Health Care business and what was driving
such strong growth? Was it just the flu season, or was there something else going on there? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Well in terms of innovation and SKU proliferation, our point of view is one where we
work with customers and create – retailers and create joint value creation. We have scorecards that we work with
customers. And part of that is working efficient assortment where we don't bring an innovation to retailers that we don't
think will command – attract a large number of consumers. And while we go in with that new innovation and expect or
try to sell a certain amount of shelf space, at the same time we help retailers pull out – eliminate some of the
innovations that other competitors or even we have launched that may not have worked. So we try to keep the SKU
proliferation under control.
I think I would point to our manufacturing productivity. Our manufacturing productivity and our work on inventory,
which is turning in great cash results, wouldn't be where it is if there was evidence that we were proliferating SKUs. At
the same time, I'd encourage you look at some of the new items that were launched by some of our competitors that
haven't done well. And we'll be working with retailers to try to get the shelf space back so the retailers can make money
off that shelf space.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: In terms of Health Care, there were really three drivers, Chris. One you rightly cite, which is
the strong cold/flu season. The second is the expansion of the Vicks lineup in Eastern Europe that we've talked about
before. And the third is a real strong quarter on the P&G-Teva business as we continue to drive the products of that
joint venture. So those are the three main drivers of our Health Care progress.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Did we mention ZzzQuil? I would also mention the launch of ZzzQuil, which is
multiples beyond our expectation and success. It's already the number one branded sleep aid. It has expanded the
category. ZzzQuil is off to a tremendous start, and I would recommend it for all of you who may suffer jetlag if you
travel internationally.

Your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. You may begin.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So I think like a lot of other people on the call, I'm struggling with the dichotomy
between the positive tone of your press release, the confidence you're clearly exuding on this call, all the very, very
enticing innovations that are out there, versus essentially I think disappointing top line results, at least from the investor
and analyst end. I think you're seeing that in the stock reaction probably.
So I've got a few things. One is how was your share gain related to the slowdown in the market growth? Two is if
everything is going to plan, why is it pretty impossible to get to the high end of your top line growth range for the year?
And then three is you say there's more to come, and I'm trying to understand. Are there other bigger things you're
expecting to happen, whether it be an incremental reinvestment that you need to make, whether it be an acceleration to
org chart changes or structure changes or incentive structure? What else can get us to feel better to tie into this
dichotomy between your confidence and, frankly, somewhat disappointment? I think everybody on this call so far
asked questions and certainly the market right now. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Our top line growth delivery was within our guidance range, Ali. And I think may be
part of the dislocation that you're perceiving between our confidence and your lack of confidence may be just in time

sequence. The innovations we're talking about, as I responded to Chris's question, are all future oriented and future
related, and you're looking at past results.
I think that we're going to continue to do what we're doing. We're going to continue to invest in innovation. We're
going to continue to bring out a large number of innovations. We're going to continue to fuel that with productivity
improvement and with investments in innovation. I'm really excited about the work that we've done around productivity
both in the manufacturing area, where we've offset the head count that we need to run 20 new factories, but also in the
area of non-manufacturing, where we're ahead of target. And the work that we've done already in the productivity area
with Jorge Uribe's team and his leadership is suggesting that we can get to the 2% to 4% reduction, which by the time
we get to 2016 could have us down 16% to 22% of enrollment. And I think that's terrific progress, and it gives us a lot
of confidence that we'll have the fuel to then spend behind innovation and get those sequential market share growth
goals that we talked about without regard to choppiness of the global economy.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer. You may begin.
<Q - Joseph Altobello>: Thanks, good morning, guys. I guess since you just mentioned choppiness again, Bob, I'll
start there. You guys have talked about that a lot this morning. We've heard that from other companies as well. Could
you give us a little more color or perhaps anecdotes in terms of what you're seeing from your customers, where they're
buying, what they're buying, how often they're buying, how that has changed in the quarter perhaps?
And then secondly, the market share trends obviously are improving, but I think your overall market shares are still
down year over year. So when would you guys expect to see those overall market share start to grow overall? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Let me deal with the year-over-year first. The year-over-year varies by category by
country. For example, year over year now in North America, we're obviously seeing growth because we've got
70%-plus of the business holding or growing share. So obviously, with the sequential improvement over time with
50%-plus now holding or growing share globally, we're going to expect to see year-over-year growth sequentially in
the coming quarters.
Relative to the choppiness of the economy, it's more of an evolution I think than a cathartic revolution. What we're
seeing is obviously retailers concerned about their levels of inventory and their cash investment. We see them worrying
about attracting traffic to their stores. But we don't see extraordinary levels of promotion like we may have in 2009 –
2010, but there are times where there are extraordinary levels of promotion. For example, when we launched Vidal
Sassoon and Pantene Expert and one of our competitors launched a new brand, the third competitor who did not have
very a strong innovation program this quarter put instantly redeemable coupons on all of their hair care offerings in
every store. So you do see choppiness in that regard to promotion spending when you don't have innovation, but the
rest I would see as evolutionary but an improvement in the way retailers are operating.
Another point that you see is the move to online or e-commerce. We've been working hard to understand what our
market share is in e-commerce. We've been putting a lot of resources against it. I'd just give you the U.S. as an
example. If you take our U.S. market share, our e-commerce digital market share both through bricks-and-mortar and
true digital players is 20 points higher than it is through regular retail, and this is a fast-growing channel. So that may
lead to also some of the choppiness that you may see because most of that sale is not transparent to the marketplace.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: If we're going to continue to operate in an environment that is a little bit choppy, I think we're
extraordinarily well positioned from the standpoint of both the productivity program and the innovation program,
which are the antidotes to this kind of market environment.

<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning, another question on market share. If U.S. shares are growing in 65% to
70% of your businesses and your shares are growing in 70% – 75% of businesses in China but your worldwide shares
are growing 50% worldwide, in which international markets are you losing share, and why and when would you expect
to turn?
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: So, Connie, first about we said that holding and growing share, not just growing, and
that's a significant difference. Places where we're losing market share, frankly, we've talked about the work we're doing
on Skin Care globally and trying to improve our Beauty business. That's a major focus for us. Russia Laundry, we were
losing some share, and we've put a plan in place to regain share. So we have pockets like that around the world, but
believe me. We are all focused on turning those shares around and doing it through innovation.

Your next question is from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. You may begin.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. I would like to come back to Beauty and the choppiness and, again,
the marketing spending and the innovation that you're talking about. If you step back, you did major launches in the
U.S. in Olay, in Hair Care, in makeup with CoverGirl, and yet we don't see any traction from it. So I understand that
L'Oreal did a competitive launch, but under the same choppiness they grew 5.5% in the quarter and your GBUs
contracted, minus 1%. So what I'm hearing is doing the same thing, spending more and doing the same innovation and
blaming competitive activity in terms of the lack of traction. But shouldn't you be thinking about doing things
differently so that there is more effectiveness in the A&P spending and on the innovation? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Javier, we understandably see it a little bit differently than you do. We launched these
items recently. They're making sequential progress. We've talked about Vidal Sassoon already approaching a 2% value
share, which is double our prelaunch estimates at this point in time. These things are making progress period to period.
Pantene Expert, for example, has a higher repurchase rate than a competitor's new brand. So we're seeing progress
period to period, and we think that will be reflected in the market share results and the top line growth sequentially, as
we've said.

And your next question is from the line of Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: Thanks, good morning. I'm not going to use the word complexity because I think it has been
overused a little bit. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out when you're looking at all the innovation that you're
bringing out and the top line growth that's coming through, can you talk about some of what I would consider the
non-core businesses in the portfolio? Obviously, we know the 40/20/10 the areas that you're focusing on and where
you're Playing to Win, but it just seems like there is some volatility with some of these non-core businesses that you
guys I think are not considering disposing at times. So I'm just wondering when you see the results that are coming
through and the great innovation that you're getting in some of what I would consider the more core businesses, does
that change your outlook in terms of keeping other brands in the portfolio. Or I think one of the last questions was on
the SKU complexity, eliminating that so you can put up healthier numbers and seeing the results of better innovations
in some of the core brands. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Jason, as you know, we have quite a robust process for weeding and feeding our
portfolio, and we have divested businesses in the past. We are happy with our portfolio that we have today. And any
item in our portfolio, there is an expectation that we innovate. Jon went through the innovation, for example, that we
have in Pet Care coming to market, Good for You and the new Woof item. We have innovation Duracell, another
category that you've asked us about in the past in Duralock with a 10-year guarantee on Powermat. So we expect to
innovate in every one of our businesses. There may be a different cycle of innovation and need for that. But we expect

Your next question is from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. You may begin.
<Q - William B. Chappell, Jr.>: Good morning. I just wanted to dig back into the PODS in the U.S. And certainly
$0.5 billion in sales and improving market share is great. But just can you give us some color of after being out in the
market for year, is a 6% household penetration where you expected, better, worse? Can you get to 10% in the near
term? And do you need to have Gain PODS or something else to really jumpstart the category even further? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Thank you, Bill. With a technology like Tide PODS, we usually start with the leading
brand, and then we expand that technology across countries and across brands. What we've seen with PODS is that it's
a preferred form of laundry detergent. And people who move from a powder to a liquid historically now move from a
liquid to a pod, and they typically don't go backwards. Once you start using a pod, you don't go back to a liquid. Once
you've moved to a liquid, you don't go back to a powder. And that just is the generational shift in the laundry category.
I think one of the things that has been interesting about PODS is it has attracted users. Even though it has a higher cost
per load, it has attracted users across the entire spectrum of income. So there are many, many people who are forced to
overdose their laundry detergent today because they aren't getting satisfactory cleaning and they buy a low-priced
brand. That brand doesn't work. It has a low level of actives, has a lot of water, and so they overdose.
And they move to this form which cleans better, and they find it more economical, even though it has a higher cost per
use. The reason the cost per use is higher is you're not paying for water. You're paying for active ingredients. So I think
it surprised us a little bit to see where the source of volume has come from.
If you look at the track of what percent of the business this has become, we said that we think we will get to 30%
eventually because of what we've seen in dishwashing over time, in automatic dishwashing, and we have no data to
refute that. It's going to be an evolution over time. But as we expand the form around the world, you'll see a higher
proportion of our laundry business go into PODS, and eventually I think we'll get near the 30% number that
dishwashing has.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: And don't forget that we were constrained in terms of supply until just recently. So we'll be
increasing the levels of marketing, of in-store support. So to your point of driving higher household penetration, that's
still ahead of us.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus. You may begin.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yes thanks and morning, everybody. So I wanted to go back to the underperformance in
Beauty and sort of try to think about it a little bit differently. What do you think has led to some of the
underperformance? And when do you think the innovation-based strategy potentially needs to shift, or how do you sort
of evaluate the efficacy of what you're doing?
And then sort of related to that, how do you think about supplementing the internal innovation with acquisitions
externally? And then sort of related to that, how do you think, Jon, about the optimal leverage structure on an overall
basis for the business? And does the cost savings program limit the acquisition appetite overall?
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Well we've been working to strengthen the organization and strengthen the business now
for some time. We're starting to see progress, as we reported in this quarter. We've launched a number of new
innovations. And the innovation program looks even stronger in the future. We have more what we call bigger change
innovations coming in the future, and we're excited about that.

So I expect, as I've said, I expect the performance of the Beauty organization to improve quarter to quarter and
sequentially. And we're going to continue to invest in it both in terms of innovation and in terms of – and marketing.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: And we've said before that we're interested – we continue to be interested in fill-in acquisitions.
That would be true in Beauty as well. I don't think there's anything that holds us back from that at this point except
asset availability and asset attractiveness. But that's something we'll continue to look at. There's really no constraint
within either our leverage targets or our earnings projections to the activity, should something attractive present itself.

Your next question is from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research. You may begin.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Hi, good morning. I have a housekeeping question and then my real question. My first is
could you just tell us what your category growth rate was by region, emerging markets, U.S., and Europe?
And then my real question is on Tide in the U.S. I know it's not suffering the price reversal in powders that some of
your others are. Could you tell us how much Tide as a brand overall was up or down in the quarter if you include
powders, liquids, and PODS together? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Let me take the first one, Alice. In terms of the market growth rates, developed markets in our
categories grew about 1 point. Developing markets were up about 7 points, leaving us with a global total of about 3.5
points, which compares to 4 points in the prior quarter. Within that, you asked about the U.S. The U.S. was up about
2.5 points, with Europe down and Japan essentially flat.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: And Tide?
<A - John Chevalier>: Hi, Alice, John Chevalier. Tide was down in the quarter from a shipment standpoint. But recall
that this is the quarter that we're comping the PODS launch. So the underlying trends, again from a market share
standpoint are very strong. Shipments are down year over year only because of the pipeline fill.

Your next question is from the line of Joe Lachky from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Lachky>: Thank you. I was wondering if you could outline your opportunities and efforts you're
making on working capital, specifically inventory. I think you mentioned that briefly, but also payables and
receivables. And remind me if you've quantified how much opportunity you see there. And how you plan to use that
cash to either reinvest in your business or potentially return additional cash to shareholders.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So we're actively working on inventory days on hand. And our goal is to be able to reduce
working capital by sufficient levels to be able to offset the increase in capital spending behind the developing market
expansion, such that we continue to deliver 90% free cash flow productivity, which gives us ample cash to return to
shareholders.
And that's exactly what we're doing now. We're on target in terms of a pretty significant reduction in inventory days on
hand this year. We're targeting again the same next year. And I'll let Teri briefly talk about what we're doing on
payables.
<A - Teri L. List-Stoll>: Yeah so there has been some press recently about a new program that we've introduced with
suppliers called Supply Chain Finance, where we're partnering with some of our world-class banking partners to be
able to present what we think is a win-win solution to suppliers.
As part of that, we'll be extending our payment terms, which obviously frees up cash for us. So we're offering lower
cash financing and actually earlier access to cash to our suppliers as part of that program. So that's something that we

think over time – and we're implementing it over time, so it's not disruptive to suppliers. That will free up a tremendous
amount of cash starting next year and then over the next two to three years.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Steib from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. You made several references towards investing behind marketing spending.
Could you be a bit more specific please? What does that mean? Does that mean that ad spend, for example, is up
sequentially in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Yes.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Okay.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: It also means we're investing in things like sampling, door-to-door sampling, selling,
things that will generate trial and awareness of the new innovations.

And your next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser from B. Riley Caris & Company. You may begin.
<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi. My question is on cash flow. You had 20% year-over-year growth in operating cash
flow in the first half of the fiscal year, and it was only up slightly in the third quarter. So is your working capital
performance actually deteriorating a little bit? Or is there some other strange comparisons that happened in the quarter?
And also it looked like in the quarter you paid down – reduced debt by about $800 million or so. Is there any reason
why you can't just maintain the debt that you added to the balance sheet in the first half and use – instead of paying
down debt in the second half just do more share repurchase? Would that put you over – would that not allow you to
maintain your credit ratings as you would like? Or what's the reason that you can't just maintain that little bit additional
leverage and repurchase shares? Because other companies have levered up a little bit here and are repurchasing more
stock. So can you just kind of explain that? Thanks a lot.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Sure. Well stepping way back again, 10 years, $98 billion of cash returned to shareholders.
That's clearly a focus area. Generated $3 billion of cash in the quarter, so a strong quarter of cash flow. The IR team
can take you through the line item comparatives versus the base period.
We have been using that increase in cash flow to increase our share repurchase. You may recall when we first started
talking about share repurchase for the year, it was $4 billion to $6 billion. We increased that range based on cash
over-delivery to $5 billion to $6 billion. This quarter we increased the range again to $6 billion based on cash
over-delivery, so we're very much focused on that objective.
<A - Robert A. McDonald>: And we increased the dividend 7% at the same time, as you know.

And your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA. You may begin.
<Q - Caroline Shan Levy>: Good morning. I'm just wondering if you look at your base businesses if maybe where a
lot of the problems are arising you launch new products in Hair Care but the base Pantene must be where the weakness
is. I'm assuming similar with liquid Tide and the Olay products. So is there something – with all the innovation that you
talk about and do, is there some way one can address the base business to make sure that there isn't that kind of

erosion? So that's my first question.
And I was also wondering if you could just talk about your diaper share in the top few markets there. I'm not sure I
caught what trends are like in diapers anywhere in your big markets.
Robert A. McDonald
Caroline, we're very focused on growing the base business. Without growing the base business, there is no growth. And
I think evidence of that is the fact that we're holding or growing share in 70% of the U.S. business in the month of
March. The innovations are helping, but you couldn't do that without growing the base business. And so we evaluate
people on growing the base business. It's important to us and we know we can't grow without growing the base
business. And that's particularly true in developed markets like the United States, but it's also true in developing
markets. So we're focused on that and that's why market share is such an important measure for us. Diapers?
