MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Q3 2013 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine and I will be your operator
for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President Investor Relations and Communications. You may
begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Christine. Thanks to all of our participants and a big welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me
today in the room are Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Fox, our EVP of
Exploration and Production.
We'll make our prepared remarks – begin our prepared remarks in a moment, but I wanted to make sure that all of you
saw the announcement this morning that we completed the sale of our Kashagan business for about $5.4 billion. Just a
quick mechanical point, we sent the earnings release and the Kashagan releases separately. That was because we had to
queue up the earnings release last night and we weren't entirely certain about the timing of the Kashagan close, so
apologies here for a little bit of possible confusion. But this is obviously a huge milestone for the business and wanted
to get the news out to the marketplace this morning.

Also wanted to make sure that all of you saw in our release this morning that we expect to announce our 2014 capital
and production budget in early December and that in 2014 we'll be hosting our Analyst Meeting on the April 10, in
New York. Obviously, details to follow.
If you'll turn to page two, you'll note our Safe Harbor statement and that describes the risks and uncertainties in our
future performance. These are also described in our periodic filings with the SEC.
With those details out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Ellen. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I'm going to jump right into the material beginning on slide three. This slide shows some of the key highlights for the
quarter. Once again, the theme of today's call is pretty simple; we're successfully executing on our business plan.
Operationally, we delivered our expected volumes. We produced 1.514 million BOE per day, which is in line with
guidance despite the curtailment of Libyan production for most of the quarter. From continuing operations, we
produced 1.47 million BOE per day. Without the disruption in Libya, we would've exceeded the high end of our
production guidance. As we've stated for quite some time, we expected this quarter to be the low point on volumes and
we are positioned to grow from here.
The third quarter was an active period for seasonal planned maintenance. We executed these key turnarounds on
schedule and most of that work is complete for the year. Our major growth projects are progressing. Christina Lake
Phase E and Ekofisk South are now producing and others are nearing first oil. We have several near-term milestones
that Matt will discuss in a minute, so operationally, we executed our plan.
Moving to the financial results, reported earnings were $2.5 billion or $2 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings were $1.8
billion or $1.47 per share. This is a 7% increase year-over-year. We were also up 4% sequentially despite this being the
low point for volumes. And excluding working capital, we generated $3.8 billion in cash from continuing operations
and we ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash. Cash margins grew 13% compared to last year's third quarter,
reflecting the impact of higher prices, production mix and location. Normalized for changes in prices, cash margins
grew 3% year-over-year. This was an important part of growing cash flows to internally fund our investment programs
and dividends over time.
In the quarter, we continued to prune our portfolio and closed on two non-strategic asset sales, our Clyden undeveloped
oil sands leasehold in Canada, and our interest in the Phoenix Park midstream asset in Trinidad and Tobago. And as
Ellen mentioned at the start of the call, importantly, we achieved a big milestone earlier today with the closing and the
receipt of funds for the $5.4 billion Kashagan transaction. And we continue to make progress on closing our other
announced asset sales. We're continuing to add to and test our conventional and unconventional exploration inventory
globally, and these programs are running at a high level of activity. Finally, we are committed to returning capital to
our shareholders. In early July, we increased our dividend by 4.5%, and we remain committed to increasing the
dividend over time.
In summary, we delivered on our plan for the quarter. We achieved the operational performance we expected and
generated strong financial results. We're positioned for an exciting phase of growth and margin expansion, which is the
essence of our strategic plan. So please turn to slide four and we'll cover the financial review for the quarter.
Again, this quarter's adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion or $1.47 per share, and this was slightly above consensus. The
7% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings was primarily driven by higher margins. The higher margins reflect
strong liquids pricing in the quarter and a continued shift to higher-value liquids in the portfolio. Average realizations
were up 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Production from continuing operations was in line with expectations,
but down sequentially and flat compared to the third quarter of 2012, largely reflecting the curtailments in Libya.

We've shown a table of segment earnings for the quarter in the lower right corner of the slide. Our usual segment charts
can be found in the appendix of this deck and I don't plan to review these on the call, but wanted to make a few key
points here. Alaska income was down sequentially due to planned maintenance, but in line with our expectations.
Lower 48 adjusted earnings were up sequentially, reflecting strong liquids prices and the mix shift. Canada generated
significantly higher adjusted earnings sequentially as well. Although natural gas prices were weaker than last quarter,
bitumen prices were particularly strong, reflecting higher WTI prices, favorable diluent prices, lower crude
differentials, and lower seasonal blending requirements, sort of a perfect set of conditions for the oil sands. At this
point, we would not expect fourth quarter realizations for bitumen to be as strong.
Europe and the Asia Pacific and Middle East segments were also in line with expectations. Our corporate segment
adjusted losses were about $40 million higher than in the second quarter of 2013, due to the absence of licensing
revenues in the third quarter. This is about the same level we would expect for the fourth quarter as well, so there's no
change to our full-year guidance of $750 million for this segment.
Next I'll step through our production performance for the quarter on slide five. Total company production in the second
quarter was 1.514 million BOE per day, and this includes 44,000 BOE per day from discontinued operations. This chart
shows continuing operations compared to the third quarter of 2012 and in the third quarter 2012 production from
continuing operations was 1.47 million BOE per day. Adjusting for dispositions of 12,000 BOE per day, normalized
production from continuing operations was 1.548 million BOE per day in last year's third quarter and that's the middle
blue bar on the chart, and I'll talk about growth from there.
The Libya downtime accounted for a 28,000 barrels per day reduction compared to last year's third quarter, but that was
partially offset by lower downtime in the rest of our operations of around 11,000 per day in this year's third quarter.
The key is the next two bars. You can see that growth of 215,000 barrels per day more than offset declines of 186,000
barrels per day. This represents net organic growth of 29,000 per day or about 2%, adjusted for dispositions and
downtime. The majority of the growth came from our development projects in the Lower 48 shale plays, growth in our
oil sands assets and from China. And as I mentioned before, this should be the low point on continuing operations
volume that we've been predicting for a while, and we are now positioned for an upward trend.
If you'll turn to slide six, I'll make a few comments about the improving margin trend we also have underway. This
slide shows how our third quarter growth and changing mix drove cash margin improvement compared to last year's
third quarter. The tornado chart shows the change in this quarter's volumes by region and product compared to last
year's third quarter. The growth shown in green is all from liquids. In addition, it's coming in areas with more favorable
fiscal terms in the company average, notably the Lower 48, Canada, and the Asia Pacific and Middle East segments.
Normal field declines in Alaska and Europe and lower North American natural gas production somewhat offset the
growth.
Slide seven shows the impact of our growth mix shift in fiscals on our margin performance. This slide shows sequential
and year-over-year cash margins, both on a reported basis and a price-normalized basis. Compared to last year's third
quarter, cash margins grew 13%. Sequentially, cash margins grew 6% and realized prices improved compared to both
periods, but that's not the whole story. On the right side of the page, using our published sensitivities, we priced
normalized margins with last year's third quarter as the base line. As you can see, cash margins improved 3% on a
price-normalized basis compared to last year. This metric will tend to be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we
expect the trend to continue to improve as we shift production towards higher-value products in places with more
favorable fiscal terms, and we'll continue to track and report this metric.
I'll wrap up my comments with our cash flow waterfall and quarter-end financial position on slide eight. I'm going to
talk you through our cash flow, and this does not include the proceeds from Kashagan, which we announced this
morning and which will be a fourth quarter item. Through the third quarter of 2013, we've generated $11.8 billion of
cash from continuing operations and our working capital was about a $100 million source of cash. Through the end of
September, we've generated $3.2 billion in asset sales proceeds from the sale of the Cedar Creek Anticline assets, the
Clyden assets, Phoenix Park and some smaller asset packages. If you include Kashagan in, this increases to $8.6
billion. So far this year, we've funded an $11.9 billion capital program for continuing operations and paid out $2.5

billion in dividends. Debt & Other, which includes the capital associated with discontinued operations, accounts for a
$1.2 billion use of cash in 2013, so we had $3.9 billion of cash on hand as of September 30, essentially flat to where we
started the year.
Our balance sheet and financial situation are very strong and just got stronger today with the closing and receipt of the
proceeds from the Kashagan disposition. We're in a great position to execute our investment programs and deliver
value through a combination of organic growth, improving margins, and a compelling dividend.
That concludes the review of the financial overview, and now I'm going to turn the call over to Matt for an update on
our operations, which begins on slide nine.
Matthew J. Fox
Thank you, Jeff. As Jeff mentioned, the main theme of this quarter's operational performance is: we're on plan. In fact,
that's been the theme for the past several quarters. I'm going to cover the operations material by our capital categories.
As a reminder, those are our high-quality base assets, our lower-risk development drilling programs, our major projects,
and our exploration program. So I'll begin with a quick review of our base asset performance.
Most importantly, this quarter's major turnaround and tie-in activity went according to plan, and this essentially
completes the majority of our major turnaround activity for this year. I'll run through a few of these key activities
quickly. Alaska experienced high seasonal turnaround activity at Kuparuk and Prudhoe. In the Lower 48, we had
planned downtime at the Lost Cabin Gas Plant. In the UK, the Britannia area and Southern North Sea turnarounds were
completed, and planned maintenance was also recently completed at the Foster Creek in the oil sands.
The shutdown activity that began at Norway's Greater Ekofisk complex in June was completed early in the third quarter
and included the brownfield work necessary for the new Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects. As the chart on the
lower left shows, most of our planned turnaround activity is complete for the year. Fourth quarter turnarounds are
nearing completion at Clair and Qatargas 3.
The restart of our assets after the recent turnarounds should deliver strong volume momentum in the fourth quarter. So
will the expected production startup in the East Irish Sea following about a year long shutdown there to replace the
asset gas plant. So as you can see, our base assets performed well.
Now let's move to our development programs on slide 10. These development programs consist of lower risk,
drilling-led activities around the world that mitigate our base decline and generate higher margins and attractive
returns. And these programs remain on track to deliver about 600,000 BOE per day of production by 2017 as shown on
the top left graphic. In the Kuparuk field in Alaska our coiled tubing drilling sidetracks continued in the third quarter.
Since changes were made to Alaska's fiscals with the More Alaska Production Act, we added a rig in Kuparuk at the
end of May. We're planning to add another rig for development drilling at Kuparuk in January and we continue to work
with partners in Prudhoe to identify additional opportunities to increase activity there. A big milestone for the quarter
was reaching 500,000 BOE per day in the Lower 48. Of course this is largely due to performance from the
unconventionals in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, but continuing good performance in the Permian conventional
program.
A couple of highlights from these plays. Bakken production averaged 334,000 BOE per day in the year's third quarter,
up 31% compared to the same quarter last year and up 13% sequentially. Our focus during the third quarter was in
reducing the time from drilling a well to bringing it on production. This continues to be our focus and will become even
more important as we shift to pad drilling. At the end of the third quarter, we had 11 operated rigs running in the
Bakken, 9 of which were pad drilling.
The Eagle Ford also continued to deliver strong performance. Third quarter production averaged 126,000 BOE per day,
up 66% compared with the third quarter of last year. Sequentially, the Eagle Ford grew 4%, a bit lower than the first
half of 2013's growth rate, because this quarter was impacted by the commissioning of further stages of the Helena and

Sugarloaf stabilization facilities and maintenance of third-party facilities to increase meter sizes, resulting in a slight
increase in downtime versus the second quarter.
At the end of the third quarter we had a backlog of 77 wells waiting in facilities on various stages of completion. This
represents a 38% reduction in inventory compared to year-end 2012, so we're gaining on the backlog. The Eagle Ford
exited the third quarter over 130,000 BOE a day and for the fourth quarter we will continue to run 11 rigs in the play
and expect to bring on between 50 and 60 operated wells.
As we head into 2014, we're in a full transition to multi-well pad drilling on more than 1,800 remaining identified well
locations assuming an 80-acre well spacing. Right now 6 out of 11 rigs running in the Eagle Ford are pad drilling. And
we expect to see more variability in our quarterly production levels as we move to pad drilling where we anticipate
continued growth in this asset next year.
In Western Canada, we continue to see good results from margin enhancing drilling programs in the liquid rich plays.
Here our development drilling activity continues to focus on the Glauconite, Montney, Lower Cretaceous and Triassic
plays. Activity levels are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter as we prepare for and execute our winter drilling
program. Finally, our legacy field development programs are also on track through all of our operating areas.
Now let's discuss our major projects on slide 11 where we're approaching some very important milestones. Our projects
are very high levels of activity and remain on track to deliver about 400,000 BOE per day of production by 2017 as
shown on the top left graph. Virtually all business segments are contributing to our growth for major projects. In
Alaska, a CD5 project, construction is progressing on schedule and preparations are underway for the winter
construction season when the ice roads are in place. We continue to pursue engineering work and additional satellite
projects for sanctioning in 2014. For example, work is underway at Shark Tooth and Greater Moose's Tooth 1. We'll
make a decision on these projects late next year.
You also probably saw our recent announcement about the site selection for a possible Alaskan LNG project, which we
now refer to as AKLNG. Along with our co-venturers we're performing studies now to determine the feasibility of that
project. Our oil sands projects are performing as planned. The combined oil sands project averaged 107,000 BOE per
day during the quarter, up 16% year-over-year.
Christina Lake Phase E started up in mid-July and this should add about 20,000 BOE net over the next several months.
At our operated Surmont 2 project we remain on plan for first steam in the first half of 2015. You may have seen the
announcement that we achieved first oil at Ekofisk South last week, a couple of months ahead of schedule. This is an
exciting milestone for the company and over the next few years we'll ramp up volumes as we drill 35 producing wells
and 8 injection wells. And by early 2015, we'll also start first production at Eldfisk II. So we're positioning ourselves to
achieve significant growth in Norway and extend fuel life for decades to come.
At Jasmine in the UK, we're in the final stages of our commissioning of startup preparations before initiating first oil.
Offshore hook-up is progressing as planned and four wells have been perforated and are ready for first production.
Jasmine should start up later in this quarter, which would provide good exit rate momentum going into 2014.
At Curtis Island, we continue to progress our APLNG project. Train 1 is still on schedule for first LNG by mid-2015
and critical milestones have been achieved on the project. We've got a lot going on in Malaysia. We're close to
achieving major project startups in two non-operated projects Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai. At Gumusut offshore
commissioning continues. The tenth and final riser was installed in early September and flow-line installations are
complete.
The operator estimates that full fuel startup will be in early 1Q 2014. The Siakap North-Petai development is
continuing hook-up and pre-commissioning. Umbilical installations are complete and flow-line installation is
underway. And the operator estimates the startup will occur right at the end of this year.
Elsewhere in Malaysia the Kebabangan development is also progressing. Topside fabrication is running ahead of
schedule and drilling commenced in August. The overall project remains on track for first production in the fourth
quarter of 2014. So you can tell we're at a very exciting yet critical time in many of our major projects and they will be

a key driver in our volume growth over the next few years.
So now I want to briefly recover our exploration program on slide 12. Our exploration efforts continue on several
fronts. We're building an inventory of both conventional and unconventional opportunities, we're drilling several
non-operated prospects currently and we're advancing our operated prospects to the drill-ready stage. We currently
have three conventional prospects drilling in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico program. We have an interest in the Gila
and Deep Nansen wildcat prospects. In addition, we have an interest in a Tiber appraisal well. So we are participating
in some big, important Lower Tertiary wells. We're also currently progressing our plans for our operated drilling
program in the Gulf for 2014.
In the Browse Basin of Australia we drilled the Proteus-1 discovery during the recent quarter. This was an untested
structure to the southeast of the Poseidon discovery. In Indonesia, we obtained government approval for the
Palangkaraya farm-in agreement, onshore Kalimantan. This clears the way to begin drilling next year. In Malaysia, we
completed our seismic activity in block SB 311. In the Kwanza basin in Angola, we completed our 3D seismic program
earlier in the year. We've identified and ranked several prospects and expect to be drilling there by mid-next year.
And we're just as busy in several unconventional plays, especially in North America. In the Permian Basin we're testing
prospective zones across our leasehold in the Delaware and Midland Basins. In the Niobrara, we currently have one rig
in the field executing an appraisal program. It's too early to discuss results in the Permian or the Niobrara, but we're
encouraged by our preliminary results. In Canada, we continue to drill and appraise the Duvernay and Montney plays
and we're also gearing up for a second season of winter drilling in the Mackenzie Valley Canol Play.
So that was a pretty quick overview of our operations and exploration activity and the key takeaways are these; the
operations are running well, the development programs are delivering, startup of several growth projects are underway
or imminent, and we've got high level of exploration activity.
If you turn to slide 13, I'll quickly cover how this all adds up to our production outlook for this year. The table on the
bottom of the slide provides actual volumes for the first three quarters of the year and our expected range for the fourth
quarter. The data is provided for both continuing and discontinued operations. Our overall volume guidance for the
year is unchanged except in the fourth quarter, we're now removing 50,000 BOE from Libya, as result of the ongoing
disruptions there. What's important to note is that the fourth quarter volumes are expected to ramp up from the third
quarter due to lower turnaround activity, ramp up in our unconventional programs and the major project startups. The
range in fourth quarter volumes reflects typical variability in major projects startup timing. We'll announce our 2014
production target with our capital release in December. In the meantime, we're positioned to deliver a strong exit rate in
2013, and that'll provide strong momentum towards achieving our organic growth goals next year.
Now please turn to slide 14 for our summary comments. Operationally, we've arrived at a very important inflection
point for the company. We have several key milestones to achieve this quarter, and we should have volume growth
momentum coming out of 2013. So in 2014, you should expect to see increased production from our major projects at
Ekofisk South, Jasmine, Britannia long-term compression, Gumusut, Siakap North-Petai, Kebabangan, Christina Lake
Phase E, Foster Creek Phase F, and our Lower 48 unconventional programs at Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. All
these projects help contribute to our 3% to 5% production growth as we detailed at our Analyst Meeting earlier in the
year. And as always, we expect to deliver our operational performance safely and efficiently.
We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that can provide financial flexibility. We're seeing the early
stages of cash margin expansion. We should improve as our volumes grow. We're focused on improving returns, and
that's the driver behind continuing to rebalance our portfolio and allocate capital prudently. We're delivering on our
value proposition. We continue to progress our announced asset divestures, and this will provide the financial
flexibilities to fund our investment programs and our dividend, which remains a top priority. So I hope Jeff and I have
given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones this year and positioning ConocoPhillips
for an exciting 2014.
And now we're pleased to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from
Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey. Good afternoon and congrats on the delivery so far this year against your plan. I guess in
the slides, Jeff, you've outlined $6 billion of incremental cash flow from the production growth between, sort of, 2013
and 2017 in a flat macro tape, which is going to obviously increase your financial flexibility at the top line. But I've got
a question on CapEx. You're still investing in SAGD and you're still investing in some LNG. Is there a year, as you
look out in the, sort of the CapEx profile where, as you sort of finalize some of those longer-lived assets, you get a bit
more flexibility in terms of how you could allocate, sort of, CapEx in the upstream business?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes, that certainly going to be the case, Ed. And really, we'll detail this more in December like
we indicated on our – earlier in the call, as far as what 2014 capital will be. But the effect you're pointing out is
probably going to be fairly pronounced in 2014, where APLNG capital will hit a peak, Surmont 2 capital will hit a
peak, and we'll be continuing to fund the expansions in the oil sands at Foster Creek and Christina Lake. And as you go
through time, we'll see some of those projects tail off, and which will give us more flexibility to handle increased levels
of spend in the unconventionals.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Great. And then in terms of, obviously the longer we go through time, and with Kashagan
receipts in and the balance sheet looking a little bit more robust, and clearly the oil price hasn't collapsed in any way, I
mean, what are your thoughts about maybe reinstituting a buyback program?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right. So at the end of this year, assuming we continue to progress the rest of our asset sales
program, we're going to have significant cash balances at the end of the year. We could be approaching nearly $10
billion – in that neighborhood of $10 billion of cash on our balance sheet. As we think through 2014 and 2015, we're
going to be increasing our cash flow, but still at the point where cash from operations is not going to completely cover
capital and dividends. In terms of a buyback, I think that's something we're going to be thinking more about as we get
to the point where cash from operations funds capital and dividends on a go-forward basis. Near-term I think we feel
like it's important to maintain a significant level of financial flexibility to adequately invest in our capital program and
fund our dividend.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, Jeff.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thanks, Ed.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Congratulations on your result, everybody.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thanks, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: U.S. production growth has obviously been a major success story for the company and I
think output was higher by another 40% this quarter from Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. Yet it seems like the
potential from the Eagle Ford continues to improve as more is known about the company's position. So, my first
question is, whether Matt would agree and second whether there's any additional color on the position in Eagle Ford as
it relates to activity, efficiency or financial performance that is stronger versus the original expectations? Meaning,
what's really changed here because it seems like you're much more enthusiastic on this position.

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, Doug, we are still very excited and I would say getting more excited about our Eagle
Ford position. We continue to run a consistent program there for now. We're running 11 rigs. Our intention is
essentially to continue that and we'll continue to see production growth because of that. What we've indicated is that
we've got remaining about 1,800 well locations in the Eagle Ford to drill and that's all based on the assumption that we
continue to drill the 80-acre spacing and we have pilot tests underway to determine if that's the right spacing. That may
ultimately tighten up and there'll be more drilling locations. We're also looking at other levels in the Eagle Ford for
potential too. So we're still very excited about the Eagle Ford position and we're going to see significant growth and
very high-margin growth from the Eagle Ford for several years to come.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Thanks, Matt. And second, in Alaska it appears that passage of SB 21 will impact activity in
the state and but because you guys are the largest producer and acreage holder, it seems that you'll be a leading
beneficiary. But at the same time, your portfolio of high-return opportunities is as strong as it's been in several years.
So the question's twofold. First, how meaningful are the legislative changes as it relates to your desire to invest in the
state when you consider the opportunity set that you have elsewhere? And then second, with ANS trading
inexpensively to global markers in recent periods, my question is whether the strategy for sales to new markets is
changing, or put another way, how is the company thinking about optimizing realizations on future output from
Alaska?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so the first part, the SB 21, that's now called the More Alaska Production Act.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That was a significant change and as a result of that we will spend more capital in Alaska.
There are opportunities for investment there now that with the change to the fiscal regime are competitive in our
international portfolio. So we will be doing that and we've announced a few those and I mentioned a few on the call. So
we definitely see potential there and you're right, we're very well positioned in Alaska as the largest producer there just
now. On the ANS sales, so we do have the flexibility if we want to exercise it to take ANS cargos to Asia. We do have
the right to do that. And that will depend on the differential that we're seeing to Asian prices versus West Coast prices
obviously, but it's good to have that flexibility and then as time evolves, we'll see if that's the flexibility we need to
exercise.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great. Thanks a lot everybody.

Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi. Good afternoon everyone. I don't want to spoil the Analyst Meeting party too much, but if I
could just clarify that the page 13 volume guidance for the full-year 2013 and Q4 is consistent, I obviously assume it is,
with the slide nine outlook that you have there on the high-quality legacy base production. I'm basically trying to get to
a 2014/2015 volume number for you guys.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, as we had indicated at the beginning of the year, Paul, that we would be intending to
exit the year essentially at the same level as we come into the year. So that growth that you see on slide nine and the
exit that we're moving towards in the fourth quarter here they're both consistent. Now there's the complication of
exactly what's going to happen in Libya. I mean, that's 50,000 barrels a day of production that's not going anywhere,
and we're still going to be there to produce, but it's really uncertain as to how that will play out over the next several
months. But yeah, they're both – they're internally consistent, yeah.

<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: I would have thought that Libya, thinking about the slide nine chart, was assumed to be flat. I
mean, it was neither declining nor growing, I guess.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, there was slight growth actually coming in Libya, as we increased our ability to process
and sell gas there. In the overall scheme of things it was between 50,000 and 60,000 barrels a day. And that, of course,
is in the base on slide nine; that's the grey base on the graphic in the top left-hand side of slide nine.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, I guess, again, I don't want to spoil the party too much for the Analyst Meeting, but I
guess what I'm trying to push towards is that this slide nine outlook is broadly unchanged even allowing for Libya, and
can be considered to be your outlook for volumes, basically.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah -
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Just to be precise, Paul, the slide nine outlook has Libya included in it.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: As Matt said, Libya is just really hard to predict...
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Right, and anyway, you're basically outperforming your expectations, given that you've kept
the same number but you've lost Libya basically, right?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, we've lowered our fourth quarter numbers to reflect the assumption that Libya will just be
off in the fourth quarter, but we've not changed our go-forward 2013 and beyond numbers, and those all still include
Libya.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, I've got you. Just, without wanting to be too pedantic, on page 13 where the Libya
numbers are just completely excluded from 4Q because I'm thinking, continuing or discontinued, it's not in either of
those, right?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: For the fourth quarter, that's right. So we show them on that slide, we show them as a light
blue color at the top, just to give perspective or scale.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: But we're assuming in the guidance that we're giving now for the fourth quarter that Libya
won't come back. It may come back in the fourth quarter, but we're assuming for this guidance that it doesn't.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: No, I understand. Yeah, I do. And then again, without, again, front-running the Analyst
Meeting too much, your previous guidance on CapEx going forward, I think, was about $15.5 billion to $16 billion a
year. Is that correct?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I think what we've been saying is around $16 billion, is basically the guidance we gave at
Analyst Day.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: The last sort of forward guidance you gave, okay, to work on this is annual around $16 billion.
I've got you.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And then I guess just a follow-up would be simply the old question, further to Doug's which is,
why don't you accelerate in the Eagle Ford? Thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, I mean, the flexibility exists to do that in Eagle Ford. We're focused on a few different
things here to establish what the optimum rate of development is. The first thing is, we want to make sure that we're
operating efficiently and safely. So that comes in as an important factor. And we want to move towards pad drilling.
We want to make sure we don't get out in front of infrastructure constraints in the Eagle Ford. We want to make sure
that we're taking advantage of the learning curve, because we're continuing to see learning curve improvements and we

opportunities are not going away, so we want to – we think that our strategy is the right strategy for us in the Eagle

Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys. Simple quick question, hopefully. Jeff, I was looking at your result in the Lower 48,
it looked like your unit DD&A sequentially from the second to the third quarter, up by about $1.50 per barrel. Is there
any particular reason why that was such a big jump?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I don't know the details of that, Paul. Generally as we're bringing on some of these
unconventional production, our reserve bookings are still being done on a fairly conservative basis, so you're finding
fairly – you're finding higher DD&A rates on some of the unconventional properties than we will probably see
longer-term. I think that's part – that's probably the biggest single driver that's [indiscernible] (38:24).
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I hear you, but I mean, from the first to the second quarter, you also see production increase but
that your unit DD&A is pretty flat. It's just that from the second to third that all of a sudden you jump by $1.50, so that
seems very high. So maybe then if you can have someone to get back to me offline?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, we'll just have to get back on that detail, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Then in your slide you indicate that Alaska have a negative impact from the lifting. I
presume you have underneath; can you quantify how big is that?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Lift timings in general for this quarter were not big factors so we didn't highlight them in the
earnings release. The second quarter of Alaska had a favorable impact and the third quarter was relatively small. I
believe the negative impact; it was on the order of $10 million to $15 million in Alaska with a positive impact in the
second quarter. I know we mentioned that on our second quarter call. It was a much larger number.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And then the company as a whole doesn't have a lot because when I'm looking at your
supplemental slide, you indicate that in the third quarter the total company had an [ph] over lift (39:41) of 19,000
barrels per day.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, that's right, Paul. So in general, the overall company impact from timing was relatively
small this quarter. We had slight negatives in Alaska and some slight positives in other regions. But none of them were
large enough that we felt like it made sense to highlight them this quarter.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And then a final one, I think this is probably for Matt. Matt, in Permian, it looked like that in
the third quarter based on the data that you gave back in that will be about 54,000 barrels per day. Are those all
conventional oil production or that some of them is actually already in the [ph] tight (40:25) oil production?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: The vast majority is from the conventional productions. 4,000 or 5,000 barrels a day of
production from the unconventionals just now in the Permian. We're really in the exploration and appraisal phase in the
unconventionals. Yeah so the vast majority is from our conventional program and that program is doing great. That's a
very high return program with lots of running room there. In the unconventional, we're continuing to evaluate the
position that we have and we're feeling good about that too.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Matt, if you're looking out over the next two or three years and separate out again Permian
between unconventional and the conventional component, what is the growth projection that you expect for both sides?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we're going to see growth in both. The rate of growth obviously in the unconventionals will
be a lot faster because we're starting from a lower base. And we're going to see significant growth over the next five

years on both the conventional and the unconventional.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Any number you can share, say that, are we talking about over the next five years on the
conventional side growing by say 50,000 barrel per day, unconventional side growing by say 30,000 barrel per day or
any kind of number you can share?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We actually we gave an indication of this, our expectations on the Analyst Day. So if you go
back to the Analyst Day presentation, we had a specific slide on the – for our expectations for growth in the
conventionals and the unconventionals in the Permian. So and our view hasn't changed since then. We'll update that –
our view of that in our next Analyst Day in April. But that's a good go by for now, Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Yeah, thanks. Since we're sort of on this unconventional conversation with the Permian I just
want to delve in a little bit more on that. I mean when do you all think you'll feel more comfortable with looking at
plays like the Niobrara and the Permian or any of these other unconventional plays you're testing today to actually get
to the decision to put more capital and get somewhat of a development program going? Is that something that is more
of a later 2014, 2015 event? Or could we see that sooner than that?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So for the Niobrara for example, we've got one rig running there. We've drilled 11 wells, we've
got five on production. And we've got a very well, I think a very well thought through appraisal program that's going to
run through the end of 2014. At the end of 2014 we'll really know the scale and the scope of our Niobrara development
and that's when we'll make the development decision of what the characteristics of that will be.
The same really applies in the Permian as well. We're going through, we're testing our portfolio there, making sure that
we understand which of the different prospective horizons, the Avalon, the Bone Springs, the various Wolfcamp
horizons, offer the right, the best potential and are the right place to start that development. So I would say that's
probably on about the same timeline, by the end of 2014 we'll have a really good sense of how that's going to develop.
And in both of those we'll give some more guidance at the Analyst Meet in April.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And are your acreage positions in like each of those plays and specifically large enough
[ph] for – or could be (43:36) the size of Conoco?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I would say so. And I think we've got 130,000 acres in the Niobrara and we've got about
150,000 acres in the Delaware Basin and about 90,000 acres in the Midland Basin and with multiple horizons that exist
in those plays, yeah, it's a significant position even for a company of our size.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And then one last question. On the concept of Alaska LNG project, the AKLNG as you all
call it, can you give me a little more thoughts on what the view is in terms of getting a project? When could we expect
to see the thought of potentially pushing forward that and how that kind of reflects other projects coming on in the
global market?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Okay. So the status of AKLNG is that we've selected a concept and I spoke about that – you
might remember, Scott, I spoke about that maybe in the last call, the concept that we've selected. We announced in this
quarter the site location that we're favoring for the location of the LNG plant in Kenai, the Kenai area in south-central
Alaska. We're moving towards the stage of getting into what's called pre-FEED, so the early stages of engineering and
we're in conversations with our co-venturers and with the State of Alaska on the timing of that. We did quite an
extensive summer fieldwork season on the pipeline route, but it's premature to put any timeline out there as to when
first production would be because there's a lot of water to flow under the bridge. But we're focused on it. We and the
co-venturers and the state are focused on making sure that we fully understand the viability of that project.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: So maybe ask the question in a different way, then. To make this viable what kind of size does
this project need to be for you guys?

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: It's going to be a very large-scale project because of the nature of the resource base there and
we think it could be a competitive project with other sources of supply; otherwise we wouldn't be pursuing it. So it's
going to be of a quite a significant scale. I mean it's somewhere between $45 billion and $60 billion of capital is what
we expect it's going to cost.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got a couple if I may. Jeff, on the deferred tax with the
startup of Norway and obviously I'm not quite sure how other major projects are going to be treated like this, but can
you give us some idea as to whether or not you will have a tax shield building as some of these major projects come on
stream?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I'm not sure I understand your question, Doug. So let me try and answer and if that's not what
you're asking...
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Let me try and help a little bit. So Ekofisk in Norway you get to uplift your capital that you've
spent on the development. So I'm curious as to know, are you going to be paying cash taxes on some of these – which
of the projects and Norway in particular I guess and will you see an uptick in your deferred tax line? I'm just thinking
about the cash flow as we move forward?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, there's a lot of moving pieces on deferred taxes and if you think about how things are
treated tax-wise around the world, Norway you get a relatively quick recovery of your capital. In the UK, you get a
very quick recovery of capital. In the Lower 48 where we're spending quite a bit of capital, to the extent you have
IDCs, we get a quick recovery of capital there as well. So what you'll see in this year and what you'll see probably on
into next year and then it gets harder to model as you go on into subsequent years is that deferred taxes in general, you
can think of as being a source of cash for us on the cash flow statement. So far this year, it's been about $1 billion
source of cash. Whether it keeps running at exactly the rate we've seen for the last few quarters, it's hard to predict, but
certainly it's going to be a positive number. So you could consider that a source of cash for both 2013 and 2014.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. As a signal, I'm sure you're aware of this, but a lot of your pure play E&P peers gave
some guidance on how much is expected to be current and deferred. I don't know if that's something that you might
consider, which would be really helpful if you would. A couple of quick follow-ups please. I guess it's related to some
of the questions you've had already about the Eagle Ford, but I'd like to turn it to the Bakken please, Matt. A number of
your peers have talked about resetting their development plans based on Three Forks success and down spacing
success. I'm just curious about – I mean your acreage is right in the heart of where all that stuff's going on. Just curious
as to how you're thinking about that going forward?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, we are thinking about that, Doug and we've got some pilot tests underway. Right now
we're developing what's effectively 320-acre space and we're developing both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks.
And it's quite possible that we ultimately will want to tighten up that space. And so we have pilot tests underway to try
and give us a good sense of what's the optimum spacing and what level of communication exists between the Middle
Bakken and the Three Forks for the fracs that we have delivered just now. So, yes, we are pursuing the potential for
downspacing in the Bakken.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: No plans to increase the rig count anytime soon, Matt?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No, I don't think so. My comments on that are sort of very similar to the Eagle Ford. I think
we're running 11 rigs in the Bakken and I think that, that's the right level for now. But one of the beauties of these
unconventional plays is that you do have flexibility. It's just a question of making sure that we're exercising that
flexibility at the right time and with the right information.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. And just one final one if I can squeeze it in. Jeff, I don't want to, like Paul, I don't want
to try and front run the Analyst Day, but I just wanted to pick up on your comments about APLNG and Surmont CapEx
peaking. I just wanted to be clear, were you talking specifically about 2014? Should we be – directionally can you give
us any kind of feel as to how spending should go 2014 over 2013 and 2015 over 2014? I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

more precisely about that with you. We're in the middle of wrapping up our capital outlook for next year and as Ellen
mentioned at the top the call, we'll be back to you with that in fairly early December.

Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Hi, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi. Just looking at the project startups you guys have, Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Gumusut, Jasmine, I
mean what's the – I'm looking at your I think it's the page seven sort of cash margin per barrel. What would you say
that these projects collectively sort of have in terms of a cash margin per barrel? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of
what the margin uplift is going to be. I know you guys talk about it, but these are three or four big projects that could
have a material impact to cash flows.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Generally what we've looked at when we think about everything that we're adding to our
portfolio over between now and 2017, that kind of mix has generally a low $40s kind of cash margin to it. And it's
when you mix that kind of cash margin with what's really a high $20s kind of cash margin for us right now that you get
that kind of growth. I think our views on this really aren't any different than what we had in the analyst presentation
where we actually – if you recall we had a chart there that kind of plotted cash margins and production growth. And it
kind of pointed to that that same what I just said, a low $40s type number overall. Some things like Malaysia where you
get capital recovery per the terms of the PSC in the early parts of the year, you end up with some even higher than that
cash margins as you're getting capital recovery.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And in terms of Eldfisk and Ekofisk are those in that same $40 sort of ballpark
numbers?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, they're probably a bit lower than that because of where the taxes are in Norway. They're
probably a little bit – they're more in the $30 than they are in the $40s.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. Understood. And then just in terms of the Eagle Ford, can you give us some – a
little more color on well costs? I know those numbers have been trending down for you in the last quarter. But can you
let us know kind of where you are today and how we can compare that to rest of the peers in the industry?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, we're continuing to see improvements, Faisel, across the board and our drilling costs in
particular. We have recently increased the size of our frac jobs. Starting in September we've increased the size of our
frac jobs significantly. So our completion costs are going up, but for good reason. And what we'll do at the Analyst Day
is we'll give you a good breakdown of how that learning curve has been proceeding and the overall costs at that time.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then in terms of APLNG, just any update on labor productivity
and how that's trending with both the downstream build out and also any updates on the upstream, any upstream issues?
Or things to note on any – any changes from last time when the costs sort of built up a little bit because of the upstream
part of the business.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No. We're – the project is going well. We're about 50% complete on the upstream part of the
project, about 54% complete on the downstream. And we're tracking well against the milestones that we have outlined
for both the downstream and the upstream project. We're very focused now on getting ready for first production so

you have inflow potential at the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. In the past you've talked about thinking in terms of field
kind of plateau levels. Would you rather extend the plateau or increase the rate for the given intervals you expect at
peak production for plays like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford or is that still to be determined?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So the answer's sort of easy. Both.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I'd like to increase the plateau size and increase the duration. And the opportunity set that
exists in our Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken acreage is going to give us the opportunity to do that. And we'll – that's
another thing that we're going to give more guidance on, but the potential exists to do both in those plays.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. That's fair. With some of the newer plays that are kind of in the germinal stages, do
have any acreage retention issues like in the Permian and the Niobrara?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No. No acreage retention issues that we're not able to manage. So no, we're not going to run
into any issues of losing acreage that we think is prospective. That's one of the things that influences how we organize
our drilling schedule in these plays.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. That's fair. In Canada, with plays like the Duvernay some of your peers have had pretty
high costs and I know it's early days. Are the costs more prohibitive in terms of getting more aggressive up in Canada
for unconventionals than in the U.S.?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No. I wouldn't say so, no. I mean our – in fact, our development drilling programs and
exploration programs in Canada have been reducing costs. We've actually been seeing quite a bit of capital efficiency
there, so I wouldn't say that we're seeing that sort of pressure at well in the Duvernay or the Montney or the other the
plays that we're pursuing up there.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Last one for me is more oriented towards Jeff, I guess. You've made some very large,
chunky asset sales. In the future should we see more smaller-type bite size sales rather than large chunky assets?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think in a portfolio of our size you probably expect they'll always to be a little bit of asset sales
that are happening that could be smaller asset sales. I think the thing that is still out there that we've talked about on
previous calls is whether we choose to do something to lower our concentration in oil sands and that could be just
because of the nature of how large of an asset that is for us. Even a relatively small change in that could be a fairly
significant number. But other than that I think the larger asset sales are behind us now and you will see things be
smaller.

<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess a lot of stuff's been hit but kind of melding the Eagle Ford questions with the cash flow
questions, I would imagine where you are in your drilling compared some other companies, you're not cash flow
positive in the Eagle Ford, if that's incorrect, I'd appreciate a correction but maybe a timing on when you could be free
cash positive?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So we are today.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: You are free cash flow positive today?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, we're right above free cash flow positive today.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. And – all right. So that's question one. The other one was as we look at the decline rate
that you highlighted on one of the early charts, I think I calculated it about 13% roughly 186,000 barrels a day of
decline. What as you go forward and add some of the big projects that you're adding – some of the ones obviously that
just started up are pretty traditional, but thinking maybe more like APLNG and so forth, do we get a slower decline rate
going forward? And it is that part of the production growth uptick we would expect to see let's say exit rate for 2014
into 2016?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So our overall decline rate in our base production is about 10% a year over the next five years.
And then as the production mix changes over those years, for example, we drill our oil sands and we add APLNG, and
then the base decline, those, that would tend to mitigate the underlying base decline. But on the other hand, we're also
growing there by drilling unconventionals, which have a higher overall decline. So our expectation is that, that 10%
underlying base decline rate is probably a good go-by for the next five years.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Okay. Well, that was the two things I wanted to hit. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thank you, Roger.

Thank you. Our next question is from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: I was wondering – hi. I'd like to go back to the ANS question or the ANS topic if I
could. You talked about having the option to send ANS volumes over to Asia. Is that just an option that's there, or is it
one that you've really diligently explored? And I guess if I ask it another way, if you look out two years, how likely do
you think it is that Alaskan volumes are leading the U.S. versus remaining domestic?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So what would cause us to really focus on that as an option is if we saw ANS gas created some
significant – ANS oil, excuse me, if it traded some significant discount to Brent prices, which we saw for a short period
of time back when WTI Brent spreads were very wide. Now those, of course, have collapsed quite a bit. Now ANS is
back to trading pretty much flat with Brent prices. It's an option that we know is out there. I can't say that we've
thoroughly investigated or tried to make it happen yet. We know that we could if that were the case. Whether or not it
happens in the next couple of years will depends a lot on where ANS pricing sits relative to other crudes.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: And have you guys looked at what the shipping differential is between Asia and the
West Coast for ANS, or have you not gotten to that point yet?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, I think you'd have to see that ANS pricing was probably $5 or so below Brent pricing for
it to make sense for us to be thinking of doing that.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Mei of Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Mei>: Hi. Thanks. Two questions for me. First one is on, I just wanted to get your thoughts on [ph]
ACO-pricing (61:36) in Canada, and moving forward here in the next year or so?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I mean, it's hard to tell. I mean, it's going to remain likely to remain weak in the – maybe
Brandon, that your assessment is as good as our assessment.
<Q - Brandon Mei>: Okay. And the second question is on the Venezuela ruling. What are the next steps in that
process, and then how should we think about the timing and the amount of the award? Because I think that the amount
of time is – at the time of expropriation the PV10 was around $10 billion.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I don't think we can comment on any expectations of amounts, but just as far as process
goes, we've had the initial award which sets out some of the parameters upon which the award is going to be – which
the financial award is going to be calculated. We now move – are moving into the more detailed assessment of what
exactly what that award is, and that's going to be a process that will take a couple of years to evolve. And that's just
something where we're going to continue to update as we can, but it's a process that we continue to work through.
Operator
Thank you and our last question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Folks, sorry to prompt in late in the call. I'll just limit it to one question. I was just curious
where you think we are in the lifecycle of developing technology to economically develop the lower tertiary. I guess
when I look at your portfolio, you've got several discoveries. You're drilling the appraisal well at Tiber and talking with
peers such as BP, developing 20K and what not. It seems like the technology isn't quite there just yet. What kind of
confidence do you have that we're going to get there, and when do you think we can reasonably expect production from
the play? Thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So the – and as I'm sure you know, Blake, that the – not all of the lower tertiary is at the same
pressure and the same depth. But you're right that several parts of the lower tertiary are going to require 20K trees, and
that – the development of those trees is underway, and that will come over the next few years.
From our own discovery so far, I don't expect we'll see production from the lower tertiary discoveries hitting us until
the late part of this decade. But the development work that's required to make sure that we have the technology in
place, that's all in hand and it's – I mean, developing 20K trees isn't like putting a man on the moon. We know how
trees work, it's a question of just making sure that we're building them and getting them certified in a way that we're
confident on their deployment, but we'll certainly get that done.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Blake. Back to you, operator. We'll wrap up the call here.
