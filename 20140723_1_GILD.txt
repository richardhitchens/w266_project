For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our
President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development,
Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Paul Carter; and our Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.
Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements,
including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve
certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ
materially from these statements.
A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.
In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release, as well as on our website.
I would now like to turn the call over to John Martin.
John C. Martin, Ph.D.
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased with our progress and would like to highlight a
number of key milestones achieved during the quarter.
Just today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zydelig for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Zydelig is the first in our
new class of oral medicines that targets PI3K delta, and we are pleased to provide this additional treatment option for
patients.
Moving to hepatitis C, the rapid adoption of Sovaldi reflects widespread recognition across the medical community of
the benefits that this breakthrough product can bring to patients suffering from hepatitis C. Since approval, more than
70,000 patients in United States and 10,000 patients in the EU have been treated with Sovaldi-containing regimens.
Sovaldi offers higher cure rates with shortened treatment duration at a cost that is comparable to that of alternative
treatment options. And for many patients who have failed treatment with older regimens, Sovaldi provides a new
possibility for a cure.
Gilead has generated and is continuing to generate clinical data that support the scientific and medical evidence for
treating hepatitis C at many stages of the disease. In fact, across all our hepatitis C clinical studies, over 6,000 patients
have been treated and cured to-date.
In Japan, a New Drug Application has been submitted to Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency for
approval of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 2 infected patients.
In the Phase III study supporting this application, 97% of patients dosed for 12 weeks with sofosbuvir and ribavirin
achieved an SVR12. This filing represents Gilead's first drug application in Japan and, if approved, sofosbuvir would
be the first product to be launched and marketed by Gilead in that country.
Our innovation and investment in improving the treatment for hepatitis C continues with a single-tablet regimen of
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. FDA has assigned a PDUFA date of
October 10 and the European Union approval is expected to come later in this year.
In Japan, the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Marketing Authorization Application will be filed in the fourth quarter of this year.
This application will be supported by results of the Phase III clinical trial conducted in Japan in which genotype 1
infected patients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks. 22% of the patients
have cirrhosis.

Overall, the SVR12 rate was 99%. And in the cohort that received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin, the SVR rate
was 100%.
Ensuring patient access to Sovaldi and all our medicines has been and will continue to be a top priority for Gilead, and
we have been actively engaging with payers to convey the benefits of Sovaldi. In addition, we are committed to making
Sovaldi available to patients in developed countries and have recently entered an agreement with Egypt, a country that
has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C in the world.
In HIV, a single-tablet regimen abbreviated E/C/F/TAF is being evaluated in a number of studies, including
treatment-experienced patients, patients on stable therapies switch to E/C/F/TAF, patients with mild to moderate renal
impairment, as well as adolescents.
Data from our two Phase III studies comparing E/C/F/TAF to Stribild in treatment-naïve patients should become
available in the third quarter of this year. We anticipate filing for U.S. and European Marketing Authorization of
E/C/F/TAF in the first quarter of 2015 for the use in treatment-naïve, treatment-experienced and renal-impaired
patients.
TAF as a single agent is also being studied in chronic hepatitis B infection: two studies in 1,250 patients are 30%
enrolled; one study is e antigen-positive; and the other, an e antigen-negative hepatitis B infected patients. We expect to
complete enrollment of these studies around the end of this year.
We have significant activities ongoing across other therapeutic areas as well. A number of studies of simtuzumab, an
investigational monoclonal antibody targeting the LOXL2 protein, are ongoing in a variety of fibrotic diseases and
solid tumors. The Phase II study in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is fully enrolled and data are expected in the middle of
2015. We also look forward to providing updates for the simtuzumab studies in pancreatic and colorectal cancer and
myelofibrosis before the end of the year.
GS-9620, a TLR-7 agonist, is being evaluated in a Phase II study as a potential cure for hepatitis B with the first
patients having been screened at the beginning of July. GS-5745, an MMP9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor, is currently
in Phase I and is being explored in ulcerative colitis and solid tumors.
The synergistic activity of ranolazine in combination with dronedarone in atrial fibrillation and the activity of GS-6615
in long QT-3 syndrome were presented recently at the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.
While I'm only highlighting a few of our R&D accomplishments for this year, I am very pleased with our high level of
innovation and productivity. I would like to thank the more than 6,000 employees at Gilead and our collaborators and
partners around the world for their dedication and immeasurable contributions to the company. Their work and
commitment have enabled us to achieve a number of milestones across different therapeutic areas of the business and,
importantly, continue to bring life-changing therapies to patients and communities in need.
I would now like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul R. Carter
Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter of 2014, our worldwide total net product revenue
increased to $6.4 billion, representing growth of 141% over the second quarter last year. U.S. sales exceeded $4.8
billion and European sales exceeded $1.3 billion.
This performance has been driven mainly by healthy demand in our HIV business and the uptake of Sovaldi, which
have sales totaling $3.5 billion. Of that number, $3 billion represents U.S. sales, with most of the rest of the remaining
revenues coming from France and Germany. Patients have now been treated with Sovaldi in 34 countries worldwide,
and that number will continue to increase as further regulatory approvals and reimbursements are achieved.
Beginning with the U.S. in HIV, prescription volume continued to grow on our HIV products. 9 out of 10 patients new
to treatment were prescribed a Gilead medicine, with 7 out of 10 receiving one of Gilead's Truvada-based single-tablet

regimens. Of these, Stribild continues to be the leading HIV regimen for patients who are beginning therapy, capturing
3 out of 10 [ph] starts (10:04).
Prescription growth of Gilead's Truvada-based single-tablet regimens, including Stribild, Complera and Atripla, is 13%
year-over-year. I'm pleased to report that Stribild prescriptions alone grew 19% in quarter two over quarter one this
year, and Stribild is now approaching $1 billion annual run rate in the U.S.
ADAP purchasing in the U.S. was in-line with expectations and historical norms and we did not see any unusual
movements in wholesaler inventory levels.
Moving to U.S. hepatitis C performance, Sovaldi sales of $3 billion showed strong patient demand and rapid adoption
by physicians. We estimate that approximately 70,000 patients have now been prescribed Sovaldi in the U.S. since
launch.
The prescribing of Sovaldi in the U.S. has been driven mainly by hepatologists and gastroenterologists, but internal
medicine specialists and primary care physicians, many of whom also treat HIV patients, have also prescribed the
treatment. Approximately 70% of the physicians visited by our therapeutic specialists have prescribed Sovaldi to-date.
We are seeing signs that some physicians have begun delaying treatment for some patients, also known as
warehousing, in anticipation of the approval of the single-tablet regimen of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir.
The initial patients who started a Sovaldi-based treatment in the U.S. became aware that they were cured late in the
second quarter. Based on prescription data and our cure rates in Sovaldi clinical trials, we estimate that around 9,000
individuals have been cured to-date, and that number will continue to accelerate as the year goes on. Of the patients
treated so far, we believe that around 80% are new to therapy.
The genotype distribution of patients that receive treatment is approximately representative of the U.S. HCV
population, with around 60% usage in genotype 1; 25% in genotype 2; 10% in genotype 3; and 5% in genotypes 4, 5
and 6 combined.
We have noticed the reporting of an increased use of the interferon-free regimen used in the Phase II COSMOS study
comprised of Sovaldi with simeprevir and we estimate that during quarter two 70% of Sovaldi usage was in
interferon-free regimens, including COSMOS.
On the payer front, most commercial Medicare party and state Medicaid plans take a full six months to review new
drugs and we are working with these payers to facilitate patient accessibility to Sovaldi.
As anticipated, we saw a slight shift in the payer mix in quarter two due to more patients from the VA and other
non-retail coming on to treatment. As we exited the second quarter, the overwhelming majority of state Medicaids are
covering Sovaldi, roughly half of them with a prior authorization to label and the other half with restrictions around
fibrosis scores. Only three states are not covering Sovaldi, pending completion of their review or the establishment of
prior authorization criteria.
In the U.S., we have one of the most comprehensive patient assistance programs in the industry to help ensure cost is
not a barrier for patients. The components of that program include providing coupons to bring the co-pay down to as
low as $5 per month and paying the entire cost for the eligible uninsured. We also provide financial support to an
independent non-profit organization offering assistance to patients who cannot cover their out-of-pocket medication
costs.
Turning to Europe, we are very pleased with our strong HIV performance, again, underscoring our confidence in the
benefits of Truvada-based single-tablet regimens. Gilead's single-tablet regimens have grown over 20% in volume
year-over-year in the Big 5 EU markets. Of these, Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen for treatment-naïve HIV
patients and also continued to extend its lead over Atripla as the most commonly switched-to regimen.
Despite the availability of generic efavirenz in Europe, 70% of switches out of Atripla in quarter two went to Eviplera,
which since the beginning of the year has been actively promoting the switch in most countries where approved. This,

again, demonstrates the value of Truvada-based single-tablet regimens. In fact, we have seen little impact to our
business from generic efavirenz so far.
By the end of the second quarter, we have sales from Stribild in 19 countries across Europe, including all five EU Big 5
markets. Stribild is now the second most prescribed regimen for switches after Eviplera, gaining most of these switches
from previous protease inhibitor or raltegravir-containing regimens.
Moving to hepatitis C, we estimate approximately 10,000 patients have now received treatment with Sovaldi in Europe,
where sales were $400 million in quarter two. The vast majority of these patients are in France and Germany.
While Sovaldi has regulatory approval in the EU, the full pricing and reimbursement process varies by country, with
some countries completing the process more quickly than others. Negotiations are ongoing in the majority of EU
markets. Indeed, we have filed health economic dossiers with all the major reimbursement agencies, and we are
following the processes that lead to final price and reimbursement approval.
In France, Sovaldi was given high marks in a recent government health technology assessment, in which it was
recognized for demonstrating a high level of innovation and is recommended for reimbursement consistent with
Sovaldi's label.
While we are going through the rest of the pricing process with the French Ministry of Health, we continue to make
Sovaldi available to patients in the pre and post-liver transplant setting and also for patients with advanced liver disease
who failed other hepatitis C treatments or are interferon-intolerant. This is in-line with the Temporary Authorization for
Use, or ATU, scope, and this use will widen when full reimbursement is established.
In Germany just last week, the government's AMNOG process completed its review of Sovaldi, also recognizing the
additional benefit that it brings to patients. The AMNOG process will continue over the next month.
In the UK, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, or NICE, has requested additional consultation before a final
recommendation on reimbursement can be made. We are confident that upon completion of the process, NICE will be
able to make a positive formal recommendation that acknowledges both the clinical and health economic benefits that
Sovaldi can bring to the broader UK population.
In the meantime, the National Health Service in England has approved funding for approximately 500 people,
recognizing the urgent need for sicker patients.
It is also worth noting that Sovaldi has received a positive HTA review in Scotland, and this has been accepted by the
Scottish Medicines Consortium on behalf of NHS Scotland.
In Australia, Sovaldi was recently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, and discussions for
pricing and reimbursement are ongoing.
Outside North America and Europe, we continue to expand our geographic footprint. The build-out of our Gilead
organization in Japan is going according to plan, in anticipation of the approval of sofosbuvir in early 2015 and the
single-tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir later in 2015.
In closing, I'm excited to share that earlier today, as John mentioned, the FDA granted approval of Zydelig for use in
three B-cell malignancies. Our U.S. commercial team has been prepared for this day and will immediately begin to
promote Zydelig. We're very excited to have our first commercial product in oncology.
The approvals in Europe are pending and our teams there will be ready for commercial launch, consistent with the
anticipated regulatory and reimbursement timelines.
I'd now like to turn over the call to Robin.

Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenues for the second quarter were $6.5 billion. Non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.36.
As Paul covered the key commercial drivers and performance for the quarter, I would like to briefly discuss Q2
inventory dynamics for our core business and our recent Sovaldi product launch.
As mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, we experienced an inventory drawdown in the first quarter for our HIV and
cardiopulmonary products following strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in December 2013 in anticipation
of January 1 price increases. During the second quarter, inventory levels remained at the low-end of the range as we did
not see a rebuild of inventory within the channel.
Turning to Sovaldi, we estimate the vast majority of U.S. sales for the second quarter were related to demand.
Inventory across the supply chain for Sovaldi were at levels necessary to support demand during the quarter. And while
the provisions for the inventory management agreements for Sovaldi with the big three wholesalers do not start until
September, inventory levels were already within the range of those provisions as of the end of the quarter.
As anticipated, we are starting to see some patient warehousing in advance of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir approval. If this
warehousing continues, it may have a downstream impact to Sovaldi inventory held in the distribution channel.
Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $54 million year-over-year, reflecting increases in head count
to support clinical study activities, geographic expansion and marketed products support in addition to infrastructure
costs related to expansion of our R&D activities. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased $16
million to $542 million in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the ramp-down of Sovaldi and
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Phase III studies.
During the second half of 2014, we expect non-GAAP R&D expense to increase relative to first half 2014 levels to
support expansion of studies in HCV, HIV, inflammation and respiratory therapeutic areas.
Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $193 million year-over-year to support Sovaldi sales, ongoing geographic
expansion and the anticipated approvals of our HCV fixed-dose combination and idelalisib. On a sequential basis,
non-GAAP SG&A increased by approximately $70 million, driven primarily by the support of Sovaldi's launch. We
expect continued and incremental investments in these areas in the second half of 2014.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 14.6%, primarily due to increased sales of Sovaldi and a
cumulative catch-up adjustment of 3.6 percentage points to the first quarter tax rate to reduce the year-to-date
non-GAAP effective tax rate to 18.2%. We have included a reconciliation of this change on slide 40 in the earnings
deck.
The first half revenue performance resulted in another strong quarter of cash flow from operations of $4.2 billion. This
reflects strong collections in the current quarter and a larger-than-normal component of Q1 collections given the ramp
of Q1 Sovaldi sales.
As committed, we increased our level of shareholder return this quarter by repurchasing 15.2 million shares, utilizing
$1.2 billion in cash. As of June 30, we had $1.7 billion remaining on our $5 billion repurchase authorization from
January 2011, which we will complete in the third quarter prior to its expiration in September 2014.
In addition, in May 2014, our board approved an additional $5 billion in purchase authorization.
During the quarter, we repaid the remainder of the outstanding May 2014 convertible notes, as outlined on slide 56. In
the third quarter, the warrants related to the May 2014 convertible debt will expire, which, if settled in cash, will result
in cash utilization of approximately $3.1 billion to $3.7 billion.
Finally, we are updating full year 2014 guidance, which is outlined on slide 43, to include HCV revenues for 2014.
We expect Gilead total net product sales to be in the range of $21 billion to $23 billion. I would like to caution you that
it is very difficult to accurately predict revenues from HCV products, which are now included in our total net product
sales. As a result, the following factors specific to HCV products could cause our net product revenue to be higher or

lower than projected.
These factors include the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir single-tablet regimen not being approved by the PDUFA date of
October 10, 2014; the level and speed of market acceptance of the STR; the pricing and rate of reimbursement for the
STR; the amount of patient warehousing and wholesaler inventory decreases prior to approval of the STR, which could
negatively impacted sales of Sovaldi; and finally, the launch timing and market acceptance of competitive drugs
already on the market or scheduled to enter the market later this year.
Turning to expense guidance, our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 85% to 88%. We
are increasing our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion as we continue to invest
in our pipeline. We are increasing our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to also be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion,
which assumes the continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support
HCV product launches and increased marketing and sales efforts related to the launch of our first oncology product.
For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 20.5%. As Congress has
not extended the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, we have excluded the credit from our guidance. If the R&D tax
credit is extended in 2014, we would expect an additional 0.4% reduction in our annual effective tax rate.
We are anticipating the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation
expenses to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share. This range includes the full year effect of the amortization of
end process R&D related to Sovaldi.
Thank you and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the
call for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter.
<A - John C. Martin, Ph.D.>: Thanks, Geoff.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: So the cost benefit of Sovaldi seems pretty straightforward, but there still are a lot of public
comments. So my question is, is there any color you can give us on the progress you're making in Washington or with
private payers on this front? And then, very related, what can be done to more rapidly increase hep C budgets in the
state for Medicaid patients and also across Europe? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Hey, Geoff. It's John Milligan. Yeah, that's a complicated question that you gave us
there. So a number of things are being done, of course. We have had a number of healthcare economic outcome
research programs that we commissioned and have published. We are talking about the value of Sovaldi. There is
clearly a lively debate within the press, there's a lively debate within the payer community and, of course, the interest of
Washington on this.
It is just now really that we're starting to see some of the benefits of Sovaldi. And we've been talking about this during
the script, the fact that we can estimate that over 9,000 patients have now been cured in our commercial program, that
we've cured over 6,000 patients across a wide range of disease states in HCV in our hepatitis clinical trials program,
and we're starting to see some of these benefits.
So this is the leading edge of benefit that you will see, and that will clearly accelerate as we get into later in the year as
more and more patients will have reached that important time point of 12 weeks past the end of their treatment period.

So, I think there'll be a positive momentum and a positive series of stories coming out of that which will be quite
helpful. Of course, the discussions with the payers center around the volumes that they are seeing.
I don't think anybody disagrees with the fact that Sovaldi is a remarkable drug. It's been called an outlier in some
segments; I agree with it. It's an outlier because we are curing people of a horrible disease in a very rapid timeframe,
and that's a very unusual thing for payers to think about.
So we have noticed some positive movement of some payers, indicating that they have budgetary room in the second
half of this year for this product. That has not been universal, but we are in discussions with them and talking about
Sovaldi use and then, importantly, the next-generation product, the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, coming forward.
Interestingly, if you picked up on Paul's script, we noticed that the interferon three regimens are becoming increasingly
important. And I think it is important to note that a high percentage of patients now seem to be getting Sovaldi plus
simeprevir, indicating that all-oral regimens are being approved by the payers and are considered an important part of
the way to treat this disease going forward.
It's a long answer to your long question. And the final part, with regard to things like the Senate, we, of course, are
complying with their request for information and look forward to the opportunities to discuss the value of Sovaldi with
members of the Senatorial staff.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thank you very much and congratulations again. Also, a remarkable quarter. Just a
question on timing. So you mentioned the October 10 PDUFA date for the fixed-dose combination, and that's an
eight-month review cycle from filing and it is being given breakthrough status. So, is there anything going on in your
interactions with the agency that suggests that might be extended?
And just a related question, if Paul could comment on TAF and Stribild, another new combination, just a little bit about
what you're seeing in the market in terms of the appetite for replacing the existing combinations with the TAF
formulation. Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Hi, Geoff. It's Norbert. I'll take your first question. The review of
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is moving ahead nicely. We've had all the usual questions from the agency about clinical CMC.
We've had clinical-type inspections that are done, manufacturing inspections that are done. At this point, it's all moving
ahead nicely, but it would be too much to speculate about the approval date. All we really know for certain is the
PDUFA date is October 10.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: And, Geoff, on your question about TAF, clearly this drug is not approved yet and we haven't
completed our clinical trials, and data really will instruct us on how this is going to play out. I think it's worth
mentioning though that single-tablet regimens are the way ahead in our opinion and we hope very much that the data
coming out of the TAF trials will underscore the importance of Gilead's single-tablet regimens.

Merck is doing a trial with four-week data due by the end year, and there's some possibility that [indiscernible] (32:05)
exceptionally high of course that they could shorten the duration with the triplet regimen down to four weeks. And I
know that you have explored triple regimens in the past. I'd love an update as to where you guys are with that and, if
needed, how quickly you could move forward to react to the Merck data if indeed it hits a high bar and it looks pretty
good. Thank you.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yes, Mark. This is Norbert. Mark, quickly, to remind you, we actually
disclosed data from an NIH study which was in early March at CROI, and there we showed that you can indeed take
six weeks of three drugs – so in that case, it was our protease inhibitor, GS-9451, with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, and
you get 100% cure rates. Of course, we knew those data quite awhile before we presented it.
So, we have undertaken now to look at eight weeks in Sovaldi patients. We're looking at six weeks in Sovaldi patients.
We're looking out four weeks in naïve patients, both for three drugs and four drugs. You will see some of these data
that are emerging openly at AASLD. If then, we see that a certain regimen as the profile that we hope it has to have,
and remember the hurdle bar has gone way up. Below 95% I don't think we would consider anything taken forward into
Phase III. We could then move fairly – very quickly into Phase III with whatever regimen we decide we want to do that
experiment on.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess following up on Mark's question,
can you maybe clarify what regimens you're looking at with the three and four DAA combos for four weeks to eight
weeks that you just mentioned, Norbert? And then, are there other ways beyond those triplet regimens that you could
potentially maintain you per-patient hep C revenues should others add on and get down to four weeks? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yeah, hi, Brian. So as you know, we have Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Of course,
that's under review. That's genotype 1, with the initial approval. We have GS-5816/sofosbuvir combination. That is
going into Phase III, and you will see something very soon in the second half on clinic trials. And then, we have an
HIV – a genotype 1 specific protease inhibitor, GS-9451, and we have a genotype 1 specific, NS5B non-nucleoside
inhibitor, GS-9669. In addition, we are now moving very soon into Phase II with a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor.
So again, to summarize all of this, we are aiming for a pan-genotypic regimen that either can be three drugs, and it's
probably going to be sofosbuvir with GS-5816 and the pan-genotypic protease inhibitor. And we just have to establish
the minimum treatment duration. And we are conscious, or we want to be the treatment duration not only for
treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients to be shorter, but also for the more difficult to treat treatment-experienced and
Sovaldi patients, to apply the same concept. And again, we hope if everything goes well, we will go into a larger Phase
II study in the second half of this year or, if we so choose, we could use GS-9451 and go directly into Phase III. That all
depends on what the emerging data looks like.

conservatism given the uncertainties, Robin, that you mentioned, or is there a specific reason we wouldn't see an uptick
in sales with the single-pill?
And then just related, real quick for Paul, in the hep C launch is it possible for you to break out the proportion of
patients who are fibrotic and cirrhotic, and your relative level of confidence that the less urgently sick patients will
ultimately be treated down the line?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hey, Matt. It's Robin. I'll take the first part of the question. I think the variables that we
discussed are the ones I mentioned, and it can swing you from the lower or the high range. I would remind you to keep
in mind that unlike HIV, which is chronic care, in HCV we cure patients, right? So, it's not necessarily as linear. But all
the things that I talked about, patient warehousing, movement in inventory levels, the approval date, payer discussions,
all of these could apply some variability in the range provided.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Okay. And Paul here, just to add just a comment on the fibrosis scores. [ph] I mean (37:56) this
data is inaccurate, I would say, but our best estimate is that around 40% of patients are F3, F4. 60% of patients treated
today are zero to F2. We don't have data on the cirrhotic's level. But I did mention earlier that 80% of the patients
treated are new to treatment, so consequently 20% are experienced patients and would be sicker ones.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, thanks. A quick question. Initially, there was a lot of focus around you giving numbers
around how many patients in the U.S. were under care by an expert, and I noticed the number has gone up a little bit
from 388,000 to the 393,000. Presumably that could be busted through over the next few years based on your
trajectory. So I just want to understand how you're thinking about opening up that $700,000 or so, I guess $1.4 million
to get to the fully diagnosed number so we could think about just beyond the next couple of years?
And then simultaneously, in Europe, a similar thinking but presumably a much lower price. So when you think out
maybe over the long term, what percent of U.S. sales do you think Europe or o-U.S. could be?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Michael, this is John. With regard to the number of patients diagnosed, I mean we are
seeing – certainly, and you probably read about this as well, a lot of doctors now reaching out to patients who had
previously been diagnosed but have not been under care in the last 12 months. That's why you see that number shift,
letting patients know that new options are available and better options are coming. So, there has been an increase in the
number of patients seeking care. So I think that's been an important dynamic that we're witnessing, just really the
beginnings of this as we've been launching Sovaldi and as it's now become available in certain plans and certain states.
We are confident that the increased cure rate, the ease of treatment and these very important regimens that act more
broadly across different types of patients will encourage patients to go get tested and bring into care as well. So, we
think two things will happen. One, we'll test a higher percentage of people, increasing that diagnosed number; and that
those patients who are diagnosed will eventually seek care.
I have to say, all the controversy around Sovaldi is a constant daily reminder to patients that there's a very important
new option available for them as well, and I have to think that that's been helpful as well. So we have a high degree of
confidence that in the future, there'll be more and more people now seeking care from their hepatologist as they have
those options available.
<A - John C. Martin, Ph.D.>: Paul, do you want to take the second part?

<Q - Michael J. Yee>: What percent of sales' o-U.S. versus U.S.?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I think that's a really hard question, Michael. There's going to be a different timing is the reality,
because the countries in Europe are going to be slower to reimburse and approve the product. But I think the prevalence
in Europe is just marginally below the U.S., so I think in volume terms, the numbers could end up being very similar.
But the price points in Europe is going to be slightly less than Europe – the ASP, probably. So I think we can figure out
that the numbers are going to be fairly similar; U.S. probably slightly bigger than Europe in the end spread over a
longer timeframe.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I did have one on reimbursement. Could you
give us some sense for the portion of people who are currently being denied coverage for Sovaldi, and how many
people need, for example, to have their fibrosis status determined before they do get coverage? And then relatedly,
what's your most recent thinking on the pricing for the combo pill? I think in the past, you've said Sovaldi contributes
the most, the highest percentage of value to the pills. Is that still your position? Any updated thoughts would be
appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I think I'll have to come back to you on the fibrosis score, Phil. I don't know the answer to that.
This is Paul, by the way. I'm thinking about the fixed-dose combination pricing, we haven't come to a conclusion yet.
But I do think philosophically, we feel the majority of the value in the fixed-dose combination is within Sovaldi.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Phil, on your question about reimbursement and denial of care, I mean we do have a
significant number of patients who are getting some form of help from Gilead, especially through a patient assistance
program. We do know that prior authorizations are being used in most of the plans, especially the Medicaid plan, and
this tends to slow down the rate of patients coming into care. And then, we also know that physicians are now delaying
putting patients on treatment, waiting for the fixed-dose combination.
So, it's a difficult thing to say who's being denied versus who is being delayed, waiting for the all-oral regimens to
come on the market. So, it is difficult and I don't know that we'll have a better answer for you anytime in the future
either.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Okay, good. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I have sort of a, maybe a little bit of a follow-on
on Phil's question and it's sort of in two parts. One, can you think of – I'm just trying to get a sense, this is a unique
situation where we're talking about an approved drug with a broad label and potential coverage denial. I mean is that
something that you can recall in the past, even from a legal standpoint, are payers allowed to reject coverage?
And then secondly, just a little bit from a Federal Trade Commission perspective, If you price the fixed-dose combo in
a way that's competitive, and then Sovaldi plus another drug is materially more expensive, is that an issue from the
Federal Trade given that you're going to be owning the market? Thank you.
<A - John C. Martin, Ph.D.>: Yaron, your first question is kind of a broad one, if this has ever happened in the
industry, and I don't know that I can speak to it. I certainly can't think of any situations that are similar to this, although
this drug is different than other drugs. In many ways, in the HIV field, we were limiting the patients who were coming

on to care, we have guidelines not specifically through FDA labeling. So there were considerations there that were not
part of the FDA label, and that's the one that comes to mind.
Obviously, we broadened those guidelines over time as some medicines got better and doctors got more comfortable
putting patients on a higher and higher CD4 counts, and I think that's probably most analogous. But again, since this is
a cure market, you can make rational choices about who should come under care today knowing that eventually you'll
be able to get to all the patients even though that may take many, many years to do so and will naturally take many,
many years.
I think the second part of your question was about pricing. And so, simply put, we can't comment on pricing, our
thoughts around pricing for an unapproved product. And so, I can't really comment and won't speculate on the outcome
that might happen with regard to that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thanks. I'm going to follow the trend and maybe ask one question, two-parts, completely
unrelated. Just on – maybe switching topics a little bit, maybe starting off with NASH. Maybe, Norbert, if could you
provide us a update on what you feel are the regulatory requirements to get a drug approved for NASH in the U.S. and
Europe?
And then just on pricing, following up on a earlier question, I know the thought seems to be that Sovaldi should be
driving most – or is providing most of the benefit, so should engender most of the sort of pricing power. But how do
you balance that with a payer environment U.S. and Europe, which is basically reimbursing two drugs, [indiscernible]
(46:40) and Sovaldi, which are priced very similarly?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: So, Ian, quickly, the approval – the endpoint – and I'm simply telling you
about the conversations we've had with the FDA as little as six months ago. U.S. FDA felt that histology, even for
accelerated approval is not an approvable endpoint. They wanted to have some clinical evidence of efficacies. And
after a lot of conversations and back-and-forths and involving experts, the FDA agreed that changes in hepatic venous
pressure gradient at 48 weeks, they would accept as a clinical endpoint. And that's the study we're doing right now.
Our study in NASH was people with cirrhosis actually uses hepatic venous pressure gradient at week 48 as the
endpoint. And that will of course then – we also have a NASH study in [ph] urgent (47:41) fibrosis patients and in
those patients it would be histology. But the histology will be kind of the link between the two studies, so that
ultimately the approvable endpoint would be hepatic venous pressure gradient. So, Ian, having that said, the FDA could
change their mind. So, I'm simply telling you what we were told six months ago.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: And your second question about pricing, Ian – this is John Milligan – these are always
complicated things to think about in terms of the value that a product brings, the types of patients that it would be
appropriate for, and the appropriate level of pricing based on that. And so, these are things that we have to take into
consideration, as well as the external environment we're in and the competitive nature of future regimens when we
think about pricing.
And so, all of those, we will factor into what the ultimate pricing decision will be on the fixed-dose combination. So I
obviously can't tell you more than that because these things can't be talked about until after provability, but these are
the various factors that we use to think about that ultimate price.

<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Obviously, you've got an marked uptick in cash
generation. So, your latest thoughts on capital allocation policy? You previously talked about dividends. Are you any a
nearer to that and can commit into that? Any philosophical change in thinking how you accelerate your pipeline breadth
given your need ultimately for higher future revenues given your higher current base? Thank you.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Ravi, I'll take the first part. I mean, I think, overall, our capital structure practices remain
similar to what we've communicated in the past. We're committed to effectively leveraging our strong cash flow, and
we're disciplined in thinking about it relative to the investments in growing our pipeline, selective M&A, as well as
returning capital to shareholders.
The vehicle that we use today are share repurchases. With the increased level of cash flows and the repayment of debt,
we expect to continue to use share repurchases over and beyond the $1.7 billion year-to-date. We've announced, as we
did on the call, that we will repurchase another $1.7 billion this quarter. And as you know, we have a larger $5 billion
repurchase program outstanding.
So at this juncture, we still believe that that's the best vehicle for us to use. And it's consistent with our belief that we
feel our shares are currently under-valued. We continue to have discussions with management about using other
vehicles, so we could in the future think about a dividend in addition to share repurchases.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Ravi, it's John. Just to highlight the second part of your question about, will the
accelerated amount of cash generation change our thinking about bringing in our pipeline. Really, the cash generation
isn't material to our thinking this way. We have a lot of good things in our pipeline. As John Martin mentioned, he was
only able to highlight a few of the many exciting things that are going on in our pipeline. We've never had so many
things going forward as we do today, and we feel very, very confident in the pipeline that we have today.
So as Robin mentioned, our focus will be on selective deals in order to augment our pipeline in certain key areas. But
with all the things going on so well, we feel there isn't a strong need to do anything more than that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just to switch actually on HIV. So it looks like
the Stribild, your new patient share is going up. But we've done some math from the metrics you provided, it looks like
the amount of patients who are switching off current drug is sort of stable. So I just wanted to check and see if the math
is right, that the patients on current drugs who switched is sort of stable. And then, how do you see TAF influencing
that switch market, and do you have any sense of how quickly that could occur over time? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Maybe I'll take this question. So our single-tablet regimen growth, Robyn, both in the U.S. and
in Europe, continues a nice steady trajectory upwards. We are seeing some switches out of [indiscernible] (52:17)
containing products within our single-tablet regimens. So patients are switching out of Atripla to some extent, although
that is fairly slow and the majority, the vast majority of those switches out of Atripla, are coming to either Stribild or
Complera in the U.S., or Eviplera in Europe. So we are pretty comfortable with that and pleased, the way things are
going.
Your question on TAF, it's really too early to say because the data coming out of the Phase III study will be highly
instructive as to the feature of our single-tablet regimen treatment going forward.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: As a follow-up, so our math says it's about 6% of people have switched and that – has it
sort of been stable over the last two quarters? Like, do you have any sense of how high that could go, or is that
important or not important to you?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Thanks for taking my question. Prior to the Sovaldi launch, you indicated you're actively
preparing payers for its impact. Can you comment on how effective that's been to-date, ways you think you may be
able to improve payer preparedness for next year and beyond, and to what extent do you think that may help curtail
some of the constant stream of complaints we read about in the press on price? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Hey, Josh. It's John Milligan. So, we did talk to payers about the impact. I think they,
frankly, thought they were going to see something that was much more like a Vertex launch for Incivek. And so, they
were surprised that not only did the product launch at such a high rate, but also that it continued to grow; whereas it
topped out very quickly with Incivek, which is, of course, going to happen in a drug that is a high touch point for
physicians, with lots of labor necessary and long duration of treatment. So, I think they just simply didn't understand
technically what happens when you only treat patients for 12 weeks.
And so, they clearly understand the dynamic much better now. They understand also that the demand for all-oral
regimens is very high. Certainly, the interest is high. And I hope they will be preparing for this, but it's hard for me to
know exactly what they're going to do and how they're going to think about something like our all-oral fixed dose
combination which is coming out later this year.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Do you believe that's been a prime driver for kind of the pricing noise concerns and
complaints we've heard this year and will that abate next year as a result?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Well, I don't know if it's been the prime driver. It's better to speak to the payers, the
individuals who have been saying these things, than to me. I don't know if it's going to have an abatement next year or
not. I do know that as the value story grows, I think there'll be a greater appreciation that the fact these patients have
been cured. A lot of ancillary problems that they had will subside. And we believe that over time the healthcare system
will save a lot of money by these patients being healthy again.

course, the endpoint is PFS, and we will be looking for a convincing difference of PFS on the active arms versus the
placebo. And how convincing, I can't tell you. [indiscernible] (56:33) I know both of them are at two doses of
simtuzumab, 200 milligram and 700 milligram IV every two weeks. And clearly, what would also be nice to see is
some dose response. Anyway, something that would convince us to spend the money and time and resources going to
Phase III.

And as you may also know, the endpoint in the myelofibrosis study is histology. So again, we will be looking at
something that just convinces us that it's worth trying to put these drugs into further development.
How important these things are, I would say very important. I mean I always said with simtuzumab, it's high risk
because it is a novel target and, as you know, there are a lot of drugs against novel targets have never gone anywhere.
But if it works, this could be a really, really useful drug for solid tumors. So were looking forward to learning more

<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'm thinking a lot about
the shortening duration of hep C therapy, and I wonder if you could just comment strategically what options you have
with Sovaldi in terms of pricing and access should data justify a four-week regimen through a two-company
combination where Sovaldi is one of the agents. I'm thinking in particular of Bristol-Myers' forward study; if that does
show four weeks of high SVR, isn't there a scenario where next year, if it was priced competitively, you would see
potentially a 50% reduction in the overall price per patient if Sovaldi remains at the same price. So, just if you could
give any color on are there options to change Sovaldi's pricing as a result of that?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Brian, again, we're not going to speculate on any pricing or any regimens in the future
that haven't been tested. We have a lot of options within our own regimens. There will undoubtedly be options with
combinations of regimens in the future as there's the potential to get down to shorter and shorter durations. Certainly,
we've already shown that six weeks is possible with our own combinations. So, there may be others that could get to
that as well. But I don't want to – I'm not going to publicly speculate about what we might or might not do with regard
to pricing in the future. We'll just have to see how these things play out and we'll make decisions accordingly in the
future.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Okay, that's fair. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to change the topic and ask about
idelalisib. Obviously, you got approval today on both indications. I just wanted to ask if, one, obviously, coming much
earlier than you expected, if that changed sort of how you think about the launch; and then also, what you think about
the impact of the black box as well as the requirement of the REMS? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yeah, so Matthew, thanks for asking about idelalisib. It's the first time this
comes up. It's a great news for us. It's our first oncology product, and we're all proud and happy about it.
It wasn't a surprise to us that it came sooner because we kind of always knew FDA was working towards this. We had
breakthrough status on one of the indications. And the other – let me make a comment about the black box from a
clinical point of view.
So first of all, idelalisib is a highly effective drug for certain patients and we believe a lot of patients will benefit from
it. Actually, in our clinical studies, looking at some of the statistics, it's 8 out of 10 that derive a benefit.
Secondly, you have to realize the data sets that we submitted to FDA, both for the NHL, the two NHLs, and the CLL
indications, were relatively small. It was Study 116, which had 110 patients on one arm, and the total of the SLL and
FL patients in the NHL study was about 100.

So, we were left with a relatively small data set. And the data is the data. These events were observed. We did have
fatalities. This is in a patient population that is otherwise old age, mostly very sick, takes other medications. And we,
together with the FDA, felt that it was appropriate to include conservative warnings in the prescribing information.
I would like to also like to remind you, we have a total of five additional clinical studies ongoing, two in CLL, which in
a month or two should be fully enrolled; two in NHL, both for relapse; and one in frontline therapy in CLL. So, five
additional clinical studies. And from these studies, this will inform us further about the safety profile of idelalisib. And
as the data emerge, we may update the label.
Paul, do you want to add anything?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I just like to add that our commercial team has been preparing for the idelalisib launch for quite
a while now. We have a fully recruited team. We've recruited some very high-caliber people from companies that have
high levels of oncology experience. The team is trained. They're in the field, and they are promoting the product as of
today. And we're really very excited about it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks. A question on TAF. With the data coming up in the third quarter, I guess I wanted to
get your perspective on what you think is a clinically meaningful improvement on either the bone side or the renal side
when comparing a TAF versus a Viread regimen? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yeah, Thomas, we obviously thought a lot about this. And we – so if you
look at the totality of the tenofovir DF data, I think we can comfortably and confidently say that the BMD effects
overall are not clinically relevant. We can also say that with the exception of a few patients that discontinued, out of
that small degree of decreasing creatinine clearance, that's not that really clinically significant effect.
So I don't think we're going to see this in the Phase III study, Thomas. But I think what we will see, what we saw
already in the Phase II study, that there will be much less or no decrease in BMD; there will be much less or no
decrease in creatinine clearance.
But I think where the clinical relevance comes from is from the renal impairment study. We have a study now in about
290 patients, where we are testing the E/C/F/TAF regimen down to creatinine clearance of 30 milliliters per minute.
And that will be a really important point, if you could say there's no renal effects anymore laboratory-wise, there's no
BMD effects. Moreover, you don't have to dose or dose-interval-adjust down to creatinine clearance of 30 milliliters
per minute. And if the regulatory authorities accept this, you also don't have to do a regular creatinine checks.
So I think it would be a very safe, much more – physicians and patients would feel more comfortable with this regimen
than they would be – if we didn't have these laboratory abnormalities.
Operator
Thank you. And at this time, we have time for one last question. Our final question comes from Terence Flynn of
Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on that TAF one. Can you
quantify for us the percentage of patients with HIV that have renal impairment? And then also, maybe stratify by age
now, the HIV patient cohort that maybe would be at highest risk for having a fracture or low BMD given their age?
And then, the second part of the question is, I noticed during your remarks you said you're seeing a minimal impact
from generic Sustiva in Europe right now on market share. But what about pricing? Any impact there, either now or

maybe in the future? Thank you.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yeah, so, Terence, just quickly, I can't give you specific numbers. But
qualitatively, of course, you know that the HIV population in the U.S. and in other parts of the world is aging. With
increasing age, creatinine or renal function declines. And so, this will be just a more convenient and safer use of the
drug. If you have borderline creatinine clearance of 60 milliliters per minute or 50 milliliters per minute, you would not
have to worry about any adverse renal events to be happening with TAF; whereas tenofovir DF, as you know, has to be
dosed interval-adjusted when you come down to creatinine clearance of 50 milliliters per minute, or 70 milliliters per
minute in case of Stribild.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, and maybe I can comment on the pricing question of Sustiva in Europe. So the product
that's affected for us is Atripla, and we price Atripla on a one-plus-one basis. What we have seen is the branded price of
Sustiva has followed down, to some extent, the generic price of generic efavirenz. Nevertheless, the price of Atripla,
we've managed to keep above slightly that one-plus-one level, and that recognizes the value of the single-tablet
regimen.
And as I said also earlier, where patients are switching out of Atripla for CNS reasons associated with efavirenz, most
of the switches are coming to Gilead products, notably 70% in quarter two went to Eviplera.
