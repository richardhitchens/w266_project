Ian M. Cook
Good morning. This is Ian. I thought before John jumped into his customary division review, I'd just make a couple of
opening comments.
Suffice to say, as we said in the press release, this indeed was another challenging quarter, and as I think we all know,
the industry continues to face global market volatility and we have seen a further slowdown in consumer demand in
several key markets, most especially the U.S., Southeast Asia, and South Pacific. On the positive side, that pressure
was offset somewhat by strong organic growth in Latin America with a good balance between price and volume and a
return to positive organic sales growth at Hill's.
My purpose in making the introductory comments now is to give you a sense of where we are focused going forward.
And going forward, we are focused, focused intensely on returning our business to growth over the balance of the year
and improving bottom line performance. And our focus is heightened and will be heightened on four fundamentals.
The first is increased advertising spending behind more impactful creative. The second, innovation across our portfolio
of businesses, particularly for Personal Care and Oral Care in the growing Naturals segment, and especially naturals for
toothpaste, which has a particular target of local brands in some key geographies in Eurasia and Asia. Third, greater
investment behind our high growth e-commerce business. And fourth, aggressively maximizing productivity up and
down our income statement.
Those are the four fundamentals we are focusing on for the balance of the year, and I will be back later with more detail
on each and turn the call back now to John to go through the discussion of the quarter.
John?
John Faucher
Thanks, Ian.
As Ian said in the press release, the second quarter was another challenging one. Net sales were down 0.5% in the
quarter, with 1% pricing growth, offset by a 1% volume decline and slightly negative foreign exchange. Organic sales
growth was flat year over year in the second quarter, below our expectations. Our categories and markets remain
volatile, as the macroeconomic picture remains mixed. We have seen a further slowdown in demand in several markets,
including the United States, Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific.
Looking at the cadence of the quarter, after a weak April, we saw improvement in organic sales through the first half of
June. The back half of June was, however, negatively impacted by retailer destocking in some markets and a reduction
in shipments in India in advance of the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax.
As Ian mentioned in the press release, there were also several encouraging factors in the quarter as compared to a year
ago. We saw strong sales growth in Latin America, driven by a balance of volume and pricing, and we saw a return to
positive organic sales growth at Hill's following two weaker quarters.
We are also encouraged that on balance, foreign exchange headwinds have lessened over the past several quarters, and
raw material costs are increasing at a more modest rate. We believe consumer usage of our products has remained
broadly stable in the vast majority of markets, which would indicate that category takeaway should normalize going
forward.
While we have seen a small decline in purchase frequency in some markets, we are taking steps to adjust price points
where necessary to spur consumption and usage. While we are pleased with these bright spots, we are attacking the
headwinds with the focus you would expect from our company and a strong sense of urgency. Through pricing and

productivity, we achieved gross profit margin expansion in Q2, with 20 basis points of expansion on a GAAP basis and
50 basis points excluding the impact of our 2012 Restructuring Program.
On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was down 230 basis points year over year in Q2. Excluding the impact
of our 2012 Restructuring Program, our operating profit margin was down 10 basis points, as the improvement in gross
profit margin was more than offset by increased advertising investment, higher overhead expenses, and other
income/expense net.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share of $0.59 was down 12% year over year. Excluding the impact of our 2012
Restructuring Program and the net benefit from a previously disclosed foreign tax matter in the second quarter of 2016,
earnings per share was up 3%.
We returned almost $1.6 billion to shareholders year to date through share repurchases and dividends. This is a 16%
increase versus the first half of 2016.
Now moving to the divisions, we'll start off with North America. In Q2, we saw improvement versus Q1 in both net
sales growth and organic sales growth in North America, but not to the extent that we had expected. Net sales and
organic sales growth in the quarter were down 3.5%. Category growth rates in the U.S. slowed sequentially versus the
first quarter, dipping slightly negative, driven by a notable decline in April. May and June were better, particularly
May.
In the toothpaste category, we strengthened our leadership in the U.S., where our market share lead versus our largest
competitor increased again versus Q1 and now stands at more than one share point year to date. We continued to gain
share in the ultra-premium whitening segment, seeing benefits from our latest launches, Colgate Optic White Beauty
Radiant and Tom's of Maine Luminous White.
Outside of Oral Care, our Tom's franchise also continues to gain share in underarm protection, tapping into the
continued consumer interest in the natural space. Tom's has expanded its underarm protection line to now include men's
and children's variants as well.
Turning to our hand dish category, while we saw a sequential improvement in market share in the quarter versus Q1,
the business is not yet where it needs to be. Our restage of the business is progressing slower than anticipated, as it has
been impacted by both category weakness and heightened competitive activity. The rollout of the new SKUs is
complete, and we are adjusting our promotional strategy to compete more effectively on shelf.
Now, we'll look at Latin America. Latin America delivered 7% net sales growth and 8% operating profit growth.
Organic sales growth was also 7%, as foreign exchange was even with the year-ago period. Our strong gross profit
growth in the quarter funded a significant year-over-year increase in advertising investment.
We are encouraged that our volume performance improved across categories and geographies in the division. Our net
and organic sales growth of 7% was driven by a mix of volume, plus 2.5%, and pricing, plus 4.5%.
While Mexico volumes were down slightly against a difficult comparison, our toothpaste market share in Mexico is up
170 basis points year to date versus year-to-date 2016 to 82.1%, our highest share in six years. We saw sequential
improvement in our volume performance in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and many other markets across the division.
As I mentioned, we are encouraged by the volume growth in Brazil, but the market remains volatile. We are managing
our price points to ensure that we are competitive on shelf. Our toothpaste market share in Brazil remained at 72% in
the quarter, even with Q1.
Our Latin American business will benefit from several new product launches in Q3, including Colgate Triple Action
Extra Freshness toothpaste, Colgate Total mouthwash, and in Brazil, Protex Pro-Hidrata bar soap and body wash.
Moving to Europe, Europe net sales were down 3.5% in the quarter, with organic sales down 0.5% similar to Q1, and a
3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Our UK business continues to perform well with a mix of pricing and
volume growth, although this was offset by a significant negative foreign exchange impact, which should abate as we

cycle easier foreign exchange comparisons in the second half.
Encouragingly, we saw further improvement in our French business. Our oral care market shares are improving
sequentially as we regain distribution, and we would expect this trend to continue into the third and fourth quarters. Our
Personal Care business in France saw strong growth behind the Sanex Zero% relaunch. This relaunch features new
graphics and new product claims. The media investment for the Sanex Zero% relaunch includes both TV and digital
support that has tested well above advertising testing norms.
Looking forward, along with the Sanex relaunch, we expect to see benefits from the launch of Colgate Max White
Expert Complete toothpaste, Colgate Minions licensed battery-powered toothbrush, and the launch of Palmolive
Naturals with precious oils.
Next, Asia-Pacific, net sales in Asia-Pacific were down 5% in the quarter, and organic sales were down 3.5%. As
mentioned in the press release, organic sales for this region came in softer than expected, primarily due to the reduction
in shipments in India in advance of the new Goods and Services Tax, or GST, increased competitive activity in
Australia, and consumption declines in Thailand. Volume was down 2% in the quarter, driven by declines in India,
Australia, and Thailand, with Greater China down modestly.
Volume performance in India worsened sequentially in Q2 in advance of the implementation of the new Goods and
Services Tax, which took effect on July 1. Due to uncertainty about the new law, the trade in India was cautious, and
shipments basically ground to a halt for the last two weeks of June.
As I mentioned, our Greater China business posted a modest decline in volumes in Q2, which was a sequential
improvement from Q1. We are driving significant growth in e-commerce. And as a company, we increased our
industry-leading toothpaste market share in the quarter in this highly important channel.
In the Philippines, we continue to see solid volume growth performance and market share gains across our Oral Care
and Personal Care portfolios.
The Africa-Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 1% in Q2, driven by price increases and foreign exchange,
which more than offset weaker volumes. The volume weakness was driven primarily by the continued impact of our
distributor changes in our sub-Saharan African business. We showed sequential improvement in volume in our Russian
business in the quarter versus Q1, as we raised advertising spending and adjusted price points, given some of the recent
currency movements.
Benefits from pricing and savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives allowed us to significantly increase our
advertising investment in the division. We continued to invest in brand-building activities, both in terms of increased
television and digital advertising as well as programs to build per capita consumption to drive long-term changes in
consumer behavior.
Looking at the second half of the year, we expect the Africa-Eurasia division to benefit from the launch of Colgate
Ancient Secrets toothpaste in Russia. This premium price line uses locally gleaned insights to tap into the rapidly
growing premium-priced Natural segment in the country.
And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered flat net sales for the second quarter as organic sales growth of 0.5% was
offset by slightly negative foreign exchange. Volumes were down 1.5%, with pricing up 2%. We are encouraged by a
notable sequential improvement in volume trends in the United States versus Q1, driven by continued strength in our
e-commerce business and greater availability in the pet specialty channel. We made significant progress in regaining
distribution and promotional activity in the pet specialty channel in the quarter and we continue to expect improved
performance as we further align our strategic priorities with our top accounts in this channel.
Our e-commerce growth continues to outpace the category as our e-commerce business in the U.S. doubled year over
year in the second quarter. Also, our Prescription Diet business in the U.S. is growing nicely, driven by strength in the
vet channel. Hill's continues to benefit from the recent U.S. launch of Hill's Science Diet Youthful Vitality, which is
specially formulated for dogs aged seven years and older, to help fight the effects of aging. It's gaining share in the
aging dog segment, driven by a strong integrated marketing program that has driven 43 million impressions across all

platforms, including some of the most impactful digital advertising we have ever seen on the Hill's brand.
We continue to see significant opportunities to build the Hill's brand in emerging markets where the specialty pet food
category remains underdeveloped. Our emerging markets business volume growth in the quarter was led by Mexico,
Brazil, Russia, and South Africa.
Now, we'll turn to our outlook for 2017. As stated in our press release, we lowered our guidance to flat EPS on a
GAAP basis to down mid-single digits on a GAAP basis. The change in our GAAP EPS guidance is due to the
additional projects bringing our projected charges for the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to the higher end of
our previously disclosed guidance range.
On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance remains for low-single digit EPS growth. Based on current spot rates, we expect
net sales to be up low-single digits for the year with a slight negative impact from foreign exchange. However, given
the organic sales weakness in the first half of the year, we now expect organic sales growth will be in the low-single
digits versus our previous guidance of modestly below our historical long-term range of 4% to 7%. We still expect
solid gross margin expansion, but we are now planning for gross margin to be up in the low end to midpoint of our 75
to 125 basis points long-term guidance range versus at the high end previously. Lower topline growth and certain
higher raw material costs have impacted our year-to-date gross margin performance. We still expect gross margin
expansion to accelerate in the second half of the year, given less impact from raw material costs and greater benefits
from our funding-the-growth initiatives.
And now, I'll turn it back over to Ian.
Ian M. Cook
Thanks, John.
So let me come back to my introductory remarks and say that despite the recent category weaknesses we have seen, we
believe a heightened focus on the four fundamentals I mentioned, in essence, a focus on brand building and
productivity will allow us to reaccelerate our top and bottom line growth.
So let me talk a bit further about each of them in turn. The first was, you will remember, increased advertising spend
behind more impactful creative. So, we are, as you know from the beginning of this year, committed to more consistent
advertising investment sustained across the year, with an increase on both a dollar basis and as a percentage of sales.
The year-over-year increase in advertising investment is planned to accelerate in the second half as we lapped lower
levels of spending in the prior year. Obviously, part of this advertising will be digital, which is a growing percentage of
our working media spend, and when I talk about quality, we're talking about advertising that is tested to be motivating
and persuasive with consumers using testing norms. And what it sees is an increase in advertising behind what you
might call the equity of the brand, or the purpose of the brand advertising behind the base business sustained over time,
while we use incremental advertising to launch new products.
That's the most immediate investment effect. But one I wouldn't want to forget is our increasing investment in building
per capita consumption of toothpaste, which, of course, drives sustainable long-term growth, particularly for Latin
America, Asia, and Africa. Our Bright Smiles Bright Futures program is well on its way to reaching 1.3 billion children
and teach them how to brush their teeth by our target year of 2020. As you may recall, spending behind this program
generates returns that are three times our return on traditional advertising. And our analysis has shown that in our top
markets outside the United States, 70% of our addressable population brushes their teeth on average less than once a
day. The point being, there is significant upside over time in consumption in oral care and so we are investing
sustainably to generate that consumption over time. So, advertising for the near term and advertising for the longer
term.
Secondly, innovation. Innovation, of course, across our portfolio for the balance of the year and into 2018. But
innovation particularly in the Naturals space, which is a growing area of opportunity and further than that, specific

innovation in the Natural space for toothpaste, which is both an emerging segment and an effective counter, we believe,
against local brands in Asia and Eurasia.
Now, on the Naturals side, beyond oral care, John ready already spoke about progress with Tom's on UAP, and,
obviously, we've broadened that Tom's range now into other personal care categories like body cleansing and bar soap.
On toothpaste, we have launched the Colgate Naturals toothpaste line in several markets across three of our divisions
and the rollout of that bundle will continue over the balance of the year, particularly across Asia.
Our consumer innovation centers located in those geographies have allowed us to build bundles that are tailored to
meet local needs and preferences. In other words, a counter to the local brands we find in those geographies, and we're
encouraged by the initial results that we've seen. Now, on top of that, as I had mentioned previously, in terms of
regional brands, we continue to see benefit from underlying growth on brands like Elmex and Meridol in toothpaste in
Europe, Darlie in China, and Sanex in Europe. So that's the second, innovation across the portfolio, particularly focused
on Naturals and especially focused on Naturals for toothpaste.
The third is working with retailer partners for growth on our business and specifically greater investment behind the
high growth e-commerce space. So, given the changes that we're seeing in the retail landscape, we continue to
aggressively adapt our go-to-market execution to service the very different brick-and-mortar retailers growing in our
categories today, and, of course, e-commerce.
The focused nature of our portfolio and the industry-leading market shares that we have make us relevant to the
shoppers in those outlets and give us influence in our key categories. And we, of course, are working very closely with
our retail partners to help them drive traffic to their stores across all of the different segments of brick-and-mortar retail.
Very importantly, we continue to build our capabilities in e-commerce and this, I think, is reflected in our leadership in
toothpaste from an e-commerce point of view in our top markets, the United States, China, and the UK, and for Hill's,
as consumers increasingly move to online shopping, we have the ability to reach an entirely new group of consumers
and we make sure that our presence is structured to provide the information that pet owners need to make a smart
decision about which Hill's product is right for their pets. Interestingly, year to date, Colgate's worldwide e-commerce
business growth is up 65%. So, an area of aggressive focus for the back half of the year.
And finally, the fourth, aggressively maximizing productivity up and down the income statement. On the cost front, we
are, of course, focused on realizing both short and long-term productivity in order to drive sustainable margin
expansion. Funding the growth that you know well continues, we believe, to be a best in class productivity program
that we use to work down costs on all lines of the income statement.
In 2017, funding-the-growth is delivering significant savings in areas like ocean freight, direct and indirect
procurement, copacking, and fragrance and formula harmonization. We're also tackling long-term cost structure
through our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. We'll continue to see benefits from our hubbing activity and our
move to centralized Colgate business services and the back-office services that they indeed provide.
And we have said consistently over the last six to nine months that in this last year of our Global Growth and
Efficiency Program we are being particularly focused to capitalize on the opportunity it affords us, and so, in the
second quarter of this year, we initiated two additional projects as part of that program with the goal to better align our
cost structure to longer term trends. One addresses the structure of our European business and one addresses our
corporate infrastructure, both underway. And these additional projects take us to the upper end of our
previously-disclosed cost and savings ranges.
And we continue to say that we remain very focused on identifying as many additional projects in the last year of this
program. So, those are the four areas of heightened focus – increased advertising spending behind stronger creative
innovation across the portfolio, particularly in Naturals and especially in Naturals on toothpaste against local brands;
sharp focus with our retail partners; and particular emphasis on the high growth e-commerce marketplace; and
continuing to aggressively maximizing productivity up and down our income statement with two new programs, now
public in this quarter just closed.
So, those are our areas of focus for the back half of the year and now I'd be delighted to open the line to questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: So, I'm sure you guys are spending a lot of time analyzing the drivers behind the top-line
growth slowdown in the last few quarters. My question is, how much of the recent top-line growth variance in the last
few quarters versus your long-term forecast, how much of that do you think is due to the factors that may linger in
longer term? Like consumer brand fragmentation away from leading brands, that was sort of implied by your focus on
Natural, an increased competitive environment or any other longer-term factors versus more of the shorter-term factors
that you mentioned? And that's in both North America as well as emerging markets. And the background behind that is,
is your long-term 4% to 7% organic sales growth outlook still reasonable? Why should we have faith in that, given the
magnitude of disappointment the last few quarters, the fact that it's sustained over a few quarter period and has
surprised you guys?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, well, a lot in there, Dara. First, I think as we came into this year and we've had the two
quarters we have had, when we talked about the prior quarter, the first quarter, we clearly said we would be below that
range, and now we are saying, based on the first half performance, that our growth this year will be at low-single digits.
I would not offer comment at this stage on the 4% to 7% range. I think that's something that we would come back and
revisit once we gain more practical experience of how this year unfolds.
I will say there have been a lot of one-time, or at least volatile episodes in the last couple of quarters, particularly late in
the second quarter, which have been problematic. And it would be fair to say that the continuing slow consumer
demand is worrisome, but there's nothing that we see in the data that suggests that consumer behavior is changing in
any way. As John said, we have seen pockets of lengthened frequency of purchase, and we are addressing that both
strategically with advertising and innovation and also some price-point action on the shelf.
The competitive environment is variable. It can be volatile and it can be particularly sharp. And we saw that, for
example, in June here in the United States across many categories heightened competitive activity. So I think that's
going to be a variable and our belief, and I think the most important belief here, is that the consumer behavior will see
the categories come back.
The only thing we can practically do to address that in the short term is to drive our market shares, because then
whatever the category growth is, we will be getting the best return out of the category growth that exists. And in that
regard, I can say that our global year-to-date market shares are better or even with the first quarter shares on all of our
priority businesses, so we are beginning to see our market shares rise.
But I think before one takes a view on longer-term growth rates, one would want to see this year play out and get more
information on that consumer behavior, get some practical evidence that indeed the consumption patterns do return to
the norm. and then when we give guidance for 2018, that would be the time to have the conversation.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Great, thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Dara.

<A - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bonnie.
<A - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. I just had a few questions on the stepped-up innovation that you discussed. First, could
you give us a sense of the growth rates of the Natural toothpaste category versus non? And then how much
cannibalization are you anticipating of your existing business from some of this new innovation? I guess I assume this
is a premiumization opportunity, so to some extent, cannibalization could be welcomed.
And then finally, curious what you haven't innovated here earlier. Were you not sure of the growth of this emerging
category would necessarily be sustainable, but now you are? And I guess for me, it's sort of begging the question, are
there other emerging categories that are pressuring your existing business that you might need to move more
aggressively in?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, all good questions, Bonnie. Suffice to say that the Natural segment is growing faster than the
average growth of the category, which is what makes it attractive. We of course have participated in this segment for
quite a while, particularly in markets where it's important, Asia. I'll even go back to our now more than decade-ago
acquisition of Tom's of Maine here in the United States, which continues to grow very, very nicely.
I guess the point is that the offering we are talking about now is different from the Naturals offerings that we have had
thus far. That's much more tailored to brands that now exist that didn't exist when we had our Naturals portfolio first in
the marketplace, competitive with those brands, tailored from a flavor point of view, and to the point you made, at a
meaningful premium price compared to prior offerings in the marketplace. So it's more of the tailoring of it than the
existence of it because segments obviously morph over time. So I don't think it's a question of missed. I think it's a
question of tailoring the product to the category as it evolves over time.
And the question of cannibalization is a very difficult one to answer in the general. It varies market by market.
Premiumization tends to reduce the cannibalization, obviously, with lower businesses. And we will, of course, be
supporting our base business when we come with this premium innovation. So we'll be working very hard to keep the
cannibalization to a minimum. But regardless, to the point you made, from a cannibalization point of view, this will be
accretive from a pricing point of view, and therefore favorable.

We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, good morning, a couple things. First, just to clarify, when you said your global
e-commerce business was up 65% in the quarter, can you break out roughly how much of that was Hill's versus for the
core? And then just remind us off what base that is. Is global e-commerce still like 2% of your sales, or is that number
out of date?
And then secondly, just higher level, you talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about maybe taking some, I think,
strategic pricing down a little bit in a couple of countries or categories. And I wanted to go back to something that I had
heard Noel [Wallace] talk about recently, which was a little bit more focus on raising prices and revenue management
and maybe that Colgate's price points are below where the company would like them to be from a longer-term strategic
perspective. So I get that you're doing things that are right now tactical and strategic to recover some share. But how
important is this concept of revenue management? How much of it factors into your thinking of your growth algorithm
going forward, et cetera, et cetera? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Wendy. The e-commerce growth of 65% is indeed for Colgate in totality. In other words,
it is the Hill's business and it is all of the Colgate businesses. And frankly, we don't intend to break out the difference
between the two, nor do we intend to break out the percentage of our business that is e-commerce. Suffice to say, it is
still relatively modest, but very, very high growth. And once it reaches a tipping point, we'll certainly bring that
information to the marketplace.

The pricing reaction is actually not mutually exclusive. When we talk about price point adjustment at retail, it is to be
competitive on purchase cycles. And while it applies to all of our categories in promotional pricing, it is less focused on
oral care, which of course is what Noel was talking about. So they're selective, they're surgical, and they're less focused
on oral care, point number one.
Point number two, from an oral care point of view, just the prior discussion on the Naturals offering, we're also
bringing innovation that is materially higher priced to that business. And as Noel may have described, in some cases, as
we have relaunched literally tiers of our business, T-I-E-R-S of our business in different parts of the world, behind that
relaunch, we found a way of elevating the value the consumer gets and the pricing of the line to increase the average
price of our entire portfolio. So I guess that's the way to answer it.
And yes, revenue management is extremely important. The topic that Noel talked about remains highly relevant, and
what John was talking about was surgical activity less applicable to oral care on promotional pricing, not strategic
pricing.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And if you just put those two concepts together – I know you said consumer behavior
vis-à-vis the oral care category isn't really changing, but clearly consumer behavior with regard to e-commerce is
changing a lot. So if you say e-commerce plus pricing, in your analysis so far, if I'm buying toothpaste on Amazon as
opposed to in Walgreens, does this consumer tend to be more price sensitive, more brand loyal? That's just a high-level
question. You guys do such a great job of analyzing the business, I'm wondering if you have any kind of high-level
takeaways about how to make sure that your shares are as strong online as they are in bricks-and-mortar. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Interestingly, Wendy, it kind of works the other way. What we observe on e-commerce thus far is
that the consumer is actually tends to buy more premium, and even if they're not buying the premium brands, they tend
to buy in multiples. So in fact, the e-commerce behavior is favorable to us from a consumption point of view. And if
you look at the Hill's business, 50% of the Hill's business in the U.S. on e-commerce is subscription. So that means
once they buy it one time, they're signing up to regular delivery of that diet over time, which is, we believe, a good
business model for our brand.

We'll go next to Jason English, Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Thanks. This is actually Usha on behalf of Jason. Thanks for the question. Gross margin
improvement has been impressive, in spite of a softer top-line growth. But guidance for the full-year was brought down
slightly, in spite of a good run rate for savings. Now, is this mainly due to the higher expected reinvestments you plan
to make in the second half? And would those continue into 2018?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks for the question. Usha, is your name? The gross profit, as John said in his remarks, was
behind our expectations for the first half of this year, largely because of raw material cost increases, which, in fact, was
primarily in the area of fats and oils. Interestingly, the cost of fats and oils has ebbed since the first half of this year, so
as John also said, we're now moving into a more favorable raw material cost environment and, of course, for this year
thus far, and it gets easier against our projections. Over the balance of the year there has been less transaction headwind
because foreign exchange has not been so negative as it had been in previous years. So we are looking at what we
believe will be a multiple benefit of material costs easing and transaction costs lessening. And, as John also said, we,
therefore, expect to see a sequential improvement in gross margin as the year unfolds. So I think that's the answer to the
question.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hello, Steve.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Hello. Ian, a question to follow-up on your advertising comment, if I could. Historically, if
we go back, your advertising was spread out pretty even quarter to quarter as a percentage of sales. But over the last
several years we've seen really a 200 basis point gap open up between first half spending and second half spending.
And I know that directionally you intend to close that, just based on your comments. But, to say you can get back to
10% of sales in the back half, which would still be 50 basis points light of what I think you spent so far this year, that
would imply 160 basis points of incremental spending in the back half and skewed to Q4, if my math is correct. I'd just
love to get your sense if that's the right order of magnitude to be considering.
And then if so what kind of ROI do you expect that's going to have and will it contribute to the second half top-line
improvement that you're expecting? Or should we not expect the list to really show through until fiscal 2018? Perhaps
that answer lies in how much spending goes to new launches versus the things like Bright Smiles Bright Futures? But
just some context to how you're thinking about both the magnitude of increased spending and then the expected ROI
and when you see it flowing through. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good question and I'm glad you got the scale thing on the table. You're right. For the last couple
of years, and I think we were quite express about this when we talked about 2017. Faced with sharp foreign exchange,
negative impacts, and with having no immediate term place to go, we reduced advertising. And we said, coming into
this year, we did not want to do that.
But even if foreign exchange were going to run sharply negative, for whatever global calamity reason, that we would
not pull back on our advertising investment. And our intention at the time we said that, and it remains our intention and
our plan is to continue our advertising investment in the second half at approximately the same level, in other words,
sustained advertising that we have seen so far across the first half. And, yes, that will suggest a fairly meaningful
step-up in advertising investment.
We think the ROI will be good. This is now talking to the traditional advertising because, as I said earlier, we have a lot
of advertising vehicles now developed that have tested extremely well. So we know the advertising works very, very
hard and is persuasive to consumers. And interestingly, it is good to have this balance between announcing what's new
and, shall we say, supporting and reminding of the reason consumers give trust to the brand in the first place. And so
continuous advertising behind, as we call it, the base, is an important part of that decision.
And you're right, obviously, the Bright Smiles Bright Futures investment is not a short-term investment, but as again I
tried to spell out, we know the ROI on that is terrific. We know we get good ROI on our media, in general, and
therefore we are very comfortable with the investment decision. And, of course, it is our expectation that this will be
part of the reason to return us to growth as we work our way across the year. And, again, Bright Smiles Bright Future,
we hope, will be part of the reason why we will be able to sustain that growth in the toothpaste category out over time.

We'll go next to Jason Gere, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess, obviously what we're hearing is the first half of the
year pricing helped offset, I guess, the weaker volumes. In the second half it sounds like volumes will probably offset
price to get to that low-single digit. So I'm just wondering if you can just lay maybe a little bit more some of the
macro-micro impacts that you saw in the first half, how that placed you in the second half. So on the micro side, talk
about some of the distributor changes in Eurasia, the U.S. liquid. I think in Europe there were some packaging changes.
So those things that were within your control, and I was just wondering how that plays out in the second half. And then
the macro side, I think you were talking – besides India and how that kind of plays out in the second half. I think you
said that there was some destocking in the second half of June, where that is and maybe a little bit more color as to how
we can think about that going forward. Thanks.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good question, Jason. Let me try and take it on. The U.S. dish reset, which I think we have well
covered, we now have the products fully in distribution. They're on the shelf where we want them on the shelf. We
were hit in June, as we've said, by heightened competitive activity, very heightened, and we are responding to adjust
our promotional planning and offerings to jump start progress across the back half of the year. So yes, in our control
and I think a plan in place to rebuild growth.
On the decisions that affected customers, I guess I would focus on the three you raised. You have our decision to move
broadly to e-commerce in the United States with our pet nutrition business, which we continue to believe is absolutely
the right decision. And we're an equal opportunity believer in that space. In other words, we are just as happy to lean in
aggressively with a retailer who has a brick-and-mortar offering and an e-commerce offering as we are with a pure play
e-commerce company.
We had a hiccup, shall we say, with a customer in the U.S. That hiccup is now substantially behind us and a return to
normal promotional and other consumer engagement activity is recommencing, and we'll, of course, build across the
balance of the year. The European retailer matter I think John covered well. We are seeing our market shares rebound
quite nicely and growing sustainably and sequentially and we expect to see that continue across the back half of the
year.
In Africa-Eurasia we made those distributor choices that we again believe are the right choices for the business over the
long term. And we will continue to lap those comparisons until the fourth quarter of this year. So the third quarter will
still be burdened by a difficult comparison. And then, of course, the reality is that even though each of them, we
believe, was the right decision, they had a compounded effect all at the same time, which was problematic, but I think
faced with the requirement to make the decisions again, we've made the same decisions.
The GST, we were just digging out of the demonetization headwind and then, boom, you get the GST, which basically
saw the stockists close up shop the last two weeks in June. And we're hopeful, barring another event, that we will see
that rebuild across the back half of the year. So I think on balance those issues I think we have identified them before
and I think we are in the process of building them.
The macroenvironment looking forward, you know, it really comes down to the categories. We think the behavior will
come back, but we're focused on building our market shares so that whatever the category growth rate is, we're getting,
frankly, more than our fair share of that underlying growth. So that's the way we're thinking about that while we get
more consumer data in terms of behavior as we work our way through the balance of the year.

We'll go to Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Faiza Alwy>: Yes, hi. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi.
<Q - Faiza Alwy>: Ian, I just had a broader strategic question because I think if you look at some of the per capita
consumption trends it seems like the opportunity is really in some of these frontier markets like in Africa and India,
which can be pretty volatile on from a macro point of view and maybe geopolitical point of view. So are you thinking
about extending – using your distribution network globally and extending it into other categories? So maybe skin care?
You have a great brand in Sanex, maybe taking that global or another brand, sort of just extending your overall reach
into just these global markets where you have a great set-up?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, I think that's a very relevant and pertinent point. And yes, of course, it is within our strategic
remit. It's not, and I know you know this, but it's not as simple as simply taking a product and putting it through a
proven distribution system. When you bring products that people may or may not be familiar with in their entirety, i.e.,
from a usage point at all, or certainly from a brand point of view, it requires a considerable degree of investment and
patience over multiple years to build a position in the marketplace. But the answer is yes, it is clearly one of the assets

We'll go next to Kevin Grundy, Jefferies.
<Q - Kevin Grundy>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin Grundy>: First question, Ian, if you wouldn't mind just a housekeeping one. In the past, you've been kind
enough to supply category growth rates by region, U.S., Europe, and EM. So can we get an update there? I think
probably, in aggregate, category growth rates have probably come in about 1 point since 3Q, but an update there would
be helpful.
And the second question more broadly, Ian, would be around M&A. And you talked a lot about areas of focus for the
balance of the year, which we've well covered in this call, so I appreciate that. That's very clear. But the question is, I
guess, given this sharp deceleration which we haven't seen in your portfolio in a long, long time, does this give you any
cause with respect to M&A, which has not been a big part of the company's portfolio strategy. You've had some nice
tuck-in deals, of course, with Sanex and Hill's, but said differently, in this lower growth environment, does this increase
your appetite for M&A? And if so would you consider pursuing any businesses outside the current portfolio? Thank
you,
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, the – well, category growth, frankly, it's reasonably straightforward. Certainly, for the last
quarter the emerging markets are still mid-single digits. In some countries, we have much more of a presence now in
e-commerce. China would be the obvious example. And in the developed world, what we have seen is Europe and a
United States or a North America essentially flat. I mean, that's the way the world splits today.
M&A, do we have appetite? We've always had appetite. We're just, I would say, very strategic in our appetites. And
when we look at M&A, we look at it from the point of view of strengthening the portfolio of the company, not meeting
a sales requirement. And certainly not jumping into a new business that we don't know too much about, and mustard
would have been a very expensive one to get into, for example.
So I think you could see us buy on the fringes of the businesses we're in. We have with Sanex, for example, lotions and
creams that we are now expanding in Europe. But if we were to play in M&A, and we are very keen on expanding our
portfolio with the right asset, I think you would see it in the broader definitions of the categories we're already in, in
oral care, in pet nutrition, and in personal care, and that's the way we think about it. We're not going to do anything in
an undisciplined way just for a tactical response. We remain keen.

And we'll go next to Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan.
<Q - Andrea F. Teixeira>: Thank you. Hello all, good morning. So can you elaborate more on your comment on the
cadence of the quarter in North America and Asia? It seems like June got worse from May. And then the destocking
was not only in the U.S. and China, which obviously you mentioned in the last call, as well as India, but I was just
hoping to see if there are any other areas where you can recover from where we were in the first half. And if you can
comment if orders are starting to come in faster now that we're probably six to eight months behind us in terms of – the
high notes in terms of the destocking both in the pantry and the retail destocking?
And related to that, in terms of the funding of your funding-for-growth, you elaborated a lot on the sales perspective.
But is there anything that we can think of the SG&A? I know you had invested a lot more in overhead over the past few
months globally. But if you can, elaborate if there is any other source of potential savings on that front that could allow
you to continue to invest and foster further growth. Thank you.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay, Andrea. Let me start with the global growth and efficiency program and the SG&A idea.
You're right, we remain extremely focused on maximizing our opportunity in this final year of that program, and I think
that is reflected in the two actions that we talk about in the second quarter, one of which reflected in the costs in our
filing. Both of them are directly and meaningfully in the SG&A space. They will play out over time in terms of
realizing the benefit, but they will afford a benefit. And we continue to focus on finding other areas that we could do
like without in any way damaging the firepower we need to be successful on the ground. So yes, it's a very clear area of
focus, and I think it's evidenced in the actions that we took.
It's very difficult to come back to this cadence on the quarter. Again, as John said, in the U.S., actually the second
quarter in aggregate was worse than the first quarter overall, with a combination of a weak April and then a June that
faded. In terms of destocking, we have seen that on a volatile basis.
I guess the only thing I can repeat is that we are seeing, on a year-to-date basis, our global market shares in our priority
categories better or flat with the first quarter, which gives us a sense that our underlying consumption-driven growth is
improving. And we look forward, with the four areas of focus I mentioned, to capitalizing on that fully as we work our
way through the back half of the year.
Operator
We'll go next to Olivia Tong, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Great, thanks. I guess, Ian, perhaps can we talk a little bit about just the aggregate impact of some
of these one-offs, like the dish in the U.S., France, GST, et cetera? I'm trying to understand what you think your
underlying growth would be if not for all these things because it's still probably not at the low end of your long-term
range. And then also, given these one-offs and recognizing the comp differential in Q3 versus Q4 in the second half, I
was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there.
And then, just on Naturals, we talked a lot about specifics for Naturals in oral care, and that was very helpful, but one
category where Naturals has also been taking disproportionate share is pet food. And we've talked about that in the
past, but just wondering. Can you talk about how you think about that category and the growth potential there and your
interest in expanding in Naturals and pet as well? Thanks so much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, taking it in reverse order, in pet, we think about it more in terms of the formulation of our
products. We are unabashedly a brand that provides proven clinical benefits to pets, whether it's preventative or
whether it's curative, with our prescription diet business. And certainly, on the preventative health line, we have
reformulated our products to put proteins first and not give people a reason to switch out of our business and, if they
value a particular clinical benefit, to not have a barrier to then trying the Hill's product.
And we think that has been quite successful and conceptually moving into a very, very almost Tom's-like Naturals is
difficult to do. We have tried a couple of times with Hill's, and the heritage of the brand doesn't give you the bandwidth
to go pure on Naturals. So we've done it by formulation to eliminate barriers.
I don't think at this stage given the compounding effect of the slowdown in our markets, trying to do the math on what
is the one-off and how does it relate to the underlying category growth is going to be particularly helpful because the
expectation is that the category growth will come back. So the reason – the way we're thinking about it is to say over
the year, we expect this year now to be low single digits from an organic sales point of view. And we continue to be
very focused on the consumer and the consumer behavior. We've taken some actions that John mentioned to try and
capture the frequency of purchase in some of our businesses. And as we learn more, we'll be able to respond more
authoritatively. Is the behavior coming back or is there something else driving what we see in the categories, and we
think it would be premature and probably misleading to get into that at this stage?

We'll go next to Ali Dibadj, Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys. So I have two questions. One question is when you talk about those initiatives, Ian, that
you laid out so eloquently around Naturals, local competitors, e-commerce, more ad spend, better productivity or lower
SG&A, these are all things you've heard many of us collectively push for and push you on in the past on these
conference calls, I guess for a while. I remember three years ago about e-commerce certainly local competitors, and all
of us were asking these questions. Ad spend has been an ongoing discussion. And now you're saying look, we've got to
do something about these things. So I guess my first question is I'm just wondering why it took so long to react, what
was turning point? And now it just feels you're behind. So I guess why it took so long?
And the second question, I'll let you decide if it's related or not, I guess. But there's a lot of buzz out there right now, a
lot of discussion, and I think your stock performance today, given the numbers would suggest it. There's lot of
discussion in the investor community that the numbers today are so bad, the numbers last quarter are so bad, that
they're actually good for shareholders. And activists will come in, an acquirer will come in and get involved. What do
you think about that view? Certainly, helped your stock out recently, but what do you think about that view? And how
hard will you work to specifically prevent a bid or an activist in that context? So thanks for those two hopefully focus
questions.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I guess on the first question, I'm not sure I completely agree. I think it's fair, the criticism on the
advertising spend and the lack of consistency of advertising. But that we addressed coming into this year's budget. And
I'm just reaffirming that it is playing out the way we expected it to play out.
On e-commerce, we have been very focused on e-commerce for a long time. We may not have talked about it as
eloquently as you find I did this morning. But we have been focused on it. And I think that's why we have the
toothpaste leadership positions in the markets that we talk about. And the growth rate and subscription levels on the
Hill's business that we talk about even if we took the pain of making those decisions in the marketplace, which we're
now after almost nine months nearly a year just working our way out of.
Naturals, again, we had been talking about the Naturals for a while. Yes, it's only coming to marketplace right now. But
when the local brands idea came up, we were saying that that is our response. You can try this on the speed of getting it
to marketplace and I won't fight that, but in terms of the idea, and that that was accounted to the local brands, we feel
good about the offering that we're on.
And on the efficiency, I'm not sure you were implying any critique of the productivity. And I think the action that we
have taken in this quarter that we have mentioned was evidence of our focus in that area. So when we think about going
forward, buzz is one thing and there seems to be increasing buzz in this world about virtually everything, which can
become an enormous distraction. So the only thing I can say and I won't repeat the remarks I made at Bernstein, but I
will say, we are focused on the areas that I have mentioned. We think these are the right areas to focus on to see a
recovery in sales momentum across the back half of the year. We are focused on the SG&A line in our income
statement to get us more productive from a reasonably advantaged base going forward. So we have no blinders in terms
of a need to focus on our cost structure.
And we will continue to do that. And if we have more to say in that space, we will say that in a way that we think is
consistent with driving growth sustainably over time. And with or without buzz, we are steadfastly focused on that. So
I'm sorry I can't sound more energetic. It seems to fail me. But I think you can rest assured – well, you don't have to rest
assured – I guess I'm saying that we very much are focused on growth and on cost structure.

Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Hey, and just thank you for your comments earlier about the focus on innovation to address
the local brands particularly in Asia and Eurasia. I know it's other places, but you called out that specifically. And I'm
trying to understand maybe why is it now versus any of the times in the past 10 or 20 years where you've had really

nice businesses in these places that local brands are gaining traction? And does it have to do with a change that is
relevant to other markets? Is it technology driven? And specifically, does it have anything at all to do with – I know
some markets in Asia, e-commerce has developed somewhat rapidly. Does the pressure that puts on retailers and retail
distribution have anything to do with the increased traction some of these local brand forms are having with
consumers? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I don't think it's driven by e-commerce. I think it's driven by shall we say business entrepreneurs
who are local. I think pleasingly for us, it's driven by ideas that tend to be premium, which are ideas we're happy to
compete with rather than perhaps in the early years ideas that were more pricing driven. In some cases, it's driven by
affinity. So the Yunnan Baiyao brand in China was already a well-established wound healing brand in the country. You
take it into the toothpaste category and say, you stop bleeding gums, well-known brand in the toothpaste category, and
they didn't do much advertising in the early years and the business started to grow. Patanjali in India takes a very
nationalist view of this business.
So these are concepts in the local market. They tend to be premium price oriented and it means that you have to
respond with a very specifically-constructed offering that attacks the benefit the consumer's looking for, hence the
Naturals reaction. So I think it's more a function of entrepreneurs, concepts, affinity with the local market, which is
why we have innovation centers and technology centers in China to be close to the consumer on the ground in that
country. And in the end, the winner over time in these clashes are going to be the companies that best understand the
consumer. And serve them offerings that they want over time and of course that's what we are resourced and focused
on doing.

We'll go next to Iain Simpson, SG.
<Q - Iain E. Simpson>: Thanks very much. Hello everyone. Couple of questions if I may. Firstly, just drilling down
into advertising, into the big picture stuff I guess. Your volumes are down 1.5% in the first half and that really does
seem to imply some fairly significant global share loss. Yet you're advertising is only up 10 bps year on year and you're
talking about marketing being at that sort of level in the second half as well. Is that enough? I mean, up until 2014, your
advertising was 10.5%, 11% of sales pretty much every year. In recent years it's been more like 9%, 9.5%, and we've
seen your topline slow pretty meaningfully. So structurally, where do you think advertising needs to get to medium
term?
And secondly, visibility on FX is pretty limited, but if you do get a big transactional FX tailwind, be it in second half
2017 or in 2018, what will you do with that? How much will you let through to the bottom line? Or will you reinvest it?
What are the sort of key factors you'll look at were you to be in a position to make that decision? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Let me start by saying you start with a great name, so that's a good place to start. Our point on
advertising was not to do with the advertising in the first half. Our point on advertising and the numbers you refer to in
the recent historical past was to do with adjustments downward that we made in advertising in response to
unfortunately foreign exchange very sharply going the other way that your second question was suggesting. And when
we came into this year, what we said was that isn't what we were going to do.
Advertising north of 10% is a good level of advertising. And so what we said coming into this year is that we wanted to
sustain our advertising across the full year, which means the comparison over the last couple of years is driven by a
lower second half in those prior years and what will be a sustained level over the back half of the year which means the
advertising will be meaningfully up versus the prior year. So it's sustainability rather than a lack of in terms of
investment.
And hey, foreign exchange, you look at the last 5 years, I think the pundits have been wrong coming into basically
every single year. And if foreign exchange does turn positive, we will have a quick round of applause and then we will
bring it back to the business.

Our general historical rule of thumb has been to reinvest some and to bring some to the bottom line. What we would
actually do this time around would be a subject of internal debate, but that rule of thumb has been our historical action.

We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Good morning. Okay, first is I have to ask for the gross margin bridge or else we
won't have it. That's one. And secondly, I just – maybe let's talk about Latin America for a second where things turn
very much for the better. And I think about probably nine months ago now I got to spent some time with Panos, and he
talked about sort of a broader innovation pipeline in Latin America where you were going to be bringing more news to
lower price tiers in your portfolio, so giving the consumer more room for kind of trade-up at a lower level. And I was
just wondering the degree to which has some of that news flow started to hit the market because it was a pretty
significant change in that volume, really dollar weighted volume metric. So if you can talk a little bit about what's
starting to work in Brazil, particularly Brazil we've started this term? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The gross profit roll-forward, so prior year gross profit was 60.2% as you know. We picked up 40
bps from pricing between the restructuring, which is de minimis and funding the growth a positive 170 bps. Material
negative 180 bps which was primarily the fats and oils as I said. All other 20 bps, and that takes you to the 60.7%
which is up 50 basis points year on year. So that's the gross margin roll forward.
I would say in Latin America it is a focus on the fundamentals. It is innovation. I wouldn't go so far as to say the lower
end innovation is making the difference. And I would say markets like Brazil I'm afraid remain variable. So we're very
pleased with that bounce back, but we'll be watching very closely in terms of sustainability through the third quarter.
But the fundamentals are the same fundamentals for Latin America across the back half of the year.
Ian M. Cook
Okay. I understand that is the last call. So thank you for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again in
October.
